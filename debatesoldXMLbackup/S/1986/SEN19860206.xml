      <P>I have notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The proposed closure by the Minister for Health of the St. Patrick's Psychiatric Hospital, Castlerea, Co. Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jack Fitzsimons of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to ensure that in the reconstruction housing grant scheme, in bona fide situations, nothing in the scheme will preclude applicants from carrying out the works, or parts of the works themselves, without the services of full services of a building contractor.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Ellis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The delay by the Department of Health in the provision of an extension to the Manorhamilton Hospital.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Patrick Durcan of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to indicate his plans for the introduction of a full and proper system of <Col N="302" /> integrated nursing in the psychiatric nursing service.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters as suitable for discussion on the adjournment.  I have selected Senator Connor's motion for today's adjournment and it will be taken from 4.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators Fitzsimons, Ellis and Durcan may give notice for another day of the matter they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I think it is a pity that on the debate on the Adjournment today we will have only half an hour to discuss the closure of hospitals which was announced. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the Government Whips would not agree to allow a full debate on this matter I must express disappointment with the Whip on the other side of the House that we could not arrange a full debate for today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify something for Senator Lanigan.  Last night I met with Senator Willie Ryan and the view of our group was that we were as anxious as the other groups were to have such a debate, but we felt it would be futile to have such a debate unless the Minister was present for the debate.  Unfortunately, it was not possible at such short notice to ensure that he would be here.  In those circumstances we were reluctantly compelled to forego having a debate today.  We did agree that, if the Opposition wished to put down the motion, we would do as much as we could to see that it was debated at an early date.</P>

      <P>Would the Government side be prepared to allow a debate on the closure of the College of Education in Carysfort, which was announced the day before yesterday by the Minister.  I believe that this announcement was a calculated insult to the generations of teachers who have graduated from Carysfort College.  The fact that it was announced in the week in which the Government were bringing a motion before the other House to alter an arbitration award to the teaching profession added to that insult.  I ask that the Government would allow time next week to debate the closure of Carysfort College.</P>

    <Title>Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries shall be empowered to take evidence in public and to include with any report which it may make minutes of such evidence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This measure is designed to broaden the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries.  Since its inception this committee, of which I am a member has done very useful work in highlighting the great international tragedy of world hunger and poverty, and Ireland's role in the field of development aid.  A very important part of the committee's work has been the taking of submissions from the myriad of individuals and bodies who work both directly and indirectly in the whole area of development aid and who work in developing countries and in the whole area of development co-operation, whether it be abroad or here at home. These people are working often in the very poor countries of the world or countries that we would describe as totally impoverished.  We are prohibited under the present terms of reference from making public the vast <i>corpus</i> of submissions that we have taken from these various people which I have mentioned. This has been a restriction on our work, because we see it as a very important part of our role to highlight the work of the committee and to highlight it by publishing the direct evidence of people who have been on the ground and who are intimately involved in that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> I am recommending to the House that we pass this measure.  I might also mention that the Minister of State, who I am glad to see here with us this morning, has commended the work of the committee very highly.  He has indicated that he intends to incorporate many of the recommendations of the committee to date in furture legislation in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would go along totally with the extension of the rules to allow evidence to be taken in public. There has been a feeling abroad that the right use has not been made of aid from countries such as Ireland to the developing countries.  The aid which has been given has been given to the wrong areas and for the wrong reasons.  It is about time the Joint Committee were able to take evidence in public and that this evidence would be given to the newspapers or given to anybody looking for it.  We have heard from people in the Third World too often that their wishes and their desires in regard to aid from outside are not taken into account.  Too often the aid that is given is given by the donor country for its own reasons &mdash; some of which are not in any way meant to help the country which is receiving the aid but rather to extend the area of influence of the donor country.</P>
      <P>As Senator Connor has said, the work of the Joint Committee has been excellent. The amount of time they have spent in trying to work out a cohesive policy on co-operation with developing countries has been enormous.  Again, I wish to concur with the remarks that the Senator has made regarding the work of the committee and to say that we on this side of the House would welcome the extension of the powers of the committee to take evidence and that the evidence should be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to add a brief word of welcome to this extension of the powers of the committee.  It is extremely important that stitched into the record of public affairs in this country would be the views of people who are experienced in matters of development <Col N="306" /> co-operation.  It is valuable and important in our national debate on these matters to have a written record made before a parliamentary committee of the views of such people.  I had the pleasure of work ing on the all-party Committee on Marital Breakdown.  Part of that work involved the taking of evidence from experienced individuals and groups in the field of marital breakdown.  When the committee were coming to conclusions on decisions it was extremely valuable to have that body of information to refer to and to lean on when making decisions.  I would very much support this extension of the powers of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries. There is an increasing and growing public awareness of this whole area.  Anything that will enhance and develop that is to be welcomed.  I certainly feel that his motion today has that merit accordingly, I am happy to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am very pleased to see this extension of powers to the Joint Committee.  I believe that the Joint Committee serve a very useful purpose. Up to now they have been hindered to some extent by the demands of their terms of reference.  I would hope that the Minister, and the Minister for Finance, would perhaps be a little bit more liberal in facilitating the Joint Committee to oversee the way the Irish taxpayers' money is spent on specific projects in selected Third World countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year a number of members of that committee had the opportunity for the first time of visiting some of our projects. The amount of finance being made available by the Irish taxpayers through the development aid programme is now very considerable.  It is important that the members of the Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas should be familiar to the extent of seeing for themselves the work and the projects that our funds are promoting and facilitating.  It is not possible to get to terms with the programme unless our colleagues on the Joint Committee can see the work for themselves, can evaluate it and perhaps suggest amendments or changes in the <Col N="307" /> actual organisation of the programme itself.</P>
    <P>In the four or five countries which we specifically support in this way the different projects vary greatly.  It is important that the Members of the House should be up to date on that.  Last month we saw where there were some political difficulties in Lesotho.  That country gets the greater proportion of our aid.  I would hope that in this coming year it would be possible for the Department to expend a higher proportion on Governmental aid through co-operatives, through either religious or lay volunteers working in the fields themselves.  In that way valuable projects, especially in the co-operative line, can be directly, efficiently and effectively aided.  I would ask that the Government would consider allocating a higher proportion of the funds in this way.</P>
    <P>I welcome this extension of powers to the Joint Committee.  I wish them well in their work.  It is very important.  There is a great awareness of the problems that developing countries contend with at the present time.  We would need to keep abreast of the developments.  While this does not effectively come within the scope of this debate, I see that one of the Church charitable organisations has gone into the political business by renting huge hoardings on the roadways, thus more or less asking for political changes in some of the developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I came here in relation to the next motion but I would make a few comments if I thought it was useful to do so.  However, I am entirely in the Cathaoirleach's hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am here, I will take the opportunity of commenting on the excellent work being done by this Joint Committee. When I was first appointed Minister of State with special responsibility in this area I felt that it was important that Members of both Houses should be more involved in discussing aspects of our relations with developing countries.  It is for that reason I made the proposals that this <Col N="308" /> Joint Committee should be set up.  I am pleased that so far it has proved its worth. The committee has produced excellent reports and, as mentioned by Senator Connor, a number of recommendations are already forming part of the policies which I am now implementing.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of visits by Members overseas, I can say quite categorically that I am not in favour of junkets, but I do not classify the first-hand experience that can be gained by seeing conditions in developing countries and examining programmes as in any way a junket.  In fact, I came back from Africa only yesterday.  I can assure the House that I would not suggest that anyone would undertake the type of schedule that one does in visiting aid programmes as a holiday outing.  At the same time, the point made by Senator McDonald is quite correct.  I believe that Members of the Oireachtas would gain a broader insight into the problems of developing countries and would be in a better position to have greater expertise in suggesting solutions or amendments to existing policies if they had an opportunity of seeing the conditions and programmes at first hand.  I am very glad that one group visited two countries last year and duly reported in great detail on their visit.  I found the report quite useful.  I am hoping that over the period of this term of the Dáil at least one further visit can be arranged, if not two, so that all the members of the committee would have some experience of the situation in developing countries.</P>
    <P>Going back to the motion, it is quite clear at this stage that the recommendation made to me by the Joint Committee on the question of taking evidence in public is very valid.  Having examined it I have no hestiation whatsoever in recommending that it be implemented.  This motion has been approved by the other House.  I am very glad that the views expressed by both sides of the House indicate that this House is also in favour of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I would like to thank everyone who has spoken, <Col N="309" /> especially the Opposition for their total co-operation in this area.  As I stated at the outset, this is an important committee. Maybe it is not as well known as it should be, but its fame is continuing to grow nationally.  This in no small measure has been due to the very good work of our capable chairman, Deputy Nora Owen, and indeed all the other members who attend regularly.</P>
      <P>This motion which has now been passed by the Oireachtas in both Houses gives us the right to examine witnesses in public and to publish the evidence.  At the moment we are examining that awful problem of apartheid in South Africa. This is just one area of our work.  Last year our report dealt with the whole area of Ireland's development aid, whether direct assistance or indirect assistance by the various agencies in various countries, and as I said we were somewhat restricted. We had a vast <i>corpus</i> of submissions from various people which we were very often restricted in publishing, but the passage of this motion removes that particular restriction.  I thank the House for their co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of Report No. 16 of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities: nine Statutory Instruments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe) Jim O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 16th Report of the Fourth Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation, which is the subject of the motion down for discussion today, deals with nine statutory instruments made in implementation of Community legislation in Ireland which were selected by the Joint Committee for examination.  Senators will be aware that the statutory instruments in <Col N="310" /> question relate to the responsibilities of several Government Departments.  I intend to address the comments made by the Joint Committee in regard to these instruments.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee draws attention in its report to the methods employed to implement Community legislation in this country with specific reference to two sets of regulations made in the area of Road Traffic, namely the European Communities (Road Traffic/Compulsory Insurance) Regulations 1975 and the European Communities (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 1984.  The former were made in implementation of the first EC Directive on Motor Insurance which in effect abolished insurance checks on visiting EC vehicles in all the member states and eliminated the need for the drivers of the vehicles involved to secure and present &ldquo;Green Cards&rdquo;.  The latter gave effect in Ireland to a clause in an EC Directive on driver licensing under which a person who holds a valid driving licence issued by a member state of the European Community may, for a period of 12 months after he has taken up residence in another member state, drive any vehicle which he is permitted by such licence to drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view expressed by the Joint Committee that all primary legislation relating to road traffic should be contained in the Road Traffic Acts, and that all subordinate legislation pertaining thereto should be contained in regulations made under these Acts, has been noted by the Minister for the Environment.  While this view is accepted, the Minister has asked me to point out that, because of time and staffing constraints, Community legislation was implemented in the first instance by way of regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972.  The intention has always been to incorporate the EC Directive provisions in appropriate amending or new primary legislation as soon as possible.  I understand that suitable provisions to replace the regulations referred to by the joint committee will be incorporated in a Road Traffic Bill which the Minister for the Environment <Col N="311" /> hopes to bring before the Oireachtas later this year.</P>
    <P>The remainder of Report No. 16 is devoted to detailed consideration of three of the statutory instruments selected for review.  I propose to consider each of the instruments in turn in the order in which they are dealt with in the report.</P>
    <P>The regulations made by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism in Statutory Instrument No. 367 of 1984 repeal the Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) Act 1968 which provided the statutory framework for special arrangements which applied to the assembly and importation of motor vehicles in Ireland.  When originally introduced in 1968 these arrangements, known as the &ldquo;Scheme&rdquo;, were intended to apply until 1992.  However, under the terms of Protocol 7 annexed to Ireland's Treaty of Accession to the European Communities, we were obliged to terminate the scheme by 1 January 1985.</P>
    <P>The suggestion of the Joint Committee that regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, giving effect to secondary legislation of the institutions of the European Communities should contain a reference to the legislation concerned has, of course, been adopted.  The vast majority of the regulations under that Act are, in fact, made to give effect to Commission or Council Directives (that is, the secondary legislation to which the Joint Committee's suggestion referred).  However, the regulations in question in the present case give effect, not to secondary legislation, as such, but to a Protocol to the Treaty of Accession to the Communities.  In the circumstances, an appropriate reference was inadvertently omitted.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out, however, that such references are for the purpose only of giving information to the reader, and their omission does not affect the validity of the instrument concerned.</P>
    <P>The second point made by the Joint Committee in relation to this statutory instrument was that the explanatory note to the instrument should not merely have <Col N="312" /> explained why the Protocol required repeal of the Act but should also have made reference to what it describes as the &ldquo;associated fiscal measures&rdquo; introduced by other statutory instruments following on the repeal of the Act.  This point has been answered in part by the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism in correspondence with the Joint Committee in which the Department accepted that some clarification of the reasoning behind the regulations should have been given in the explanatory note.  I am advised, however, that it is not necessary or usual to refer in such a note to &ldquo;associated measures&rdquo; not directly within the ambit of the instrument itself.</P>
    <P>The second instrument examined by the Joint Committee was the European Communities (Cereal Seed) Regulations, 1985, the purpose of which was to postpone by one year, to 1 January 1986, the operative date for the implementation of the 1983 regulation prohibiting the sale of second generation cereal seed in Ireland. The Joint Committee, while not disagreeing with what the instrument sought to do, considered that it was open to objection on the grounds that it purported to have retrospective effect and felt that the matter should have been dealt with by statute instead of by statutory instrument if the Minister for Agriculture could not have availed of a delegated legislative power other than that of regulations made under the European Communities Act.</P>
    <P>The unusual circumstances which necessitated recourse on the part of the Minister for Agriculture to the making of these regulations are set out in correspondence between the Joint Committee and the Department of Agriculture which is reproduced in an appendix to the report. The views expressed by the Joint Committee have been noted by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The other statutory instrument reviewed by the Joint Committee was the Land Act, 1965 (Additional Category of Qualified Persons) Regulation, 1983. This regulation was made by the Minister for Agriculture following the initiation <Col N="313" /> of court proceedings by the European Commission in January 1983 in pursuance of its contention that section 45 of the Land Act, 1965 was in breach of Article 52 of the EEC Treaty.  The regulation adds to the list of qualified persons under section 45 of that Act any citizen of a member state of the European Communities who is exercising the right of establishment under Article 52 of the Treaty.  It is stressed that this category consists only of EEC citizens who are exercising the right of establishment as self-employed persons in this country by way of economic activity and who acquire an interest in agricultural land for the purpose of exercising that right.  The category does not include the acquisition of land by companies, or by persons acquiring holiday or retirement homes.</P>
    <P>This regulation does not purport to amend the Land Act, 1965.  It was made by the Minister for Agriculture in exercise of his powers under section 45 of that Act.  This enables him to declare by regulation categories of qualified persons in addition to those mentioned in the section itself.</P>
    <P>I note that the Joint Committee have expressed themselves satisfied, following correspondence with the Land Registry and the Department of Agriculture, that the new category of qualified persons is clear and that the instrument gives rise to no administrative difficulties.</P>
    <P>A glance at the subject-matter of the statutory instruments covered in the Joint Committee's report gives an indication of the extent to which obligations resulting from Ireland's membership of the European Communities now impinge on economic activity in this country.  The growing body of Community law is having a considerable and increasing impact on the everyday lives of our people.  Although it may often appear to be unspectacular and technically complex in nature, it is an area in which the relevance of the Community and the opportunities and challenges it presents become manifest for many people.</P>
    <P>The increasing harmonisation of Community law is part of a process which is <Col N="314" /> taking place in parallel in all of the member states aimed at creating a genuine single market throughout the entire Community.  The Intergovernmental Conference to review the EEC Treaty which began work after the Milan European Council has prepared a Single European Act incorporating the results of the conference, although this Act is subject to overall reserves by Denmark and Italy which we hope will be lifted soon.  One important aspect of the agreement reached at the conference is the setting of 1992 as the target date for the achievement of a single internal market, and the use of qualified majority voting, rather than unanimity, under relevant Treaty Articles to make possible the necessary harmonisation of legislation.  As a country which is heavily dependent on its export performance for its economic growth and development and which has often been frustrated by technical obstacles to trade, we should welcome the modest but significant steps which have been agreed with a view to making the early achievement of a single internal market in the Community possible.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like, a Chathaoirligh, to pay tribute to the work of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation.  The present Joint Committee, following in the distinguished tradition established by its three predecessors, have displayed a notable technical expertise in the discharge of the important scrutinising functions in relation to the complex area of Community legislation with which it has been entrusted by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Moreover, the Joint Committee has demonstrated a capacity to address, where it is appropriate to its terms of reference for it to do so, issues of central importance to the future development of the Community and to Ireland's role within it.  The series of valuable reports which the Joint Committee have produced are a testament to the scope, diligence and quality of their work.  These reports and the public debate which they generate have an important role to play in helping to promote and sustain public awareness of the work of the Community <Col N="315" /> in all its aspects, and the impact of this work on economic and social life in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Under its Orders of Reference the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities are enjoined to examine domestic regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972 and any other instruments made under statute and necessitated by the obligations of membership.</P>
      <P>There is a statutory provision that any of these statutory instruments may be annulled by resolution passed by both Houses only if the Joint Committee so recommend.</P>
      <P>Accordingly the Joint Committee aim to examine every statutory instrument coming within their remit and to report thereon to both Houses.  To date the present Joint Committee which was set up in 1984 has adopted four separate Reports on statutory instruments.  The report under review here to day is the third of this series.</P>
      <P>The scrutiny of domestic implementing regulations, many of which are extremely technical and complex can be regarded as the unglamorous side of the work of the Joint Committee.  The members of the sub-committee in question are to be congratulated for their efforts in this regard.  It should also be put on record that this Joint Committee at its inception had inherited a large backlog of statutory instruments for consideration.  This back-log was cleared and the scrutiny is fully up to date.</P>

    <P>There is going through the central part of all of these reports certain points of criticism which tend to repeat themselves: (a) Bad draughtsmanship; (b) Unusual use of power; (c) Appropriateness of penalties; (d) Failure to cite relevant authority; (e) Statutory instrument should be comprehensible in itself so that it is unnecessary to consult original Community legislation in order to comprehend the scope of the domestic instrument; (f) Obligations of the public <Col N="316" /> should be clear especially where the creation of a public offence is involved; (g) Fees: The Joint Committee has not accepted that Ministers are entitled in regulations made under the EC Act, 1972 to delegate to themselves or others the power to fix and vary fees administratively. Such action removes fees completely from the control which the Houses of the Oireachtas are seeking to exercise through the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>In report No. 16, nine Statutory Instruments are examined with attention being drawn specifically to four instruments.</P>
    <P>Correspondence with the Department of the Environment in relation to Licensing of Drivers Regulations 1984 indicated that a European Council Directive was implemented in part by domestic Regulations under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and in part by domestic Regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972.  The report makes two observations on this.  Firstly, the 1961 Act is of such importance in the everyday life of citizens that it would more properly be amended by a Bill introduced in the Dáil or Seanad.  Secondly, it is undesirable that the law relating to road traffic matters should be &ldquo;spread throughout different codes of legislation&rdquo;.  A useful suggestion is made that all primary legislation relating to road traffic should be contained in the Road Traffic Acts and all subordinate legislation pertaining thereto should be contained in regulations made under those Acts.</P>
    <P>In view of what appears to be the very irregular dispersion of road traffic legislation, I endorse this worthwhile suggestion. I think the Minister has taken this into account and indicated that a comprehensive Road Traffic Bill will be introduced by the end of the year.  This will be welcomed on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The Motor Vehicles Regulations 1984 which repealed the registration of Importers Act, 1968 will be remembered by all motorists as heralding the promise of cheaper cars.  The Lord have mercy on whoever said that.  Under Protocol 7 annexed to our Treaty of Accession Ireland was obliged to terminate the scheme <Col N="317" /> for special support to the motor industry after the period of transition.  The statutory framework for this scheme was provided by the 1968 Act repealed by these regulations.</P>
    <P>The report instances two defects in this statutory instrument.  First, any reference to the Protocol was omitted and, secondly, the Joint Committee considered that there should have been some reference to the reason the 1968 Act was being repealed and also to the associated fiscal measures introduced by other instruments which had the effect of &ldquo;counteracting the benefit that might have accrued to consumers...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee go on to warn the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, and quite rightly in my view that but for the fact that it implements important Treaty obligations, it might have considered annulment.</P>
    <P>Finally, the report castigates the Department of Agriculture for the purported retrospective effect of the Cereal Seed Regulations, 1985.</P>
    <P>Important issues of principle are raised in this report and it is heartening to see them now being noted in this House.</P>

      <P>Since the Joint Committee issued their thirteenth report which considered 46 statutory instruments they have examined these further nine. As Senator Smith has so very rightly said, it is an aspect of the work of the Joint Committee that is very unexciting and, perhaps, mundane.  These instruments were considered in detail by the sub-committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Maurice Manning.  We on the Joint Committee acknowledge our indebtedness to Deputy Manning and his colleagues for their very thorough and dedicated work.</P>
      <P>In part 2 of this report the Joint Committee again draw attention to the method of implementing Community secondary legislation, this time specifically in relation to instruments affecting the road traffic code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In part 3 the Joint Committee deal with three statutory instruments individually. In their consideration of the European <Col N="318" /> Community's Licensing of Drivers Regulations 1984, the Joint Committee raised certain queries with the Department of the Environment and the Department's reply is reproduced in an appendix to this report which indicates that the Council directive No. 180, 1263 of 1980, on driving licences had been implemented in part by regulations made under the Road Traffic Act, 1971, and in part by regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>The first Joint Committee, who were appointed in July 1973, in their 22nd report drew attention to the methods of implementing Community secondary legislation when they reported on their examination of the European Communities Road Traffic Compulsory Insurance Regulations, 1975.  These regulations also amended the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and the present Joint Committee considers it appropriate to reproduce the recommendations here in relation to implementing Community secondary legislation.</P>
    <P>We accept that Ministerial regulations, made under section 3 of the European Communities Act, 1972, may lawfully amend Acts of the Oireachtas or other Statues in force if such is required by Community secondary legislation, which the regulations are to implement.  However, the fact that the power exists ought not, in our opinion, to mean that it is appropriate to use it in every case. Regard should be had to the relative importance of the statute to be amended and to the range of its application to determine whether the amendment should be effected by a Statutory Instrument or an amending statute.  In the case of a statute such as the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which is of such importance in the everyday life of the citizens of this country, the Joint Committee consider that any proposals for its amendment should be initiated by a Bill introduced either in the Dáil or the Seanad and they recommend that when the opportunity offers European Communities Road Traffic Compulsory Insurance Regulations, 1975, should be repealed and its terms incorporated into amending legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> Initially, in relation to the 1984 Regulations, the Joint Committee consider it most undesirable that the law relating to road traffic matters should be spread throughout different codes of legislation and propose to raise the matter with the Department of the Environment with a view to having all primary legislation contained in the Road Traffic Acts and all subordinate legislation pertaining thereto contained in regulations made under those Acts because otherwise it is not ideal, especially in those Acts with which large numbers of the public are confronted every day.  The legislation here should be extremely clear.</P>
    <P>All these statutory instruments bring us to the desirable ideal of greater harmonisation in the laws of Community countries.  Indeed, Senator Smith in his speech put his finger on what is very dear to the heart of everyone in the country &mdash; the fact that duty on motor vehicles operating in this country is much higher than in most of our sister countries in the Community.  If the Minister could find a way of greater harmonisation of the duties and taxes he would have the support and admiration and, indeed, the thanks of the motoring public, at least in the country.  With greater communications and larger numbers of people travelling throughout the Community, it is important that the code of law of traffic regulations should be harmonised more closely.  Transportation is an area that accounts for one of the highest percentages of the GNP of the Community.  The Commission for Transport have dragged their heels to a greater extent than any other sector or division within the Commission itself.  This is regrettable having regard to the huge cost of infrastructure and the importance of transport and transportation to the citizens of every Community country.</P>
    <P>As a result of this report and the work put into it, I hope that the individual Ministers of the Government and Secretaries of each Department will note the views of the Joint Committee on the methods employed in implementing Community directives.  Now that we are <Col N="320" /> over 15 years members of the Community we should be entitled to expect a greater degree of accuracy, perhaps and a clearer system of implementing Community directives.  I hope that a greater effort will be made towards harmonisation.  If we, as citizens of the Community, are to win the greatest possible benefit from our membership, it can only come with a greater degree of harmonisation across the entire spectrum of legislation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his very clear and concise explanation during his speech on the report this morning. Towards the end of his speech he referred to the Milan European Council who decided that the qualified majority voting procedure should be deferred for a further six years to 1992.  This is, perhaps, a deplorable deferral of that problem, which is certainly not included in the original Treaty of Rome.  It was included in the Luxembourg Agreement some years ago as a greater insurance for the smaller countries such as ours, but, in fact, when we look at the record, we find that it is the larger countries who are using this facility for their own very narrow-minded nationalist sector interest. This is not in the spirit of the Treaty of Rome and I would hope that at some future meeting of the Heads of State it will be possible to bring forward that date because, unless a qualified majority voting procedure is implemented soon, we are going to find that reaching decisions in the expanded Community will become more difficult rather than easier as they ought to be.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and compliment the colleagues who have worked and studied the statutory instruments and produced an excellent report which I think will be of considerable benefit to the administration of Community laws in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few brief comments.  First, in common with other Senators who spoke before me I congratulate the committee for bringing forward this report and, indeed also, as was stated by Senator Smith, for bringing up to date a very serious back-log that <Col N="321" /> existed <i>vis-a-vis</i> various matters they had to attend to.  I would like to compliment the Minister on his precise and concise presentation which he made this morning covering the matter very effectively.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with three areas in this report this morning &mdash; the Motor Traffic Act, the Cereals Act and the Land Act. One must strive, in so far as is possible, to have this harmonisation, to which reference has already been made, on various issues particularly in areas where the question of the safety of individuals is concerned.  Page 4, paragraph 8 of the report states:</P>
      <P>It is a serious defect in drafting to omit in a former Statutory Instrument under the European Communities Act, 1972 any reference to the secondary legislation of the European Communities under which the exercise of the power of making regulations under the Act ultimately depends.</P>
      <P>In depth consideration must be given to ensure that we have matters that deserve and require regulations and proven discussion surrounding it from both Houses of the Oireachtas should come into play where that is necessary.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a brief point on the cereal side.  The committee has set out its position very clearly on page 6 of the report.  It contains a certain amount of criticism with regard to the delay involved and the question of retrospection. There is also appended to the report correspondence from the Department of Agriculture, to which I do not intend making any lengthy reference except to say that this should be noted very carefully.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Land Act, an aspect which we considered this morning and which has been considered in other reports as well, quite honestly this is an extremely important area.  I am satisfied that the views of the committee are expressed quite clearly in the report and that we must take serious note of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to be traditional to congratulate the committee on their work.  My congratulations will have <Col N="322" /> to be somewhat reduced in volume because of the failure to grasp the nettle with regard to these regulations.  I should like to refer to the committee's reports and to the use by the Minister of powers under the European Communities Act and whether it is appropriate that it should be so used.  There is no doubt that under the European Communities Act, 1972, there exists power for the Minister, under section 3 of that Act, to make regulations enabling section 2 of the 1972 Act to be implemented.  That is to enable the Minister of the day to make sure that the domestic law is in conformity with the Treaty of the European Communities mentioned in that Act.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects of this matter to which I should like to refer.  One is a matter which was specifically referred to by the committee and the other is a matter which was not, in fact, referred to by the committee but, in my opinion, should have been referred to by the committee. Therefore, it is important that it should be brought to the attention of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee, in page 2 of their report, quote from one of their previous reports &mdash; the 22nd report.  It states during the course of that report that the Joint Committee accepts that ministerial regulations made under section 3 of the European Communities Act, 1972, May lawfully amend Acts of the Oireachtas, all statutes in force, if such is required by the Communities' secondary legislation of the European Communities which the regulations are to implement.  However, the fact that the power exists ought not, in the opinion of the Joint Committee, mean that it is appropriate to use it in every case.  This is correct.  This power is there to enable Ireland to fulfil internationally its obligations as required from time to time.  The normal position should be that, when we come to amending our own legislation, it should be done by way of Act of the Oireachtas.  It is not just good enough to say, because the power exists to make a law by regulation under the European Communities Act, that the Minister should automatically do so. There was a time when I would consider <Col N="323" /> that acceptable, but I do so no longer. The House may be aware that under the original European Communities Act, 1972, any regulations made had to be incorporated in an Act of the Oireachtas at a later date.  That was done in 1973 in respect of the first lot of regulations. Under section 4 of the European Communities Act, 1972, the regulations under the Act would have statutory effect. Unless they are confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas passed within six months after they are made regulations, they effectively stand repealed without validity to anything that might be done in the meantime.</P>
    <P>In other words, while it is true that they got the force of law immediately, they had to be put into an Act of the Oireachtas together jointly, as was done in 1973, or individually, so as to give the elected representatives of the people the opportunity of expressing their view on it.  In 1973 that was changed, and I think it was changed for administrative convenience. It was changed by the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1973, which basically said that you did not have to pass any Act when these regulations were made.  They will have statutory effect.  If the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation recommend to the Houses of the Oireachtas that any regulations under the Act be annulled and if a resolution annulling the regulations is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas within one year after the regulations are made, the regulations shall be annulled accordingly.  In other words, they stand unless the Joint Committee suggest and get the concurrence of both Houses of the Oireachtas that they should be annulled. There are additional provisions to cover the period when neither the Dáil nor the Seanad would be meeting.  Leaving that aside for the moment, the normal position is that the Joint Committee are to consider it and make recommendations. Against that background, therefore, I fail to see, when the Joint Committee meet a situation which they consider to be unsatisfactory, why they do not take the bull by the horns then and say that they do <Col N="324" /> not agree with it and recommend that it should be annulled.</P>
    <P>In a very wishy-washy section, on page 5 of the report, the committee make reference to the European Communities (Motor Vehicles) (Registration of Importers) Act, 1968, Repeal Regulations, 1984.  They state that the Department's explanation and assurance does not, in the view of the Joint Committee, expiate the serious deficiencies in this instance. They say that, but for the fact that it implements important Treaty obligations, the Joint Committee might have seriously contemplated exercising its statutory sanction of recommending annulment. Then why does it not do it?  That is what it is there for.  It cannot unilaterally do so merely by recommending an annulment which would go before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the matter would be considered.  In the meantime, the regulation would continue to have effect.  It is a further example of where the Members of this House and the Members of the other House are not willing to take the responsibility of their legislation-making powers seriously enough.  We have the power to do that and we should exercise that power.  In fact what would have happened if they had so recommended is that the Minister would of course change the regulation to conform with what the Joint Committee said was necessary.  There is not much point in having a Joint Committee unless it is actually going to take action when it sees a problem.  I think the history of the correspondence which we see is an indictment of the committee's capacity to take the ultimate hard decision.  They certainly ask the hard questions but ultimately we are slipping to a greater extent into a situation in which we are being ruled by the Civil Service.  We are ruled by Ministers who in turn are being influenced by civil servants.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the second aspect of the regulations with particular reference to Statutory Instrument 367 of 1984.  That statutory instrument is an extraordinary document because this statutory instrument which was never considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas repeals an Act <Col N="325" /> of the Oireachtas.  It does not repeal just a section of the Act; it repeals a whole Act.  It wipes an Act from the Statute Book by ministerial order.  That is a quite inappropriate &mdash; and this is a point not picked up by the committee &mdash; use of the powers contained in the European Communities Act to have regulations used to remove totally from the Statute Books an Act of the Oireachtas.  That is within the scope of the powers but outside the intent of the use of the powers of the European Communities Act as amended by the Houses of the Oireachtas, as passed in 1972 and amended in 1973.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is acceptable that any Minister should revoke an Act of the Oireachtas by statutory instrument.  This Statutory Instrument 367 of 1984 is a most flimsy looking document.  It should be brought to the Minister's attention that it is not considered good enough to repeal an Act of the Houses of the Oireachtas by a statutory instrument which may never come before us for consideration under the provisions of a catchall Act introduced at the time so as to ease the transition between non-membership of the EC and membership of the EC.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the other point which the Joint Committee, in my opinion, should be addressing at this stage.  I do not think there is any need now for the European Communities Act and it should be repealed.  The abuse of the European Communities Act which has taken place should warn us that there lies here a power to Ministers which is far in excess of what is necessary.  I think there is no reason for that power now that our transition has taken place.  Where it is necessary to make regulations under Acts, if the power to make regulations exists under the principal Act itself or alternatively where it is necessary to enact new legislation, that should be done by the normal democratic process of introducing legislation into this House and into the other House and have it subject to full public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I wonder do people realise the full extent of the power contained in section 3 of the European Communities <Col N="326" /> Act, 1972.  In this regard I draw the attention of the House to one of the replies received from the Departments during the course of the excellent correspondence. The correspondence and the displaying of the correspondence reflects great credit on the committee.  During the course of that correspondence a point arose concerning the question of the use of the European Communities Act and the application of the European Communities Act to the particular regulations which were being made.  The point being made by the Department was that it was not necessary or there was no statutory obligation on them to express a view that it was a regulation necessitated by our membership of the EC under the European Communities Act, 1972.  In other words, when the Minister decides to make a regulation under the European Communities Act in my opinion, it is necessary that he should have formed an opinion that it was necessary for him to make those regulations in order to conform with the Treaty.  The question of whether the Minister did or did not form that view and whether it was a reasonable view is in fact capable of examination by the courts and I have no doubt that some time in the future the courts will consider these matters.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of the necessity for the repeal of the Act itself it is absolutely necessary that the Minister should form the view and should clearly state what his view is with regard to these matters.  I do not think it is acceptable that a Minister should make regulations as, for example, European Communities Regulations, 1984, without ever indicating within the regulation itself or indeed in the explanatory note, that he has formed the view that it was necessary for him to make those regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, as amended by the Act of 1973.  For that reason I think the Minister is in error in that regard and the committee are correct in their assertion that it is necessary for the Minister to form a view in these matters and that the view being formed by him and the reasonableness of the view is subject to scrutiny by the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> Reference was made to the Minister's statement here this morning when he said:</P>
    <P>I should like to point out, however, that such references are for the purpose only of giving information to the reader, and their omission does not affect the validity of the instrument concerned.</P>
    <P>It may well be true that it does not affect the validity of the instrument concerned but that is not the same thing as saying that the Minister can only use the European Communities Act 1972 if he forms the reasonable view that it is necessary to make regulations under the Act for the purposes set out in section 2 of the Act.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances I think that the report of the committee, in so far as it exposes the problem to our consideration, is to be welcomed.  In that regard I would like to join in the tributes that have been paid by the Members of this House to the committee for the work they did in that regard.  In so far as it fires a warning shot across the bow of the Departmental officials concerning the explanation of regulations in the future it is also to be welcomed.  However, in so far as it fails to do two things I think it is a little inadequate; it fails to tackle the general problem of the European Communities Act and its relevance to this country now that we are in the Community for 13 years, and secondly, it fails to tackle the very serious problem of the reasonableness and the use by the Minister of these powers under the European Communities Act for the purpose of amending primary legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and indeed repealing primary legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not think that is proper.  We should expect from the Minister that he would, in these cases, introduce a very simple Bill which would have the effect of amending the legislation in the normal way in which we expect legislation to be amended before this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> With regard to the details of the instruments themselves, they are much too technical to be considered by a House of the Oireachtas in detail.  For that reason the Joint Committee is the ideal place to examine this kind of regulation.  I can only assume that they are necessary under the Treaty and are necessary in order to ensure that we live up to our Treaty obligations as members of the EC. The time has long passed where the use of the European Communities Act, 1972, for the purposes set out in section 3, should now only be used where a genuine emergency exists and that serious consideration should be given to its repeal, as being no longer necessary in the more stable conditions which now exist, now that the transitional phase of our membership of the European Community has terminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to deal with one point, that is Protocol 7, which covers the cessation of the assembly of motor cars in this country and which was agreed when we got a 14 year period in which to adjust our position.  When that happened it would be uneconomic for any assembler to stay in the business because their competitors were free from 1 January 1985 to import fully assembled vehicles which are produced by manufacturers and sold at a small margin.  Many people in this country misunderstood the position because they thought that inevitably there had been a great loss of employment when this happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to explode this myth.  The IDA &mdash; I think they should get recognition for this &mdash; did a very good job in the setting up of other industries in this country to manufacture components.  In fact, there are more people employed now in the manufacture of motor components, which are mainly for export, than there was when the motor assembly industry was flourishing.  I would also like to pay tribute to Córas Tráchtála who found the markets for these components after the industries had been set up by the IDA.  They have also done a very good job and they should get recognition <Col N="329" /> for it.  I would like to put that on the record of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes when I come into this House and I commence a speech I find myself in the unlucky position of having to speak after Senator O'Leary. On occasion I disagree with him.  I am in the most unfortunate position today that I speak after him and I find myself in total agreement with the comments he made with regard to the operation of section 3 of the European Communities Act, 1972. That is the nub of the contents of this report.  It is probably the reason why we have a Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities at all.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important that the Houses of Parliament existing in this country, and existing in every other member state of the European Communities, operate as proper legislative bodies.  In so far as we have lost that function it is important that our systems provide other bases within which the legislation which affects us &mdash; the legislation of the European Communities &mdash; is brought home to the citizens of the individual countries.  It is extremely unfortunate that section 3 of the 1972 Act is used in such a wide way.  One of the points made in the report before us this morning is a reference to the 22nd report of the joint committee appointed on 26 July, 1973.  In the report before us there is a quotation from that committee's report which I propose to read into the record. I quote from page 2 of the report No. 16. The quotation is in turn a quotation from the 22nd report of the Joint Committee appointed on 26 July 1973.  It reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Committee accepts that Ministerial Regulations made under section 3 of the European Communities Act, 1972 may lawfully amend Acts of the Oireachtas or other Statutes in force if such is required by the Community secondary legislation, which the Regulations are to implement. However, the fact that the power exists <Col N="330" /> ought not, in the Joint Committee's opinion, to mean that it is appropriate to use it in every case.  Regard should be had to the relative importance of the statute to be amended and to the range of its application to determine whether the amendment should be affected by a Statutory Instrument or amending statute.  In the case of a statute such as the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which is of such importance in the everyday life of citizens, the Joint Committee considers that any proposals for its amendment should be initiated by a Bill introduced in the Dáil or Seanad.  It recommends that when opportunity offers the European Communities (Road Traffic) (Compulsory Insurance) Regulations, 1975 (Statutory Instrument No. 178 of 1975) should be repealed and its terms incorporated in an amending statute.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that since that statutory instrument was introduced we have had at least two important Road Traffic Acts enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Neither of these Acts included the provisions which were introduced by the particular regulations.  I find it distressing that successive Governments and the Houses of the Oireachtas have had such scant and little regard for the recommendations of previous Joint Committees in this regard.  One has to bear in mind the fact that the law of this country is becoming much more complex.  That complexity is added to by virtue of European regulations.  We could make our law a little easier to understand and a little easier to read if the Government, through the Stationery Office, were to publish, speedily and at least annually, a composite volume of Acts of the Oireachtas as amended by domestic statutory instruments and as amended by European legislation.  We do not do that.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary read into the record a statutory instrument which amended a particular Act.  I refer to another now. That is the European Communities Employment Equality Regulations, 1982.  It is a very short statutory instrument. What frightens me is that section <Col N="331" /> 3 of that statutory instrument states as follows and I quote:</P>
    <P>Section 11 (2) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of Section 17 (2) of the Employment Equality Act, 1977 are hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>Given under my Official Seal, this 17th day of September, 1982.</P>
    <P>GENE FITZGERALD,</P>
    <P>Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>What is the point of our debating legislation in this House and in the other House if the Minister of the day can amend that legislation by instrument given under his seal of office?  At least we should have the opportunity of debating every such instrument.  The existence of every such instrument should, at an early date, be brought before the Oireachtas and Members should be given the opportunity of debating it and they should be advised of its contents.  That is a point that the Government should act upon to ensure that we, as a legislative body, become more relevant and cease to be a type of rubber-stamping body whose decisions are very ineffective.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to two of the statutory instruments that are mentioned in the report.  First, there is the European Community Licensing of Drivers Regulation of 1984.  I think that regulation is to be welcomed and it is the type of regulation which brings all of us, within the Community, closer together in a practical way.  Secondly, I want to refer to the Land Act, 1965, Additional Category of Qualified Persons Regulation.  This regulation is somewhat different in the sense that it is a domestic regulation and that we have a Minister exercising power conferred upon him by an Act of the Irish Parliament.  I welcome the existence of that regulation and I am glad that the Minister has extended the list of qualified persons existing by virtue of section 45 of the Land Act, 1965.  It is a pity that the Minister of the day in doing that had to be propelled by court action into taking that decision.  It is also a pity that since our accession to Europe many non-Irish <Col N="332" /> Europeans who attempted to buy land for productive purposes, land which was not being used, were prevented from doing so.  I am glad that the existence of this regulation will at least make that position a little easier.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and I commend the committee on their work.  I conclude by stressing my extreme worry at the constant use of section 3 of the 1972 Act and I hope that the Minister can give the House an assurance that his colleagues in this Government and in future Governments will use that power with greater restraint and that in so far as European decisions have to be implemented in a legislative sense in this country we will have the opportunity of doing it within the Houses of the Oireachtas rather than having to accept regulations about which immediately we know little.</P>

I can assure the Members of this House that I have listened to them with great interest.  I have taken very careful note of the specific points which have been raised. As Senators will understand, points refer to different Departments and the best assurance I can give the House is to confirm that I will arrange to have the appropriate points passed on to the relevant Ministers and their Departments.</P>
      <P>I would like to take up a point raised by Senator McDonald in relation to the Luxembourg Council.  He was talking about the time scale for the implementation of qualified majority voting and mentioned, in disapproving terms, the time scale which he said extended to 1992.  In fact, the year 1992 does not refer to the time scale for the introduction of qualified majority voting.  On the contrary, it refers to the target date for the achievement of the single internal market.  Of course if the single internal market is to be achieved by 1992 it is generally agreed that the qualified majority voting will have to be put in place straight away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in my opening remarks <Col N="333" /> the position is that there are still two reserves on the conclusions of the Luxembourg Council.  Our friends in Denmark in particular have a problem.  Senators were talking about the question of the power of the Executive as opposed to the power of the Legislature.  In Denmark they found that the views of the Prime Minister were not immediately acceptable to the Legislature.  As I understand from recent discussions with Danish colleagues, they now propose to have a referendum late next month in an effort to sort out the matter.  This arises from the point raised by Senator McDonald.  I would reiterate my view and that of the Government, and probably of the Opposition as well, that even though occasionally problems in sectors can arise or in relation to specific products, it is in our overall national interest to move as quickly as possible towards the single market without any restrictions on trade. That relates to our position as a major exporter and the possibility of further jobs in the manufacturing sector resulting from the opportunities for increased exports.</P>
    <P>I enjoyed Senator O'Leary's remarks. As usual he was interesting and perhaps a little provocative.  Senator Durcan seems to be <i>ad idem</i> with Senator O'Leary in his broad approach.  Both Senators raised quite a serious point.  Perhaps it is one that has not been discussed at a serious level sufficiently in this country. I appreciate that at the administrative end there is, of course, with the mass of regulations or procedures that have to be adopted, great pressure to try to find the easiest and quickest way of having these European directives or regulations translated into our national law.  In any democracy one has to watch the trend whereby the easy and quick way may in fact be removing too much power from the Legislature.</P>
    <P>I took careful note of the points raised. I cannot give a Government viewpoint on that particular issue.  It has just been raised here but it is one that I will dwell on and discuss with colleagues as to whether there should be a more effective procedure enabling both Houses to have a <Col N="334" /> greater input into and a greater effect on the implementation of these Community directives.  One suggestion made was that annually or bi-annually an Act would be put before the Oireachtas which would enable regulations which had been temporarily introduced to be discussed and, if not approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas, that these particular regulations will then become void and have no effect.  That is a suggestion that can be usefully looked at.  While I cannot give any commitment on behalf of the Government, I will certainly arrange to have the matter discussed with my colleagues.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions to this interesting debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report of the Joint Committee on Building Land.  It represents the first serious attempt by representatives from both Houses of the Oireachtas to consider in detail the problems associated with the supply and cost of building land and to put forward proposals for dealing with the issues involved. The committee had a very wide brief and received a large number of submissions from interested parties which reflected the wide range of issues connected with the question of building land. The committee, therefore, was able to make a comprehensive analysis of the problem.  The report contains 28 main recommendations which are aimed at achieving three main objectives: the improvement of the operation of the land market; the recovery by the community of a fair proportion of the gains arising from the development of land; and the better implementation of planning objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> The Government have noted the report and have decided that its recommendations should be examined by my Department with a view to formulating proposals for submission to Government as soon as possible.  This examination has begun and the views of other Departments and the local authorities are being sought before specific legislative proposals or other measures are developed in response to the report. There are, however, a number of measures which I have already taken which relate to the committee's recommendations and I would like to take this opportunity of outlining these to the House. As I have already stated, the committee's main recommendations were aimed at improving the operation of the land market.  In this regard the committee recommended that measures be taken: to streamline and update compulsory purchase procedures; to counter urban decay; and to examine existing legislation with a view to reducing compensation liability.</P>
    <P>There is a general recognition that the present system of compulsory purchase of land by local authorities is cumbersome and long delays can occur before land actually comes into the control of the local authority and becomes available for development.  These delays cause planning blight and inhibit local authority intervention in the land market.  A general review of the law and procedures relating to the compulsory purchase of land and other property has been completed by my Department and a general scheme of a Bill to consolidate and modernise CPO law has now been prepared and will be brought before Government in the very near future.  While this is an extremely complex branch of the law, the provisions in the general scheme will give effect to the Joint Committee's recommendations in this area.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommended that the basis for the assessment of compensation for land which is compulsorily acquired should be modified with a view to ensuring that a valuation of land would <Col N="336" /> reflect its development potential on the basis of a reasonable development timescale and so as to eliminate the effect which ill-founded expectations on the part of the landowner, or any purchaser, might have on land prices.  This recommendation highlights the need for a detailed look at the existing rules for the assessment of compensation.  My Department are undertaking such a review so that specific legislative proposals can be developed.  This is a difficult and complicated issue and will need to be carefully thought out in order to get the correct balance between private property rights and the interests of the common good.  As evidence of this, one has only to consider the difficulties experienced a few years ago in devising arrangements for the control of rents of those dwellings to which the Rent Restrictions Acts formerly applied.  I believe, however, that the compensation rules, which in their present form go back to 1919, need to be changed if we are to bring them more closely into line with modern requirements and if we are to achieve a proper balance between private property rights and the interests of the common good.</P>
    <P>The committee also considered the financial contributions which planning authorities may require to be made as a condition of planning permission.  These contributions, which are commonly referred to as development levies, have become a source of contention between some builders and local authorities and the committee recommended that my Department should ensure that consistent and appropriate procedures are followed in establishing levy systems.  As the law stands, it is entirely a matter for each planning authority to decide to what extent they should seek to recover costs by way of levies.  There may well be a case for introducing greater consistency and equity to the present system of levies and the proposals of the committee in this area are being examined with a view to considering what legislative and other changes might be desirable.</P>
    <P>If an adequate supply of building land is to be maintained there will be a need <Col N="337" /> for continuing investment in infrastructural services, and this was rightly emphasised by the committee.  Over recent years there has been a considerable increase in capital spending on sanitary services schemes with a corresponding expansion in the level of activity on schemes in progress.  Road grants totalling £160 million will be made available to local authorities this year for road improvement and maintenance.  This represents an increase of 4 per cent on the 1985 provision.  However, it has to be remembered that in 1985 there was a substantial increase in State funding for roadworks which was 14.5 per cent greater in real terms than the 1984 provision. The recommendation of the committee that tax revenues from transactions in building land be allocated to local authorities for use in land acquisition and development will need to be considered by the Government in the context of other proposals currently being developed in relation to the reform of local finances.</P>
    <P>The report pointed out that the existence of rights of connection to services, independent of the objectives of development plans, may act as a serious constraint on the implementation of the plans and recommended that the law should be amended to restrict the right of connection to public main sewers to development which is in accord with the proper planning and development of an area as set out in the development plan.  It is my opinion that the statutory right of connection to services, which was granted in 1878, has implications for planning, particularly in relation to compensation claims, and I intend therefore that this recommendation will receive very careful consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>One of the more sensitive areas which will require examination in the light of the report is the taxation system as it relates to land transactions and development and windfall gains.  The committee enunciated the principle that the community has a right to recover its own contributions, through the provision of services, to gains arising from increases <Col N="338" /> in land values and that a substantial part of the increase in land values should be acquired by the community subject to minimising any consequential effects on supply, availability and price.  In this connection the committee expressed dissatisfaction that precise figures were not available of the amount of income tax and corporation tax arising from sales of development land.  The lack of such information for an area as sensitive as this, where the popular perception is that large profits are being made and little tax is being paid, is a matter which must be pursued.  My Department are already in communication with the Revenue Commissioners on this matter.</P>
    <P>On a more general level the initial response to the range of financial and other incentives which I have introduced to promote the rehabilitation of inner-city areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick by encouraging redevelopment programmes has been encouraging.  These incentives are intended to attract development into areas which have generally been perceived as unfavourable for investment purposes and which would probably remain in a run-down and derelict state if left to the normal operation of the property market.  Legislation is at present being prepared in my Department which will provide for the designation of these areas and the establishment of a new statutory authority to secure the redevelopment of one of these areas, the 27 acre Custom House Docks site in Dublin.  I am also hopeful that the redevelopment of this massive site will do much to enhance the environment and employment prospects of the whole surrounding area and will serve as a catalyst to stimulate redevelopment along the docks and in the north inner-city.</P>
    <P>Generally, I think that the overall reaction to the report has been one of welcome. The committee has put together a very good analysis of the problems which deserves the widest consideration.  A large number of the report's detailed recommendations are acceptable and are being implemented.  A detailed examination of the remaining recommendations is under way in my Department and when <Col N="339" /> this has been completed specific legislative proposals and other measures will be developed and submitted to Government for approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I could not get my notes for this debate due to the snow storm so I will be speaking from memory.  I am glad the Minister has welcomed the report because it is a very important one.  I was anxious to be a member of that committee because I have some involvement in building and it seemed to me that I might be able to play a full part in that kind of work.  As it turned out I discovered that a knowledge of building and housing was no advantage. My view is that somebody with no knowledge in that area would have been equally helpful to the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I should like to make is that I regard this report as a bible in this area.  How do you deal in a brief contribution with a virtual bible?  It is very difficult.  There are many ways in which we can approach it.  We can take a general look at it or we can refer to specific areas.  I suppose there is for and against both these ways.  I should like to pay tribute to the committee and particularly to the Chairman, Deputy Molloy and the Vice-Chairman, Senator Ferris. I should also like to express appreciation for the work done by the Clerk to the Committee, Mr. Kieran Coughlan. Unfortunately we lost him half way through on his promotion to Clerk Assistant in this House.  He was replaced by Miss Patricia Ryan, who was a very able replacement.  She had a very difficult job to take up where Mr. Coughlan left off. We were also very fortunate that we had Mr. Bob Jennings, Senior Research Officer with An Foras Forbartha to help us.  No words of mine would be adequate to pay tribute to the hard work and the expertise of Mr. Jennings.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that in a large measure this report is a tribute to him.  I would also like to thank Mr. T.C. Smith, Senior Counsel, and Mr. P. Kelly Barrister-at-Law, both of whom provided legal advice to the committee and also to the <Col N="340" /> staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas who helped out with the typing and all the secretarial work.</P>
    <P>In the whole area of social engineering housing is most important.  Housing development may be regarded as the implementation of social policy.  It is not merely structural planning.  It is a fundamental part of social engineering.  This is what underlies the importance of this report and indeed any examination in this area.  This report contains 40 conclusions and 28 recommendations and represents two years hard work.  It is very hard to focus on everything in that period.  The presentation of the report is unique because I see that details are given of all the meetings that were held and the attendance of all the members.  People looking at it will at least know who played their part.  I must say, looking back on it, since nobody else is likely to clap me on the back, I am inclined to do it myself. My attendance is something of which I am proud.  It is not easy for Deputies or Senators to attend these meetings.  Meetings were held mostly on Wednesdays.  I personally found it difficult to play my part here and also to take part in the committee.  I am sure that would be the experience of every other member. There is a difficulty.  In some ways it might be better not to have those meetings held when the Dáil or the Seanad are in session.  That may be difficult, but in passing I would say that.</P>
    <P>Coming closer to the report, one of the views we took about building land was that with regard to any profits in that area the community had an entitlement as well as the individual.  By and large most people are of the opinion that the Kenny report was unconstitutional in its suggestion about the control of building costs. The view we took on the committee was that the community had a right to the benefits which accrued with regard to the cost of servicing areas and also that the individual had a right under the Constitution. The committee tried to reach a reasonable balance between the two. That was fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>I am sure I am in order in referring to the proposed amendment which regrets <Col N="341" /> the failure of the committee adequately to address the constitutional obstacles to a proper organisation of the building land market.  Senator Brendan Ryan was one of the most enthusiastic members on the committee and I could not agree that the committee did not face all the obstacles. I believe that if the committee came to the conclusion that constitutional change was necessary, they would have approached it in that way.</P>
    <P>The committee came to the conclusion, in my view, that not alone was constitutional change unnecessary but there was adequate scope to do everything that was required under the Constitution.  Furthermore, to deal with constitutional change would have involved very long delays and these would have been unacceptable because several times during the course of the sittings of the committee we came to the House to look for extensions. Many people had reservations about giving those extensions.  The committee decided that constitutional change was unnecessary and I want to put it on record that the committee would not shy away from approaching it in that respect if they felt it was necessary.</P>
    <P>Another area on which we spent considerable time was compulsory purchase orders.  Suggestions were made about simplifying procedures.  It was also felt that the value should be more in line with the existing use of a property rather than what it might be if planning permission was given.  This is reasonable and it must be accepted.  In other words, if property on which a CPO had been placed were within an urban area the value should be related strictly to the value of that property in its own right and not to the possibilities connected with it, possibilities in large measure which would be related to public services, public facilities, the infrastructure which the public had paid for.  That was another area which was discussed at length with regard to serviced land.</P>
    <P>In many instances serviced land brought considerable wealth to individuals by reason of the fact that the land or property was close to services provided by the local authority at the taxpayer's <Col N="342" /> expense.  This is the important part.  The initial windfall went to the owner and then the developer and, in particular, the purchaser was paying on the double because he was paying the enhanced price because of the services that were provided by the taxpayer and as a taxpayer he had paid for the service.  We had that difficulty.</P>
    <P>Inner city development was another matter which came up during the discussions. Everybody knows there is a considerable problem in deciding whether very expensive and valuable land in the centre of the city should be used for a limited number of houses or whether the same amount of money should be used to build further from the central area, where the same amount of money would build more houses.  This is a problem that has arisen.  It is a political question &mdash; I do not mean party political &mdash; and part of the science of government and social policy.  Unfortunately, many people would feel the wrong decisions have been made in this area.  People were brought out from the inner city, they were disrupted, their culture was disrupted and interfered with, their way of life was disrupted with the result that they were discontented, under stress, placed in a strange environment.  Crime and drug problems occurred.  Indeed, in many cases very decent people were put in a situation where they succumbed to these pressures.  The people were blamed for the problems which the climate had created.  The people in their own setting were decent people who had a way of life; they interfered with nobody.</P>
    <P>Bringing people from the inner city out to high-rise flats, we can all see now, was an enormous mistake.  In other countries, even in London, the decision was made many years ago to regenerate the inner city on the same lines as we are doing here and, in fact, we are only copying what they have done and in many cases the designs and plans seem to be a copy of what they have there.  Even in the area of high-rise flats people were put in an impossible position for which they were subsequently blamed.  When I came to Dublin in the late 1950s, high-rise flats <Col N="343" /> were the in-thing all over Europe.  They came in here subsequently &mdash; I think really as a political issue &mdash; following publicity and people pointing out the success of high-rise flats and their advantages in other countries.  I remember an exhibition in the Building Centre on Corbousier, who I suppose was the architect of high-rise flats and this exhibition went on for a very long period promoting high-rise flats and their success.  I do not hear much about Corbousier now and, indeed, his flats were a great success until some years afterwards when people, instead of using the chutes for getting rid of refuse, threw it over the bannisters and the sides of the building.  As a result, high-rise flats were no longer promoted and are a bad word now and rightly so.  That is the specific problem with regard to the inner city regeneration and development.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile referring to one-off houses because the report did say that one-off houses took the pressure off serviced land.  On page 23 it is stated:</P>
    <P>The growth in private single housing diverted pressure which would otherwise have been felt on publicly serviced land.</P>
    <P>In effect, the report states that publicly serviced land was not available because during the seventies there was a great expansion in the building industry.  The problem arose because we were not prepared for that expansion and not geared towards an expansion in infrastructures, such as sewerage schemes, water supply schemes, and so on.  It is worth pointing out that the report emphasises the value of the one-off sites.  Of course, we have the advantage at present that we are in a period of great decline in the building industry and therefore, the pressure was not on the committee as it would have been in the seventies.  We have much more time.  Hopefully, the recommendations in this report will be geared for a period when the situation will change and when we will reach a degree of activity in the housing market.</P>
    <P>Regarding the one-off houses.  I realise and, indeed, the report emphasises that <Col N="344" /> to an extent we are not considering the planning laws <i>per se.</i>  In any event, it is worthwhile pointing out that even today the one-off house is taking considerable pressure off serviced sites.  It is a mistake that we have this drive to make it more difficult to obtain planning permission for isolated houses in rural areas.</P>
    <P>There are problems in some areas.  For example, in parts of Meath we have higher densities and in the area close to Dublin we have pollution due to concentration of septic tanks.  The report very clearly points out that the reason we have this concentration of houses in the adjoining counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow is that in the Dublin area with regard to planning permission for single one-off houses, there is a charge for the provision of services.  Naturally this charge is greater in Dublin than it is in the other counties with the result that this, in itself, drives people to the adjoining counties.</P>
    <P>The committee came to the conclusion that it would be a good idea if those charges could be standardised.  On the legal side, there seems to be a problem in that regard.  If that were to be done, for example, if Meath, Louth, Kildare and Wicklow were to charge the same amount as in Dublin they would, in effect, be making a profit.  If, in Dublin, they were charging the costs that would have been incurred for those services in Meath, there would be a loss.  I cannot see how this problem could be got over without legislation.  I am sure there is some way to do it, because the committee clearly felt that one of the reasons for this rural sprawl in the areas contiguous to Dublin was the differential charges.  They could be looked at and, perhaps, when we reach the stage when we will be looking at these problems on a regional basis this problem may very well be simplified.</P>
    <P>I should like to put some emphasis on the value of the one-off house.  I am not going to discuss any other area.  It is playing an important part and should continue to do so.  With regard to the planning legislation we have a democratic situation.  Under the Planning Acts, 1963 up to the present, people are in control <Col N="345" /> of what they want.  Development plans have been drawn up by the local authorities for a period of five years.  These are considered by the elected members and eventually a decision is reached with regard to a development plan.  That plan is put on display for a period of three months.  Any ratepayer who wants to make a complaint or has some observation to make is enabled to do so.  In effect, the people are responsible for the development plan.  This is something that should not be changed.  With regard to changes in the development plan, if the elected representatives feel that it is necessary, that is possible.</P>
    <P>The planning control is adequate.  It is unfortunate that section 4 is necessary but it is something that should be retained. It is one of the few reserved functions and these are evaporating all the time.  This is something we should not forego too easily.</P>
    <P>It is fair that in passing that I should refer to the old housing stock and say that a concentration on helping out in this area of reconstruction and refurbishing also &mdash; as well as the one-off house &mdash; reduces pressure with regard to the requirements of building land.  We welcome the reconstruction grant, 1985, scheme.  If it is implemented in the way that it should be, it will have a major input into the whole area of housing.  It will reduce the pressures on the requirements for sites for new houses which, in effect, in the subtleties of the market, will reduce the cost of building land.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile to refer to the reconstruction grant and to state that the committee felt that this was one area where pressure could be taken off the requirements for building land.  This was before the announcements were made by the Government regarding the reconstruction grant in 1985.  It is one thing that tied in very well with the thinking of the committee.</P>
    <P>Another area we dealt with for long periods was the price, cost and value of building land.  There are subtle differences but nevertheless, they are important. The committee concentrated on dealing with the value of building land.  Value in <Col N="346" /> this sense is determined by the use of land for the greatest benefit to the community. Price is not always related to benefit.  It is something that is determined by the market and changes rapidly.  Value is much more important because it is related to the planning and to the importance of the development plan.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the development plan the members of the local authority come to a decision about the precise use of land.  What the development plan really states is that within the terms of that plan the designations for the particular parcels of land are the best for the community. That is precisely what they are saying. They are putting the value on it for a particular purpose.  The committee also pointed out that if these values are not maintained, in other words, if land which best benefits the community through it use for housing but instead is used for office blocks which will be there for many generations, that creates a major problem.</P>
    <P>The value of building land is the important consideration.  The value must be related to the community and the benefits which the community will get from that land.  The committee decided that any consideration of building land must be placed firmly in the context of ensuring the best use of land in the community interest.  While recognising the constitutional rights of the individual and the rights which could not be overlooked and the rights which are very important in the context of the culture and the history of this country, the committee while considering them all the time focused on the important benefits which were due to the community.  It was not up to the committee to decide or to dictate how land should be used.  That is the role at present both of the planning system and the land market.  I suppose, in effect, one could say that this limited the scope of the work of the committee in the overall context and particularly in the context of social engineering of which this is a part. It should have been possible to look at that area and maybe not to dictate but to make recommendations in this respect and to point out that perhaps in some <Col N="347" /> areas changes should be made in order to improve the planning legislation and in order to achieve the situation that we would all desire with regard to individual rights and with regard to the community.</P>
    <P>There was a rapid growth in the building industry output in the seventies.  Possibly it is still not fully appreciated how unusual that decade was in the economic and demographic life of the country.  By 1979 total building output was about two-thirds higher than in 1971.  New housing, the main area which gives rise to demand for building land, had doubled between 1970 and 1975 and peaked in the early eighties.  It is no exaggeration to say that it was this growth and its consequences which were the dominant influences on most other developments connected with building land.  Clearly that was a phenomenon. The fact that we are in a period of decline gave the committe time to look at this situation calmly without the pressure of having to rush through their report. Even looking back on it, the committee came to the conclusion that even if there had been adequate serviced land &mdash; which there was not &mdash; the pressures were such that they would result in distortion in the market.  We realised that the supply of serviced land was caught unprepared &mdash; and even if it were prepared it still would not mean that some major problems would not have arisen with regard to the supply and cost of building land.  In this regard, while we are reasonably satisfied now that there is a considerable area of serviced building land, to some extent it is never possible to say that we are in a satisfactory situation.  In effect, what could happen would be that people who might require new houses might be driven out of areas in which they would want to reside and into areas where they would not want to reside.  There is a major difficulty in ensuring that there is an adequate supply of building land available in suitable places.  That is something that would be very difficult.  In relation to requirements of people regarding where they want to work, the committee gave some consideration to the matter of why people who work in urban areas would want to <Col N="348" /> commute from houses in the countryside. Many reasons were put forward such as getting away from the pressures of urban life to enjoy the amenities of the countryside &mdash; which they are entitled to do &mdash; but no clear impression came across.  No statistics came up.  We got no picture to show an overriding reason as to why people want to build in rural areas.</P>
    <P>One survey shows that most of the people who build in rural areas acquire their sites from relatives, from in-laws or, perhaps, on their parents' farm.  That, in itself, would be an overriding reason. Perhaps some people would like to live close to relatives.  Why should they not if they want to?  Indeed, why should a farmer not be able to give a plot of land to one of his family on which to build a house?  Why should somebody with a small area of land not be allowed to build a house in a rural area, if that person wants to, because it is curtailing a right? This is something new and a departure from the old standards.  I think it is wrong. In more recent years, while investment in services was increasing, the level of demand for building output was in decline.  Those developments place in context one of the major conclusions of the committee that there is now a reasonably adequate supply of serviced land to meet needs arising for a number of years. This was fairly well established by the information before the committee from many local authorities.  The committee drew attention to the inadequate levels of investment in related road networks which are also necessary to ensure that land can be developed.  This is one area that is important.  We should emphasise that it is not only the water and sewerage facilities that are necessary.  The roads network is equally important.</P>
    <P>At present when I see, in passing, that our roads are in such a sad state it is hard to feel it is unreasonable to look for development in this area.  I would like to emphasise that the committee came to the conclusion that while, in general, it seems there is an adequate supply of serviced land, nevertheless there are situations where having the serviced land is not enough.  The roads network and other <Col N="349" /> areas such as telephones and electricity enter into the picture as well.  That is a situation which might very well be looked at.  I mention that in passing with regard to the problems we have in getting finance for these works at present.  Nevertheless, while we say in general that we have an adequate supply of building land, that reservation about the roads network does raise a serious question mark with regard to all the information supplied by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The committee concluded, as Justice Kenny had done in his report many years earlier, that the overal increase in land prices was due to the heavy demand, to which I have already referred.  Even in a well-ordered situation there would have been difficulty in keeping pace with that kind of pressure.</P>
    <P>There are many areas of the report itself on which we could spend a lot of time.  Section 1.1 of the report, in the first paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>Land is a resource of both the community and the individual.  The effects of individual decisions on land use often outlive the individual interest and in many cases are irreversible.  Furthermore, the use of a parcel of land for one purpose usually means that it cannot be used in any alternative manner.</P>
    <P>That is something I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>In urban areas, use of land in one location may influence the whole urban structure by affecting the possibility of similar land use in other locations.  In smaller towns, ribbon development on access routes can severely restrict other development options.</P>
    <P>It is important to refer to this sprawl in the suburbs and on the outskirts of towns and the damage this is doing.  This is an area in which I feel great progress could be made without spending as much in resources as would be necessary in new housing schemes.  On the outskirts of towns and cities and villages we have this sprawl.  The reason for this sprawl is that the roads network, the sewerage facilities and the water supply are not available for <Col N="350" /> development in depth.  In many of those instances it would be possible to extend the services at a very reasonable cost.  We could reach a situation in which we would have a total development of an area.  We could, perhaps, limit the sites to certain sizes.</P>

      <P>Most reasonable people agree that this is a very well researched document.  While it does not solve all the problems, and nobody would claim that it does or could, it makes many very sound recommendations which, if implemented, would make a significant contribution in the area of building land.  I am glad that the Minister appreciates that. Given the status of private ownership in our Constitution, most thinking people would feel that the committee have done a very good job.  Many of the recommendations could be introduced quickly without new legislation by simple amendments to other Acts which are subject to frequent amendment.  The report is very important and it has been acknowledged as being very important.  It will become more so in time.</P>
      <P>We do not have the pressures now that we had in the seventies, but we will have them again.  This is a time when I feel I could make a party political outburst but I will refrain from that because the subject is much too important.  We all hope that the problems will be solved and we will once again get back into the development that we had in the seventies. All of us involved on the committee and people who are involved in this area realise the complexity of issues connected with building land and that there is no simple solution for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A brief reference was made to the possibility of controlling prices.  This is dealt with briefly.  It is pointed out that to implement such control would simply transfer wealth because the value of the site or land is the intrinsic thing.  If a community placed a value on a particular site of, say, £10,000 and if we had price control and that site had to be sold at <Col N="351" /> £5,000, its value would remain the same and there would simply be a transfer of wealth.  This transfer might not necessarily be necessary or desirable.  In that situation I am sure there would have to be some kind of means test.  Otherwise it would not be effective and price control, even if it were constitutional, which it is not, would not be the answer.  People had the wrong idea that new house prices could be inflated to make up for the extra cost of the site.  It has been shown that this is not so.  New house prices are related to the second hand houses in the area or to the existing housing stock.  While in other areas somebody selling a commodity might make up the input of costs and arrive at a total figure, in effect what the developer or speculator does is look at an area, see the type of houses that are in that area, how desirable the locality is, and put his price or the amount that he would be able to get for his houses, and work backwards like that.</P>
    <P>What it points out also is that we are a class-ridden people.  It shows that people by themselves determine the value of houses or the desirability of the locality. For example, if there was a travellers' camp in the locality it would devalue the area; so, in effect, the new house prices relate to the area, not to anything else. The developer in fixing his price will have to come to some kind of conclusion as to what price he would get for the houses he would erect in that area and the success or failure of his operation would depend on that judgment and the decision he would come to.</P>
    <P>Another peripheral matter that came before the committee is worth mentioning. That is the problem we have with regard to sewage treatment plants and how this, in turn, affects prices and site costs.  We have, of course, a serious problem in this regard.  We have the unfortunate situation where raw sewage is being pumped into Dublin Bay.  While this from the health point of view may not be serious, from the amenity and any other points of view it is totally undesirable.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, in rural areas one of <Col N="352" /> the big problems is septic tanks and the pollution consequent on septic tanks, because the septic tank is really a very primitive and very primary method of sewage disposal.  It seems strange that with all the developments we have in technology something has not been done with regard to this problem.  It is difficult to understand and realise that in many ways the primitive privy attached to the old houses in pre-Famine times was more hygienic than the modern methods of treating human waste and sewage.  When we are talking of the National Development Corporation, the many schemes that could be undertaken and the many areas where the corporation could help, this is certainly an area where scholarship, research and development would pay.  Not alone do these matters push up our housing costs but they are also responsible for pollution of our rivers and destroying the amenity and the tourist attractiveness of the countryside.  I hope that something can be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>One thing the report makes clear is that raw land prices have not been a major influence on house price trends, contrary to what was generally believed. The raw land price had no effective influence on house prices.  With regard to recommendations on the land market, the committee concluded that at present the planning system looks after the broad issues of land use and provision of main services.  Land availability transactions and development are looked after by the market, quite apart from these main services. There is no policy area directly concerned with the operation of the land market, which is largely left to its own devices.</P>
    <P>I think this is unfortunate.  Broadly speaking, in this country we have no land policy either.  I am not saying that in the critical sense.  I am saying it in the sense that we need a land policy on the lines mentioned here.  The land policy plays a very large part not alone in regard to building land, but we see that some areas traditionally used for agriculture may be converted into forestry with the result that the ecology and the wildlife of the <Col N="353" /> place is totally changed.  In some sense it seems to me that a land policy should incorporate all these considerations and would eliminate that possibility.  Then the committee recommend development of policy to ensure effective operation of the land market.  This policy should include measures to guide, regulate and supplement market behaviour, taking account of the more detailed recommendations which are given later on.</P>
    <P>With regard to guidance, it was felt that the individual speculative house builder is the key to the operation of the new private estate housing and land markets and policy should be geared towards ensuring that they operate most effectively. Industry and the State have not made sufficient distinction between need, which is the prime policy interest of the State, and demand, which is the dominant influence of the market.  The committee go on then to make recommendations, and these are:</P>
    <P>Large or local authorities be required to publish an annual development report.  This report should include, among other things, a review of the position on serviced building land, land transactions and prices, building intentions as indicated in planning permissions, and the position of unexercised planning permissions.</P>
    <P>By and large, the development plan does not impose any strict obligations as regards the actual development on a planning authority.  It is a framework against which proposals and planning permissions are considered.  But of itself the development plan does not achieve the actual development that is desirable. It is a vehicle towards that end.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended that:</P>
    <P>Details of all transactions in building land be notifiable to local authorities. This should be an obligation on those engaged in the transaction, a legal statutory obligation, to ensure that this information is available for the development of the report.</P>
    <P>And of course &mdash; it would have to be readily and immediately available.  There <Col N="354" /> are, of course, facilities with the planning authorities to be able to register this information and to monitor it constantly. The committee also recommended that planning permission should include a proposed development timescale.  This is intended to assist in the preparation of the development report, which I mentioned earlier, and in particular to indicate the supply position of the industry. It is not intended as a matter which should influence the granting of permission.  Of course, I am sure there will be no statutory basis to help in that regard, in having that as a consideration.</P>
    <P>The committee considered the very important matter of compensation.  Of course, in the present climate this is one of the major considerations.  It says:</P>
    <P>Refusal of planning permission can entail a liability for compensation at the development value of land.  This frustrates amenity and open space objectives in development plans.</P>
    <P>The committee felt, however, that there is considerable scope within public policies for supporting the decisions of local authorities as to the proper planning and development of their areas.  Then the report goes on to recommend that subsidies and incentives for housing and industrial development be restricted to development which is in accord with the planning policies of local authorities as indicated in zoning or granting of planning permissions.  This would largely eliminate development value on land which planning authorities do not wish to see developed and significantly reduce compensation liabilities.</P>
    <P>It was the committee's view that, while public policy may not deprive property owners of their entitlements, it is under no obligation to confer entitlements and should not do so where these frustrate other policy objectives.  That is a most important statement.  I also feel that it is not improper for me to say that it is a statement which had the backing of the legal adviser.  On such an important matter, it would have been most important to have that advice.  By and large that is something that should be immediately <Col N="355" /> considered and, indeed, it appears to an ordinary layman that it is very sound advice.  While public policy may not deprive property owners of their entitlements, it is under no obligation to confer entitlements such as would be conferred where people have land beside services and want to develop it and so get a windfall in respect of that land.  Short of that, some amendment or change could be made to the planning regulations to ensure that compensation would not be payable in those cases.  It seems that this is the simplest course to take.  I am sure the Minister will take note of that and has taken it already.</P>
    <P>Regarding compulsory purchase orders the reports says:</P>
    <P>The effective implementation of planning requires that local authorities have effective, speedy and efficient compulsory purchase powers.  Reform and streamlining of the CPO procedures is therefore essential.</P>
    <P>At present they are too cumbersome; they result in long delays and therefore increase costs.  They also require a long time from professionals and from advisers in many areas.</P>
    <P>In the case of market failure there is an inconsistency between the value which may be attributed to an individual parcel of land taken on its own and the aggregate valuation of all parcels taken together. The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Any individual parcel of urban land might be used for office development; all parcels together could not because there would be simply no demand for that quantity of office space.  The present method of assessing compensation for refusal of permission or in the case of compulsory purchase does not take account of this inconsistency.</P>
    <P>This is something to which the Department and the Minister will give great consideration.  It seems very sensible and it is something I referred to earlier.  I believe that the compensation <Col N="356" /> which is payable should be related to the value of the land as determined by the development plan.</P>
    <P>In the past one of the causes of windfall gain for the original land owner was the provision of services, of the infrastructure, by the local authority at the taxpayers' expense.  The committee considered this and said:</P>
    <P>Owners and occupiers of land are at present entitled to connect to public main services.  These rights can conflict with the proper planning and development of an area.</P>
    <P>This can be easily understood where the local authority might have in mind a certain housing development and provide public services on those lines.  A land owner in that immediate area would be entitled to connect to those public services. That seems inconsistent.  The committee have very rightly underlined this by recommending that the right of connection to the public main services be restricted to the development which is in accord with the proper planning and development of the area.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about development levies and contributions and said that they should be unified, but that there is a place for them.  The committee were critical of the way in which development levies have been implemented up to now in an arbitrary way and which varies from one local authority to another with the unfortunate practical result that, because of the high levies in the Dublin area, people have been driven out to the adjoining counties, as the levies there are less or non-existent.  This has created grave problems, not alone with pollution but with regard to the cost of land in those areas.  The committee recommended:</P>
    <P>that local authorities be required to publish the basis of assessing levies and contributions.  The Minister for the Environment should ensure that consistent and appropriate procedures are followed in establishing levies</P>
    <P>that changes in levies be notified well in advance of implementation</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> that levies should not amount to a tax on development</P>
    <P>that standard levies be utilised as much as possible ... Variable conditions attaching to planning permissions, which affect development costs, should only arise in exceptional circumstances</P>
    <P>that the seven year limitation on admissible costs, for the purposes of assessing levies and contributions be removed.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to consider planning and the market and says:</P>
    <P>A range of problems arise at the interface between the planning and market systems.  In some cases these can have a significant impact on the cost or viability of proposed development. Consideration then of this particular aspect and the recommendations which the committee made are as follows:</P>
    <P>that the Minister for the Environment undertake an examination of land availability to ascertain whether organisational changes within the planning system or an independent body, such as a land authority, would provide the most effective policy response</P>
    <P>that the planning criteria adopted by different planning authorities be mutually consistent where the authorities' areas are part of a wider development region.</P>
    <P>This, of course, may be helped to some considerable extent when, as I said, the development regions will become more effective because they cover larger areas. The whole country will be covered by live development regions.  The report also recommends:</P>
    <P>that the use of compulsory purchase procedures to assist in site assembly by private or partnership public/private development be encouraged</P>
    <P>that the advice and guidelines issued <Col N="358" /> by the Minister for the Environment be adopted by local authorities</P>
    <P>that local authorities ensure that all of their activities connected with development are fully in line with the development plan.</P>
    <P>With regard to the last point, I do not think there is any implied criticism of local authorities or planning authorities in this respect.  It emphasises the importance of the development plan.</P>
    <P>With regard to equity, this is concerned with the distribution of benefits from increases in land values and, as I have said before, the important aspect is that the community would benefit from the increases in land value.  The report states:</P>
    <P>The Committee's primary concern is with the question of windfall gain in building land transactions.  This question is often concerned with proposals for reducing land prices, but in the committee's view these are largely separate issues.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with that before.  The committee goes on to give their views in relation to the distribution of gains and that these should be based on three important principles.  The first one is the right to recover the community's own contribution in the provision of services.  That is a basic right and is most important.  I cannot see any reason why that should not be implemented straight away.  The second principle is the need to eliminate distortions and pressures arising from windfall gains which are contrary to optimum development; and third is the need to ensure public acceptance that the distribution of realised gains is fair and reasonable.  This the committee say &ldquo;should take account of the fact that the overall operation of the planning system influences which landowners will benefit from development, and recognise that windfall gain is concentrated, in some cases, on a relatively small number of landowners&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We had a situation in the seventies and previously where the speculator was the person who possibly got most of the <Col N="359" /> benefit, the person who did nothing, perhaps bought the land, applied for planning permission and reaped the benefits. Nobody would take serious objection to a developer who would make a profit because that is his motive in doing it, but the speculator was the person who did little and, in many cases, made most.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recoupment for the community of gains from increases in land values, in relation to the first two principles which I mentioned, the committee were of the view that development levies are the appropriate method for recovering costs of services.  Services are costly.  It is comparatively easy to calculate the actual costs and it does seem a simple method of recovering costs of the services.  The committee recommended:</P>
    <P>that the recommendations made in regard to compensation and compulsory purchase, and other recommendations, will substantially reduce distortions and pressures related to windfall gain</P>
    <P>&mdash;which is one of the primary reasons for setting up this report.</P>
    <P>With regard to the value and the importance of a proper social policy, the committee dealt with the speculative situation where a local authority would have to pay £100,000 for an acre of urban building land and another authority which would own a similar site worth £100,000 and the different problems they would have.  It may be possible to devise a scheme which would enable the first authority to acquire the site at substantially less than its market value.  But, having done so, there is another question facing each authority: whether it is desirable to build houses on land without market price.  There is a cost involved which could be measured by the number of extra houses which could be built on lower valued land if the site was sold. Longer waiting times for some prospective tenants are part of the cost of proceeding with the inner urban scheme. There are also benefits to society in general and to individual tenants for urban renewal and more central location.  It is <Col N="360" /> up to each authority to balance the benefits and the cost involved, but it is important that they be known and taken into account in such decisions.</P>
    <P>It is very easy on a grand scale to come to a conclusion with regard to housing and planning that most houses are built and properly serviced in urban situations. Comparing the situation with isolated houses in rural areas and urban development, if we take the cost of the infrastructure for a one-off rural house we have to consider the cost of providing telephone facilities, the cost of roads and the cost of many other issues, perhaps providing free travel to schools, and we work out a certain figure.  If we consider 50 houses together, of course, the cost works out so much less because providing the infrastructure for 50 houses is much simpler than it is for one.  Therefore, if we are to have that kind of comparison it is very hard to make a case for the one-off house.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as I have said before, taking into consideration the time somebody has to wait, the stress which is caused, the problems of crime and use of drugs, air pollution which at present is very serious, it is not so simple.  It is rather a complicated problem and, therefore, to make the decision whether to build in the inner city area a small number of houses or, with the same money, to build outside the urban area a larger number of houses and displace all those people, interfere with their culture and way of life, put all those stresses on them &mdash; all that comes under the heading of social engineering and, of course, as I said before, the implementation of a housing policy is an integral part of social engineering.  The committee did not go into the pros and cons because it was not part of their remit, but the way they spell it out here is interesting and it is worthwhile putting emphasis on it in passing.</P>
    <P>To control the price of building land would mean a transfer of wealth and, if wealth is transferred to households not requiring assistance, then there is less available for those in need.  Similarly, in the case of local authorities, there are alternatives to new building.  These include encouraging vacancies in their <Col N="361" /> existing stock, purchase of secondhand houses or refurbishing rundown buildings. I complimented the Minister and the Department of the Environment on their 1985 reconstruction grants scheme. We should remember that throughout the country there are many vacant houses which the owners will not be tempted to refurbish even with the attractive grant scheme that has been implemented.</P>
    <P>The Government have played a part in taking the pressure off the requirement of sites for new houses but there is still a considerable number of rundown houses that could be restored.  In my own area I know of many which could be made suitable for people who are looking for houses.  Indeed, in Kells we have a serious problem because so many people have applied for houses, have waited a number of years and still cannot get houses. Although we are making good strides, there is always the list that cannot be dealt with and many deserving cases are left out which should not be left out. In general, the committee felt from the information they got that between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the cost of a house ended up in the State's pocket in one way or another.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude with a comparison of costs and charges arising in housing and building land development on the lines of information we got in the committee. It brings in a few important aspects and I will complete my contribution with this.  The comparison is a provisional one.  Unless there is some unusual development, the situation will be the same for some considerable time to come.  We were given two examples which outlined the land and building costs associated with housing development from &ldquo;raw&rdquo; land to completed house. Costs arising from arranging mortgage and finance were not included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This information was provided by An Foras Forbartha on 6 December 1983 by the technical adviser, <Col N="362" /> Mr. Bob Jennings.  The first example is a straightforward case in that the prospective house owner purchases a site directly from a farmer and contracts all the building and development work to a builder. This would apply to about half of all the new private housing which, in effect, means all the single one-off houses which is a very considerable number.</P>
      <P>The second example is a fairly simple example of the situation which applies to speculative house building and would be representative of the main urban certres. In this case it is assumed that the builder purchases an undeveloped ten-acre parcel of land from a property company. A large number of variations are possible on either example.  We got copious notes about these.  I will not mention any of them as it would complicate the issue. Each example is based on a house purchaser with access to £40,000 finance. This is to illustrate the workings of the market for housing and for land.  The general level of house prices is determined by the type of purchaser active in the market and the amount of finance to which the purchasers have access.  The cost of house building and other charges arising will determine what the purchaser gets for £40,000, that is, the type of house, size, accommodation and location of the house.</P>
      <P>In other words, if most of the purchasers who are active in the market are trading up, then the typical house traded will be four-bedroomed or larger in a reasonably &ldquo;select&rdquo; location.  This was the case in 1978-79.  Conversely, if most purchasers are first time house owners the typical house will be three-bedroomed on the urban fringe, a situation which prevails at present, and the average price of new houses would reflect this.  The examples show that for the same amount of money a single one-off house provides more in terms of accommodation and plot size than the speculatively built house.  There must be a moral there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha surveys of new private house building confirm that one-off houses are typically larger than estate houses, and from my own experiece I would say in all respects better, including <Col N="363" /> the construction and the materials used. Apart from difference in transaction costs, fees and other charges the house builder working on contract can provide for a lower profit margin than the speculative builder since the latter must allow for risk.  In a buoyant market, a speculative builder may realise the full profit, but in poor market conditions it may be wiped out altogether by extra interest payments. Plot sizes are larger in single one-off houses because building and land prices per acre are lower in county towns and rural areas than they are in urban areas.  In the examples we have used a price of £5,000 plus expenses for an undeveloped site.  For estate houses this is based on the An Foras Forbartha study &ldquo;Land Transactions and Prices in the Dublin area.&rdquo; No data were available on site prices for single one-off houses and, in any event, these vary very much.  It is understood that a figure of £5,000 is reasonably typical.</P>
    <P>The differences in plot size illustrate that where building land values differ, these differences do not necessarily carry through to house prices.  Unless there are restrictions on building densities, it is more likely that plot sizes will adjust to leave the site prices unchanged by building more houses.  Unlike all the other costs, the market value of undeveloped land is not the result of any productive effort on the part of the property owner. Under existing legislation, two types of tax liability will arise in respect of land transactions shown in the second example. The property company is subject to corporation tax on its profits &mdash; land is its stock in trade &mdash; and the original landowner will be liable for capital gains tax. In contrast, the seller of a site for a single one-off house is unlikely to be subject to tax.</P>
    <P>It should be emphasised that although the property owner requires a substantial gain from sale of the land, he does not create the value of the land.  The market value is determined by demand and by the amount supplied by other owners. It is interesting to see from those two examples that in the case of a private, <Col N="364" /> single, one-off house the State receipts amount to £8,415 and for the private estate house built by the speculative builder, at 80 houses per ten acres, the State receipts would amount to £11,700. This puts the situation into perspective.</P>
    <P>Finally, this was a hard-working and dedicated committee.  They produced a very important report.  It will be taken as the bible in this area for many years to come in the same way as the Kenny report was for such a long period.  The Kenny report made an important contribution in many ways but the questions we considered were different questions entirely.  I hope the Minister for the Environment will consider carefully all the recommendations made.  Because no constitutional question is involved, because many of the recommendations can be incorporated by simple amending legislation or by regulations or statutory instruments of some kind and, indeed, also because many of the recommendations would not involve any large amounts of money on the part of the State but in effect would result in bringing in more money to the State, I hope the Minister for the Environment will incorporate all these recommendations as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir.  I should like to start by echoing a point made by Senator Fitzsimons a few times during the course of his contribution to this debate.  That relates to the fact that the report of the Joint Committee on Building Land is not only a comprehensive publication but one which will be <Col N="365" /> treated through time as an extraordinarily important record in relation to an area of some considerable controversy in this country of late.  That is not to suggest that the controversy relating to the price of building land is particularly topical just now.  The market has seen changes in the demand for building land.  That has not meant that the pressure on vendors to sell and purchasers to buy has not been what it was five years ago.  Nonetheless, markets of their nature fluctuate and no doubt in the foreseeable future that position will change again.  To that extent it is important that this House and the other House in due course consider this report and the implications of it and also the very many heavy recommendations that have been made in the report, many of which have been referred to in a positive manner by the Minister here today.</P>
      <P>I should say at this stage that I was not a member of the committee and thus perhaps I am not as <i>au fait</i> with the report as the Senator who has just spoken or, indeed, as are a number of other Senators who were intimately involved in its preparation. However, I have a certain professional background in the auctioneering world.  I am the Seanad nominee of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute and I am also somebody who, through a period of approximately 12 years on a local authority, has seen the other side of the coin, or another part of the total picture relating to the position on land and land purchase and the availability of land.</P>
      <P>There are three distinct categories of sale of land which merit our attention. Every so often in the well established residential areas of our cities and towns we find parcels of land coming on the market.  Very often in a period of high boom in the building industry these reach prices that are a surprise to those participating in the auction and to the wider informed public in relation to the price achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say also that these individual small parcels of land which might be five acres, or perhaps up to ten or 15 acres, generally speaking, seem to be priced by the market place at a level which reflects <Col N="366" /> the price of the completed house when the exercise is complete.  I do not think that the concern of the Joint Committee on Building Land nor my concern should be in that particular area as it seems to cater for itself through market forces.  On the other hand, there is the sale of much larger tracts of land in greenbelt areas and areas that are perhaps changing from a former agricultural use into the developing of a town or city.</P>
    <P>There is a third category which I will come to a little later.  That relates to the methodology of the CPO procedures relating to the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, as it now operates in modern times. There are many frustrations in that Act. Its cumbersome procedures are long. Often as long as eight to ten years are involved in the process and obviously progress will have to be made.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that a Bill to deal with this matter is now in course of preparation which he hopes to bring to the Oireachtas in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with the servicing of land or the sale of land which is about to be serviced or has been serviced in the newly developed areas in the outskirts of cities and towns relates to the programme on servicing we have experienced in this State in the past ten or 15 years.  It is fair comment at this point to say that I have the view, and it is a considered view and I think very widely held, that the zoning objectives in the city or county development plans &mdash; and I think it particularly relates to the counties rather than to the cities &mdash; lead to much premature zoning. The city of Dublin is already largely a developed area and thus the chances and opportunities given to members of the local authority of which I am a member, Dublin Corporation, for the rezoning of land is minimal.  This occurs frequently also in the counties and in Dublin County Council, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow in particular.</P>
    <P>Land is zoned for a five year development plan which in no way reflects the extent to which that local authority are able in the five years to see through the <Col N="367" /> development of water and sewerage facilities, road development and so on.  That acts to some extent to create an unreal value for some parcels of land.  These parcels of land can be big or small depending on the attitudes taken by the market place and they do not assist in controlling the development of land which is not serviced and where in due course the new owner may recoup the value of servicing.</P>
    <P>On the question of the servicing of building land, which is very central to the whole issue of the control of building land, we have enough land zoned but not too much.  There must be a balance there. As I have said, there has been, to some extent, a premature zoning of land in certain areas but it is important that we have the land that is zoned serviced as far as possible by the local authorities and properly funded by the State to ensure that it does not contribute to the cost of pieces of land that may come on the market.  One of the greatest contributory causes of the escalation in the price of land is the likelihood in a short time and the risks that are taken by people in relation to the servicing of land which may not be necessary in some circumstances. In chapter 3.30 of the report there is this observation:</P>
    <P>It seems there were severe deficiencies in the supply of serviced land in the early seventies and that the level of investment at that time was too low. The Kenny (majority and minority) Reports both emphasised the &ldquo;inadequate investment in the sanitary services programme in the 1960s... which was not sufficient to meet increased demands for serviced land for housing, industry and other purposes&rdquo; and also the &ldquo;existing deficiencies in infrastructure, especially in Dublin&rdquo;.  This was the general tenor of many of the submissions to the Kenny Committee and reflects anxiety about the adequacy of provision and the possibility that existing facilities would become overloaded.</P>
    <P>It is on the record, in the course of this <Col N="368" /> report, that investment in sanitary services in 1983 was four times what it was in the early seventies.  The importance of advance servicing has been recognised as one part of the State's contribution to holding the value of land rather than allowing it to accelerate to the extent it had been doing historically due to a great deal of the market attempting to take advantage of what was seen as a good buy, with poor knowledge of the likely indications of servicing.</P>
    <P>Chapter 3.32 reads:</P>
    <P>Sanitary services investment peaked in 1976 and fell back until 1978.  It doubled between then and 1983.  Since housing completions in the later seventies have not grown as rapidly and given the diversion of demand into privately serviced land, it is likely that the supply of serviced land is now on a much improved footing compared with the early seventies, at least where water and sewerage are concerned.</P>
    <P>I wanted to make that point initially &mdash; that I saw the market place, to some extent being given an impetus for the sale of land at prices beyond what would normally be the case due to the inadequacy of servicing and due particularly to the premature zoning that was taking place.</P>
    <P>One of the important recommendations in this report and which could contribute to a great deal more sensible behaviour by the market, is the one on page xi which reads:</P>
    <P>That larger local authorities be required to publish an annual Development Report.  This report should include, <i>inter alia</i> a review of the position on serviced building land, land transactions and prices ... that details of all transactions of the building land be notifiable to local authorities... that planning permission include a proposed development time scale.  This is intended to assist in the preparation of the Development report...</P>
    <P>All this kind of information could be extremely valuable in working to attempt a much more considered approach to the <Col N="369" /> issue of building land and to a much more real atmosphere in the market-place.</P>
    <P>The issue is, on the one hand, the question of the supply of land serviced in the outlying areas of our cities and towns while on the other hand we have to deal with the procedures for compulsory purchase so outdated, as I described in an earlier part of my contribution.</P>
    <P>On page 152 of the report we have the principal Rule No. 2 relating to the value of land.  This reads:</P>
    <P>The value of the land shall, subject as is hereafter provided, be taken to be the amount which the land as sold in the open market by a willing seller might be expected to realise; provided always that the arbitrator shall be entitled to consider all returns and assessments of capital value for taxation made or acquiesced in by the claimant.</P>
    <P>The Rule continues, as quoted in the report:</P>
    <P>The compensation must be determined, therefore, by reference to the price which a willing vendor might reasonably expect to obtain from a willing purchaser.  The disinclination of the vendor to part with his land and the urgent necessity of the purchaser to buy must alike be disregarded.  Neither must be regarded as acting under compulsion.</P>
    <P>In the course of some of the recommendations in the report we are considering today a number of points made relating to the area of compulsory acquisition.  It seems to me that in this area, there is some little misunderstanding of the role of the arbitrator in handling a decision in relation to a proposal to purchase compulsorily. The recommendation in the report, page xv, is that:</P>
    <P>any development value attributed to land must be established by reference to specified development which would be completed within a reasonable time scale and for which a market demand has been established...</P>
    <P>The recommendation continues:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> That other transaction prices adduced for comparability purposes be admissible only where they are shown to be related to similar development and provided there is no evidence that such prices are distorted.</P>
    <P>The important area to advance here is the area which was mentioned in the Minister's speech.  It requires a great deal of action by the Department of the Environment in the foreseeable future, that is, to have a situation where the whole question of advancing the period of acquisition is pursued.  Chapter 7.37 reads:</P>
    <P>Compulsory purchase procedures are cumbersome and slow.  An order may take between five and eight years to complete and the process is very open to delay by legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in this area are particularly worthy of attention.  They suggest that specific time limits at the various stages of making a CPO could be looked at.  Chapter 7.39 reads:</P>
    <P>The statutory authority allowing a local authority to enter on or gain possession of land can often cause delays and consideration could be given to tightening up the law to enable a local authority to enter on land to do surveys, etc. and to gain possession of land with the minimum amount of delay.</P>
    <P>In tandem with that is the need to move ahead in the general consolidation of the law.  The whole speeding up of the process is an essential element in what we are dealing with here.  I am inclined to think that the first section relating to the completion of a development within a reasonable time scale may itself act as a deterrent, add uncertainty and delay movements in the availability of land in areas where servicing has already been provided.  I would suggest hesitancy in that area while being totally in support of the need to modernise the legislation and give the public authority the possibilities of advancing the purchase in a much shorter and more practicable way <Col N="371" /> towards ensuring that important policy objectives in our cities and towns are seen to be fulfilled much faster than is possible at present.</P>
    <P>One of the areas to which this report directs itself is the question of how we deal with the community investment in building land, particularly on the outskirts of our cities and towns where new servicing is being provided.  I accept that some arrangement would have to be made to recoup part of the investment by the State by way of development levies and capital gains.  I notice that the Minister referred to this and presumably we will be hearing more relating to that subject and the concern there is in the community about the area of windfall gains.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of what I intended to say and would like to conclude by saying that the important objective as I see it, in the immediate future, is to attempt to ensure that local authorities do not engage in as much premature zoning as they have been doing and that the recommendations in this report are seen as being of some considerable significance, by way of the production of an annual report by the major local authorities on servicing intentions and the planning stage which has arrived in relation to areas where development is occurring. The report should help also in speeding up the area of compulsory purchase to make it more practical and to make the legislation of a kind that is modern in content and is of a type that will be approached with a great deal more likelihood of gaining results within a relatively short time.  I hope the expected legislation from the Minister in relation to compulsory purchase will be tabled as early as possible.  All those engaged in the production of this report should be congratulated on the way in which they have contributed to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the committee who produced this report I am pleased to speak briefly on it in the Seanad.  I welcome the report.  It was long <Col N="372" /> in gestation but I hope its recommendations will be implemented and that they will receive serious consideration in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  We all remember a previous report which dealt with issues of building land.  I refer, of course, to the Kenny report.  That was hotly debated when it was published.  In many aspects it is now very dated.  It certainly did not have any legislative follow-through.  It has been largely relegated.  It is my earnest hope that the same fate will not await this report which was worked on with great dedication by those people who were on the all-party committee.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the chairman of that committee, Deputy Bobby Molloy, for his dedication and enthusiasm for this subject and for the gracious way in which he handled meetings and for all that he contributed to them.  I would like also to pay my own tribute to the clerk of that committee, Ms. Pat Ryan, who was extremely conscientious in all her duties.  The life of the committee was extended on at least two occasions. That meant that the work she had originally decided to do had a longer life than was expected so that a great tribute is due to her for her dedication.  We had a superb technical adviser, Mr. Jennings, from An Foras Forbartha.  He was extremely generous with his skill and expertise and in the latter time of the committee he spent hours teasing out the arguments in the various areas we had to consider.  His advice and expertise were invaluable to the committee.  The report bears the stamp of much of the input which came from that source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that we all have a clear understanding that this report deals with a sensitive and, constitutionally, a key issue for Irish people.  Essentially it boils down to being about the ownership of private property.  I believe that man has a right to the ownership of private property but like all rights it is not an entirely absolute one because that right is secondary to the common good.  We have to recognise that property and the ownership of it, particularly land, has a social dimension.  The ownership of land whether by an individual, a company or <Col N="373" /> the State is infused with a certain burden of stewardship.  Its use therefore must always be considered in the broad context of the common good of all the citizens of the land.</P>
    <P>Members of the committee bore this very much in mind during their deliberations on this key issue.  In the sixties and seventies the whole question of the ownership of land was more of a burning issue than it is now because the economic recession has had its effect on this area as it has had on so many areas of public life in this State.  The building industry is in what might be kindly described as something of a dormant situation.  Therefore, the supply of land and the turnover of land is markedly slow.  This whole issue has been on the backburner.  In a way that is a good climate within which to discuss the report of the committee because it means that people can be relatively detached from the issue and discuss it calmly and rationally.  At the moment we are not bedevilled by a rash of zonings and rezonings in local authority areas. The picture is very changed from that which obtained in the sixties and seventies. This is a good time, then, to be calm and rational and to discuss this whole issue of building land in that kind of climate.</P>
    <P>At the outset it is important to state the terms of reference of the committee. It was a broad brief, even within the parameters.  It was charged to consider and make recommendations regarding possible legislative and other measures to deal, in the interests of the common good, with the supply and cost of building land, including land within and adjacent to urban areas, having regard in particular to the Constitution and judgments of the Superior Courts in regard to the relevant Articles thereof; the Report of the Committee on the Price of Building Land; tax legislation in relation to profits or gains from dealings in, disposals of, or development of, land; the operation of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963-82 and the Local Government (Building Land) Bill, 1982.  It was also charged to report on the merits and demerits of any measures <Col N="374" /> considered, with particular reference to their constitutionality, legal and administrative practicality, financial and economic implications and likely effects on the cost of housing and of other forms of development.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee were given powers to send for persons, papers and records and to conduct hearings with experts on all aspects of this matter.  The committee did that.  There is a valuable appendix in relation to all the various submissions that were made to the committee. It is true to say that concern with the supply and cost of building land was a recurrent feature of Irish life in the seventies and, indeed, in earlier decades. In the early seventies, given economic buoyancy, building land prices were increasing rapidly.  This, of course, led to the establishment of the Kenny report, which I have spoken of earlier and which, sadly, has more or less been allowed to languish.  It reported in 1973 when speculative building and land purchasing were at their height.  It was the very first broadly-based assessment of this whole issue of building land and of the many ancillary problems connected with it.  It occasioned wide debate throughout the length and breadth of the country.  It is true to say that the Government of the day accepted in principle the basic approach and thrust of the Kenny report.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of Parliamentary debate at the time and the difficulty seemed to rest on the constitutionality and, indeed, the scope of some of the recommendations at the time.  Questions were asked as to whether or not they were practicable.  The approach being adopted was also questioned.  The members of this committee bore all that in mind.  In addressing the problems they re-examined the whole issue in the light of the difficulties which had been raised in the Kenny report.  In the late seventies also, there was a rash of rapidly increasing land prices.  It was that that prompted the establishment of this committee to consider the matter.  The terms of reference that this committee was given differed from those of the Kenny <Col N="375" /> committee.  In the Kenny committee members were asked to consider a particular issue connected with building land.  The terms of reference of this Joint Committee, whose report we are discussing today, permitted a wider approach to an evaluation of all issues connected with the supply of land and the cost of land.  It was, in a way, a reflection of the wider appreciation which has grown up with the passage of time, and an awareness of the range and complexity of the issues which are connected with building land.</P>
    <P>Many submissions were received by the committee from interested parties. From my work on another committee and, indeed, with reference to a motion which we passed here this morning allowing the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries to bring in people and hear oral evidence, I would like to state that it is extremely important that the citizens of this State have the widest possible access to Parliament and to Parliamentary committees.  The establishment of all party committees and the invitation to make submissions is part of this access of citizens to Parliament and its offshoots.  It is interesting to note that in all committees &mdash; and this one on building land is no exception &mdash; when submissions are invited and when people are requested to make an input they are only too pleased to do so.</P>
    <P>I certainly feel from this report that the views given to the committee in the submissions are very much reflected in the report and that this was not a token exercise.  It actually means that the views of the people and their consensus opinion has found its way into the report and as such adds weight and value to the report. It is important to put that on record because there is a lot of cynicism abroad about Parliament, about its committees and about relationships between public representatives and the public.  Certainly in my experience, albeit limited, on committees and in this House, I have found a great willingness on the part of the public, and a great ability to be receptive on the part of public representatives, <Col N="376" /> when views are sought and where at all possible they are incorporated into findings and reports.</P>
    <P>Certainly as a member of this committee I would like to place on record my thanks and appreciation to all those people who sent in submissions and involved themselves so willingly and so wholeheartedly with the work of the committee.</P>
    <P>The submissions reflect a wide range of issues connected with the question of building land.  It is not that everybody felt the same about things; of course they did not.  The differences &mdash; and the sharp differences at times &mdash; and the complexities of the issues certainly surfaced in the submissions and the various problems were identified and well and truly argued. The main concern of the committee, of course, was the supply and the cost of building land.</P>
    <P>Certainly the bulk of the report deals with this whole matter.  It would simplify things if one would group the issues under four headings.  The committee endeavoured to ensure that it discussed the best use of building land.  Again, the supply and the cost of building land and the distribution of gains from increases in land values took up much of our time.  We also discussed and deliberated on related policy issues.  The underlying issues are important and should certainly be considered very carefully by anybody who is giving some thought to this whole area. Land is a most valuable resource.  It is a resource of the community in which we live and it has also given us our philosophy of private ownership.  It is a resource of the individual.</P>
    <P>The effects of individual decisions on land use often outlive the individual interest. In many cases they are irreversible. This is why they must be approached always with all seriousness.  If a parcel of land is at one stage used for a particular purpose it usually means that it is never used for an alternative purpose again.  In urban areas a decision to use land, for example for a shopping area, can influence the whole urban structure because it affects the land use of adjacent parcels of land.  This is why in urban areas it is <Col N="377" /> such a vexatious issue and why people care so very much about it.</P>
    <P>In smaller towns we have all seen the blight of ribbon development, leading into and out of our towns and villages. This means that our access to towns is very often less than it should be.  There is a certain restriction then on the possibilities of options for development in and around the access to towns.  Communities have a fundamental interest in keeping an eye on what is happening in their areas and ensuring that the use to which land is put is the best possible and that the interests of the community as a whole are upheld in any scenario.  Indeed, from my experience on a local authority, I know that issues of planning and zoning, and sometimes rezoning, are the ones that really raise the blood pressure.  It is on occasions like that one really can generate much public interest in the deliberations and decisions of local councils.  It behoves every citizen to keep a watching brief on planning permissions and decisions that are made by councils.</P>
    <P>I also feel that concerned citizens in our counties and towns should all know what is in the county or, indeed, the city or town development plan.  There should be more civic-minded people who would concern themselves with this.  Of course, there are others who would rather keep all of those decisions very much under wraps and that is not healthy or good and it should not be so.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject I would certainly like to see some changes about the placing of notices for planning permissions. There is something reprehensible and sneaky about the facility which allows people to place their notice very often in papers which have a less than significant circulation in an area and to place their applications for planning permission in these deliberately.  Very often people who have no great love or enthusiasm for our native language are only too happy to put their planning applications in that language in newspapers of minority circulation.  That is to be roundly condemned and I do hope at some stage somebody will address themselves to that particular difficulty.</P>

      <P>I know they can, but the legislation at present allows that to be so and the local authority very often does not make difficulties for people because they are acting within the framework of existing legislation.</P>
      <P>I hope that I have stressed so far that the importance of using land properly is one that underlined all the thinking of the committee.  This whole business of the use of land on the urban periphery or land contiguous to towns is a very significant one because what we have is a situation of continuing urban sprawl in many of our towns and cities.  Consistent with that then is a growing dereliction of inner cities, and with that comes a growth in crime and vandalism and all the attendant evils which naturally and rightly we all deplore.</P>
      <P>When cities and towns are making their development plans they should perhaps take a leaf from Waterford, the local authority on which I sit in Waterford city, where there is a very vigorous programme of inner city renewal.  It is most harmonious and most pleasing and has given enormous satisfaction to people.  The same thing is happening here in Dublin.  People are rightly angered when the heart is seen to be torn out of a living, vibrant community and when families are settled on the periphery, miles from areas that they knew and loved and where their families have lived for generations.  This all forms part of the thrust of a committee on building land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that while the proper use and allocation of land are important for community welfare, the committee had to investigate issues which ranged far outside that aspect.  Local authorities and planning systems were examined by the committee.  I am interested to see the amendments which at least one other member of the committee put down.  It will be useful to see that argument conducted in the Seanad, because the committee did not have a specific cut-off <Col N="379" /> point.  They examined as widely and as broadly as possible the whole role of land and its use by the citizens.</P>
    <P>The basis of land value is something we should emphasise.  The committee decided that it was the benefit which the community as individual groups or collectively would obtain from the use of the land.  The value of most land in the country is related only to its potential for agriculture.  Development land differs because it has a variety of other uses.  This is what gives rise to the large difference in land values.  Land values, if they are properly determined, are fundamental to ensuring the best use of land.  This is the bench mark against which the committee considered the issues and against which it identified the problems and made its recommendations.  The whole role of land values is implicit in much of the debate which has taken place on building land, but it is seldom addressed directly.  As a result it is very often overlooked. The committee were determined in their work not to do this, and so much of the thrust of the report relates to land values.</P>
    <P>I would now like to speak on how land use is currently decided.  The planning system which we have and the market forces play a part in deciding how land is actually used.  There are relative degrees of influence of both of these.  It is dictated to some extent by private ownership of property, that is, the private ownership of property as interpreted under the Constitution. Indeed, we have got to remember in all discussions on land and land use that Ireland is a market economy. A freely-operating land market cannot achieve the best use of land because the interests engaged in the market do not take account of costs and benefits to the community at large.  That is why we need a planning system.  It is necessary to ensure orderly development and for the community interest to act as a check or a balance against individual interests represented in the market place.  By and large, we have a good planning system in this country and the checks and balances work very well.  From time to time local <Col N="380" /> authorities feel aggrieved when An Bord Pleanála, which is the highest arbiter, overturns the decisions of local authorities. Nevertheless, it is useful and important to have that body in place.  It is part of the checks, balances and brakes within the planning system.  It has a very useful role and function to play.</P>
    <P>Each local authority have a duty &mdash; and carry it out effectively &mdash; of preparing, reviewing, and updating their own development plans.  Usually, they are quite free in doing this.  They deliberate carefully. They take their time about it. Members, generally speaking, address themselves to it with all seriousness.  They are perfectly entitled to adopt their own criteria in relation to the type and the mix and the density of development permitted. They are also allowed decide on what locations development should take place. It is very important for the members of county councils, borough councils and corporations to be allowed to do this in all seriousness and with a great deal of concern.  The whole business of bringing out the development plan is a complex one and it is important to balance the benefits of developments against the costs.</P>
    <P>Many things have to be taken into account.  In an ideal situation communities, through the planning system, would decide that certain patterns of land use are in their own best interests and, through zoning, a provision of services and acquisition where it is necessary, and other measures, would ensure that land is used accordingly.  Therefore, the development plan and the actions of the local authority would reflect the community's actual view on land and land values.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are problems in this. Planning has a difficulty in that very often it has to do some crystal-ball gazing.  It has to anticipate the amount of land likely to be required for development because, of course, the function of the local authority is to ensure that the servicing is put in place.  This impinges directly on the value of the land.  Development pressures which give rise to the demand for land are usually outside the control of any individual authority.  There may be a situation where too much land is zoned for <Col N="381" /> one particular purpose or, conversely, where too little land is zoned and, indeed, serviced.  Then there is poor use of resources or undue pressure on land prices.  These are difficulties which must be addressed.  They also stress the necessity of having highly qualified technical competence available to people in local authorities.</P>
    <P>I will conclude my remarks on this subject by saying that the whole report is worthy of very serious consideration in this House and, indeed, in the Dail.  I certainly hope that the legislative changes which the committee have identified and which are clearly seen to be necessary will be implemented speedily, because this whole area has remained something of a Cinderella, legislatively speaking.  It has not been addressed promptly by the Legislature.  This is a good time to do it when the pressure is off land by and large, as I said at the outset of my remarks.  It is a time when feeling is not running high on the issue.  That type of back-drop is always useful when it comes to making hard decisions.  I hope this report will not suffer the same fate as the Kenny report and merely be something which allows people to ventilate their views, prejudices or concerns without any specific legislative follow-through.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the three Senators who made contributions to this important debate.  I would have expected a larger number to be contributing on such an important topic, but maybe the weather we are having is preventing them from being here.  Nevertheless, I have taken note of the contributions.  As I stated in my opening remarks, I am in the process of implementing the committee's recommendations in the area of CPO law.  My Department are also examining the other recommendations in the report and when this examination is completed I will bring my proposals to Government for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the report and I thank all the members of the committee and its <Col N="382" /> support staff for producing such a comprehensive analysis of the land problem and making so many valuable recommendations. Senators may be assured that all of these recommendations will be examined in detail in my Department.  Senator Fitzsimons drew particular attention to the recommendations in the report in regard to the assessment of compensation. As I stated in my opening remarks, my Department are undertaking a detailed review of all the legislative provisions in this area and I hope to bring forward in the near future specific legislative proposals to deal with all the compensation issues dealt with in the report, including compensation for land compulsorily acquired and compensation liabilities arising under the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald rightly drew attention to the importance of the provision of infrastructure.  I also recognise its importance and, despite the difficult economic situation, I have maintained the high level of spending on services. As I have already stated, road grants totalling £160 million will be made available to the local authorities this year for road improvements and maintenance. A 4 per cent increase on last year's provision and an increase of 20 per cent on the 1984 provision is reflected in that figure.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Bulbulia for her interesting remarks and assure her that there will be no delay on my part in bringing forward legislative proposals to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are looking at the recommendations.  As soon as the Cabinet have dealt with our memorandum we will be bringing forward proposals this year to deal with the recommendations in the report and, perhap, also taking a look at what was in Kenny and seeing if we can include some of the thoughts and recommendations of that report without offending the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House we will not delay in bringing forward our proposals as soon as we have had very deep deliberations in the Department on the recommendations. I thank the Members for their contributions on what I regard as <Col N="383" /> probably one of the most important questions about which my Department will be concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue of St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea in the light of the recent announcement to close it at the end of 1986.  First of all, I am delighted that the Minister for Health is present.  Senator de Brún and myself are both public representatives who live in the area.  I am delighted the Minister is present to hear our point of view as to why this hospital should not be closed. At the outset, I would like to say that this is a totally unacceptable proposal and I hope in the course of this short submission and strong assertion of mine to show why the hospital should not be closed and I hope to make the point well for its continued operation.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea is incidentally the newest psychiatric hospital in the country.  It was built in 1943. Like most hospitals, it is located in a most pleasant wooded parkland.  It is well away from the local town of Castlerea and the local roads system.  In every way its ambience and location give it a very appropriate setting for such a hospital.  It is probably one of the most appropriate settings for a hospital that one could find anywhere in the country.  This can be seen as part of the therapy of treating people with mental illness.</P>
      <P>At the moment, there are about 233 patients in the hospital.  Through the community care system operated by the hospital and the general admissions, patients who come and go during the year, in those two categories, there are approximately 700 people linked directly or indirectly to or dependent upon this institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Patrick's Hospital, unlike many of our psychiatric institutions, has operated a very enlightened and progressive policy in relation to patient rehabilitation by the medium of community placement. At the moment, there are about <Col N="385" /> 100 patients being looked after in the four day centres and one day hospital operated by St. Patrick's.  The day centres are at Roscommon town, Strokestown, Boyle and Ballaghadereen while the day hospital is located in Castlerea itself.  In addition, there are at least 15 patients who are allowed home to their relatives under a very flexible time arrangement. Some of them may stay for weeks with their relatives.  Some may stay for a day or days or whatever is appropriate.  This is an enlightened approach by the hospital authorities in the way they allow patients the freedom to come and go where they know there is proper relation care, and it is also sensitive to the needs of relations in that it is flexible about the time.  Patients can come back to the hospital at weekends and they can stay several weeks if that is appropriate.</P>
    <P>St. Patrick's was one of the very few hospitals in the country which speedily carried out a full survey of its patient population.  Broadly speaking, this survey arrived at the following conclusions. About 100 of the patients were deemed to be capable of or have a potential to be placed outside the institution in community care.  This, of course, would be a very slow process.  About 33 of the patients are mentally handicapped and they would be better placed in a hospital or in an institution with better facilities for looking after mentally handicapped people.  There was a small number who might be capable of being placed in a conventional geriatric home.  The remainder, well in excess of 100 patients were deemed to be psycho-geriatrics. They would be unsuitable for moving because of their age &mdash; most of them are over 65 years and some are in their eighties &mdash; and because of their identification with the hospital as their home. This is very important.  Those people, because of their long stay in the hospital, have no home within their memory other than St. Patrick's.  Disturbance of these patients would have to be seen as an unacceptable proposal because of the trauma this would bring to these unfortunate people.  One has to be very sensitive, <Col N="386" /> and no doubt the Minister fully recognises this, especially in the way psycho-geriatrics are handled.  They are very vulnerable and naturally very sensitive to the slightest changes in their lives.  Even a small change in their lives can have a deleterious effect on them.</P>
    <P>Of course, we cannot lose sight of the fact either that moving those patients would cause major hardship upon their relations.  As I say, many of these people are old; their relatives are also old, and it is often with great difficulty that they can get, I may say infrequently, to Castlerea to visit them.  If they were to be moved to Ballinasloe or Castlebar, both towns are at least 40 miles away and for most relatives that would impose that extra distance in terms of travelling to see them.  I would submit to the Minister that this would be a totally unacceptable imposition and hardship both on relatives and on the patients themselves from the relative/patient point of view.</P>
    <P>I should like to go back to the more general and particular reasons that are germane in my argument for keeping this hospital open.  To say that the hospital population fell from 388 in 1971 to 215 now and to use this as a good reason to close it, is in my opinion, spurious.  All mental hospitals in that decade and a half had the same experience of a falling population because of the move away towards community placement and so on. The number of people and patients linked to and dependent upon this hospital is greater now than it was in 1971 because the catchment area in which St. Patrick's Hospital operates has a population of about 48,000 people in it.  This area has the highest incidence of mental illness found anywhere in the country, and, many experts say, anywhere in Europe as has been proved in a number of surveys.  If we had total figures, it might be one of the worst black spots for mental illness in the whole world.  We do not know.  It is a significant statistic.  It is a significant fact that this hospital is located in an area with this particular unfortunate statistic about it.  That is a high incidence of psychiatric illness.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking in laudatory <Col N="387" /> terms about the back-up service which Castlerea has operated but, of course, I have been speaking relatively.  It is very good when compared with the community back-up service operated out of other psychiatric institutions in the country. The fact is that the community care services out of this hospital are, like everywhere, greatly underdeveloped and in many cases inadequate.  For that reason the closure of the hospital could not be contemplated or cannot be contemplated until a proper community care service is built up with buildings, properly trained staff, transport and all that that entails.  That would take not months but at least years.</P>
    <P>Let me look at the four centres which operate from St. Patrick's.  The centres at Strokestown and Ballaghadereen are about adequate for what they have to do. The numbers that have been placed in them are relatively small as yet but they are just about adequate.  They leave a lot to be desired but they would be, in the general description, about adequate. The centre at Boyle is regarded as being barely adequate.  There is a new centre at Roscommon which many people believe and, indeed, I would agree, is not adequate or suitable.  It is the old gate lodge of the county home in Roscommon. It is in the wrong location.  This has been reconstructed but it is not the right kind of centre because there should have been a suitable new building in a much better location provided in Roscommon town.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to suggest that I am talking about St. Patrick's Hospital, and the day centre at Roscommon is a spoke, if you like, going out from the hub of St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not being closed but I am talking about the fact that it is inadequate and before you could talk about <Col N="388" /> closing the hospital you would have to provide an adequate service in Roscommon because Roscommon is the largest urban centre in County Roscommon which has a natural drawing effect to a very large proportion of the population of County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>Another interesting fact about St. Patrick's Hospital is that in recent years. out of the capital programme &mdash; I think you call it the small capital programme &mdash; provided by the Department of Health and operated by the Western Health Board for improvements in this and other hospitals there have been several significant improvements carried out in this hospital. In the speech on Tuesday night in the Dáil by the junior Minister the point was made about inadequate toilet facilities and I think inadequate kitchen facilities in St. Patrick's.  That cannot be true because a significant amount of money has been spent in recent years on providing new toilets and new kitchens adjacent to each ward in St. Patrick's. Surely if these things were well planned, they should not be described as unsuitable now.  It is also interesting that recently 300 new windows have been replaced in St. Patrick's, no doubt costing tens of thousands of pounds.  One must surely question the wisdom of spending in recent years sums of money that must have run into at lest six figures on upgrading the hospital from a structural point of view at least and now it is proposed to close it down.  Surely there is great lack of policy and great lack of any kind of foresight in that kind of thinking and certainly in that kind of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a relatively new industrial therapy unit at Castlerea.  That was opened in 1975.  That is also an important part of the service which is offered by St. Patrick's Hospital.  I am aware that I am already more than 15 minutes into my time and I have to allow some time for Senator de Brún.  I have not had time to make all the points I would like to make to the Minister about the matter.  No doubt my colleague will have more to say.  I appeal to the Minister because I see no good case for closing this hospital. <Col N="389" /> It has operated well and efficiently. Granted, it is one of the smaller hospitals in the Western Health Board region but that does not necessarily mean that it should be closed for that reason.  When people talk about its 250 patients and say there is a relationship between the number of patients in the beds in the hospital and the number of staff, that are around one-to-one, it is not a fair comparison because you have to think in terms of the total patient population which is related to, linked to or directly dependent upon St. Patrick's Hospital and that figure is more like 1,000 than 250.  There were about 400 admissions &mdash; people who were coming and going &mdash; in the 1985 to St. Patrick's Hospital.  The amount of manpower that it takes to look after that kind of activity is quite large.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider his proposal in this case very carefully.  There are the economic side effects for the town of Castlerea which I know the Minister for Health is not directly involved in but believe me it is a major economic blow to the community there.  I will not go into it because I am talking to the Minister for Health.  I am making the point purely for good health reasons and good psychiatric health care reasons that the hospital should not be closed.  There is a widespread feeling abroad that this hospital is being closed to allow resources to be released to open the new mentally handicapped centre at Swinford.  I submit to the Minister that that is an unacceptable proposal also.</P>
    <P>Naturally, we want to open the centre at Swinford.  I fully agree that we should move the mentally handicapped patients in Castlerea to a centre like Swinford because it was specially developed and built for that purpose but the long stay patients in Castlerea are entitled to have their hospital there.  The hospital has gone along with modern trends in psychiatric treatment and has evolved along the community care idea.  It has operated a very flexible policy in the way it looks at its patients and in allowing them home and so on.  I hope the Minister's decision is not a final decision.  To close this institution is wrong.  It is not <Col N="390" /> based on the right facts and I sincerely hope that it is not based in any way on any economic fact of having to close one hospital to open another.</P>

      <P>I should like to say, first of all, that I had a gentlemen's agreement with Senator Connor that he would allocate me 50 per cent of his time.  I do not think he has done so but, however, I hope the Cathaoirleach will be lenient with me in my contribution.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to support this motion calling on the Minister for Health and the Government to reverse the decision to close St. Patrick's Psychiatric Hospital in Castlerea.  I need hardly say that the Minister's announcement to close this hospital came as a profound shock to everybody.  The manner in which it was announced was both insensitive and offensive, in my view.  It is inconceivable that any Minister or Government would come to such a far-reaching decision without prior consultation with the various agencies responsible for the administration of the hospital, namely, the Western Health Board, the chief executive officer of that board and the senior psychiatric person at the hospital.  No such consultation took place.  This unilateral action by the Minister is surely without precedent.  It also shows a total disregard for the unfortunate patients, especially patients afflicted with mental illness.</P>
      <P>As one who lives in Castlerea I sincerely assure the Minister and his Government that the patients have not yet recovered from the shock of learning over the airways, that their hospital was to be closed.  Some of them are there for 30 years or more and regard the hospital as their home.  To be told that they are to be transferred to other institutions or even sent to community care must be a traumatic experience.  It is an experience which they will not easily overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three elements inherent in the closure of any hospital.  One, the patients, two, the nursing staff and general <Col N="391" /> workforce and, three, the economic consequences to the community in the environs of that hospital.  Obviously, the most important of these is the well-being of the patients.  What is best for them must be the primary consideration of all.  But the staff and workers also have rights and they must be given serious consideration. They chose mental nursing as a career and have dedicated themselves to caring for the most vulnerable section of our community.</P>
    <P>A closure of the hospital will entail redeployment and disruption of homes established for quite some time.  These are considerations that must be respected and considered.  The economic consequences to Castlerea which would result from the closure of the hospital need not be elaborated on.  It would have a crippling effect on that town.</P>
    <P>There are many cogent reasons why Castlerea Hospital should be retained.  It is a comparatively new hospital, built for psychiatric treatment only 45 years ago. It is a very fine building of cut stone and will bear examination to that effect any day of the week.  The catchment area for which it provides has the highest incidence of mental illness and schizophrenia in Europe.  A varied programme of mental treatment is operated there.  That programme includes an industrial training centre, a reform training centre and a centre for dealing with the treatment of alcoholism.</P>
    <P>The senior psychiatric consultant at the hospital has advanced the view that the hospital should be retained as at present and in view of the circumstances in the catchment area it could be gainfully developed as a research unit for psychiatric treatment generally.</P>
    <P>For all the foregoing reasons, on behalf of the patients, the management and the staff and the people of Castlerea &mdash; in which town I live &mdash; I strongly protest at this totally unjustified decision to close Castlerea Hospital.  Accordingly, I call on the Minister and the Government to reverse this decision which is a grave injustice to the most vulnerable section in society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> It is heartening to know that I am not alone in making this demand.  I am aware that there is general opposition by Oireachtas Members not only to the closure of Castlerea hospital but also to the closure of St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow.</P>
    <P>As of now neither the Minister nor the Government are empowered to close hospitals.  This requires new legislation which will, presumably, be introduced in due course.  When that time comes I hope the Members of the Oireachtas generally opposed to the closure of these hospitals will demonstrate that opposition by voting against the proposed legislation and by so doing defeat the decision to close the hospitals.  I hope, particularly, that Senator Connor will act similarly when a more composite motion relating to the closure of the Castlerea Hospital will be brought before this House in the very near future.  Have I exceeded my time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to reply to the debate.  The report on <i>Planning for the Future</i> was drawn up by professional psychiatric and administrative officers of the Department of Health and the health boards.  I would urge all Senators and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to read that report.  If one takes a glance at the references in the report they will show that there is a very extensive range of authorities quoted by them, in this country and elsewhere, who fully support their recommendations. The study group was set up a considerable time ago in 1981 and the report was published by the Government <Col N="393" /> in late 1984.  In their introduction they said:</P>
      <P>What is required now is a programme to implement these recommendations in all parts of the country. This programme should be initiated without delay so that mentally ill persons can benefit from an effective and progressive service.</P>
      <P>I strongly hold the view that for too long the psychiatric services in this country had not received the attention from successive Ministers for Health that the services merit.  We had a commission of inquiry which reported in 1966.  It made many recommendations.  These are echoed again and further developed in the 1984 Report.  In the past 20 years there has been some progress in following the earlier recommendations.  I strongly hold the view that in relation to our psychiatric services &mdash; 12,000 in-patients, 12,000 beds, in 22 psychiatric hospitals &mdash; there could have been, there should be and there must be far greater progress in implementing long-awaited recommendations. My only regret is that in the past three years, due to the pressure of a great deal of work in the Department, I have not had the opportunity to devote myself &mdash; to an even greater degree &mdash; to these recommendations.  I do not intend that they should suffer the same fate as previous recommendations and the recent report should start to be implemented.</P>
      <P>I do that because in my adamant view the best interests of psychiatric patients, which must come first, require that I press ahead with the necessary changes, even in these very difficult and controversial circumstances.  I intend to do so in the certain knowledge that I will introduce changes which will meet the needs of those who must be our first concern above all else, the patients in these hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connor and Senator de Brún referred to St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea.  It was built in 1943 with separate male and female blocks.  As the House knows, it was used in the late forties and early fifties for about seven <Col N="394" /> years as a TB sanatorium.  Then it reverted to a psychiatric hospital.  The patient population in the hospital has dropped steadily over the years, from 414 in 1965 to 336 in 1975, down to 251 at the end of 1984 and now we have 226 in-patients. That is a very substantial drop; even in the past decade there has been a drop of 110, almost 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is a very large number of staff involved.  That point has been made. There are 273 staff.  Last year the budget was £4 million.  The pay side of that budget was £3.3 million and the non-pay was roughly £700,000.  The breakdown of staff was eight medical, 162 nursing and allied, five para-medical, 51 catering and housekeeping, 24 maintenance, nine clerical and administrative, nine other grades of staff and five locums, making a total of 273 as of 31 March 1985.  That is the situation.  I hold the view, and it is not a personal view and I assure everyone here it is not a political view but it is a view advised to me by my senior professional staff, that the hospital now, like its predecessors and the TB sanatorium is in a setting where we can provide more modern and more effective treatment methods which are now available and that the hospital is not suitable for the particular psychiatric treatment model which we want to introduce.</P>
    <P>I make the point that 75 per cent of the patients have been in the hospital for about five years or more.  That is general confirmation of the point made by Senator Connor.  In common with other hospitals the entire in-patient population of Castlerea was recently assessed with a view to implementing the recommendations of Planning for the Future.  We had to determine the needs of patients in that regard and patients come first.  That assessment is an interesting assessment, one which enables us to have very detailed discussions with the Western Health Board.  As Senator Connor pointed out, there are 33 persons assessed as relating to the mental handicap services. When one looks at the figure of the 1981 census of 172 mental-handicap persons in St. Bridget's in Ballinasloe, 45 in 1981 in St. Patrick's in Castlerea and <Col N="395" /> 104 in St. Mary's in Castlebar, a number of questions arise.</P>
    <P>How and why did we, as a society, all during those years put mental-handicap patients into psychiatric hospitals?  It is not good enough to say that we did it because we had nowhere else to put them.  They should never have been in there in the first instance.  Now I want to take some of the 33 remaining out &mdash; not necessarily all as one can have a geriatric situation equally in mental handicapped persons &mdash; and I want to bring them over to a brand new £12 million mental-handicap residential centre with 190 vacant places at the moment.  We spent £12 million building it and now that I want to use it there is adamant opposition to the transfer of those patients, but we cannot have it both ways.  Patients will be transferred out of St. Bridget's, St. Patrick's and St. Mary's.  Not all will go but a substantial number could, in my view.  There will be staffing arrangements and the budget for them must also transfer.</P>
    <P>I cannot stand over a situation where the annual running cost of Swinford would be £3 million.  Simultaneously, we have to spend a very large amount of money in each of the other psychiatric hospitals and in other centres in the west, in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  I could not stand over it in terms of the rational organisation of services or in terms of having to go to the Government and ask them for additional resources of that order.  That is part of the <i>rationale</i> behind what we are endeavouring to do. We have done the assessment and that will form the basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to miss the vote in the other House.  Therefore, we will be sitting down with the Western Health Board and we will determine the <Col N="396" /> appropriate placement for the 226 patients involved.  We will also have to determine the future admission facilities to be made available for Roscommon. Roscommon, as well as every other county, must have and will have a psychiatric service.  We will also have to determine the other facilities needed.  For example, throughout the local towns, throughout Roscommon, we will have to build up day centres and day hospital places.  We will have to build up supervised and unsupervised hostels or domestic residences for patients who do not at the moment, I readily accept, have homes of their own.  We also have a situation of geriatric care.  Four out of every ten of the patients are now over 65 years of age.  In fact, looking back at the hospitals statistics to 31 December 1984, 46.6 per cent of the patients were over 65 years of age.</P>
      <P>Therefore the closure of the hospital, as proposed, will facilitate the opening of the new mental handicap centre at Swinford &mdash; I make no secret of that &mdash; which was completed, if I may remind Senators, almost a year ago.  We have to deal with a situation where the 1981 census of psychiatric hospitals &mdash; three psychiatric hospitals in the Western Health Board area &mdash; showed a total of 321 in-patients whose primary diagnosis was mental handicap.  I want to reiterate that that is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did announce my decision in Dáil Éireann and I have been criticised from many quarters about the alleged lack of consultation.  Quite frankly, consultation equates rejection.  That has been the experience of my office over three years. It was not just my decision; it was a decision taken by the Government after due submission by me of a memorandum to Government.  It is a collective governmental decision of both parties in Government.  Nobody will be permitted by me to be selective in the collective responsibility for that decision.  The Government accepted my recommendation by draft decision at that time.  I put it forward so that action could be taken to implement the decision in a controlled way.  I have provided funding for the <Col N="397" /> hospital for the next six months to enable alternative arrangements to be made.  I can assure Senator Connor, and I very much share his concern and that of his colleague, Senator de Brún, that there will be no hardship imposed by me, by the Department of Health or by the health board or anybody else on patients or on their relatives.  But if I had introduced a complete air of uncertainty about the prospect of a decision and if I had engaged in lengthy consultations, with all the rejection that that has entailed down through the years, nothing would have happened at all.  That applies to the hospitals. If I had adopted an attitude that something might happen in 1987 or 1988 or 1989 well, again, it would simply become part of a party political manifesto because regrettably these hospital services have been personalised and politicised to an inordinate degree.  That too I want, as far as possible, to bring to an end.</P>
    <P>Finally, the staff of the hospital, and any staff involved are understandably and rightly concerned.  As a member of trade union myself which organises psychiatric nurses, I can readily appreciate the concern. Every possible effort will be made to find a new role for staff, for their redeployment in appropriate positions within structures.  But the policy is clear and the alternative services will be provided and I would hope to bring in, and I certainly intend to bring in the new situation as quickly as possible.  For too <Col N="398" /> long we have failed to take action in this area.  In making a start in Carlow and in Castlerea, it is not in any way intended to be a reflection on the hospitals themselves or on the level of care.  A start must be made.  Traumatic as that change is, I intend to press ahead.  I will keep in regular consultation with the Senators on this matter, very regular consultation. Any Senator &mdash; now that we are up and running &mdash; is more than welcome to come into my office at any time to meet senior officers in my Department on a monthly basis, on a weekly basis if necessary, and I will give all information to Senators in that regard.  I, and my colleague, Deputy John Donnellan, from the health board area in the west, will advise and give all possible information to Members of both Houses.  They can be assured of that.  But we have had to take the decision in hand and now meet the health board.  We are making arrangements these days to meet the officers of the Western Health Board. I hope that the matter will be resolved in a co-operative, constructive way.  I will not be found wanting in accommodating the needs of the health boards and the members in that regard.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators Connor and de Brún for the opportunity to clarify the position in Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 12 February 1986.</P>
