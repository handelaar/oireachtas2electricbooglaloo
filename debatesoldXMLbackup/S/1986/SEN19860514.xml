      <P>I have notice from Senator Jimmy Deenihan that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to approve the placing of contracts to enable a new national school to be built at Girls Convent School, Listowel, County Kerry.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 10 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  It is proposed if No. 1 is not completed by 12 noon to interrupt the debate in order to take the Finance Bill from 12 noon onwards.  It is proposed to suspend the sitting from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and again from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  It is proposed to take No. 3 from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. and then resume debate on No. 2 until 10 p.m.</P>

    <P>I asked the other day a specific question <Col N="892" /> about the Copyright Bill which has been discussed in this House and then sent to the Dáil and delayed there.  I understand that there are no difficulties and that it is a matter for finding time for it in the Dáil business.  There are no further difficulties in regard to the Bill itself.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Leader of the House for mentioning this fact about the Copyright Bill.  We want to facilitate the Government in passing this Bill.

      <P>I would like your guidance on a matter.  I think it would be very appropriate that this House should record its regret and sympathy on the death of a major intellectual, Peadar O'Donnell, a former Member of the Oireachtas, a great trade union organiser and a great contributor to the integration in Irish life of writing, art and politics. He was also a great internationalist as well as a nationalist.  If I am not out of order we might record our sympathy and regret at his passing.</P>

      <P>If I can beg your indulgence for a further moment on the same issue, I would wish to be associated with Senator Higgins.  I never knew Peadar O'Donnell.  I never met him.  For me he was one of the great inspirational figures of Irish history, above all in his courage in maintaining a struggle when it was neither popular nor profitable for himself.  Our country is a lot the poorer for his passing in one way but what he did for his country has enriched us.  He will never be gone from us and, therefore, what he has contributed in his spirit is now part of the Irish nation.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Courts Bill, 1984, is a short measure but nevertheless it is important.  Legislatively, it amends and simplifies certain District Court procedures principally with regard to the enforcement of court orders and with regard to the renewal of publicans' licences, that is, licences which require in the normal sense a court certificate for their renewal.  In so far as this Bill does these things I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important at the outset to express disappointment that the Government have not tackled in a broader way the problem of the enforcement of court orders.  Whereas the Bill deals with one aspect of the enforcement of court orders, the Minister and the Department should address themselves to the broad question of the easy enforcement of court orders.  One of the problems for any legal practitioner is that the actual enforcement of a court order, in many cases where the enforcement of a court order is not availed of, can be cumbersome, <Col N="894" /> slow and can be a very technical process. I would hope that the Minister's Department would at an early date set in train an examination of what are in many respects outmoded procedures in relation to the enforcement of court orders.  I refer here in particular to the procedures for the registration of judgments on mortgages against property.  I think the procedures should be simplified.  The view I express in this regard is a view that is shared by the Incorporated Law Society and by various agencies who have an interest in matters of this nature.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 3 of the Bill deal with certain amendments to the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts.  At the outset I find it rather odd that the Bill is set out as it is.  I find it odd that section 2 comes between section 1 and section 3.  I say that in terms of content not in terms of numerics, but it seems odd that whereas sections 1 and 3 deal specifically with the enforcement of court orders legislation, section 2 deals with an entirely different matter.  In terms of legislative tidiness the Bill could be amended at this stage and section 3 could become section 2 and section 2 could become section 3.  The Bill is rather clumsily set out as it stands.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill has the effect of inserting a new section 15 into the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926.  It was the old section that provided for the procedure that is used at present in relation to applications in the District Court for examination orders.  The current procedure is that the court must have <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the debt.  The court must be satisfied that the debtor resides in the court area and that there are no goods which could be seized.  If the court is so satisfied the justice may make an order. What we are now attempting to do is to wipe away that entire procedure.  It is interesting that the role of the sheriff which was regarded as absolutely necessary by district courts until recently is no longer regarded as necessary.</P>
    <P>When I qualified as a young solicitor not long ago the position was that one could not apply for an examination order unless one's court order was marked &ldquo;no goods&rdquo; by the sheriff.  The interesting <Col N="895" /> point is that district justices are now waiving that regard.  That reflects the whole collapse of the sheriff's office system.  I know that the former Minister for Finance announced the establishment of a new sheriff system.  His suggestions in that regard were absolutely ridiculous.  I am referring to the former Minister for Finance of this Government.  I believe that the Government and the Department of Justice should give sufficient funding, manpower and personnel to our county registrars' offices to allow them execute all functions of the sheriff's office existing within their general jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The idea of establishing a new sheriff, purely for the purpose of executing one form of court order, namely, revenue warrants, is ridiculous.  I would ask the Minister to re-examine the role of the existing sheriff's office procedure, existing within most county registrars' offices. I would ask that they be given adequate staff to ensure that all aspects of the sheriff's work can be carried out within those offices.  I am not merely referring to the enforcement of court orders obtained by private individuals, but court orders obtained by the Revenue.  There is within the existing sheriffs' office and the Circuit Court offices sufficient machinery and adequate procedures if the manpower were made available.  If there is a commitment by this Government to see that court orders are properly enforced, then there must be a commitment on the part of the Department and on the part of the Department of the Public Service to make the personnel and the manpower available within these offices.  It seems ridiculous that we do not do that.  We say there is some form of an embargo and on the other hand we establish a new sheriff who is really a revenue sheriff.  That is a very unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>The new section 15 which is inserted by section 1 of the Bill provides for a simple procedure, that is, that a statutory declaration be made to the effect that a debt is due and the debtor resides in the court area.  If a District Court clerk receives such a declaration he will then <Col N="896" /> issue a summons requiring the debtor to attend for an examination.  In so far as that is done, I welcome it because it removes one court step from the procedure.  It makes it easier for the creditor to have his court order enforced.  It removes an amount of work from the office of our District Court clerks and an amount of business from our overburdened district justices.  In so far as that is done procedurely, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about some of the technicalities of section 1.  I will be putting down certain amendments at Committee Stage but I mention the points now so that the Minister will have time to consider them between now and then.  I am concerned about section 1 (1) (a) which refers to a creditor person and a debtor person.  My worry is that obviously the enforcement of court orders of this procedure can only be used against a human person as far as a debtor is concerned, but are we actually excluding the rights of a creditor company?  I feel that the relevant subsection should be looked at.</P>
    <P>I am also worried about section 1 (4) which states:</P>
    <P>The statement of means shall, not less than one week before the sitting of the District Court at which the examination is to take place, be lodged with the District Court clerk for the District Court Area wherein the debtor's examination is to take place.</P>
    <P>I believe that that section should be amended to put a duty on the debtor to serve a copy of the statement of means on the creditor or on the creditor's solicitor.  I know that subsection (5) provides that such a copy can be obtained from the District Court clerk's office on payment of the prescribed fee, but how is a creditor to know if a statement of means has been field?  Is a creditor, in every one of these cases, to run along to the District Court clerk's office, create confusion in that office in terms of having the file produced and have time wasted in that office to see if a statement of means has been filed?  A much simpler procedure would be to impose an obligation on the debtor or on the solicitor to <Col N="897" /> serve a copy of the statement of means on the other side.  We do not have pleadings in the District Court in so far as we have pleadings in the Circuit and High Courts, but in so far as we have documents which are served on the other side then the statement of means certainly falls within that category.  In so far as you serve a process on somebody which initiates proceedings, the other side gets a copy.  The same situation should apply in relation to the statement of means.  I believe that the overall effect of this section which is to make the District Court clerk's office more effective and to prevent time being wasted is being removed when you now have creditors running into the District Court clerk's office in the seven days before the application takes place to see if a statement of means has been field.</P>
    <P>I am putting down an amendment to deal with that point.  I hope the Minister will deal with it in a sympathetic way.  I am making my point from experience, knowing what happens in our district courts throughout the country and knowing what happens in our overburdened District Court clerks' offices throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is a logical progression from section 1 to section 3.  I think that in this Bill, if the Minister accepts one of my amendments &mdash; and I hope more than one of them will be accepted &mdash; the sections should be replaced and put in proper order.  I do not know how the officials or how the parliamentary draftsman got confused in the setting out of this Bill.  I welcome section 3 because it introduces clarity into an area where there was no clarity up to now.  Section 3 simply introduces four aspects of clarity in the areas where instalment orders may be varied. I welcome it because I think that the contents of this section have given rise to an amount of talk and discussion.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for where a district court may impose a term of imprisonment in default of the payment of a fine. I find the section a little puzzling.  On the one hand we provide that a court of summary jurisdiction would have a <Col N="898" /> discretion to impose a term of imprisonment in the event of a fine not being paid, and on the other hand we take away that discretion in prescribing the length of imprisonment that may apply.  I am not altogether happy with the mandatory aspect of this section.</P>
    <P>What I am not happy about is this: one cannot simply judge an order of a district court on the basis of a fine only.  There may be very compelling circumstances in the case of drunken driving where a defendant is going to be disqualified from holding a driving licence for a period of 12 months, where the district justice may say: &ldquo;that is sufficient penalty against you and, therefore, I will impose a minimum fine of £40&rdquo;.  Yet, in a serious case of that, the period of imprisonment will be five days in default of payment.  On the other hand, in a similar case for a similar offence, where the disqualification is not so effective, the district justice may impose a fine of £500 and somebody can be imprisoned for 90 days.  I believe that the discretion which a district justice, as I understand it, had heretofore in relation to terms of imprisonment that would be imposed in the default of the payment of a fine, should not be removed.  Section 2 is a dangerous section in that regard.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I would make the point that there are many summary procedures where a fine may be imposed but where consequental orders may follow, for instance, prosecutions under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  Somebody may be prosecuted under one of the Acts that amend the 1959 Act for using a vehicle or a boat as an aid to the commission of an offence.  Consequence of conviction there is automatic forfeiture.  For a very serious matter, a small fine may be imposed and, therefore, the terms of imprisonment that would follow for default of payment would be minimal. I would ask the Minister to reconsider section 2.  I would ask him not to take away the discretion which, as I understood it, our district justices exercised up to now.  I would just say that I am unhappy about this section, as it stands.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill is welcome.  It is the section which deals with the renewal <Col N="899" /> of intoxicating liquor licences without court certificates.  As I understand it, the current situation is that somebody applies to the District Court clerk for renewal. The renewal application comes before the annual licensing court in the month of September, and if the district justice is satisfied that there is no objection to the renewal and if he is satisfied that the fire officer has been served with certification of the application and does not object to renewal, the renewal will automatically be granted.  Certainly, the renewal procedure takes up much time within our District Court clerk's offices. It takes up a certain amount of time within our district courts.  The procedure now introduced is certainly a welcome procedure.</P>
    <P>I am happy also with the caveat that is introduced whereby a court certificate is required in certain circumstances, circumstances where an objection has been field within the prescribed period of time or where a licence has expired, or where a structural alteration is being carried out in relation to the premises.  A balance has been struck the right way here, and I welcome this section.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about certain aspects of the section.  I should at this stage, record what my unhappinesses are in this regard. I am unhappy, first, that the whole question of the renewal of liquor licences has not been tackled or, indeed, the whole question of the granting of liquor licences has not been tackled.  I know that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation are currently considering a review of the intoxicating liquor code.  I know that the Department are actively pursuing this.  The problem is this: in the late twenties the Department commissioned an examination of the intoxicating liquor licensing laws.  The report was published in 1927 with a supplementary report in 1929.  Certain steps were taken on foot of that.  A further report was commissioned by the Department in the late fifties and following on that we had the 1960 and 1962 Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  In both of these reports there was the observation that nobody can find his way through the <Col N="900" /> intoxicating liquor code other than the most intrepid explorers.</P>
    <P>That is increasingly true.  The problem is this.  Nothing has been done to tackle the whole question of the codification of the intoxicating liquor code.  That applies particularly in relation to the granting and the renewal of licences, whereby the anomalous situation exists that certain licences are granted automatically by the excise authorities.  Certain licences are granted on the production of District Court certificates, and other licences are granted on the production of Circuit Court certificates.  I believe, at the outset, that the entire area of the granting and renewal of liquor licences, in so far as court certificates are required, should be brought into the District Court.  It is a ridiculous and an anomalous situation that the original licensing jurisdiction for the granting of new seven-day ordinary publicans' licences should lie with the Circuit Court.  The appropriate court in this regard is the District Court.  I am sorry that this Bill does not contain a simple provision providing that the jurisdiction currently exercised by the Circuit Court be transferred to the District Court.  I make that point because of the whole history of our intoxicating liquor code.</P>
    <P>Originally, until 1902, licences were granted by justices sitting in Petty Sessions.  The whole basis of the granting of licences at Petty Sessions was that the people who granted or renewed licences were people of standing in the locality. These were the magistrates, the justices. Despite the many reservations we may have about the system then existing, at least these people knew what was happening in the locality.  Within the parameters of the 1872 and 1874 Acts they were granted or they refused to grant.  In 1902 we decided there were too many intoxicating liquor licences so we put a certain stay on their power.  The basic point is that the power was exercised by a court that was absolutely in touch with what was happening in the area.  I believe that that power should be restored to the District Court.  It is the appropriate court to grant or to refuse, to renew or not to renew a licence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> Having said that, I couple with that the need to simplify the procedures for the issue of the whole plethora of licences to sell various types of liquors.  Simplification is sought in that regard.  This Bill does not address that particular question. I am certainly disappointed with that aspect.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about section 4 (3) which reads:</P>
    <P>Where a renewal of a licence is granted by an officer of the Revenue Commissioners and false or misleading information was given to the Commissioners in support of the application for such grant, the applicant shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £300.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) which follows from that provides that:</P>
    <P>Where the applicant is convicted of an offence under subsection (3) of this section or where there was a failure to comply with subsection (11) of this section, the District Court may order that the licence be forfeited.</P>
    <P>In other words, the District Court may make an order, where misleading information was given &mdash; minimally, misleading information &mdash; that the licence be forfeited.  The consequence of that is that the house can never again be licensed and the licensee may never again hold a licence.  I thought we would be moving towards a situation where the Department of Justice were examining seriously the entire forfeiture procedure in cases where three endorsable offences had been recorded on a licence.  It does appear that the mandarins in the Department of Justice are not prepared to accede to the requests that have been made by the Licensed Vintners' Association and other interested bodies in that regard.  I think this section is dangerous. Indeed, it may be argued that it is unconstitutional.  I wish that somebody would challenge the power of the District Court in this regard.  I would ask the Minister to take a very serious look at this section <Col N="902" /> between now and Committee Stage.  I certainly will be putting down an amendment on that point generally at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that there is not a little enlightened thinking within the Department so far as the forfeiture of licences is concerned.  If a publican errs, if he commits an offence, and the offence is prosecuted, and if he is convicted, then it should be possible for the District Court to disqualify him from holding a publican's licence for a period of 14 days, or for a period of one month, or for a period of two months.  Put him out of the shop for a period as we put the drunken driver off the road for a period.  To provide that a man's livelihood be taken away is, to my mind, ridiculous as is to provide for giving misleading information in relation to the renewal of a licence.  What is misleading information?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>A simple mistake as my friend, Senator Fitzsimons says.  I have the utmost confidence in the great majority of our district justices and I, as a practitioner, worked under many of them and would like to pay tribute to the tremendous number of working hours they put in and the reason they exercise.  We all know that those qualities do not belong to all men or to all district justices. If one listens to the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo; or to some of these other flippant radio programmes one gets the impression that there are district justices that one would prefer not to be subject to in the courts of our land.  My concern is that at the annual Brewster sessions, as they are called in the neighbouring island, at the annual licensing court a renewal application may come up; we may have an unreasonable district justice &mdash; there are one or two of them abroad &mdash; and we may suddenly find that our licence is forfeited and we are in tremendous trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say to the Minister, let us be enlightened and strike a new <Col N="903" /> balance in relation to forfeiture and introduce a discretionary power to remove the licensing capacity of a publican for a period of a month or two months in the event of an offence being committed. Certainly, if false or misleading information is given, this is not the appropriate remedy which is to disqualify the publican from holding a licence for the period I have mentioned.  I have made the important point I wanted to make on that section.  It is one that I am concerned about and one with which I will deal in depth on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 5 of the Bill which is an amendment of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  It is a sensible section and it is one that can certainly prevent a matter being dragged out for an inordinate period due to unfortunate circumstances. I do not think any complaints can be made by the defendant in so far as this new section should operate.</P>
    <P>These are the essential points I want to make in relation to this Bill.  I welcome the Bill and any move which will simplify the procedure we have for the enforcement of court orders.  However, the Bill does not go far enough.  It tackles necessary amendments to the enforcement of court orders legislation but it does not in any way examine the other methods of enforcement of court orders.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as if simplifies the system for the renewal of publicans' licences.  There are aspects of that particular section which require critical examination and I will be addressing myself to them again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Minister, let us produce tidy legislation and let us turn section 2 and section 3 round about.  I welcome the other sections of the Bill.  I hope that the remaining year-and-a-half of this Government will see other courts Bills which will amend and simplify our current District Court procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief because this is a specialised area of particular interest to lawyers.  My <Col N="904" /> comments will be simple and from the layman's point of view.  Some Bills coming before this House generate a heated reaction while others get a rather cold response.  I could describe my reaction to this Bill as lukewarm because it seems rather insignificant.</P>
      <P>There are very many people who believe we have too much law in this country and too little justice.  While I realise that it is very easy to generalise and be smart in this way, nevertheless, it seems unfortunate that the law is not synonymous with justice.</P>
      <P>This Bill is short.  It comprises seven sections.  It is dated 1984 and came before the other House on Second Stage in May 1985 and so cannot be regarded as urgent. It is non-contentious.  In so far as I have spoken of the necessity for this Bill, it is very welcome to all the parties.  It has been stated that it is the start of reform. I wonder why a start was made in this rather insignificant area.  I realise that a start must be made somewhere.  There is a great necessity for reform.  At some period of my life I worked as a clerk in the county council office attached to the courthouse in Kells and I had an opportunity of looking through some of the old Acts.  Some of them seemed to me to be out of date.  There was one particular Act prohibiting kite-flying.  I would like to remark in passing that if kite-flying were prohibited, a number of people might also be inhibited.  However, there were many of those Acts that no longer have any relevance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the significance of this Bill is that for some reason it is necessary to have it passed before completing the District Court rules.  I have looked through the contributions from the other House.  I listened attentively here and there has been no explanation or no reference in detail to the extent of these District Court rules.  An updating of those rules if there are any is most essential.  In the not-too-distant past, we had a situation with one particular district justice &mdash; and I refer to this merely in passing &mdash; who made many bizarre decisions.  Rules are necessary in order to formalise procedure.  There must be <Col N="905" /> efficiency in that area.  On one occasion a solicitor representing a client in court was found in contempt by the same district justice and there an instant fine of £50 was imposed on that man.  The legal profession took up that case and sorted out the problem.  There would be very many people going before courts who would not have the back-up of a legal profession and for whom that would be a very unenviable situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if the District Court rules envisaged would cater for problems like that.  Will they prohibit that kind of situation arising again?  If they do, I certainly would welcome the rules.  There must be uniformity with the rules.  That kind of autonomous, and peremptory and summary conviction should be prohibited totally.  I would hope that the District Court rules envisaged will bring an end to that kind of conduct which in my view does nothing for the courts.</P>
    <P>This is really a technical Bill for lawyers but at the same time the law is for the people and my reaction to it is, I hope, the reaction of an ordinary individual and in that sense I believe that everybody has something to contribute and some input to make which might be taken into account.  Reform in this area is important.  The language of Bills, as I have said on many occasions could bear some improvement.  I know it is difficult to draft Bills but in some ways modern Bills seem to use outdated phrases and outdated words.  I think they could be simplified.  I mentioned before an old lady who was the proprietor of a public house in my youth and she had a phrase: &ldquo;Plain words make the most ornamental sentences.&rdquo;  I think that in many of those Bills plan words would help.  I cannot see any reason why plain and simple words are not used.</P>
    <P>Could I refer in passing to the dress of the legal profession, not in the district courts but in the higher courts, although I am sure the same court rules apply?  It seems strange to retain that old form of dress; I know it is retained in religion too, but there it has some mystical significance.  I fail to see what significance it has <Col N="906" /> in court.  I also feel that many of the courthouses are unsuitable and perhaps there could be some modernisation there, for example, with regard to closed circuit television.  Many of the courts I know have various kinds of problems.  That is an area where something could be done.</P>
    <P>There are three objectives in this Bill. The first is to expedite the collection process regarding judgmental debts.  The second is to alter the penalty structures that may be imposed in the District Court in default of payment of a fine and associated costs.  It reduces the maximum period of one year to 90 days and reductions are of much the same order for lesser periods.  Although this has been welcomed, and I see no reason why it should not be welcomed, this is a sweeping reduction.  I wonder what sums remain unpaid in this regard and indeed will this do anything to ensure that the sums will be paid in future.</P>
    <P>Third, the Bill attempts to improve the efficiency of the licensing applications procedure for publicans.  This is one aspect of it that I would welcome.  I see no reason why publicans' licences could not be renewed at post offices or Garda barracks or in some such way if there is no objection.  There is provision in the Bill where there are objections but in the ordinary way, where there is no objection, it seems to me that it is only a matter of form and to put it through such formalised channels seems to me to be totally unnecessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to judgmental debts, I believe that these build up in a time of recession and I feel it is important that simplification would not induce creditors to be less discerning due to the time factor.</P>
    <P>The section which deals with the revision of imprisonment periods for default of payment of fine, of costs on summary conviction, seems to criminalise the situation and I am not sure that prison is the answer.  It has been suggested by others that community work would be more appropriate and I would subscribe to this view.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the grant of renewal of intoxicating licences without <Col N="907" /> court certificates.  It refers to the part the Revenue Commissioners would have to play and I too share the concern that others have expressed in regard to the power of the Revenue Commissioners possibly making it difficult to renew a licence where the moneys owed were not paid up.  With regard to the necessity to go through the court procedure where structural alterations have taken place I know that there are very clear guidelines about maps presented in court in connection with licensing laws.  In every case where there is a structural alteration it might not be necessary to prepare a new map, for example in a situation where the licensing area would not be extended and where structural alterations might possibly involve changes in the actual structure rather than the layout of a premises.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why in that situation it should be necessary to go before the court because alterations of that kind would have been processed through the planning authority and the suitability of the design would have been taken into account in granting planning permission. From that point of view, and indeed regarding the very strict rules for fire escapes and fire regulations particularly having regard to the proposed building regulations which are coming into effect very soon &mdash; with regard to all these I would hope that there would be an exemption for the premises which did not apply for an increased licensing area. Perhaps the Minister would refer to that.</P>
    <P>I believe that most of the changes contemplated in this Bill are already in effect in the Dublin District Court.  While I have to some extent been critical of the Bill as a worthwhile start to reform, nevertheless I feel that time spent in discussing the Bill itself is not wasted.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Law Reform Commission, I wonder is there not some suggestion as to what areas of priority should be taken in connection with this type of reform rather than some kind of <i>ad hoc</i> start?  I feel that it would be more appropriate and far more important to <Col N="908" /> repeal and update the licensing laws than the simple procedure of renewing a licence.  There was an article in the <i>Garda Review</i> for March this year by Garda Mathias Burke dealing with the licensing laws and I will quote a few sentences which will bear out the point I am trying to make.  He states:</P>
    <P>The law as it currently stands, in regard to licensed premised is an ass.</P>
    <P>Further on he states:</P>
    <P>The problem with the liquour licensing laws, as they are in operation in this country is that they were never made for present day conditions.</P>
    <P>Later he states:</P>
    <P>These laws have evolved over the past century and have largely outgrown their usefulness.</P>
    <P>The scope of an essay of this kind does not allow for an in-depth study of the licensing laws.  A quick glance however, will show that these laws and the penalties for a breach of the laws, remain largely unchanged since the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>This is stated by a garda in a very professional and what I find a very helpful magazine.  Here I feel is the area where a start could have been made.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would refer to the point raised by Senator Durcan regarding the forfeiture of a licence.  I think it is a very harsh situation to lose a licence at that level through information that might not be deliberately intended to mislead.  That is wrong.  I feel that some amendment should be made with regard to this section because by and large publicans have a very difficult role to play; by and large they are very decent, responsible people. The drinkers have a responsibility as regards behaviour in this whole area.  As far as the publicans are concerned and in the whole area of losing a licence it is important that this should be cleared up and that a situation could not arise where the Revenue Commissioners might be responsible, on account of inaccurate information, for a publican losing his licence.  With those reservations I welcome the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to a number of matters that are in the Bill and one or two matters that are not in the Bill and that I feel could usefully be put into a Bill of this kind.  The Bill, as the House will know, is a Courts Bill which deals with variations in the powers of courts which are felt to be appropriate.  It is instructive to read the Long Title of the Bill which is:</P>
      <P>An Act to amend and extend the Courts of Justice Acts, 1924 to 1961, and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts, 1961 to 1983, and to provide for other matters relating to the courts.</P>
      <P>I would further like to refer to the Explanatory Memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill and which is quite useful in indicating in a readable form the effects of the many technical provisions which are included in the legislation.  At paragraph 1 of the Explanatory Memorandum it states that the Bill proposes certain amendments to the law designed to simplify procedures in the District Court in relation to a number of matters.  It then goes on to describe what those matters are.  What I have to say is entirely relevant to that in that what I feel is missing from the Bill is procedures which are essential to the District Court in the carrying out of its duties under this legislation and other Courts legislation and under Acts which have been enacted from time to time by this House.</P>
      <P>In general I would like to say that I welcome the legislation.  I think it is right and the simplification of the procedures concerning the examination of debtors will be welcomed by all those who are engaged in a very difficult task of trying to enforce payment on people who use, or indeed abuse, the court system for the purpose of avoiding or delaying making proper payments of sums due by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the contents of section 2 which I think have already been referred to by Senator Durcan.  I would not be as pessimistic as Senator Durcan with regard to his interpretation of section 2.  I do not think it limits the courts to a mandatory term of <Col N="910" /> imprisonment as he outlined.  Subsection (1) of section 2 clearly say that there are terms of imprisonment &ldquo;not exceeding ...&rdquo; In my opinion, in those circumstances it is quite open to the district justice to vary them downwards.  Of course he obviously cannot vary them upwards.  I do not think they are mandatory sentences in any sense.  In relation to that aspect of the problem which was referred to by Senator Durcan the Minister will probably be able to satisfy us, or satisfy me, that the matter is already adequately covered by the legislation as proposed.</P>
    <P>I would also like to welcome the clarification of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940, and to welcome the provisions which are made in respect of the grant of renewal of intoxicating liquor licences without the necessity of court certificates.  That is right and proper.  It is appropriate that these procedures which are in the overwhelming number of cases non-controversial should go through with the minimum of court time involvement as I feel that such court time is more usefully spent in examination of the really contentious issues which, of course, of necessity come before the courts on a daily basis.  There is no court in the land that needs more streamlining than the District Court, not because it is an inefficient court but primarily because it is an efficient court and because it is the court to which the overwhelming number of our citizens have to look for redress and to which the State itself has to look for redress in the overwhelming majority of criminal cases.  The easing of the work load of the District Court is to the benefit of the community at large in so far as the granting of the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences without court certificates is concerned, I feel that it is a positive step and one which we should welcome.</P>
    <P>The use of the Revenue Commissioners for this purpose is entirely justified even though I have a great natural suspicion of non-court procedures. Where things are not contested I feel that it is only right and proper that they go through without the necessity of ensuring <Col N="911" /> that each and every pub makes a personal or representative appearance in court on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The proposal in section 5 which deals with the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, and the problem that arises when a district justice is ill on the preliminary examination of an indictable offence is one which I share and support.  It is a sensible amendment of the position.  At Second Stage it is only right for me to say that there is a great opportunity being lost in the enactment of this legislation, relating as it does to District Courts and by and large to the District Court procedure in not overcoming a problem which has serious consequences both in respect of the cost of litigation to litigants and to the State and also has serious consequences for practitioners in the area.  The legislation to which I refer has nearly all been referred to or amended in some way by the Courts Bill itself or is proposed to be amended by the Courts Bill.</P>
    <P>In order to explain to the House what the problem is I would like to refer briefly to the fact that the District Court power to commit a person or power to act in the case of contempt is governed by an Act which is referred to in this legislation as the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.  It deals with the problem of how the District Court protects itself against a person who is in contempt of an order of the District Court.  For the reason that District Courts are less formal than other courts and also because they are courts of summary jurisdiction, section 9 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851 limits the power of the court to act against those in contempt to those present in the court at the time.  If one were to go into a District Court and start shouting and roaring at the district justice one would find oneself in prison for contempt of court.  If one displays his contempt by ignoring a decision of the District Court, a person cannot be held in contempt of the District Court unless the particular enactment contains within itself a provision whereby that contempt can be remedied.</P>
    <P>A problem has arisen in the family law <Col N="912" /> area relative to the District Court and its powers.  The Family Law (Protection) of Spouses and Children) Act contains effective procedures for ensuring that spouses and their children are protected by barring orders.  Barring orders are now primarily creatures of the District Court. Within that Act there is a procedure whereby the District Court can enforce its orders because the District Court, being a creature of statute, does not have the same inherent powers to deal with contempt as the Circuit or High Court have.  The Circuit and High Courts can, without any statutory provision, commit a person for contempt regardless of whether the contempt is actually physically in the presence of the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an important point to put forward.  The District Court cannot act except where it is empowered by statute to act.  The general power is contained in section 9 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.  Additional powers are given from time to time by specific Acts.  For example, the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act contains such provision.  There is no problem about the enforcement of orders made by the District Court under <Col N="913" /> that Act.  Similarly, where the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 is concerned that also contains a provision whereby spouses and children can be maintained.  These provisions can be enforced because, within the legislation itself, the District Court is empowered to so act.</P>
      <P>The problem arises with regard to the Guardianship of Infants' Act, 1964 which was originally an Act designed for the High and the Circuit Courts.  Within that Act there was a definition of the &ldquo;court.&rdquo; That definition was that &ldquo;the court&rdquo; for this Act shall mean the High Court or the Circuit Court.  In the Courts Act, 1981 the powers with regard to custody and access were remitted from the High Court and the Circuit Court to the District Court.  The District Court was given the power to make access orders, custody orders and various other orders. Unfortunately, when that was done the Guardianship of Infants Act was not amended.  The Courts Act 1981 did not contain a provision which would enable the District Court to enforce its orders concerning custody or access.</P>
      <P>The result of that is that a person who is in defiance of a District Court order relative to custody or access cannot be called to book by the District Court. Where a person is faced with the problem of taking proceedings in a matrimonial matter, which are partly maintenance, partly protection of the spouse and which are partly custody, all the proceedings can be taken properly in the District Court and all the proper orders can be made in the District Court.  What cannot be done in the District Court is that it cannot be enforced.  Only two of those three can be enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to custody and access, there is no system whereby the order of the District Court can be enforced.  That means if there is a troublesome respondent in such a case two actions have to be taken relative to the one series of events and relative to the one application. An application must be taken in the District Court because you will not be <Col N="914" /> allowed take it in the Circuit Court relative to maintenance and relative to protection of the spouse.  An action must be taken on the same facts in the Circuit Court with regard to custody or there will not be an effective series of orders which will not only deal with the maintenance of the spouse and also deal with the protection of the spouse but will deal with the actual custody and access.  The Department of Justice are aware of this problem.  Practitioners in the family law area also know the problems exist.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider, before Committee Stage and because the Bill is nearing enactment, introducing an amendment which would effectively bring about a situation intended by the Oireachtas and would enable the District Court to effectively make orders relative to access and custody under the provisions of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  Such an amendment would have little difficulty in passing in this House. The trouble in going back to the Dáil with that amendment would be more than compensated for by a specific piece of amending legislation which would not then be required.  The intention is that there would be specific amending legislation.  Because the Bill covers the areas I have referred to it is an ideal vehicle for the changing and improving of the law and closing of this loophole.  It was never intended otherwise than that these matters would all be dealt with as a result of one application to one court with considerable savings in terms of cost to the taxpayer and in terms of personal trauma to both spouses and to the children involved.  I would ask the Minister in considering the various problems that other Members have brought to their attention concerning this Bill to consider also the problem I have mentioned and to see whether as a result of that an amendment can be made which would enable this lacuna to be corrected.</P>
    <P>I hope we can get a positive response from the Minister on Committee Stage and that he would put down an amendment.  In any event so as to encourage the Minister to do so, I will be putting down an amendment of my own which <Col N="915" /> the Minister will be relieved to know I will be very pleased to withdraw to make way for the amendment which the Minister will put down as a result of the case I have made here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution on this Bill will be rather short.  I want to confine myself mainly to the provisions in section 4 which concern the renewal of publicans' licences.  I welcome the simplification of the procedures which will now eliminate the necessity of a publican having to appear in the District Court and obtain a certificate from that court as to his suitability and fitness as an individual and the suitability and fitness of his premises.</P>
      <P>There are already licences to publicans under the terms of this measure that apply directly to the Revenue Commissioners unless there is an objection by the Garda or other qualified people to the renewal of the licence and then that renewal will automatically go through on application to the Revenue Commissioners.  There is a provision there that should there be an objection to the conduct of the premises and the conduct of the individual as proprietor of the premises, that objection can be taken to the annual licensing session in September.  In that case the applicant has to apply to the court and satisfy the court as to his or her suitability and the suitability of the premises.</P>
      <P>There is another provision which I also welcome, that is the substitution of subsection 3 of section 3 of the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904.  The effect of this will be to ensure that there is a common renewal date for the certificate made available to clubs which enables them to supply drink to their members on their premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation that has prevailed in that field up to now has been unsatisfactory in so far as the renewal date of this certificate, which is not a licence &mdash; it is actually a certificate &mdash; has varied throughout the year.  It is largely related to the time of the year in which that particular club applied for its initial registration.  Therefore, in that aspect of the Bill in so far as <Col N="916" /> it deals with the licensed trade, I welcome the simplification of procedures in the annual renewal of publicans' licences.  I strongly welcome the imposition of the enactment of a common renewal date for the registration of clubs.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other comments I want to make in relation to subsections 3 and 4.  I notice that this peculiar penalty of forfeiture of licence is being preserved in this legislation.  I also notice that in the First Schedule to the Bill no more than 11 liquor licensing Acts are referred to. I am disappointed that the Minister did not find it possible to look at this question of the forfeiture of licences as applied at present and avail of the opportunity presented by this Bill to eliminate this source of injustice.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few general observations on this section.  I want to put it on the record of the House the situation that I or any publican are confronted with as the legislation now stands in relation to the forfeiture of licences.  If I am found to have people on my premises at 11.45 p.m. I can lose my investment, my livelihood and the value of my premises.  That is the sort of penalty that is provided for within the licensing code.  While the argument might be made that this point is not so relevant to this Bill, it is in the sense of this question of forfeiture of licence.</P>
    <P>I know of no other penalty in which a person convicted of a crime no matter how serious it is, having paid his debt to society either by fine or jail sentence is not permitted by the laws of the State to resume his legitimate business.  Within the trade that I am involved in that can never happen.  If one is convicted and loses one's licence through forfeiture, one can never again hold a licence and the premises to which it applied can never again be licensed.  I want the Minister to clarify as to whether that position will prevail should a licence be forfeited under this section.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that a court may order the forfeiture of a publican's licence should false or misleading information be provided to the Revenue Commissioners in a person's <Col N="917" /> application for the licence.  Therefore, we will need to have clarified what amounts to false and misleading information.  That can come and that is important.  But what is far more important is the penalty and the effect of the penalty that can arise from a supposed supplying of that false and misleading information.  Therefore, if I, by oversight, fail to provide some piece of information to the Revenue Commissioners and a court should subsequently hold that that was false and misleading information on my part, and because I infringed the provision in this section of the Act, I deserved the penalty prescribed in the Act, that is the fortfeiture of my licence.</P>
    <P>It could be a very simple matter on which this could happen.  The points I made earlier in relation to the forfeiture of a licence under other circumstances can only occur when the court is satisfied that I have transgressed the law in four separate instances over a period of time or most significantly since last August as a result of a Supreme Court judgment, all on the one occasion.  In this provision I need only do it once and by way of oversight.  If I fail to convince the court that it was by way of oversight, then I lose my licence and it is forfeited.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister tell me if forfeiture in these circumstances is the same as forfeiture in the other circumstances?  If it is, I want to make the point that this is a penalty that is extremely severe and savage.  Having failed to satisfy the court that it was an oversight, they prescribe that I must be convicted of this offence. Therefore, my licence must be forfeited. I can never again be licensed to sell alcohol.  I can never again operate as a legitimate publican.  My business and investment of 20 years is rendered useless and the premises to which that licence applies can never again be licensed as a public house.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister conscious of the implications of that provision?  It is something that I cannot, in fairness to the people who operate the trade, accept in this particular measure.  There is in this provision here that the court may order.  And at least that is giving a certain discretion to <Col N="918" /> the court which does not apply and which is not available to the court in relation to forfeiture for other offences.  There is that discretion here but, nonetheless, the court may decide that the information that I supplied was false and misleading. These terms will have to be clarified.  We will have to spell out quite clearly what type of information will be classified as false and misleading and I want to be satisfied that the Minister is conscious that that is the type of penalty that is being imposed on me and my fellow publicans throughout the country because of an oversight in this supply of information.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say on Second Stage.  There are two aspects of it in relation to the liquor trade that I welcome &mdash; the simplification of the licences and issuing of them by the court, and the common date for the annual renewal of club certificates.  I cannot emphasise enough the depth of the reservations I hold in relation to the question of forfeiture of licences.  To my knowledge there is no other crime in this country by which for ever a person is deprived of their livelihood and their investment destroyed.  In any other circumstances they pay their debt to society by either prison or fine or both.  Having disposed of it, they have, as it were, cleansed their spirit and soul and are entitled to return to society and resume their legitimate obligation.</P>
    <P>In the case of the publican, once having lost his licence through forfeiture, he is branded for all time.  That is the effect of this legislation.  In addition to that, the premises concerned may never again hold a licence.  Does the Minister feel that the supply of minute detail that might be understood by a court to be false and misleading, is sufficient justification to merit a penalty so savage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to apologise to the House for giving such short notice. Coming from Cork this morning the traffic was very heavy.  I apologise for being late.  Like Senator Howard, I note with caution the Bill before us.  Being a public representative and a publican, I <Col N="919" /> am concerned and upset in regard to the recommendations in the Bill.  While I welcome the restructuring of the courts and the structure of the allocation of licences to public houses and hotels, I note also with deep concern the powers given to the relevant authorities who would be issuing the licences.  I appreciate that this is the Second Stage of the Bill and I will not go too deep into it.  I will be involved in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of concern throughout the licensed trade as regards this Bill and the powers that may be granted.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is mentioned in this Bill not more than once or twice but often.  I would ask again that, before Committee Stage, it should be noted that there is very deep concern as to whether licences may again be allocated or renewed to the relevant licensee.  It is being asked why the Revenue Commissioners should have the authority and why there should be so much commotion as to why licences should be transferred from one area to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put before the Minister that there may be areas where the Revenue Commissioners could have information that would not be relevant to the licence of the premises in question but which would be relevant to other areas of the person or persons or company involved and that, consequently, they might not be inclined to renew the licence.  That is a very serious concern and I would appreciate it if it was looked at again so that we do not bring about a situation where the renewal of the licence should not be granted, certainly not a situation where we are dealing with a new area of authority outside the courts. Speaking to many people involved in the business, we find that the general consensus is that at the end of the day one will get the fairest thinking and fair play within the courts.  I do not like the idea of saying that they may grant a relevant licence to the premises or the licensee. That is not to my liking and, like other <Col N="920" /> people, I will be speaking against it on Committee Stage.  I should like the Minister to let it be noted that there is very serious concern about that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.  The Bill is a short, though rather technical one.  It is designed to enable revised comprehensive rules for the District Court to be brought into operation.  The scope of the Bill is, therefore, limited.  Nevertheless, it carries significance in that it will clear a way for the completion of the major undertaking that the preparation of the new rules represents.</P>
      <P>I mentioned also that some further drafting work has been found to be necessary in relation to the proposed new rules. This is a matter that is having the active attention of the District Court Rules Committee.</P>
      <P>Senator Eoin Ryan questioned the limited scope of the Bill and expressed disappointment that, while a number of important matters require attention in the area of courts legislation, they are not being catered for in this Bill.  However, the fact is that there are other matters that are having active attention, although not in this particular Bill, even apart from the Courts Act that was enacted into law this year.</P>
      <P>Two other Bills are before the Oireachtas.  One concerns the place of juries in personal injuries cases and the other concerns judicial pensions.  In addition, I mentioned at an earlier stage of the debate that the Minister for Justice has under examination the question of reducing the level of dependence on imprisonment in cases where a court orders payment of a debt and the debtor is unwilling to pay, although he or she is in a postion to pay, and also in cases where a court imposes a fine and the person concerned is likewise unwilling to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan recommended that the Liquor Licensing Acts should be consolidated.  I share his view that such a step is desirable, but I cannot agree that it will be a simple or easy one to achieve.  The <Col N="921" /> Liquor Licensing Acts go back to 1833 and before.  Their amendment and consolidation will be a major undertaking.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan proposes to put down amendments for Committee Stage and we shall have the opportunity at that point to consider the criticisms that he has raised briefly in relation to sections 1, 2 and 3.  He favours the consolidation of the liquor licensing laws particularly in relation to the granting of licences by the District Court.  His remarks in this connection will be taken into account in the context of further work on this legislation.  He was also concerned about the power given by way of section 4 (4) to the District Court to order forfeiture of liquor licences in certain circumstances. I would make two points in this connection.</P>
    <P>First, I am satisfied that a power of this nature is necessary as without it a licensee could continue in what is often a very lucrative trade for up to a full year even where he had deliberately given false information to obtain renewal of a licence.  Secondly, I am confident that district justices will not use this power of forfeiture where the applicant does not wilfully mislead the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Fitzsimons for his contribution but I think it would be too much to hope that District Court rules alone could deal with the main matters he raised.  Rules are concerned essentially with procedure and not with substantive law such as the substantive law in contempt of court.  The Senator suggested some amendments to the procedures in relation to renewal of liquor licences so as to avoid recourse to the Revenue Commissioners and the District Courts in certain cases.  I have noted the comments he has made.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind Senators that the procedural change proposed in section 4 is a simple but useful one.  It would be inappropriate for me to use this Bill as a vehicle for further changes in the liquor licensing code.  That code is complex. Any further changes going beyond the straightforward change now proposed <Col N="922" /> would demand in-depth consideration and careful drafting and would be appropriate for consideration in the context of a more far reaching Liquor Licensing Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, Senator Howard referred to section 4 of the Bill and welcomed the simplification of the procedures for which it provides.  He referred in particular to section 4 (4) which gives the District Court discretion as to whether to order forfeiture of the licences in certain cases. I would emphasise again that this power given to the District Court is discretionary and I am quite confident that the District Court will not use it where false or misleading information is given inadvertently.  That information could be, for example, as to the nature of the licence &mdash; it could have been stated, for example, that the licence was an on-licence where in fact it was an off-licence.  He can rest assured that the District Court will not use its power in relation to what Senator Howard called &ldquo;minute details&rdquo;.  I have also noted Senator Cregan's remarks in this connection.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary's contribution largely parallels the comments which were made by Senator Eoin Ryan.  What I have already said generally applies in this regard.  However, Senator O'Leary raises the question in regard to enforcement of the orders of the District Court in guardianship matters.  I can assure him that the difficulty here is one that has been adverted to and is having active attention.  He made a very persuasive case about it.  While I cannot promise anything absolute I would like to assure him that we will be looking at this matter.</P>
    <P>I thank all Senators for their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill has received considerable attention.  It is a long and quite complex Bill and it introduces a number of major changes in the tax system.  In addition to the budget changes, it contains a number of additional measures which are intended to encourage business activity and employment and to promote greater employee interest in share ownership. There are special provisions to encourage risk investment in industry, in line with the policies outlined in the Government's White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
      <P>When introducing this Bill in Dáil Éireann, I made a number of references to general taxation policy and I would like to repeat on this occasion the general approach underlying the Government's policies.  We gave a commitment at the outset to tax reform in our Programme for Government.  By tax reform we had principally in mind a more equitable distribution of the tax burden, reductions in the overall level of taxation as far as budget constraints would allow, and an improved system of collection.</P>
      <P>There was, and there remains, a widespread perception that our taxation levels are too high.  I share this viewpoint but, I have to recognise that, while we continue to have a high expenditure profile, tax levels will continue to be high.  Also, it is not true to claim, as some have, that we have the highest taxes in Europe. While exact comparisons are difficult to make, it is clear that some European countries have more severe tax regimes believe it or not.  Most of them, however, have a wider tax base so that, on the surface, the tax burden is not always perceived to be as high as it is here.  A choice has to be made and the degree to which taxation can be reduced is a function of our willingness to control expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks there has been a number of pronouncements on new taxation policies.  I welcome new ideas and I agree entirely that there is room for improvement and I would like to see more dialogue about taxation policies.  It is interesting to note that there are widely <Col N="924" /> diverging views about the general direction we should take.  It concerns me, however, that in some instances new taxation policies are being advocated without any serious attempt to quantify costs and benefits.  There are vague indications given that somehow the revenue lost in consequence of tax reductions will be recovered through improved economic performance, so that there will be no effect on the overall budget arithmetic. No effort has been made to acknowledge the link between tax reductions and expenditure cuts.  Frankly this line of approach is dishonest and it is unfair to the general mass of taxpayers who will have to foot the bill in the longer term. Let us have some dialogue about taxation policy by all means but we must debate in an honest fashion and cost our proposals in every case.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that self-financing tax cuts &mdash; that probably should be in inverted commas &mdash; may be put forward as the quick and painless solution to our difficulties.  This is a dangerous folly.  At best the scope for self-financing tax cuts is entirely marginal.  We have already demonstrated this.  The best illustration of this unfortunately is in the area of petrol consumption.  There has been substantial fall in petrol prices in the past year as a result of the fall in oil prices.  If self-financing tax cuts were to work one would expect to have seen a very big increase in petrol consumption, yet in the first three months of this year petrol consumption, notwithstanding its being at a lower price, is down on what it was in the first three months of 1985.  If the notion of self-financing tax cuts were true, it would have risen but it has not. That indicates that while some tax cuts may pay for themselves in the very long term the long term is very long.  As John Wayne said: &ldquo;In the long run we are all dead&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To suggest that tax reductions can be made on a wide scale without loss of revenue and a consequent impact on the budget is irresponsible.  If we offer the harrassed taxpayer the prospect of tax reductions, we have an obligation to him to say how those reductions will be <Col N="925" /> financed and how they will relate to expenditure plans.  I hope that future debate on taxation policy will be conducted on that basis.</P>
    <P>After a long period of recession, there is a welcome economic upturn.  Falling energy prices, lower interest rates and lower inflation have generated a new optimism and this will be reflected in higher investment, new job opportunities and a general improvement in business confidence.  We are fortunate in that we are well equipped competitively to take full advantage of this upturn.  We can look forward to higher living standards this year.  Inflation is currently at its lowest point since the late sixties and it should fall to about 2 per cent in the second half of the year.  Overall, the outlook is most encouraging and the Government will take maximum advantage of opportunities to increase growth and employment.  In this regard the unemployment figures for April were also very encouraging.  The unemployment figures fell again in April for the third month in succession.  The fall of 4,900 was the largest reduction in unemployment to take place in any April, as against the month of March in any year since 1971. The situation by comparison with April of the previous year represented the best performance since May 1980 &mdash; again virtually the best performance in this decade.</P>
    <P>A large part of the improvement was due to the great success of the PRSI exemption scheme.  There were 2,800 people taken on under this scheme by private employers.  I am delighted with the success of the scheme and, on becoming Minister for Finance, I made a special effort to promote it during the month of March leading up to the deadline on 5 April.  I believe that these trends will now make it possible for there to be a further downward reduction in the projection for unemployment in the year as a whole. Already this projection has been significantly reduced from what was expected earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>I must, however, also sound a note of caution.  We have had statements <Col N="926" /> recently from the Opposition benches, not in this House but in the Dáil, which imply that somehow the general economic upswing will pass us by, if we do not go for growth on an unprecedented scale, whatever that means.  Whatever it is, it is a dangerous philosophy.  It exaggerates the scope for Government-induced expansion.  More significantly, it implies that we should put aside our concern about the state of the public finances and spend without worrying about the financial consequences.  This approach is discredited.  It has caused enormous problems for us previously and it would be foolhardy to go down this road again. The economic upswing will not pass us by.  It has not passed us by.</P>
    <P>In every month for the last nine months retail sales in shops are up on what they were in the same month the previous year.  This is the longest sustained period of recovery in retail sales in this country in this decade.  That clearly indicates that people have more money in their pockets and what is more they are spending it. That is also before the full effect of the oil price reduction will be felt, before the full effect of the fall in inflation will be felt and before the increase in income, as a result of the recent wage round, will be felt and before the reductions in income tax in the budget will be felt.</P>
    <P>For the last nine months we have been on a path of increased consumer spending and that is going to increase still further. It would be a dangerous mistake for us to think that we need to spend ourselves out of the boom and to make the same mistake that was made in 1977, when we tried to spend ourselves out of a recovery into a depression by spending more, and by trying to prime the pump when it is already gushing water at a very rapid rate.  The present recovery, to a good degree, is due to the fall in oil prices. That fall came quite rapidly recently. There was, in inflation-adjusted terms, a fall over quite a considerable period up to that, when you took account of the fact that oil prices were static when others were going up.</P>
    <P>While this involved a transfer of resources to the developed industrialised <Col N="927" /> world from the oil-producing countries, it can be reversed.  Remember 1973 and 1979.  This can go in reverse.  We should not ourselves get into a situation where there is no leeway because we spent all our money when things were going well, where there is no cushion available to us if things start to go badly as they could if this process were to be reversed.  If OPEC for example, were to extend its membership and be able to control the market again by bringing in countries like Norway, Britain and Mexico that have hitherto been out of OPEC, we could quite suddenly find ourselves in an extremely exposed position where we would need our borrowing capacity and where we would need reserves to get ourselves out of the difficulties that would then ensue.  We need to manage our country prudently and not to assume, as Governments have mistakenly done, that whatever is happening at present will go on happening forever and there is no need to provide for the future.  Just as the depression we suffered in the past was inevitably not going to go on forever, the recovery, as a result of oil price falls, will not necessarily go on forever either.  We need to prudently manage our finances so that we are in a position to counteract bad times and to enjoy good times, rather than be in a position where, essentially, we have no freedom of manoeuvre because we spend it when we did not need to.</P>
    <P>If we allow our public finances to fall into disarray, if we let the borrowing requirement rise again, then we will ultimately lose the benefits to be gained from the improving situation.  We have a policy of phasing down the budget deficit gradually.  Last year the outturn was 8.2 per cent of GNP and this year we have a target of 7.4 per cent.  Likewise the Exchequer borrowing requirement is projected to fall from 12.9 per cent in 1985 to 11.8 per cent.  The latest returns show that we are on target for 1986.  It is essential that this policy of phasing down our dependance on borrowing be continued.  It does not inhibit our capacity to benefit from the improving international <Col N="928" /> outlook.  On the contrary, it is for the good of the economy that we follow such a course.</P>
    <P>The present Bill has some very significant contributions to make towards the objective of increasing growth and employment.  There are three aspects of this legislation, in particular, which I would like to highlight &mdash; (i) the reductions in personal taxation, as announced in the budget and (ii) the incentives for productive investment and the extension of tax concessions to encourage greater employee participation.  The reduction in personal taxation will lead to greater disposable income with a consequent improvement in living standards.  The tax reductions are relatively modest but what is most important is that we have now turned the corner and real incomes are on an upward trend.  The tax improvements are costing £120 million this year and £200 million in a full year and they go far beyond the commitments given in the national plan.</P>
    <P>It is essential for our economic growth that we generate higher investment by Irish people in Irish business.  We have been too conservative in this respect.  We need business growth to generate more employment and more prosperity.  In particular, we need investment in manufacturing and related activities.  These are areas of relatively high risk and it is proper that we should provide incentives for those prepared to take this risk. We also need to encourage more employee participation.  Where possible, employees should have a share in the ownership of the firm in which they work. This gives them a new perspective, and where they stand to benefit, a stronger interest in generating profits.  We must get away from the traditional mould where employers and employees stood apart.  We should look to developments in other countries where considerable progress has been made on employee participation and try to emulate the advantages that have resulted from this.  I am making a strong appeal to interested groups to consider the merits of financial involvement by employees and to avail <Col N="929" /> of the new incentives offered in this Bill and those already incorporated in earlier legislation.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the individual sections of the Bill and I will focus attention on the more significant items.  As the Bill is long and much of the text is of a technical nature, it would be impractical to speak on all sections.</P>
    <P>The early sections give effect to the income tax changes announced in the budget.  These provide for the increases in the exemption limits, the new rate bands and the changes in personal reliefs. These changes taken in conjunction with the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy will mean a substantial improvement in take-home pay for practically all workers.  For example, a single PAYE taxpayer on £12,000 will have a reduction of £320 in tax, while a married couple with two children on £16,000 will be £332 better off as a result of the tax changes and the new child benefit.  These are the most significant improvements in income tax for several years and they will give a boost to living standards.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the special circumstances of elderly people the age allowance has been doubled from £100 to £200 and the age exemption limits have been increased by 5 per cent.  The abolition of the 1 per cent income levy and the reduction of the top income tax rate to 58 per cent will, together, have a significant positive effect on key employees with highly marketable skills who might otherwise feel that there is little incentive for them to earn additional income.  Their income tax on each additional pound earned is being reduced from 61 pence to 58 pence.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of new significant incentives to encourage business.  Sections 9 and 10 provide for significant changes in relation to stock options. The current tax treatment of stock options is based on the date on which an option is first exercisable.  This may act as a disincentive for some companies to make use of stock option schemes to buy shares at below the market price and it leads to uncertainty about ultimate tax liability in this and other cases.  Provision <Col N="930" /> is being made so that, in future, in the case of stock options issued below the market price, a charge to income tax will arise at the date the option is actually exercised and capital gains tax will be payable on the difference between the market price at the date of acquisition of the shares, irrespective of the price paid for them, and the proceeds received on sale of the shares.</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to approved share option schemes, however, go much further than this.  Where options are issued at the market price, there will be no charge to income tax.  The gain on the ultimate disposal of shares will be treated as a chargeable gain for capital gains tax. In the case of options in manufacturing companies which are liable to the 10 per cent rate of tax, export sales relief and Shannon companies, the period of ownership for calculation of the capital gains tax rate will be reckoned by reference to the date on which the options are granted.</P>
    <P>In support of my belief that increased share ownership can only help to improve the general industrial climate of the country and increase the productivity of workers, I am in section 11 reducing the qualifying period for full tax relief from seven years to five for shares issued under approved profit sharing schemes.  There is also in section 12 an entirely new tax incentive to encourage employees to purchase shares.  This is intended to promote wider employee participation.  I urge firms to study the new incentives and to consider what they can do to further employee participation.  This, I believe, is a key to improved industrial relations and to closer links between management and the workforce.</P>
    <P>Given the success of the business expansion scheme, which in its first full year of operation caused some £5 million to be invested in qualifying companies, I have extended the scheme to 1991.  In 1985, some 570 investors have qualified for tax relief under the scheme.  The attractiveness of the scheme has been further enhanced with the recent launching by the Stock Exchange of the smaller <Col N="931" /> companies market.  This market will provide an additional exit mechanism for investors in the shares of qualifying companies.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill provides for a scheme of relief from full rates of income tax on dividends paid out of the income of companies qualifying for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax, in other words manufacturing companies.  The aim is to improve substantially the after-tax return to Irish shareholders in such manufacturing companies so as to provide an enhanced incentive to encourage increased equity investment from Irish sources in Irish firms.  The mechanism by which relief will be given under the new scheme is to exclude from the charge to income tax an amount equal to 50 per cent of all dividends received by individual taxpayers.  The balance of a taxpayer's dividend income will then be liable to income tax at his marginal rate after deduction of the full tax credit.  It follows that the effective rate of income tax on the distributed profits of companies qualifying for the 10 per cent rate of corporation profits tax will be 23.74 per cent. Compared with a rate of 58 per cent tax on wages this shows that investing in industry is very good value under this Bill.  The total tax take on such profits, inclusive of corporation tax in the hands of the company and income tax in the hands of shareholders, will fall from 60 per cent to 32.55 per cent under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Relief will, however, be subject to a limitation in the form of a ceiling on the amount of dividend income which may be excluded from the charge to income tax in any year.  The ceiling for each taxpayer will be set at £7,000 per annum. Given average rates of return on investment in Irish industry today, the level of relief available under the new scheme will be sufficient to enable an individual to invest a sum of almost £300,000 and still obtain the full benefit of relief.  It is, therefore, extremely generous by any standards.  By providing a facility to receive investment income of an amount up to £7,000 per annum completely free of income tax, the new relief will represent <Col N="932" /> an incentive to encourage Irish investment in qualifying companies which is unequalled in the member states of the EC and may be without parallel anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>I will just explain why that is being done.  We have relied, as a country, to too great an extent on foreign investment to make our manufacturing base grow. Irish money has tended to be tied up in relatively passive forms of investment and in relatively risk free forms of investment including Government gilts.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Bill we want to achieve a major shift in the way people use their savings, to put them instead into productive investment in the manufacturing sector which includes, of course, the food sector.  This is the way self-generating growth can be established, using Irish money to grow more jobs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must realise that we cannot rely in the future on American or Japanese investors to solve our unemployment problems.  We have also got to realise that we have a limited amount of money in the country, either in private or in public hands, and that we have got to use it to the best possible effect.  The purpose of this tax incentive is to shift money out of the safe havens and the relatively unproductive uses into the most productive use of all which is in the manufacturing sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>The intention as I said is to promote investment in manufacturing and certain other activities by permitting the benefits of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to flow through to the shareholders in qualifying companies.  If the section should be exploited as a mechanism for rewarding executives in such companies by issuing tax-relieved dividends to them in substitution for normal forms of remuneration which would attract full rates of income tax, this will be regarded as an abuse of the relief.  I wish to give fair warning now that, in the event of instances of such abuse being brought to my attention by the Revenue Commissioners, I shall not hesitate to take action against it by legislation which will have retrospective effect.  The acid test in <Col N="933" /> determining the occurrence of abuse will be whether all dividends paid are realistically related to genuine investments.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the continuation for a further year of the existing stock relief arrangements for farmers. Section 16 provides for a credit for farm tax paid against the income tax liability relating to farming profits.</P>
    <P>In chapter III there is a new mechanism designed to encourage taxpayers to invest in research and development projects, where the risk is high, but where the rewards may be equally high when they materialise.  The level of research and development in this country is disappointingly low by international standards and we must do something about this.  Expenditure in 1984 on industrial research and development in Ireland accounted for 0.4 per cent of GDP as compared to 1.2 per cent average for the OECD.  The scheme for relief for investment in research and development may appear detailed and lengthy as it is set out in the Bill.  The need for complex legislation arises in order to prevent the provisions of the scheme being abused and serving solely as a means of avoiding tax rather than facilitating the objectives of the scheme.  Such detailed legislation will also assist genuine prospective investors by removing any uncertainty as to the scope or application of the relief.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme, qualifying investors may get tax relief on up to £25,000 a year invested in a research and development company.  The investment may be short to medium term and it is unlikely that many long term investment projects will be involved.</P>
    <P>Qualifying research and development is defined in terms broadly similar to those used in the Industrial Development Act, 1969.  Because of the varied nature of the projects which it is desired to promote, it is not possible to provide a more detailed definition of &ldquo;qualifying research and development&rdquo; without running the risk of excluding some worthwhile product.  There is a requirment that the benefits of any such project must accrue substantially to this country.  In <Col N="934" /> order to encourage involvement by outside investors, the ceiling on investment by the sponsoring company, which must be a manufacturing company incorporated in this country was originally limited to 20 per cent.  On further consideration and, in the light of the commitment and risk borne by sponsoring companies I have agreed to allow them to have a greater involvement in the research and development company and I have accordingly raised the 20 per cent to 49 per cent.  This incentive will supplement the existing provisions of the business expansion scheme which may be used for raising capital for research and development in the case of a manufacturing company.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the present rates of capital gains tax are a disincentive to investment.  This Finance Bill will go a considerable way towards ensuring that this is not the case.  In addition to the planned reduction in the 40 per cent rate of capital gains tax announced in the budget, the Bill also provides for a new lower rate of 30 per cent which will apply to assets held for six years or more and also to gains made on disposal of shares on small companies which are incorporated and are resident here.  This incentive is directed in particular towards the smaller companies market which is in its infancy.  It is important that this market should succeed and open up new sources of capital to companies which could not at present qualify for quotation on the Stock Exchange.  With this in mind, the Bill provides that, for a period of three years, gains realised on trading in shares in certain companies will be subject to the 30 per cent rate.  This, I hope, will provide an impetus to the new market and will help to ensure its success.</P>
    <P>The incentives for industry in this Bill should give a major impetus to investment in an already very favourable investment climate.  There is no reason why industry should not be able to utilise this climate to create new jobs on a significant scale.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV of the Bill gives effect to the deposit interest retention tax scheme. The retention tax, as announced in the <Col N="935" /> budget, has received a mixed reaction. The financial institutions generally have welcomed it as a major step forward in harmonising the tax treatment of invested funds.  There has been criticism of the tax because of its impact on certain individuals and institutions.  The order which has now been brought to the tax treatment of deposit interest is overdue and, together with the uniform reporting arrangements, it will create an environment for fairer competition among the financial institutions.  For a long time some of these institutions have been asking for standard tax arrangements to apply across the board and this is now happening.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to clarify some aspects of the tax which appear to have been causing confusion. First, the tax is deductible from deposit interest paid or credited after 5 April 1986: it is not a tax on the capital sum invested.  Secondly, the tax does not represent double taxation since the interest earned by a capital sum is regarded as a new source of income and has always been liable to income tax in the hands of taxpayers.  Finally, there have been allegations that taxpayers will have to pay double tax on deposit interest for 1986-87.  This is not true.  As a transitional measure, the previous-year basis for taxing deposit interest is being suspended for relevant deposit accounts on 5 April 1986, and the 1985-86 liability for deposit interst will be switched to an actual basis. That is, 1985-86 liability will be based on interest paid or credited in 1985-86 only.</P>
    <P>The imposition of the tax itself will not materially alter the tax position of the bulk of depositors who are liable to income tax: the measure is a more effective tax collection system for that liability.  The tax as originally announced was to apply to the deposit interest of all resident depositors.  In granting concessions to charitable bodies, incapacitated persons and individuals aged 65 and over, I feel that the best possible balance has been reached in minimising the extent of genuine hardship while at the same time maximising the yield from the tax.  It <Col N="936" /> should not be forgotten that the tax will also apply to deposit interest paid in respect of moneys earned in the black economy.  In response to criticism concerning the potential delay in making repayments of tax, I have requested the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that the repayments procedure is operated as speedily and efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>A tax of this nature will ease considerably the administrative difficulties involved in collecting tax on deposit interest. No doubt there will be continuing demands from other bodies and groups of taxpayers to have exemptions similar to those granted to charities and older and incapacitated persons.  I must emphasise that, since exemptions are costly to administer, increase the complexity of the tax code and reduce the tax yield, there can be no question of any further concessions being granted.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was published, I said that the Government had decided to exempt the over 65s and incapacitated persons as these are the categories most likely to be solely dependent on interest for income, because of inability to engage in other income-earning activities. Obviously, there will be a small number of individuals outside these categories who may be able to make a similar case. Wherever the line is drawn, however, there is the risk of genuine cases on the wrong side of it.  Refunds for all non-liable persons cannot be considered, however, because this would be far too costly.</P>
    <P>Chapter V gives effect to the tax incentives which have been announced by the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment to promote development and reconstruction in certain designated inner city areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  The precise areas in which the incentives will apply are defined in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.  This chapter complements the Urban Renewal Bill, 1986, which provides for the establishment of a new statutory authority to promote and control development of the Custom House docks site in Dublin and for schemes of rates <Col N="937" /> remission in relation to development on that site and in the other designated areas.</P>
    <P>For many years, inner city areas of the major urban centres in Ireland have been decaying and large areas have become derelict.  For decades, there has been a significant tendency for new development to locate in suburban areas and in outer-urban areas which are perceived by the property market to be more favourable.  There has been a consequent increase in the extent of physical decay, unemployment, crime, vandalism and the dispersal of established communities in the inner city areas.  Inner-city decay also poses a continuing and increasing threat to the architectural character of urban areas.  Although public sector housing of a high standard is being provided in inner-city areas, efforts to encourage private development have had little or no success.  Activity by the private sector has, in general, been painfully slow in securing the redevelopment of inner-city areas.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill, in conjunction with the Urban Renewal Bill, 1986, represents a major effort by the Government to stimulate activity to redress this situation and I am hopeful that the private sector will now respond to the needs of the areas in question in a positive way.  A further objective of the incentives is employment creation.  I am pleased to report to the House that the anticipated activity in the designated areas, along with the activity generated by the home improvement grants and the general pickup in housing demand, have an employment potential of more than 3,000 jobs per year.</P>
    <P>Section 46 contains the promised legislation to counter abuse of limited partnership arrangements for tax avoidance purposes.  The legislation has retrospective effect from 22 May 1985, the date when my predecessor announced in this House the Government's intention to introduce such legislation.  The abuse in question arose from the fact that, in a limited partnership arrangement, the limited partners have had the right to set off losses and capital allowances arising out of the partnership trade against other <Col N="938" /> income without restriction.  Limited partners could thus circumvent their tax liabilities by manipulating in a contrived way a partnership arrangement so as to create highly inflated tax losses.  Their investment in the partnership need only have been nominal, but limited partners were in a position as a result of that investment to obtain a guaranteed return in the form of a reduction in their tax liability which could be, and most often was, a multiple of the investment.</P>
    <P>A number of instances of such blatant abuse indicated that there was a significant loss in tax revenue occurring as a consequence of limited partnership arrangements.  In these circumstances, the Government have had no alternative but to move against the abuse in the interests of tax equity.  In commending this section of the Bill to the House, I wish to put formally on record my intention to extend the scope of the proposed measure with retrospective effect to all general partnerships if these are used for the purpose of continuing the abuse which heretofore has been confined to limited partnership arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 48 provides for the application of a surcharge on ultimate tax liability where certain income returns are not received by an inspector of taxes within a specified period.  This change was announced by the Taoiseach in this House last October as part of a tax reform package.  The charge will be 10 per cent of tax ultimately payable.  This measure is aimed at improving compliance by self-employed and corporate taxpayers in submitting income returns at an early date.</P>
    <P>The ceiling on the restriction on capital allowances for business cars (and the <i>pro rata</i> restriction on the running expenses of such cars) is being increased from £3,500 to £4,000.  This is a modest increase which, of course, does not take account of the increase in the general level of car prices since the introduction of the £3,500 restriction in 1976.  This is the first time that anything has been done to increase this limit since 1976 and it is not bad in that context.  There is no doubt that a lot of distribution companies have <Col N="939" /> been very badly hit by this restriction.  It has been a common cause for complaint as Senators will agree from meeting their constituents and I feel that we are on the right path by doing something about it at this stage, however modest.  However, the cost to the Exchequer in raising the restriction to a level consistent with present prices since 1976 for appropriate cars would be quite prohibitive and it is out of the question at this time.  It would also be inequitable since it is clear that many of those who have business cars enjoy a considerable advantage over other taxpayers who must meet all their motoring expenses out of after-tax income.  This is due to the fact that the private benefit derived from a business car is subject to less income tax than monetary income.  In these circumstances, it would not be fair to ask these other taxpayers and, indeed, taxpayers who cannot afford to run a car at all &mdash; to bear the cost of a substantial increase in the restriction.</P>
    <P>For the future, I am prepared to consider raising the restriction beyond its present, revised level on the basis that the cost of doing so is matched in large part by an appropriate increase in the benefit-in-kind charges which apply in respect of the private use of business cars and by taxation of business mileage payments.</P>
    <P>Section 56 empowers the Minister for Finance to withdraw certificates entitling a company to claim relief or exemption from corporation tax in respect of certain trading operations within Shannon Airport where the Minister is of the opinion that a company is engaged in activities which amount to an abuse of the certificate, for example, tax avoidance activities.</P>
    <P>The tax benefits which are available for companies at Shannon and for their shareholders are conferred by means of certificates granted at the discretion of the Minister for Finance where he is satisfied that a project to which the tax benefits are being extended will contribute to the use and development of the airport.  The relevant legislative provisions <Col N="940" /> provide for the withdrawal of the certificates in question only if the companies in receipt of them cease trading or fail to meet any conditions which are specified in the certificates.  These conditions have invariably been of a very general nature.</P>
    <P>In the past year, my Department have become aware of at least one company established in Shannon which have abused their favoured tax status to facilitate several instances of large-scale tax avoidance.  While the company in question was persuaded to desist from this objectionable activity, it became clear in the course of dealing with this matter that a Minister for Finance when faced with such activity by a Shannon company, has insufficient powers to take in the last resort the only action which would be effective against a recalcitrant company, that is, to withdraw their certificate.  This is a serious anomaly, which could compromise the good standing of Shannon as a development centre.  It is with a view to correcting the position that this section has been included in the Finance Bill.  So as not to alarm the many responsible companies in Shannon, who might otherwise feel that their tax status is in jeopardy, the section provides for withdrawal of a certificate only in the event of a company refusing to desist from activities which they have been informed by the Minister for Finance are not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I come now to indirect taxation.  Part II of the Bill which deals with Customs and Excise mainly confirms the changes already announced in the budget.  In this regard the duty on tubes and tyres will be abolished from 1 September 1986; the duty on spare parts will be reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent on that date and abolished from 1 January 1987.</P>
    <P>Section 71 amends the betting duty legislation to strengthen the Revenue Commissioners' hands in dealing with evasion of duty in non-registered premises.  The law is being strengthened also to provide more effective measures for the Revenue Commissioners in the control of red diesel oil.  Section 77 provides <Col N="941" /> for the new rates of road tax on private motor cars announced in the budget, with effect from 1 March 1986.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill gives effect to the VAT changes announced in the budget. These comprise the increase in the standard rate to 25 per cent; the rate reduction to 10 per cent for many services currently liable at the 25 standard rate; and a measure to exempt the services supplied by dental technicians.</P>
    <P>In addition, some further measures are included.  These deal with the taxation of services received from abroad that can currently avoid tax, the use for VAT record-keeping purposes of data stored in electronic form, and the withholding of VAT repayments in certain cases involving associate companies and the application of the zero-rate to supplies of goods between VAT-registered traders in a free-port.  The existing 10 per cent rating of newspapers is being extended to benefit certain fortnightly newspapers.</P>
    <P>I confidently expect the substantial VAT reductions which come into effect on 1 July next to have positive and lasting economic benefits.  The initial response of the tourist industry to the proposed VAT reduction on meals has been very encouraging and I am sure they will capitalise on the concession to achieve maximum impact.  Taken in conjunction with the tax decreases for repair and maintenance services, body care services, cinema admissions and certain entertainment these changes represent proof of our determination to encourage employment and to fight back against those operating in the black economy.  I look forward to consumers benefiting through lower prices.</P>
    <P>This is a very deliberate policy on the part of the Government to reduce the levels of VAT on employment intensive service activities.  We had already reduced the level of VAT on hotel accommodation.  We have now reduced it on meals.  We have reduced it on the services I mentioned, cinema admissions, hairdressing and all those services that are provided and which are extremely employment intensive.  It is very important that these services be provided by <Col N="942" /> legitimate traders operating in the white economy rather than in the black.</P>
    <P>The very high levels of VAT that previously applied to these services when provided by legitimate traders represented something of an encouragement to people to go into the black economy at least, either whole time or part time. By reducing the VAT rates in this way to the reasonable level of 10 per cent we are both encouraging employment in services that are labour intensive and we are encouraging people to stay in the white economy.  This strategy, which has been pursued consistently over a number of budgets, should be recognised as such: as a strategy to depress the black economy and encourage maximum employment in the white economy.  It is beneficial generally to the development of our country and will ensure that the current recovery in the economy is trapped in Ireland by people using Irish services rather than using it on foreign holidays and exporting our money which we have gained with such difficulty.</P>
    <P>Section 93 imposes a once-off stamp duty at a rate of 9 per cent on the investment income and the profits on the realisation of investments of life assurance companies.  The life assurance companies have enjoyed extremely favourably taxation arrangements and this special duty is intended to recoup to the Exchequer some of the tax revenue foregone under these arrangements.  A further reason for this new charge is that there would be an unfair competitive advantage for life assurance investment if the tax regime applicable to it remained unchanged at a time when a retention tax is being imposed on deposit interest.</P>
    <P>Since a special tax imposition may sometimes present particular difficulties for the sector affected, it has been decided to reduce the impact of the charge, as originally announced in the budget, in a number of respects.  The rate of duty is being reduced from 15 per cent to 9 per cent, industrial branch business and business relating to credit unions are being exempted in addition to pension and foreign branch business, and the final <Col N="943" /> 10 per cent of the duty will not fall to be paid until mid-1987.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, this charge will not apply for future years.  Instead, changes in the corporation tax rules applicable to life assurance companies are incorporated in this Bill.  These will provide no additional tax yield of consequence in the short term but they hold out the prospect of a reasonable yield in the longer term.  Up to now the tax contribution from the life assurance industry has been disappointingly small and a higher contribution will be expected for the future.</P>
    <P>Section 101 provides for the continuation of the stamp duty exemption for transfers of agricultural land to young trained farmers.  I am conscious of the fact that this scheme has, in the past four years, facilitated the transfer of land to young farmers but I am also conscious of the fact that its indefinite extension would remove the urgency for an early transfer of land and so would defeat the object of the scheme.  Accordingly, the Bill provides that the scheme will expire at the end of September next year and that, for the final 12 months of its operation, the age limit will be reduced from 35 to 30 years and the qualifying ACOT courses will be extended from 100 hours to 150 hours. This will give an added urgency to the need for an early transfer of land and will also encourage more in-depth agricultural training, both of which should lead to an improvement in agricultural productivity.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives effect to the decision announced in the budget to impose a 1 per cent annual charge on those discretionary trusts which were made subject to the 3 per cent once-off charge introduced in the 1984 Finance Act.  The charge is directed at those trusts which are set up essentially to avoid or delay indefinitely the payment of capital acquisitions tax.  As such it will not apply where the disponer is still alive and any one of the principal beneficiaries is under 25 years of age.  I do not feel that a charge of 1 per cent is in any sense excessive or that it is a threat to the viability of any <Col N="944" /> ongoing business concern.  If, over a period of time, a return of greater than 1 per cent per annum cannot be secured from the assets in a trust economic pressures should force an adjustment.  The effect of the tax might even be to speed up this adjustment.</P>
    <P>Section 115 of the Bill provides that the holder of a fixed charge on the book debts of a company may be liable for the tax arrears of the company in certain circumstances.  A recent Supreme Court decision &mdash; the Keenan case &mdash; which confirmed the validity of a fixed charge held on the book debts of a company has had the effect of seriously undermining the position of the Revenue and other preferential creditors in a liquidation situation.  The purpose of this provision is to deter the creation of fixed charges on book debts.  The fixed charge holder's liability is confined to arrears of PAYE and VAT and the provision only encompasses charges taken out after enactment of the legislation.  Failure to act on this matter would leave approximately £10 million of tax revenue per annum at major risk.</P>
    <P>This Bill is quite complex and it would not be feasible to explain all the details in an opening address.  I have touched briefly on the more significant items and, in the course of the debate, particularly on the Committee Stage, there will be opportunities to go into more detail.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>There are a number of items which I think are very important in this Bill.  First there is a major incentive to profit sharing and worker shareholding in industry. Secondly, there is a major incentive to research and development being undertaken by Irish industry.  Our big failure has been that we have not done enough research on new products.  Old products will not do five years from now.  Thirdly, there is a major incentive to people to put their money into manufacturing and the food processing industry creating wealth rather than putting it elsewhere. Fourthly, there are major tax incentives to urban renewal in our major cities. Fifthly, there is a further incentive to encourage farmers to transfer land to <Col N="945" /> younger farmers to increase productivity. These are probably the most important highlights of the Bill which I would like to bring to the attention of the Seanad.  I hope that the Bill will be strongly supported by the speakers in the debate.</P>

      <P>I will start to ensure that I retain my place.  I would like to welcome the Minister.  He has been here before and, being a young man, it is quite likely he will be here again.  In approaching this Bill we should remember certain basic facts about our economy and try to get the financial position into perspective. We have to start by realising &mdash; it is not necessary for me to point it out as everyone in the country is conscious of it &mdash; that we are at present a very highly taxed people, higher than most other countries in the world.  The position would simply not be tolerable were it not for the assumption at least that it cannot last forever.  Most people carry on under very severe taxation on the assumption that it will improve, that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  I hope that is true but sometimes I wonder if it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain historical and demographical factors underlying the position we find ourselves in.  These accentuate our basic problem but they are not by any means the only reasons why we find ourselves in difficulties.  We must realise that there is little real wealth in this country, in the sense that most European countries have it.  We did not have colonies in the past through which most countries accumulated a great deal of wealth. In fact, we were in a sense a colony and any money of that kind was going out of the country rather then coming in.  We did not have the benefit of the industrial revolution because we were not allowed <Col N="946" /> to have it.  These are two areas in which the kind of wealth which exists in other European countries does not exist here.</P>
    <P>The second fact I would like to mention is the very high dependency rate.  We have a very high dependency rate in the sense of the number of people who actually work as compared with the number of people depending on them because there are some large families and these depend on the wage earner more so than other European countries.  This dependency rate has been exacerbated by unemployment.  The end result is that we have a very narrow tax base.</P>
    <P>The third matter I would like to mention is the ratio of employees as compared with self-employed.  I am not sure of the present figure.  A few years ago the figure was something of the order of only 25 per cent for employees as compared with the self-employed.  In the UK something like 75 per cent were employees as compared with the self-employed.  This means that it is more difficult to collect tax.  It lends itself to a black economy.  Certainly a black economy exists.  This restricts the tax base and means for those who can be caught in the net the taxes are higher. This is a kind of cause and effect.  As people find that taxes are higher and higher, they do everything in their power to get outside the net to enter the balck economy.  These are three factors which contribute to the present situation, which to a considerable extent have been caused by ourselves.  The effect of high taxes on the economy is very serious.  It means the incentive for employees to work is undermined.  For the entrepreneur it means that profits as opposed to risks and frustrations of starting a business or even continuing a business are marginal indeed.  Many people, when asked if they would start a new business say &ldquo;you would want to have a hole in your head to do so at present&rdquo;.  Luckily there are people who go into business and stay in business.</P>
    <P>High taxes have a serious effect on exports.  It is very difficult to be competitive in these circumstances.  In spite of these great difficulties our exports record is very good.  I hope it will continue to <Col N="947" /> surmount the difficulties which exist because of high taxes.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is seriously handicapped because rising inputs are going ahead of prices which are falling behind.  The tourist industry is also undermined by high prices and taxation.  Apart from the difficulties imposed in regard to tourists from the United States, our high prices are given as reasons why people are reluctant to come here.</P>
    <P>Over and above all these sectors of the community for the man in the street it all adds up to a dramatic effect on the quality of life.  When I say quality of life I am not talking of luxuries.  I am talking about basic things, food, drink, household goods and so on.  The cost of living here is much higher than in many other countries.  A motor car is now a luxury because almost half the price of a motor car is made up of various forms of taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the effect of the very high taxes we are experiencing at present.  We should look at why these taxes are levied, what they are spent on and whether there is a necessity for all the taxes that are levied.  They way taxes are spent can be divided into four different areas.  There are the essential and justifiable services, social welfare, health, education and basic administration.  Nobody doubts that taxes have to be provided for these services and it is proper that that should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second category is the services which come under the heading of essential services but are really unnecessary, wasteful or irrelevant.  We are inclined to think that because something is spent under the Votes for Social Welfare, Health or Education that it must be necessary and that it cannot be objected <Col N="948" /> to.  In all of these areas there is unnecessary and wasteful spending and some of the things done under these headings are irrelevant and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>There is the other category where the service provided is no longer necessary, if it was ever necessary.  There are bodies and areas of expenditure which go on and on because nobody has had the initiative to abolish them.  These have to be looked at very carefully.  The fourth area is servicing the national debt.</P>
    <P>I have no criticism in regard to the first category &mdash; social welfare, health, education and so on.  These services must be maintained.  As regards the second, every possible effort must be made to eliminate areas which are not really necessary.  Every way of approaching this must be availed of, including the fact that salaries in some of these areas simply cannot continue to escalate.</P>
    <P>Regarding the third category, I mentioned bodies or services which are continued out of habit.  There is a custom in one of the states of the United States that each of these bodies have to justify their existence annually.  They have to appear before a committee of the legislature and make a case as to why they should continue in existence.  It may be that at one time they were fulfilling some useful function but because of a change in events they were not necessary any longer and should be abolished.  This is a kind of approach which could be introduced into this country.  Every body of a marginal nature should be examined and should have to show why it is necessary to carry on.  We would probably find a few mortalities if this approach was introduced.</P>
    <P>The fourth category I mentioned was the national debt.  It is one of the major problems we have and one of the major reasons why we have such high taxation. The servicing of the national debt now absorbs more than one-third of our taxes. It is an appalling burden but one which we have little option but to face up to, to face up to what has happened in the past but by no means to accept that we are going to allow it to get any higher in the future.  In the present Finance Bill debt <Col N="949" /> servicing amounts to almost 29 per cent of current budget expenditure.  The current budget deficit is almost 16 per cent of budget expenditure.  If we had not accumulated the huge debt which we have at present we would have no deficit in the present budget and we would be able to cut taxes by approximately £1 billion per year.  That helps to put into perspective the kind of mess we are in because of the huge debt we have accumulated over the years.</P>
    <P>It is not much use crying over spilt milk or dwelling at any great length on the reasons for our present position but we should look briefly at how the debt arose and who was responsible.  Strange as it may now appear, borrowing to pay current expenditure did not exist up to 1972. That is a mere 14 years ago.  In the 1972 budget, during the time of a Fianna Fáil Government, £5 million was borrowed for current expenditure.  It was a very small amount and it was done for the first time in 1972.  It was the Coalition Government of 1973-77 who really introduced borrowing for current expenditure as a regular feature of fiscal policy.  It was done during these years regularly and with ever-increasing figures and this set the country on the slippery slope the effects of which we are complaining of at present.  For current expenditure, the Coalition borrowed £10 million in 1973, £92 million in 1974, £259 million in 1975, £201 million in 1976 and £201 million in 1977.  That was the period when borrowing for current expenditure was introduced as normal fiscal policy.</P>
    <P>The effect of all this borrowing was that the national debt which was £1.42 billion when Fianna Fáil went out in 1972 had become £4.2 billion at the end of the Coalition period in 1977.  The national debt had trebled during those four years and had increased in figures by approximately £3 billion.  Between 1977 and 1981, during a Fianna Fáil period of office, the national debt went up to almost £10 billion, an increase of £6 billion.  Then, there were two short periods of office in 1981-82, Fianna Fáil followed by the Coalition, during which time it would be impossible to allocate responsibility <Col N="950" /> because they were such short periods. During the period of the present Government the national debt has gone up by over £9 billion.  What is much worse is that the foreign debt is now considerably in excess of £8 billion.  Foreign debt is a much more serious matter from the point of view of balance of payments and so on than borrowing domestically.  It is now over £8 billion.  If you look at it in perspective, in 1973 when Fianna Fáil went out the foreign borrowing was £126 million as compared with well over £8 billion at present.  To look at the position in perspective, to look at how the national debt increased during the period since 1973, it increased by £6 billion under Fianna Fáil Governments and by £12 billion under Coalition Governments.  The responsibility of Coalition Governments is twice as much as that of Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>This Government have increased the national debt in the last four years by £9 billion and they are the people who used lecture us about fiscal rectitude but they say very little about it now, which is understandable in the light of the figures I have just given.  The tragedy is that for the £9 billion borrowed by the present Government since 1973 they have little or nothing to show for it.  Unemployment has gone up from 12 per cent to approximately 17 per cent.  There is no improvement in the economy.  Almost nobody is even as well off as he was in 1973 in spite of the tremendous borrowing that has taken place during that time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his budget presentation went to great pains to show that the financial situation was being brought under control.  He said that Exchequer borrowing requirements were being reduced from 12.9 per cent of GNP to 11.8 per cent, that public sector borrowing requirements were reduced from 15¾ per cent of GNP to 14¼ per cent and the current budget deficit from 8.2 per cent to 7.4 per cent.  All of this is very welcome but it tends to disguise the fact that borrowing for current expenditure is still going on at a very high rate.  The total Exchequer borrowing for 1986 for current expenditure is £2 billion.  The £9 <Col N="951" /> billion that I have mentioned is up by another £2 billion.  The Government may say it is improving in one way but it is still going on at a very high rate.  The Government said that they hoped by cutting expenditure to deal with this problem.  They have not succeeded in bringing expenditure under control.</P>
    <P>Expenditure continues at a very high rate.  Increases in salaries continue at a very high rate.  The Government at the beginning of their term of office talked about a wage freeze but the wage freeze has gradually melted and wages and salaries are going up, expenditure is going up.  Total Exchequer borrowing for 1986 is £2 billion to add to the appalling burden that has already been laid on the neck of the taxpayer.  The fact is we are going deeper and deeper into the financial swamp.  One could not overestimate the extent to which this is happening.  The Government assures us that we are travelling at an increasingly decreasing pace.  It is like one of those exciting wild west movies.  Will our runaway stage coach be brought to a halt before reaching a part of the swamp in which it will sink without trace?  It will certainly be a close thing, it certainly will be a cliffhanger.</P>
    <P>Anybody looking at the position at present would have very considerable doubt as to whether we can recover from the financial situation in which we find ourselves.  What is certain about the position is that there are no easy options. There is no facile way of restoring the State finances to a healthy condition.  It can only be done by cutting State expenditure to the minimum without abandoning the services which are genuinely essential and, having done that, making sure that we do not get into the same position again.  It would be out of the question to increase taxes any more.  The Government have undertaken not to do so but then the Government have undertaken not to do a number of things which they have ended up by doing during the past few years.</P>
    <P>We must accept that if any improvements in finances is to be achieved, if any <Col N="952" /> recovery from our position is to achieved, there can be little real decrease in taxes during the next two to three years.  After that, if what has to be done is done, then it may be possible to move from our unenviable position as one of the highest taxed people, in the world.  It is a bleak outlook and no easier to bear because we brought it on ourselves.  We brought it on ourselves by living beyond our means, by providing ourselves with goods and services worth far more than we had earned as a nation.  The only good thing is that perhaps we have learned a lesson. If we have not learned a lesson then there is little hope for us and even less hope for our children.</P>
    <P>To be a little more cheerful about the situation there are a number of features in the Bill which I welcome.  I welcome the increases in social welfare which will at least offset the effect of inflation.  I welcome the decrease in VAT on food which will certainly be of benefit to the tourist industry and help to offset some of the serious problems it has at present and it will also be of benefit to the man in the street if the decrease is passed on. The reduction on duty on motor vehicles, spare parts and tyres is welcome and also the incentive for investment in research and development.  I think this is a particularly good initiative.  It is something which can be of considerable benefit.  The reduction in tax on dividends for manufacturing firms will also be of benefit.</P>
    <P>There are features in the Finance Bill which can be welcomed.  The present Minister has shown some understanding of the problems of taxpayers, an understanding which his predecessor did not appear to have, nor some of the mandarins in the Department of Finance.  I think he knows that there is a real world out there, a tough world where thousands of people are trying to make a living in commerce, in industry and agriculture, facing the vicissitudes of commercial life, the fierce competition at home and abroad, the frustrations of red tape, the delays of officialdom and the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.  They do not expect much from a Minister for Finance but would like to think that he was <Col N="953" /> at least doing the best he could for them rather than thinking up the worst he could.  After all, without them there would be no taxes and very little for the Minister or the Department to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the opportunity which has been too long delayed for this House to discuss the Finance Bill, 1986, and in doing so to touch upon the financial proposals made and discussed and passed by the other House on the budget.  It does not fall to this House to consider the details of the budget and the expenditure of the State except in so far as it requires the enactment of legislation such as this legislation which is before us.  As other speakers, including the Minister, have recognised the discussion on Second Stage of the Finance Bill must of necessity range a little bit broader than the provisions of the Bill.  The provisions of the Bill are a response rather than a policy.  They are a response to the needs created by the demands for goods and services in the State, and the necessity for taxation must always be seen in the context of meeting a corresponding need or perceived need for the provision of services within the community.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the continuing problem of the current budget deficit.  In doing so I recognise the points made by the Minister with regard to the reduction in the deficit as a percentage of GNP. That is true and represents some progress but the progress is very modest.  While this Government have been quite successful and considerably more successful than their predecessors of all parties since the 1970s in reversing the trend, they have not gone far enough at all in coming to terms with the problems of the permanent expenditure implications of the kind of policies which were pursued with such apparent abandon during the 1970s and well into the 1980s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction of the current budget deficit from 8.2 per cent to 7.4 per cent represents a very modest achievement.  I feel it is only right that we should put on record that the reduction in the budget deficit can only be achieved by either <Col N="954" /> an increase in taxation or a reduction in public expenditure.  The Minister demonstrated very forcibly this morning that the opportunities for what has been loosely termed self-financing subsidies or self-financing tax cuts are very limited and therefore we are forced back to the inevitable conclusion that we must either increase taxation or reduce expenditure.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's philosophy that this country is already overtaxed.  I also accept the rationale of what he says: that we are not as heavily taxed as other countries.  However, the way our tax is structured means that the taxes bear very heavily on those who are at work and bears very heavily on the income of those who are earning.</P>
    <P>An examination of the amount of taxation in a country must take into the account the stage of economic development of a country.  Bearing in mind the stage of economic development which this country is at we are the highest taxed country in Europe.  Other countries have a higher percentage of their gross national product raised by way of taxation but they are at a different stage of economic development than ourselves and in addition to that, and probably more importantly, it is raised in a different way.  Greater use is made of expenditure taxation revenue, collecting methods which are based on VAT and similar type schemes.  Less use is made in their tax code of exceptions and exemptions so, as a result of this different tax discipline, it is not necessary to apply rates of taxation of over 60 per cent at very modest levels of income.  I think this Government and any other Government which might in time replace them will be failing in their duty unless they put as a very high priority the reduction of the marginal rates of tax on those who are at work.  That has a very high priority indeed.  I will refer to that later.</P>
    <P>The historical exposition of the problem as outlined by Senator Eoin Ryan is indeed accurate, but of course, he over-simplifies the importance of those early years and certainly under-emphasises the very real change that took place <Col N="955" /> in the nature of our deficit spending, in the nature of our expenditure and our deficits during the period of the Fianna Fáil administration from 1977-81.  If you go back to the original £5 million which he said was the amount of the current budget deficit planned for in the year 1972 and indeed the £10 million in 1973 &mdash; both of which figures I have not checked myself but I accept their accuracy &mdash; that was done in a way in which there was some expectation that in the normal growth of the economy that current budget deficit would be wiped out.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficits in 1974-77 which escalated quite substantially were only a reflection of what was happening in the whole of the western world in response to the first oil crisis.  It was a completely proper use of deficit funding for the Government of the day to try to keep the economy moving by that deficit policy.  It should be recognised, and I have no doubt it has been recognised by Senator Eoin Ryan, that in the latter end of that period of time the conclusion had been come to by the Government that that period of budget deficits should come to an end, should be phased out.  The reduction between 1975 and 1977 shows that the Government of that day had the political will to bring about that change in direction, with the coming to an end of the first period of economic shock for the western world as a result of the first oil crisis.</P>
    <P>A much more serious problem arose during 1977 to 1981.  That was because the nature of the increase deficits during that period of time was such that they created a permanent expectation of deficit spending for the future and built into the system the automatic continuation of deficits.  That is where the problem arose between 1977 and 1981.  Whole areas of revenue-raising were abolished. Rates were abolished; road tax was abolished and above all the public service employee pay bill was expanded dramatically.</P>
    <P>All of these actions together meant that automatic deficits were being planned by the Government of that time, not <Col N="956" /> only in respect of its own period of office, but they were being planned and were inevitable in respect of future periods of office.  What Senator Eoin Ryan had to say with regard to the freedom and flexibility which would have been available if we did not have to repay the money which we borrowed during that period is very instructive.  It proves that this Government are providing enough money through taxation to meet their current budget deficit.  What it cannot do and must borrow money at ever-increasing rates for is to provide for the problem which was created by the initiation of policies during that period of time, which led inevitably to increasing current budget deficits.</P>
    <P>To abolish something like rates and to replace it with nothing is not only to create a problem in respect of that year, but is to create a problem in respect of that year for which borrowing will be necessary and the following year a problem in respect of that year itself plus the funding of the money borrowed in the previous year.  A geometric problem is created by the abolition of revenue-raising possibilities and no funding by any alternative means.</P>
    <P>That having been said it is great fun to be blaming Fianna Fáil for those things and only right and proper that they should be blamed because it would appear that they are hell-bent on trying to produce for the next election a policy document which will be a repeat of their 1977 manifesto.  It is only right and proper that the people should be warned not to be fooled a second or a third time in respect of this kind of nonsense.  The present responsibility rests with this Government and there are a few things which this Government have done for which they should be taken to task.  In doing so, I do so as an individual Senator rather than speaking on behalf of my party.</P>

      <P>I suppose you will win the next time.  It is one-all and you will go ahead two-one the next time.  The level of public sector pay settlements, not only in respect of this year and the coming year, but in respect of a number of years past, is daft.  This applies more in respect of the present settlement than in respect of any other settlement.  It was fairly daft all along.  It is very hard to explain that to people when you have high levels of inflation, but, to have proposals for a basic 7 per cent increase over a period of time when the level of inflation will not reach 7 per cent, what in effect you are saying is that we are going to transfer resources from the private sector of the economy to the public sector of the economy and that that is the policy which should be pursued for the well-being of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me in the present economic climate and with the kind of budget deficit which we have and the levels of taxation we have, that is a daft policy.  I would be enthralled if there was any political party in this country, whether it was my own political party or any other political party, who would tackle this problem and who would face it.  It is quite obvious that the two parties in Government, while they are conscious of the problem, are unwilling to grasp that nettle.  It is obvious that Fianna Fáil have no intention of grasping the nettle, as during the course of the recent teachers' dispute, they said they would pay whatever was necessary to get them back to work.  That kind of policy is even more than daft.  I doubt the political <Col N="958" /> capacity or indeed the determination of the PDs to grasp this nettle as I think that their performances on local authorities throughout the country, which many Members of this House will be aware of, is that they have backed down from tackling the problems created by the proposed abolition of the various service charges.  I am not passing comment one way or the other on the merits or demerits of service charges.  They were unwilling to make public expenditure cuts to match the policy implications or inevitable implications of the revenue-raising cuts which they were proposing to make.  So I doubt their sincerity or their political capacity to act in that area.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I am glad that the Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service is present to hear me saying this. Again, it is a personal view.  The continued existence of the public service arbitrator is causing a considerable problem for this Government.  It caused problems for the last Government and it will cause problems for the next Government.  Irrespective of the original intention of the scheme, it is being used for the purpose of establishing a leap frogging mechanism whereby in addition to the increases negotiated by way of a general pay round, additional special increases are being awarded on the spurious argument that in some way people in the public service are falling behind those in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The Government should seriously consider asking the public service arbitrator to look at some grades in the public sector and compare them with what has happened in the private sector in the past few years.  If this was done, inevitably the conclusion would be reached that these people are being overpaid and special pay decreases would be the order of the day rather than special pay increases.  As a country, we are are not tackling the problem.  If Fianna Fáil did it, they would have my full support.  I know in my heart and soul they will not do it.  This is the problem we are faced with.  We are devoting an ever-increasing percentage of our gross national product to the public sector control and we are not getting increased <Col N="959" /> service for it.  The result is that we are getting more civil servants providing the same service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a cut of 3,000 in the past four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>A cut of 3,000 in the number of civil servants and a dramatic increase in what they are being paid.  The reductions which we are talking about in the numbers of civil servants, even if they went on for another 15 years, would still not bring us back to the 1977 level.  I am not viewing this proposal on one year as compared with the previous year.  It is being viewed over a long period of time: there are increases.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that there is resistance at every Department level to any reduction in the numbers employed.  Is there any Department that ever went to the Department of the Public Service and said that they could reduce the number of people employed, for example, even by one?</P>
      <P>I noticed that Mr. David Stockman, the recently resigned Budget Director in the United States, said such a proposal for a reduction in expenditure never came to him from any Department in the US. I suspect that precisely the same applies in Ireland.  We may ask the question: where are we going?</P>
      <P>I am not just talking about this Government, but politicians will have to get their act together and recognise that if we want to reduce personal taxation which is the objective we share, while at the same time wanting to preserve the proper level of public service, it must be done by a sensible re-organisation of our resources. It must be done by people who put forward a policy of a reduction in personal taxation taking the consequences of the inevitable reductions in levels of public expenditure which must take place.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech, I am glad to say, committed himself to a policy of reduced taxation.  I will quote briefly as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was and there remains a widespread <Col N="960" /> perception that our taxation levels are too high.  I share this viewpoint but I have to recognise that while we continue to have higher expenditure profiles, tax levels will continue to be high.</P>
    <P>I have been seeking to get successive Ministers for Finance &mdash; and I hope to ask this Minister the same question during Committee Stage of this Bill &mdash; to say what level of personal taxation they think is appropriate?  I am not suggesting that they should automatically introduce it or that it is possible to do so, but where are we going or what are their policies?</P>
    <P>With the present level of personal taxation over 60 per cent &mdash; taking levies into account, it is effectively over 60 per cent in marginal terms &mdash; it is reasonable to ask the Minister what is his objective. I know that I would be working towards a top rate, inclusive of all levies, of not more than 50 per cent.  I do not think anybody should pay more than 50 per cent of their marginal income in taxation. This is a reasonable objective and allows much flexibility to the Government with regard to the raising of taxation.  We should be aiming for a standard rate of 30 per cent in the present climate.  This is a reasonable objective also.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to a number of the provisions of the Finance Bill in detail and give the Minister some indication of the amendments I will be moving at Committee Stage.  We might even create a record during the course of this debate on the Finance Bill and get a recommendation accepted &mdash; I would not be too hopeful on that count.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme which the Minister refers to is indeed quite successful.  He has indicated that he now proposes to extend the scheme up to 1991.  That is a worthwhile proposal.  I contributed in a small way to an investment under the business expansion scheme recently which had the effect of saving from going out of business a very important, if small, Cork industry.  I think that the provisions which the Minister has made for favourable pre-taxation treatment has already quite a beneficial effect <Col N="961" /> on employment in the manufacturing industry.  I welcome the Minister's continued commitment to its future.</P>
    <P>I have no great time indeed for the motor lobby in this House, generally speaking, &mdash; I do not mean the people involved &mdash; and their method of approaching the problem.  It would be churlish of us not to accept as unrealistic the limit of £3,500 which is the ceiling applied under the corporation tax code in respect of motor cars used for business purposes.  I say this, not only because the cost of a car is considerably in excess of £3,500 but because the provision has been extended over the years to include, not only the £3,500 in so far as that is the notional cost of the car, but also to mean that the proportion by which the cost of the car exceeds £3,500 establishes a ratio. That ratio of expenditure incurred in the running of the car is disallowed for tax purposes.  That makes no sense at all. I have no great time for the Minister's argument that in some way a further improvement from the new level of £4,000 which he proposes should be in some way linked to changes in the benefit-in-kind provision.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem with regard to the £3,500 limit relates to expenses incurred properly in the running of business motor vehicles.  It relates in no way to the personal benefit which is available and is availed of by the actual person driving the car when he uses it at night or at weekends.  Under this provision, I have seen many examples &mdash; I am a director of one such company &mdash; where the company made a loss in the year in the ordinary trading terms but because of the application of this rule and because of disallowing expenditure in respect of company cars, they ended up paying corporation tax for that year.  This not sensible.  While I recognise that it is expensive to eliminate it, there are certain things which the Minister can do to ameliorate those problems.  I will be asking him to look more closely at that and to examine his conscience with regard to the justice of that case.</P>
    <P>Section 48 of the Bill &mdash; and it is difficult to have the sections right as the Bill <Col N="962" /> was passed by the other House only last evening and the numbers were changed &mdash; deals with what I can only call the most extraordinary piece of anti-avoidance legislation that I have ever come across. It proposes that in certain circumstances &mdash; and they are not exceptional circumstances &mdash; a surcharge of 10 per cent would be made on a taxpayer who was late with his returns.  That appears to me to be a most extraordinary provision.  I think the Minister would be well advised to have a look at it.  While I have no objection to people being forced to make their returns and make them properly, to propose that as a penalty a person should pay a surcharge of an extra 10 per cent because they are a day late with their return is in my opinion an extraordinary provision.  In those circumstances, section 48 must be looked at.</P>
    <P>Section 42, taking them in no particular order, deals with the allowances which are available in respect of reconstruction of certain commercial premises.  Basically what is happening is that designated areas are being established and these areas are in major cities.  There is a kind of super-designated area being created in the Dublin Customs dock area.  Within that area it appears that certain tax reliefs will be available in respect of developments which are of a mixed kind, partly commercial and partly residential.  It would appear that in respect of the other qualifying areas that provision will not be available and that the allowance will only be available where the total building or structure is commercial.  That would have the effect that if, for example, one was doing a development in one of these areas which had a shop on the ground floor and offices on the first, second and third floors and residential accommodation on the top floor &mdash; which very often is a planning requirement particularly in the Dublin area &mdash; one would lose his allowances. That appears to me to be quite restrictive against the policy which the Minister is pursuing by other allowances elsewhere of encouraging people to build residences in or near centre city areas.  I think section 42 therefore has to be looked at and I am sure we will get an opportunity of <Col N="963" /> examining that during the course of its passage through the House.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters I would like to refer the Minister to.  I may have spoken about one of them in this House before.  This Finance Bill and every other Finance Bill superimposes on top of the existing core of legislation new and additional provisions and fits them into the overall structure.  Very often it does so by amending the Income Tax Act, 1967; sometimes by amending the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 and doing other various things and in addition to that there is a bit left over every year which really does not fit into any section and which is part of the income tax code in its own right.  Part of that procedure which is dealt with in this Bill relates to the question of appeal.  The Minister should be given fair warning of what I will be proposing in that regard.  The whole thrust of this Finance Bill and indeed of other Finance Acts to which I have contributed during my short period of time in the Oireachtas has been to tighten up very much on the possibilities for avoidance and evasion of tax.  I think that is only right and proper.</P>
    <P>Considerable additional powers had to be given to the Revenue Commissioners to enable that to happen.  What we have not looked at as closely is the way in which these existing powers are being used by the Revenue Commissioners.  I will give one example.  Where somebody is dissatisfied with his assessment &mdash; assessments are referred to in this Bill &mdash; he can appeal to the appeal commissioners and if he is dissatisfied with the determination of the appeal commissioners he can appeal to the Circuit Court.  On the appeal to the appeal commissioner there is no mechanism by which the taxpayer can have that case heard in a reasonable period.  It is totally within the control of the Revenue authorities to decide when that appeal will be heard. Sometimes that is not very serious.  It is annoying and it is delay and is administratively inconvenient for the taxpayer but a very serious problem can arise at the <Col N="964" /> next stage where a determination which is sometimes unfavourable to the taxpayer is made by the appeal commissioner.</P>
    <P>At that stage the tax becomes due. When that tax becomes due, the taxpayer has to pay the tax or else be at risk with regard to interest.  He is under an obligation to pay tax and he can appeal the case to the Circuit Court.  At that stage the Revenue commissioners are under no obligation to list the case before the Circuit Court in any specified period.  They can delay five months, six months or six years.  They can literally delay it for years and make use of the person's money in the meantime.  They can delay it so as to try to bring about a situation where they test the point which is being disputed by the taxpayer in a case and is a forum in which they feel more comfortable.  That has very grave implications.  I will be moving a series of amendments which will have the effect of ensuring that where there is an undue delay the appeal commissioners themselves on the one hand, in their case, and the Circuit Court on the other in its case, would have the right to intervene and to insist that after a reasonable length of time had elapsed the matter would be heard.  I will be proposing amendments along these lines.</P>
    <P>In section 116 of the new, up-to-date Bill as passed by the other House it is proposed to change the Income Tax Act, 1967 and in particular section 161 thereof.  That section imposes certain obligations on inspectors of taxes and makes them liable for dismissal and for fines if they fail to do certain things.  What it is proposed to do in effect is to remove that threat.  Section 116 deals with the question of the appointment of inspectors of taxes about which I will speak also.  In section 161 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 the Minister was given the responsibility for the appointment of all inspectors of taxes.  It is proposed to transfer that to the Revenue Commissioners and I have certain things to say on that which I am sure the Minister will consider at that time.</P>
    <P>There is another section, which I cannot find at the moment but I am sure <Col N="965" /> the Minister will be aware of it, in which it is proposed to restate certain obligations which the inspectors of taxes have in connection with the duty to properly assess and properly determine taxation.  Under the main Act in such circumstances the inspector of taxes who negligently or fraudulently does that job &mdash; certainly who fraudulently does it &mdash; is liable to a fine and liable to dismissal.  For some unexplained reason, it is proposed to remove the possibility of dismissal for a person who deliberately changes or undercharges taxation on a taxpayer. This is quite a serious change in the law which is not being properly highlighted in the memorandum we have before us.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer and to which the Minister will no doubt address himself on Committee Stage is the reduction in the rate of interest which is payable on refunds of tax.  There was a long discussion of this in the Dáil and I do not think it is necessary for us to go into it at this stage.  It is an area where undoubtedly the Minister will be questioned in this House.  I feel that he should be forewarned as to our intentions in that regard.</P>
    <P>In general, while it would appear that the Finance Bill, as proposed to us this year, does not contain as many fundamental changes as were proposed in the past, there are individual changes which will require careful consideration on Committee Stage in this House.  I should say that there is also a problem with regard to the definition of premises dealing with the changes in the bookmaking regulations included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>To return to the general point that while the Minister's decision to reduce the levels of personal taxation in line with the proposals set out by the Government since it came to office are welcome, it would be foolish of us not to recognise that in sticking so closely to those proposals the Government have been unable for one reason or another &mdash; I think it is really a failure of will on the part of the community and a failure of will on the part of the Government &mdash; to stick to the <Col N="966" /> targets which have been set by them for the control of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>This applies particularly in the area of public sector pay.  If the Minister is to succeed in further reducing the level of personal taxation down towards the thresholds of 50 per cent and 30 per cent to which I earlier referred, that can only be achieved if the Minister is willing to take his courage in his hands &mdash; and the Government as a unit is willing to take their courage in their hands &mdash; and challenge the conspiracy of high public sector pay which is confronting us as such a serious threat to our financial stability as a nation.</P>
    <P>I have confidence that this Minister &mdash; no more than the last one &mdash; and the Government share the objectives which I have laid out as being desirable.  I am a little concerned whether they have the capacity to persuade their colleagues in Cabinet, their political parties and the Opposition &mdash; because that is a very important portion of it &mdash; that the national solvency demands that this problem would be tackled in the only realistic way, which is to reduce public expenditure so as to achieve the objective of reduced taxation levels to which we all aspire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the changes that the Minister for Finance has brought and also Senator O'Leary's comments about grasping the nettle and about the county councils, which I am not particularly familiar with &mdash; I am only familiar with my own.  He labels the Progressive Democrats in the same way as he does Fianna Fáil.  This would, I presume, be a compliment for us by acknowledging that we are in existence and we probably will be a force in the future.  It is good to be recognised as such by Senator O'Leary. To return to the Finance Bill he places three items in the correct order of equitable distribution of the tax burden, reduction in the overall level of taxation as far as constraints will allow and the improvement in the system of collection.  He is logically correct.  He specifies it as it is. There remains, as the Minister said, the situation that our taxes are too high.  He <Col N="967" /> accepts that and the country accepts it. Indeed, the PAYE worker would accept that his taxes are too high while he feels other people get away with not paying tax.  The Minister says the way to decrease the national debt is to decrease your expenditure and, therefore, you have a better system of controlling your expenditure and that will reduce your borrowing and, therefore, give you more flexibility in the taxation system.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement about new ideas which he will accept and work on.  I believe the Minister has always been approachable and very taken with new ideas, so that I would say that as far as finance legislation is concerned the Minister would accept any ideas we would have provided they are reasonable.</P>
      <P>When you talk about new and improved economic performance Fianna Fáil brought in a situation in 1977 where there were no rates, no motor tax.  When they went to the budget to find out the difference, they put it down to buoyancy, which means, in effect, that you add two and two and you want to get five, so you put in one as buoyancy.  The Minister believes that it should be properly costed and properly looked at, that there is scope for self-financing cuts.  If that were the case, then all over Europe we would have self-financing cuts and everybody would be doing it.</P>
      <P>I remember going around during the 1977 election campaign and people who were members of my former party said that they could not vote for us because they could not afford to vote for us.  That in itself is a condemnation of the policies by which that party have operated ever since.  The idea of giving money away and buying votes should be a thing of the past. It should be realistic and you should not offer olive branches to people if you cannot afford to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister declared the recession to be over.  I would disagree with that.  If you were to look at the business community, particularly small businesses, you would find that many of them are crippled and only for the relaxation of the Revenue <Col N="968" /> Commissioners which, in effect, is due to inefficiency in most cases many of these companies would be out of business.</P>
    <P>He talked about falling energy prices. Many small horticultural companies should be affected by the reduction in the energy prices.  They should get a better benefit from the fact that we have lower energy prices.  I believe that all along the pipeline area where we have natural gas we have great scope for massive horticultural development.  I believe the gas should be given at an economic rate to these places.  I have one in mind and that is the growing of mushrooms and tomatoes, etc.  These areas are high labour outfits and they would greatly benefit by a reduction in energy costs.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister and congratulate him on the position he has taken on PRSI.  It is a very good step to exempt companies from the PRSI payments if they take on extra workers.  This had the effect of taking 2,800 people off the unemployment register.  I would ask the Minister to review that and see if he could exempt them further for a two or three year period.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that tax reductions are relatively modest.  I agree with this.  The proposals put forward would not encourage much happiness in the PAYE area.  The amount of money the PAYE workers are getting back, £320 for somebody with an income of £12,000, would, in effect, be eaten away by the high cost of living.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax benefit for investment in industry.  The amount of investment income, up to £7,000 per annum, is very encouraging.  I read the Minister's statements when he was Minister for Industry.  His thinking along the line of savings to be put to productive purposes has been a very good one.  It came across in his belief that if you put your savings into manufacturing, they will produce jobs.  There is so much competition for money for unproductive purposes that I agree with the Minister that we should try to interest people in, for instance, taking shares in the companies they work for.</P>
    <P>I worked for Irish Ropes.  Many workers <Col N="969" /> took shares in that company.  This gave them an interest in the company, in the profits, in the workforce and in production.  On a Monday morning the workers would ask me what profit was made the previous week.  The workers felt part of the company.  If we could get more employee participation in companies there would be a better flow of ideas.  If management were not looking after the company, it would come to light because the workforce are part of it.</P>
    <P>Where the employee and the employer are apart, there is no way to go ahead. The idea of profits must be that they come back to companies.  The realisation must be that if one takes a risk one should be paid for that risk.  The Minister is taking a very positive look at this.  His approach is a very definite one.  He talked about smaller companies and the incentives for them in terms of capital and capital gains tax.  This is a very good suggestion.  The Minister has always been for small companies.  He has recognised, in effect, that this country was built on small companies and that if you can improve the climate within small companies, the overall employment will fall into place.</P>
    <P>Many small companies have, as he rightly indicated, very good ideas and are very good on production but their financial situations are very bad.  They must go to the banks for finance.  The Minister recognises that if a company go, not only to their employees but outside to the public, then you can get a very good small company base.  If there is somebody with finance and somebody else with ideas on production and they are brought together, there could be a good and effective structure.</P>
    <P>Chapter 6 of the Bill deals with the DIRT tax.  I accept that the Minister made a genuine attempt to relieve hardship cases in this area.  It is a genuine effort to relieve the societies, the old people and such genuine hardship cases. But he has not gone far enough.  He should have allowed that for tax purposes.  If he believes that this was a way to crack the black economy, it will not. What happens in the case of a husband <Col N="970" /> with small children who saved for educational purposes, when the tax free allowance would not come near the income and where there is genuine hardship?  He should allow that for tax purposes.  Also, where one can give the name of an aunt in England and say that he is resident with her, he would be allowed to claim in that situation.  This should be discouraged.  The black economy must be tackled in order to get a fairer taxation system.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (5) deals with the inner city. There is one area and I am sure Senator O'Leary knows about it.  The Watercourse Industrial Estate in Cork is in the inner city renewal programme.  I understand that there are 17 acres of this development which, in effect, gives employment.  There are 40 companies there employing in excess of 500 people. They are seeking that that would be included in the urban renewal area, that the Minister would include this.  Much money is going to be spent on this.  They reckon that if they were to have this area included they would be able to increase that employment significantly and invest a massive amount of money in order to get it functional.  I would ask the Minister to include this area.  I will give him the information I have.</P>
    <P>When he talks about the inner city and the places in which he has reduced the tax on high employment, one very high employment area is the whole construction industry.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at that situation where the building industry was granted a VAT rate of 5 per cent and it was put up to 10 per cent.  I feel that should be reduced significantly because there is massive unemployment in that area.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the home improvement grants area is one for the small builder to get involved in.  It has brought back a lot of small builders who were nearly at the wall as far as their continuation of business was concerned. That has done an enormous amount of good.  I would ask the Minister again to have a look at the building construction industry.</P>
    <P>He talks about the penalties, in effect, <Col N="971" /> for non-compliance with the return of one's income tax forms.  There are at the moment two positions.  First, if you are caught driving while you are drunk there is a mandatory fine.  One cannot drive for the next 12 months or one could be imprisoned.  Second, if one does not return one's P35 at the end of the year and one is brought to court, there is a mandatory fine of £500.  We are getting to the stage whereby eventually, step by step it has to be done.  These things cannot be done overnight.  People normally send in their returns on time and become like the PAYE worker.  There have been many reasons why this has not been done and one of the main reasons is the inadequacy in the staffing in the taxation office and the taxation collection departments.  If a member of the public was to go in and have a look at the situation there where one has one inspector dealing with about 300 companies, people who are not qualified dealing with the Collector General's money coming in, one would just see that the whole situation is in disarray.  It is an area which should be looked at effectively and efficiently bringing in a team of consultants to examine the whole structure of the income tax department.  The system of self-assessment is probably a good one. At the moment it is nearly self-assessment because in a number of cases the Revenue Commissioners do not examine the returns.  They just gloss over them and send the return out and one in every 20 is examined.  People should be urged to send in their income tax returns quicker.</P>
    <P>I do accept the situation about the company car where the allowance has been from £3,500 to £4,000.  That was back in 1976.  The inflation rate since then would put that up £11,000 or £12,000 or even in excess of that.  The Minister has accepted that the anomaly is there but he should investigate it further and increase it &mdash; by not only £500 &mdash; but by the rate of inflation since 1976.  We have companies who have many cars and who give much employment and in order for them to benefit from it, it would have to be at today's rates and not at 1976 rates.  The overall thrust of this is good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> He encourages &mdash; as his style is to encourage &mdash; a new look at our taxation system.  The Minister has come a long way since his early days.  He has learned a lot.  There is a long way to go as far as the whole taxation system is concerned. There is a lot of reform and equity to be achieved, for which people are crying out.  There are many things the Minister can do and there are many areas he can look at.  There is much more information vailble to him now, for example, from the VHI, the Co-ops to tax inspectors dealing with self-employed.  There is much more information available from the Government because they pay out so much money to the self-employed and the information is actually there.</P>
    <P>In regard to subcontractors certificates, for example, I believe their use should be extended to doctors and dentists, and accountants dealing with the Government and if their affairs are not in order they should be paid less their tax.  Subcontractors must be made to realise that their affairs have to be in order.  Most subcontractors will look for their certificate because their certificate allows them work.  If they have not got their certificate, they cannot work.  This system has worked efficiently and effectively for subcontractors.  I believe it should be extended right across the board.</P>
    <P>We should look at the situation of the consultants and the Revenue Commissioners and we should bring in consultants to examine the whole question of revenue collection and the identification of accounts.  I agree with the idea of the new sheriffs and their powers but also there should be local collection units and there should be more inspectors going out and being involved with the community so that they can see what it is all about. Most revenue inspectors have never seen the companies they deal with.  If you take the IDA, for example, each IDA official would know more about the company than possibly the managing director of it. Very seldom would one get a revenue inspector to come and have a look at the company that it is dealing with or a look at the individual.  The only time he sees <Col N="973" /> them is when they come to him.  Usually when they go to him, if they have any sense at all they will be very badly dressed and go by bus.  They will actually see the situation of the person they are dealing with in their homes.  I have never yet heard of anybody getting a phone call from the Revenue Commissioners about the back VAT and the back PAYE.</P>
    <P>If you look at any liquidation, the amount of money that is due to the Revenue Commissioners is staggering and it is staggering because, first of all, the banks are in collaboration with the individual because if the cheque is made out to the Revenue Commissioners and the account is overdrawn, the first payment is to the Revenue Commissioners once the wages are paid, which I would agree with.  I would agree that they should be more aware in the PAYE department and the income tax department that this money is actually due and there are massive amounts of money to be got.</P>
    <P>It leads to a false sense of security for the company.  I know many companies who have not paid their VAT and PAYE for such a long time.  They never got any reminder.  They get the green letter first, then the red letter and then they get a notice from the sheriff and then the sheriff gets fed up calling and that is the end of the matter for two or three years until they come around again.  There is an area that should be looked at, possibly the Revenue Commissioners sitting down with accountants, asking them their opinions and how they should do their job.  I believe there are many ideas there which the inspectors could work on.</P>
    <P>I believe we should eliminate the social welfare fraud and the black economy. One way of doing that is through more inspectors and through discussion with inspectors.  To inform the employees again about the state of the company is very important because most company employees are not aware of what is happening in the company until it goes into liquidation and then they find that their PAYE and VAT has not been paid up. Recently, we brought in a law whereby <Col N="974" /> they would be cleared but still there is a long way before they get their rewards. Another area which should be looked at, is that of expense creditors.  They should be outlined on the balance sheet.  I agree with the disclosure of accounts, that the amount of VAT and PAYE due should be itemised on the balance sheet, how long it is due and the amount of pension money paid up.  There is much to be achieved before justice is seen to be done to the PAYE worker and to the self-employed so that there is not this huge gap between the self-employed and the PAYE worker with the PAYE worker feeling that the self-employed are getting away with murder.  I believe the Minister once said he referred to the amounts outstanding from self-employed persons. At that time I had a number of self-employed accounts to do.  In three different cases, three different individuals were assessed, one for £25,000, another for £65,000 and another for £30,000.  The three of them had gone out of business and were on welfare at the time.  According to the income tax people they owed that amount of money, which was absolutely crazy.</P>
    <P>There should be more realism in the structures.  They should be more in touch with the individuals and should respond quickly and effectively to requests.  The problem is that they do not respond.  If you send a letter you will probably not get a reply for about three or four weeks. It is sent in deliberately at that time because one knows that the emphasis is then with the tax inspector and that he cannot get near the file for at least four weeks after that.  He will send out a letter and then another is sent back.  That has been going on for so long now that it is becoming ridiculous.  There should be a more sensible approach.  The employment of good civil servants in that area will improve the system and will improve also the tax collection and show that equity is being done so that PAYE workers will get a fair return for the amount of tax they pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of points I want to make are very short and, I <Col N="975" /> hope, to the point.  I am not a financer or an economist and, therefore, I am not going to spread out the small number of views I have but they are views about which I feel strongly.</P>
      <P>One is about the small businesses of Ireland which together with the small and medium sized farmers, have carried this country, for very many years.  During recent years unfortunately small businesses have come under pressure, particularly from the State.  It is unfortunate that these small businesses have become glorified bookkeepers and glorified tax collectors for the State.  People in business for a number of years are frightened out of their skins by having to keep various sets of books and having to make various returns rather than getting on with what they were trained to do &mdash; run their businesses.  They just do not know where to turn.  If one is lucky enough to make a profit then like everybody else he is highly taxed.  Many of these small businesses such as small grocers and small publicans have been suffering for the past number of years, the former because of the supermarkets and for other reasons and the latter because of abuses of the licensing laws.  Whatever may be the reasons for hounding these small businesses the number of people they employ is not matched <i>pro rata</i> by the larger shops or bar businesses.  At the same time, these small businesses, and indeed also medium and large businesses, are being hounded by tax inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own case which I am not citing in any sense of bragging, but rather to point out what is happening, if the assessments made against me in two successive years were realistic I would not be sitting in this House or in any other House or working at all.  In those two years I made nothing like the profits that were assessed against me.  In fact in one of those years I made a loss.  When I contacted the tax inspector she said she had raised what she had called a realistic assessment.  When I asked how she could raise a realistic assessment that was so out of place she said she was allowed by law to raise an assessment which she <Col N="976" /> deemed to be realistic.  I would like to see the terms of the realistic assessment more clearly defined, not just to protect those people who are being unrealistically assessed but because hundreds and thousands of assessments raised against people are being used in the computation of the figure that is sometimes thrown out, of £600 million in unpaid taxes by the self-employed.  That in turn gets the backs of the PAYE sector up and were it true there would be merit in the argument.  What almost every businessman in the country knows is that it is not true. More realistic assessments must be brought in.</P>
    <P>In saying that I am not trying to pretend that there are people making money and not declaring it.  The country is absolutely full of that but it is not confined to the self-employed or the small business people. Almost everyone is on the make in some form or another.  Recently the Minister offered amnesty from prosecution to persons who had made false declarations or who had not paid their proper share of income tax.  I do not know how successful that amnesty has been.  I suggest to the Minister, through the Minister of State, that the following be considered where there are large sums of money being debated.  I am going to use as an example the taxman looking for £300,000 and the person involved offering £100,000. Where an amnesty from prosecution is being offered, let the taxman or woman &mdash; it would appear in my own area that the women are somewhat keener on these figures than the men &mdash; meet with the said person.  This amnesty should be continued during all of the debate between them.  Eventually the person and the taxman will agree on a figure of outstanding taxes due to the State.  Once a figure is agreed on the person liable for tax can then disclose openly to the taxman any other moneys he or she has earned that have not to date been disclosed or that the tax man or woman has not to date suspected that he or she has got.</P>
    <P>The socialists will say that I am encouraging letting the capitalist away with earning further money.  I am not.  What I <Col N="977" /> am trying to do is this: if this money is &ldquo;hot money&rdquo;, the taxman, in other words the State because it is for us the taxman is working, will never get his share of it unless it is allowed to be brought up.  If it is brought up and declared &mdash; I refer to the case I cited of a man or woman having £500,000 of &ldquo;hot money&rdquo;&mdash; at that stage the taxman knows of its existence and, secondly, the person concerned can invest the money.  This will result in employment and in his being able to come clean, perhaps for the first time in years and make a decent living and not have to be bowing his head to anybody.  That money will be put back to work for our economy rather than working for somebody else's economy.</P>
    <P>Not enough emphasis is placed on finances for services.  For a number of years the emphasis has been on finances for manufacturing industry and grant aid is only available to manufacturing industry for export.  I believe that services should be financed.  I would advocate two things, one is that the financial institutions would make moneys available on longer terms because the five year term or the seven year term or the ten year term but particularly the five and seven year terms can be so crippling as to cause a firm to go out of business before it gets off the ground.  I would also like to see the State getting involved in trying to control interest rates.  The State should in some way guarantee rates at a medium level.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are falling at present but not quickly enough for the Minister for the Environment and indeed for people in general with building societies being reluctant to move as quickly as they might.  During the past few months some building societies have been very slow to disclose their own affairs even to their own members.  Reading between the lines I felt that manufacturing directors lied to their own members.  I am advocating that the State might get involved by setting up some sort of a scheme whereby moneys would become available for longer terms and at a fixed interest so that if interest rates moved higher over a short period the resultant payback would <Col N="978" /> not increase and in turn when interest rates moved below that average the businessman would not get a lower rate, in other words that the body would recoup the investment made towards subsidising in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the notion of self-financing tax reductions.  I believe that in setting up this body would be self-financing because the State would save money through the person paying a level rate of interest, but it would be dearer.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to small farmers who are caught in a trap and I would advocate that the Minister for Finance take them out of that trap.  There are many small farmers in this trap in the west of Ireland.  For every pound the small farmer who is on unemployment assistance earns it is reduced by that pound of unemployment assistance; for every £1,000 he earns he loses £20 a week; for every £2,000 he loses £40 a week.  These people need help from the State.  Do not let anybody say that I, Joachim Loughrey from Donegal, ever advocated removing aid from the small farmers along the west, because I do not. There is a total disincentive to that man or woman to produce anything.  Some sort of subsidy other than unemployment assistance, should be brought in to help to remove from the small farmer the unemployment assistance tag.  This would also help production in that the more he produced the more he would get.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Finance will take that consideration on board about the amnesty for hot money.  There are hundreds of millions of pounds moving outside our economy simply because people are afraid to move it inside our economy.  There is no doubt that taxation is too high.  The person with a slight gambling instinct is afraid to make a bob because if he does the pound becomes 40 pence; he will lose 50 or 60 pence straight off.  There must be some method devised because before we can lift those on the poverty line or among the poorer elements of our country to some acceptable level we will have to allow the richer to get even more rich.  I have no doubt that <Col N="979" /> unless we allow wealth to be created then we cannot distribute it; if the wealth is not created it will not be distributed.  If wealth is being created by Irish businessmen outside Ireland then it will not be distributed inside Ireland.  I would advocate to the Minister that he continue on the road he is on &mdash; that of reducing personal taxation and creating incentives, not only for productive investment but for all other types of investment as well.  The extension of the tax concessions to encourage greater employee participation has merit.  I do not believe it has been fully thought out.  If somebody has built up a business with sweat and blood during a number of years I am not so sure that they should have to give it away subject to continuing in that business.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his consideration and I hope the Minister will take some of my ideas on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I have to begin on a slightly discordant note.  With no disrespect to you, a Chathaoirligh, I feel that the procedures of this House are unfair in that Members can sit here waiting for their turn to speak and another Member who just immediately walks into the House can be called upon to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to interrupt the Senator but that is quite correct.  The group takes the turn. Numerous times it has been mentioned and I have suggested that it be discussed again at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  There is no Standing Order governing it.  It is a practice that has been handed down prior to my time.  I entirely agree with the Senator.  If a party is made up of 10 or 15 people and one individual comes in and gets a turn prior to them, that would not be my way of doing it.  My thinking is in agreement with that of the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to delay the House but I just want to put that on the record.  Perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could have another look at it.  The practice in this House has been that, since we do not <Col N="980" /> have a budget presented here, Members take advantage of discussion on Second Stage of the Finance Bill to ramble a bit and cover matters that do not directly come within the ambit of the Finance Bill but at the same time have always been acceptable.</P>
      <P>I wonder how relevant is a budget in Ireland in these times?  One can recall in all Governments the fantastic media coverage, the hyped-up package and presentation and the way the expectations of the public are built up or, on occasions, played down prior to the introduction of a budget and finally it peters out almost always into an ineffectual instrument of economic policy.  The reason I state that is that looking at the overall finances of the country and the amount of money which is expended or agreed to be expended prior to the introduction of the budget and looking again at the balance which falls directly within the control of the Minister for Finance of the day, you see that in percentage terms it is minute.</P>
      <P>For instance, public service pay at approximately £2,600 million, servicing the national debt at £2,100 million, servicing our education, health and social welfare, combine to virtually reduce the Minister's discretion to a few hundred million pounds out of £8 billion to £9 billion.  In that context &mdash; and here I agree with part of the contribution made by Senator O'Leary &mdash; we have to look very fundamentally at how we can order things as far as the management of the State finances are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tend to get in the budget layer upon layer of new regulations, bureaucracy stitched in each year which conflicts from one year to another and it is not only ineffective but totally unintelligible to the man in the street.  We will be told successively by the Minister that a scheme is being introduced to rid us of the black economy, to eradicate the abuses and avoidance of tax and to reduce the burden on the PAYE sector.  Just how many times have we been told in this House and in the other House by Ministers that these three areas are comprehensively covered in this budget?  Each passing year <Col N="981" /> these efforts become more porous as far as tax avoidance is concerned.  The black economy grows and a more disgruntled PAYE sector emerges, as the burden of taxation continues to grow, despite falling standards of living and falling numbers in employment.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector has paid in 1985 up to 85 per cent of total income tax paid to the Exchequer and this crippling burden which has sapped the creative energy of huge sections of our population is again set to rise by another 2 per cent this year.  Income tax as a share of total tax collected continues to rise and is now heading to 40 per cent of total paid taxes. It is also estimated that there will be a 9.5 per cent increase in the tax yield from the PAYE sector in 1986.</P>
    <P>When we consider that inflation is estimated to run at an average rate of about 4.5 per cent this year, the increasing rate of the tax rake-off will be double the inflation rate, or one of the highest in recent years.  Since 1982 we have listened to a plethora of statements from the Taoiseach and his Ministers to the effect that this Government were improving the economic health of the country.  Promises were made to reduce the level of taxation on the PAYE sector.  Government borrowing would be brought under control. Public finances would be corrected.</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution Senator O'Leary was at pains to put the total blame for our present economic problems on the Fianna Fáil Government between 1977-81.  Mistakes were made at that time, but at this stage I do feel that on all sides of the House there is little point in trying to score on the basis of mistakes that were made either in 1973, 1974, 1977 or 1981.  What has happened during those years has now happened and for the young people that are growing up and the job opportunities that have to be provided, perhaps a more mature and less of the looking back attitude should be adopted, and all of us together try in what way we can mould public opinion to accept the kind of changes which will make it possible for the Minister for Finance to come into this House and have a little more room to operate and not have <Col N="982" /> so much of the expenditure which lies within the ambit of his Department virtually determined long before he comes into the House.</P>
    <P>In the promises that were made we were told that if the public accepted a variety of new taxes and very harsh measures and if this money was sucked into the Exchequer, all of our problems would be solved.  The fact still remains that despite quite a variety of new tax measures and a reintroduction of ones which were previously abolished, the picture has not changed.  You cannot pay your debts while you are sitting back.  Whether you take a business, farm, or a country, you cannot repay what you owe as you continue to retreat.  You can only pay as I understand it, when you are moving forward, because you have got to meet your day-to-day liabilities and on top of that you have got to meet crushing interest rates on repayments.  That can only be dealt with, in my view, where the economy is helped to grow.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the current account and the percentage they represent.  I do not have the record here but I think it is something like 55 per cent on social welfare, 21 per cent on debt and about 9 per cent on the economic services.  I know none of us can argue against the view that many services are essential and will always have to be provided for.  What I am talking about is the balance between economic activity and the essential services.  There is an imbalance, which all of us would accept has got to be changed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, is the budget about what we spend or is it a creative instrument?  I contend that, with the amount of money that is already predetermined, there is just not enough scope to deal with all the matters that are there.  Servicing the debt now accounts for nearly one-third of Government revenue.  This is an intolerable load.  In this area, there is no point in going back to 1977-81.  I am tired of listening to Ministers and Coalition speakers refer to that period.  During the last general election on television and elsewhere Coalition candidates told us that the international bankers were out there at Dublin Airport ready to take <Col N="983" /> Ireland Limited with them somewhere because of the financial situation and because of our borrowing which was at £12 billion.  It will have doubled in four years.  You can talk about percentage points.  You can talk about point scoring, but those are the facts.  If the international financiers were at Dublin Airport, they must be very close to me at the moment, although I cannot see them.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable controversy with regard to the DIRT tax.  I suppose it is ironic that it sounds rather badly as well.  The question is just how can you order it in a way that it will not hurt sections of the community who should not be hurt.  There is a certain amount of sense in trying to equalise the share of opportunity as far as competing for savings by the various institutions is concerned.  Generally speaking, people will recognise that.  It is not an instrument whereby it is possible to have fair play and equity.  It is very like the land tax in that sense.</P>
    <P>Last year we had a spate of attacks on old people.  Many of us, in rural areas, were concerned that old people would be encouraged not to keep their savings at home but to invest them in banking and other institutions.  In fairness to the Government, last year they responded and increased the savings relief for certain deposit interest accounts.  In fact, relief on savings was doubled but in one swoop this year, not taking into account the value of what was done last year, those concessions are totally removed and a blunt instrument to deduct 35 per cent of all interest from people in that category together with others has been put in their place.</P>
    <P>It is fine for the Exchequer to take in revenue from investments when people can afford it.  I have been told by colleagues in the lending institutions that it is not unique for people to have four and five different accounts with different presentation of names and addresses.  In those kind of situations, no one would legitimately argue against ensuring that people who were defrauding and avoiding their tax liability in that way paid the <Col N="984" /> same as all other sectors.  In order to deduct legitimate tax from people who either defraud or find some other way of hiding their resources.  We attack in the same way old people who are not on a taxable income, who are shy about investing their savings and are, therefore prey to criminal activities tragically in our cities for a long time and now escalating in rural areas as well.</P>
    <P>We also hit young couples.  I would always encourage them to purchase their houses or buy sites as the case may be but never to attempt to enter into that until they have started to save, and not to think that one can afford to repay huge commitments overnight as a married person when one is not trained to the concept of saving.  I am at a loss to know and I shall be endeavouring during the course of Committee Stage to discuss with the Minister some way of ensuring that these categories are facilitated.  The same argument is made by the GAA.  It could be made for all voluntary activities. At a time when there is so much unemployment and when it is so essential to provide the maximum kind of recreational facilities to use the energy of young people these organisations play a vital role in that regard.  Some mechanism should be devised by which the moneys they gather voluntarily are not exposed to this tax.</P>
    <P>Many so called socialists in this House would argue that the DIRT tax is an instrument to take funds from the financial institutions.  Of course this is not so. It is just passed on to the consumer.  This is clearly evidenced by the building societies who, despite lowering inflation and interest rates, have not passed on the advantage up to now to the borrowers. The Minister should use his good office to put on as much pressure as possible on the building societies to reduce, where possible, the mortgage rate on people who have provided themselves with houses.</P>
    <P>Commercial banks continue to have one of the highest rates of interest in the history of the State.  It is now running at <Col N="985" /> nearly four times the inflation rate for some accounts.  While the banks dillydally in passing on reduced interest rates to the public, more and more businesses get into financial difficulties.  During the past three years approximately 2,000 businesses have been closed down or have been put into receivership or liquidation.  I am not saying that interest rates were the cause of all of them closing down, but it was a contributor in making it very difficult in recessionary times for these companies to survive.  It is crucial that banking institutions be pressured by the Government to reduce interest rates and to do that without clinging on to the last minute so that they can recoup some of the losses they incur in business and commercial life with the public generally.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word in relation to the child benefit scheme which is being heralded as a fantastic measure in so far as families are concerned.  Following the introduction of this scheme, the child allowance in the tax code has been removed.  Childrens' allowances have also been abolished.  We have seen a reduction in food subsidies.  The base of the argument that I have been making since I began is that we have time and time again, not just in this instance, but year in and year out, played around with a small amount of money, the public believing that we were doing something for them but in the final analysis, as the year rolled on we discovered the position had not improved.  So far as large families are concerned, it is very difficult for them to manage in these times.  The Minister would have been wise to retain the £100 child allowance in the income tax code. I do not think it would have cost that much to retain that allowance.  The overall benefit in that case would have been much greater.</P>
    <P>During the course of his contribution, Senator O'Leary referred to the abolition of rates and the loss it was to the country not just in the year it was decided but as a continuing basis for income to the country and indeed to the local authorities.  It would be fair to put on the record that there was no difference in 1977 <Col N="986" /> between the Fianna Fáil manifesto in relation to rates and the Coalition's position.  That is not justifying either.  There was no distinction that I can recall in the final days of that campaign between the Coalition position and ours.  There is little to be gained by saying that this or that caused this or that problem.</P>

      <P>I would go a fair distance with that but none of us are courageous enough to re-introduce it.  In the area of revenue for local authorities, there certainly has to be some new thinking. For example, take our county roads system, I do not care whether it is a national charge or whether it is a local charge.  I would say to any farmer or any person living on a bad country road, would you be prepared to give me funds through whatever source to try and maintain that country system as it disintegrates daily? The public at large and the people who use the county roads would argue that they are already paying too much.  Leaving that aside, they would be prepared to help to finance the restoration and reinstatement of a network which was built up in difficult times and now is heading to disintegration.  County engineers all over the country are telling county councillors that by the middle of the next decade many of the roads will be impassable.  I do not think any of us want to see that happening.  As far as I am concerned I would be glad to support any measures which would help the local authorities in the discharge of their function as far as the building up of our road network is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the 16 per cent drop in the new house starts.  Here again we should encourage new investment and private investment.  The lending institutions stand condemned for the system of bridging finance provided for young couples who obtain local authority loans or building society loans.  I know people who ran into difficulties in relation to transfers and delays with solicitors, delays in the Land Registry and found themselves with massive bills accruing <Col N="987" /> even before they had begun to live in their houses.  Banks should be pressurised to provide capital on a short term basis for housing in particular at reasonable rates and not at the astronomical rates charged at present.</P>
    <P>All of the speakers have welcomed the new house improvement scheme.  It is certainly very popular.  There are one or two things I would like to mention to the Minister in that connection.  One of them is in relation to the costings used by the Department inspectors in determining eligibility for this scheme.  It seems that they are quite outdated.  You have too many skilled workers who are unemployed and others who are in jobs who are in a position to do this work themselves.  I know that the concept behind the scheme is to try to root out people who are engaging in the building business and in the black economy.  It should be possible to leave it to the discretion of the inspectors in the Department of the Environment, perhaps even in conjunction with the local authorities, to allow for people who have the skills themselves and who can afford to do the work themselves but could never dream of bringing in a contractor because it would double the cost of the work.  That is a reasonable assessment of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of the scheme is to provide employment for regular contractors who are out of work because of the downturn in the building market.  If you start giving the same incentives to people to do their own work you would destroy that benefit and you would also throw it wide open to the black economy because people would say that they did it themselves when in fact they got some black economy contractor to do it.  How would you prove who did it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that difficulty and that is why I said &ldquo;in conjunction with the local authorities&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the local authorities stayed on the site every day they would not know who was doing it.</P>

    <Col N="988" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult in a local authority area, at least as far as I am concerned, to have operations of that kind.  It comes up under the planning section time and time again when people say they were only doing something very simple.  Eventually an overseer saw what was happening.  I mentioned it as one practical way of doing it.  There may be some other way of doing it.  I recognise that the concept is to try to get at people who are operating within the black economy but I still think that for people who have the capacity to do it themselves there seems to be something fundamentally wrong when they cannot do it themselves.  If I can afford to improve my house and get in a contractor and meet all the legitimate legal demands of the Department of the Environment I can have this done.  For a man living beside me who can do the work himself but cannot afford to get in a contractor the cost is doubled by forcing him to get a contractor.  I am saying that it should be within the bounds of possibility to deal with that kind of situation.</P>
      <P>Another area I want to refer to is the kind of sleeping pills some of the social employment schemes are as far as employment is concerned.  We have had tremendous difficulty in Tipperary North Riding County Council in trying to get permission from the trade unions for some of the social employment schemes which were decided by the council.  It seems to me that the only work that can be undertaken under some of those schemes is work you could not undertake in good times, work that will not interfere with permanent activity of the workers of the council, work which is not sought by the public and yet one has to find within that ambit and consideration schemes to meet the requirements of the Congress of Trade Unions.  There are funds available and it might be much more worthwhile if these funds were provided for road upkeep and the essential services which the councils are providing but which are now deprived of funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to welcome the income tax incentives which go to encourage people <Col N="989" /> to invest share capital in industrial projects.  This is quite a positive and helpful move and should start the process of tipping the scale as far as the tax regime is concerned in favour of new investment in industry and away from safe immobile havens.  With one of the highest employment problems in Europe it is crucial that more private investment is directed into job promoting opportunities.  For far too long research and development of new products and processes have been neglected.  The amount of money provided by the State and private sources is dismally low compared to our European partners.  I remember reading in a magazine some years ago that the Netherlands were spending about fourteen times the amount on research and development that was spent in this country in comparative terms.  This would indicate the necessity to try to do something about this area.  The scheme which has been introduced by the Minister is going in the right direction.  I know that questions are being asked whether it is too restrictive or will many companies and individuals go for it.  I still recognise in it a scheme which has potential and some of the restrictions perhaps can be removed, if not this year in the very near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to confess frustration because accountants in particular are always talking about the restrictions and when you ask them what restrictions there are they are extremely short in explanation of what they are really talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>In the food area a number of worthwhile projects have been initiated but obviously a major revamping of agricultural policy.  Farm co-op and processing policies will have to take place if cognisance is to be taken of the changing trends in the EC.  Account must be taken of the needs of the consumer, the change in health trends together with innovation in marketing and continuity of supply.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company have established a centre in Limerick and there have sprung up in the past couple of years a number of small industrial projects. Hopefully this augurs well for the future.</P>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Government's support for the provision of a regional technical college in Thurles and to press for the early sanction of the purchase of the site.  Shannon Free Airport Development Company have agreed to establish an incubator unit on the college site which would facilitate research particularly in food but other processes and research would not be excluded.  The development of this college will be a major commercial factor for Tipperary as a whole and we will be pressing the Minister for Education for early sanction for other developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has also reduced from seven years to five years the retention period for shares held under the employee profit sharing scheme.  Most people welcome this change.  The reduction in long term capital gains is also <Col N="991" /> welcomed as is the new rate of 30 per cent for gains in respect of assets which have been held for six years.  The Minister has reduced the insurance levy, which the budget proposed at 15 per cent, to 9 per cent and has also indicated that this will only operate for one year.  There have been some complaints raised with regard to the level of the interest rate for payments of tax which are overdue.  This is not similar to the rate of tax where refunds of tax are made to people where an error is made either by the taxpayer, his representatives or indeed the tax inspector.  There should be no reason for this differential.  Perhaps this is an area which the Minister could rectify also.</P>
    <P>There are some positive aspects to this budget.  Some effort has been made by the Minister to recognise the difficulties with regard to income tax and employment generating opportunities.  Overall, it will not be the kind of steam engine which will help the country out of its present economic morass.  I feel that much more fundamental appraisal of our total economic situation has to be done and the public will has to be moulded in a way which will make it possible for future Ministers for Finance to introduce budgets where the control that the Minister has over expenditure and over the totality of money available to him is far greater than is the position today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate and compliment the Minister for Finance for taking the measures in the budget of this year a stage further in the direction of giving, as I perceive it, greater stimulus and a greater boost to the economy and helping along the road to having our financial position improved.  The Minister, no more than anybody else, would not suggest that a total solution is contained in the budget or indeed in the Finance Bill before us. Certainly it should be perceived as a very definite, positive step along the right road.  I feel that we should salute the Minister for Finance for having taken that very definite initiative.  It is the first time in recent years that there is a sign <Col N="992" /> of an improvement in the economy.  I am not standing here and suggesting remotely that all our economic ills are now in the process of being resolved.  I would at the same time state that they are in the process of being dealt with and I am satisfied that the measures put forward will do a great deal along that direction.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, external factors such as the steep fall in energy prices which are contributing quite substantially to matters being improved at present. Nevertheless we have internal matters, such as inflation levels, where we must acknowledge that a very definite improvement has been made by the present Government in the last three and a half years, where we have seen inflation coming from a level of 20 per cent to its present level of 3 per cent.  I believe that, coupled with inflation, there is great urgency for a definite improvement in interest rates.  I feel, with inflation rates being at a realistic level and with indicators suggesting they will be better before the end of this year, there is no logic at all for interest rates being at the extremely high levels they are at.</P>
      <P>This applies to the agricultural scene, the whole industrial scene, the tourist area, and so on.  I would say to the Minister: &ldquo;you have done a fine job this far&rdquo; but so far as interest is concerned, in whatever way a Minister for Finance can influence the situation there is an urgency to make sure that interest rates for various developments, be they industrial, commercial or agricultural, get a reasonable opportunity of getting money at a price they can handle.  I believe there is much merit in serious consideration being given to Euro-currency moneys for agriculture, industry and developments generally.  I appreciate very fully there are elements of risk with regard to exchange rates and so on but I would say that, having regard to the urgency of this finance for many types of development, that it is a risk that is worth taking particularly as we are now around the corner, where our recessionary situation is hopefully on the road towards improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt at present that <Col N="993" /> people by and large see the economy being in a state of improvement and perceive the situation as one that is on the road to recovery.  This in itself is very important because coupled with that kind of attitude we will have a great deal more definite confidence and there is nothing, as the old saying says, that succeeds like success.  People when they believe genuinely that things are improving will contribute quite substantially towards greater improvement.  There is an opportunity there now that should not be missed.</P>
    <P>Energy costs and inflation are at acceptable levels.  We must have money available at a price that can be managed. Managed is the word because up to now I do not think that people in business or farming were in a position to manage the level of repayments they had to make. This has been the straw that broke the camel's back, indeed more than a straw on many occasions.  It has been the reason a lot of business, big or small, have found themselves in extreme difficulty.</P>
    <P>There is at present a very strong indicator of an upturn in the world economy. This will directly affect the Irish economy.  It is only appropriate that we have the Finance Bill package of tax incentives aimed at encouraging savers and investors to move their funds into productive investment.  This is provided for and is welcome.</P>
    <P>There is provision for rewarding persons for good management techniques and rewards for risk taking.  Profit and wealth play a vital part in the recovery of the economy and play a vital part in the whole ability of the economy to provide the less privileged people with the necessary assistance.  Things are changing but there was an attitude that profit and wealth were regarded as being undesirable.  There is no way the economy can do the things it has to do without a certain number of people being encouraged, not just allowed, financially and otherwise, to create wealth, to make profits, to provide much needed employment and also to generate wealth in the whole economy which will enable the non-earning areas to do things that otherwise cannot be <Col N="994" /> done.  There are productive areas in the economy such as agriculture, the industrial sector and tourism.  There are a whole host of areas which are not money earners.  It is necessary for the State to ensure that law and order is maintained, to ensure that the needy are looked after, that the children of the nation are taught, that health is taken care of.  These areas do not create money.  For this reason it is essential that the areas which do create wealth are given the appropriate assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clearly entered into the area of profit sharing.  It is important to give an opportunity for people working in a business to share in the profit.  There are various profit sharing schemes in section 8 of the Bill which give further encouragement in line with provisions made in the 1982 and 1984 Finance Acts. These provisions are highly desirable.  In 1982 there was a definite provision made in the Finance Act for employees to receive shares to the value of £1,000 tax free in any one year.  In 1984 the value of shares which an employee could receive was increased to £5,000.  In 1986 it was further improved.  It is to be welcomed that persons working in a company are given a positive inducement to ensure that the company not alone survives but makes a profit.  Profit sharing in Ireland is very new.  At present there are fewer than 20 profit sharing businesses.  This is something that is in the process of development and will progress.  Various schemes are in the pipeline.  It is early days to forecast where this will go but I am confident that progress will be made in the area of profit sharing.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill contains a positive provision for rewarding persons who apply management techniques and expertise.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In countries like Japan, the United States and other countries profit sharing companies are working quite effectively. There is no reason they cannot work here to the advantage of companies and of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are faced with the major challenge of endeavouring to recover a very sick economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> Their best efforts are required to ensure that improvements are brought about. There is a consciousness among the Cabinet members of the serious job they have to do to tackle the problem of unemployment.  There are measures in the Bill which will help enormously along this route.</P>
    <P>Senators spoke earlier today about the two choices available to us.  One was greater taxation and the other was curbing expenditure.  It is obvious that taxation is at its limit.  Nobody could suggest that direct taxation for PAYE workers and others should be increased.  That leaves the options fairly narrow in the sense that one is talking about saving on expenditure.  The other area from which finance could be usefully derived for productive purposes is that some foreign borrowing could be got on a very managed careful basis, knowing precisely where the money was to be invested.  It would not be borrowed for anything except productive use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that it would remunerate the interest on the borrowing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I would hope that any suggestions on my part about borrowing money would make a definite and positive return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sufficient to cover interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I share the concern of those who are concerned about interest levels.  We are only sweeping the dirt under the carpet if we continue to borrow indiscriminately.  I am confident we can borrow on a managed basis and make sure that each pound borrowed finds its way into the productive system directly.  Any further borrowing for current expenditure must be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point should be made emphatically that the Government are managing quite well with regard to existing deficits.  The real problem is where there is an accumulation <Col N="996" /> of deficits over a number of years.  Who caused what is not very relevant at this point.  Unfortunately, we have a serious build-up of deficits leading to an impossible situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> interest obligations on those large sums of money.  The point is worthy of note that the Government are succeeding very well in coping with the day to day situation. Unfortunately, we have this massive build up and this is causing major and serious concern.  We must be more imaginative in the area of new products.  There is a great deal of potential for diversification into new products in the various spheres &mdash; industrial, agricultural and so on.  We must make sure that we produce precisely what the market place wants. In other words, whether the consumer is in London, Bonn, Limerick, or Dublin we must ensure that that consumer gets exactly what he or she is looking for whether it is a food product or any other product.</P>
    <P>This applies in particular in the agricultural sector where for a long time we have tended to produce very carelessly, without having an eye on the market place.  I have stated in this House before and I do not think it can be over emphasised that we have to produce for the market requirement, not just to produce and then go out and try to sell that product.  That applies not only in the agricultural and food sectors but in other sectors also.  We tend to produce something and then engage ourselves in massive efforts at selling that product and, in many instances, without great success.</P>
    <P>We are not paying sufficient attention to producing what is required.  In other words, we do not have what I would see as sufficient research into what the market place is looking for.  I know there has been a fair amount of improvement in these areas in recent times but, nevertheless, we have a long way to go.  There are no easy options.  As of now we have our financial position under control, but it is going to be a further hard slog on the part of the Government and also on the part of individuals within the State.  There is no way that this Government or any Government can bring out economy back <Col N="997" /> on the rails without a total awareness among all the people of the State and a level of co-operation from them.</P>
    <P>Society appreciates that there is a major problem.  Society is getting more and more responsible in this regard and is prepared to accept certain unpalatable decisions in the interest of solving problems for the future.  It was remarked earlier that, whatever the situation is now, if we do not tackle it positively it will be untenable for our children and those who come after us.  We have a moral responsibility as well as other responsibilities to make sure that does not happen.  We have an obligation to keep this State in good condition for the future generations who will take over its operations.</P>
    <P>Many areas are crying out for expenditure.  For instance, roads were referred to by Senator Smith.  If we were to bring our road network up to the present EC standards we would require something like £3,000 million to do so.  We are now spending £140 million in that direction. That is the sort of leeway we have to make up if we are to do what needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise must be encouraged to the maximum.  I am certain private enterprise has great possibilities for improvements in the economy.  Private enterprise which embraces a great many of our small industrial projects can do wonders.  We must make certain that we give every encouragement possible to persons who have the development of small enterprises as a priority.  We must look upon Europe as one large market now open to us.  It is a very large market. There is no reason why we should be trekking around the world with our wares while there is a very lucrative market right on our doorstep in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe as part of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>We tend to undersell ourselves in this regard.  We underestimate our ability to produce for a sophisticated market.  We have a very sophisticated market ready to take our products, but we tend to shy away from it and head for places like Tripoli and perhaps less dangerous places.  We have taken the easy option <Col N="998" /> and gone to places that up to now were more accessible than other places.  We must bear in mind that if we enter into the scene of marketing in France, Germany, Holland, Denmark and so on we are into a very competitive area.  We must make certain that we measure up.  We must be in there with something those people require and will buy from us.  That is extremely important.  I have already expressed my views on increases in taxation and expenditure.  I would like to think that most people share my views.</P>
    <P>The development of our natural resources is something we have not really delved into to the degree that we ought to.  We have not gone out there and developed our agriculture to its full capacity. We have not developed many of our industrial areas; nor have we developed our forestry area which has a vast potential.  We have not developed our whole tourist potential, which is enormous. While we are limited in our natural resources we are endowed with a number of natural resources which, if properly developed, could do a great deal for us.  I have already referred to unemployment, whether the figure is 200,000 or 250,000. I am not sure that anybody has the actual figure for unemployed persons.  We may have a figure for those persons who draw social welfare or social assistance but that does not necessarily mean that those persons are unemployed.  We have a great number of people who are fairly gainfully employed and yet they are drawing social welfare.  Therefore, they appear on a register of unemployed persons.  They are not, in the strict sense of the word, unemployed.  There is at the same time a substantial number of persons who are genuinely unemployed and, in fact, the number is too great for anybody to feel complacent about it.  We have had a fairly substantial increase in our population in recent years.  We must take that into account when we talk about the level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>On the unemployment side reference has been made to the black economy and so on.  Estimates would suggest &mdash; they are not my estimates &mdash; that there could be as many as 100,000 persons drawing <Col N="999" /> social welfare who are employed in some shape or form in the black economy.  That is in the area of working persons.  We have also a number of persons in the business sector who are benefitting from the black economy as well.  We have unfortunately a situation there that is very hard to tackle and it is very hard for the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in the Cabinet to say precisely the level of unemployment we have to tackle because it is a moving target that moves pretty rapidly and that does not make it any more easy to solve.  Various major changes are included here such as VAT on food.  That is something that is to be lauded.  It will do a lot of good for our tourist trade and I believe the Minister is to be complimented on his initiative in that direction.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also to the question of the amnesty that is being allowed for moneys that have not been laundered through the ordinary process.  I would suggest that a further look be taken at this particular area and that the amnesty should extend beyond the present measures proposed whereby somebody comes forward and pays the appropriate tax and is not penalised for not having paid it up to now.  I would go further and have a certain carrot there for people to declare their position and in that way we would hopefully bring a lot of much needed money into the system.  I appreciate that is a difficult area.  Unless we offer a carrot as well as giving people a clearance for doing wrong in the past we will not bring a substantial amount of money into the system.  It is very important that we get moneys into the system whether they are presently within the country, invested in various inappropriate ways or invested outside the country.  I believe there is a lot of potential there.</P>
    <P>The area of personal taxation is something that has been referred to.  We all share the view that it has been exploited to its fullest.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to acknowledge a few points that have been made by the Confederation of Irish Industry with regard to this 1986 Finance Bill.  This is a CII <Col N="1000" /> newsletter, volume 44, No. 25, dated 29 April 1986.  With regard to section 10 of the Finance Act it states:</P>
    <P>The principle incorporated in the proposed tax treatment of certain dividends is welcomed.  The provision means that the maximum amount of tax payable by a shareholder on dividends for manufacturing and other companies which carry a tax credit of 1/18th will effectively be 25% on the first IR£13,000 per annum of these dividends.</P>
    <P>There is a problem, however, in respect of a 10% tax from a manufacturing company who incur a loss or who have capital allowances available and consequently do not have a net liability. In these circumstances, the manufacturing company cannot claim the 10% tax rate.  It is also necessary to cover the position of a holding company which pays dividends to shareholders out of a primary fund consisting of dividends received from, e.g. the manufacturing subsidiary.  It would seem unreasonable that a shareholder receiving certain dividends out of manufacturing profits should be denied the relief provided in this Section merely because of either of the factors referred to above.</P>
    <P>The confederation go on to make certain proposals in this regard.  The main point I want to make is that the Confederation of Irish Industry do, in fact, welcome that.  Also with regard to sections 13 to 26 the Confederation of Irish Industry say:</P>
    <P>The principle of attempting to generate investment in research and development is a very welcome one.  There are, however, two main problems:</P>
    <P>(a)  The entire approach is too complex, and</P>
    <P>(b)  The restriction of a sponsoring company's stake to 20% will mean that very few companies, if any, will be interested in pursuing this mechanism.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 53 the CII state: <Col N="1001" /> The reduction in the rate of capital gains tax for long term capital gains as indicated in the Budget is welcome, and also particularly welcome is the new rate of 30% for gains in respect of assets which have been retained for six years.</P>
    <P>On section 104 they state:</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to the use of electronic data processing are welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is much other favourable mention not alone in the CII newsletter of that date but in many publications that have been issued. I believe the business sector in our economy has been extremely pleased with the budget and in particular with the Finance Bill which followed the budget.  It is encouraging that those favourable comments have been put forward by these different bodies.</P>
    <P>One could go on and on, but I do not intend to do so because there are other persons who are anxious to speak on this vital matter.  One matter I inadvertently omitted is the DIRT tax.  Reference was made to it earlier in the context that it might be the cause of persons keeping money at home now rather than putting it in the bank or the building society.  I believe that is not so.  There is, of course, tax paid at the bank and the building society on the same level.  Frankly, I believe that the exemptions made by the Minister in the Finance Bill, 1986, take due account of hardship cases and indeed deserving causes and I believe that there is no reason for anybody to quibble with that tax.  Finally, I want to say again that the Minister should be complimented on his foresight and vision in introducing a Finance Bill along these lines and topping it with the budget of 1986.  It does to my mind, give a lot of hope and promise for the time to come.</P>

      <P>I listened attentively to the Limerick Senator and I would agree with some of the sentiments he expressed in regard to this Finance Bill, especially in <Col N="1002" /> regard to the diversification that is producing a product that is marketable.  First however, I would like to welcome the Minister here.  He was appointed since the budget.  I know that he was Minister for Finance previously.  I do not know if he will be the &ldquo;longest&rdquo; Minister for Finance this time.  He realises himself that he is on a tight rope and I suppose he hopes to survive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it: That remains to be seen.  It was the hope of everybody that this Finance Bill would have addressed itself to the question of reforming the taxation system; but, unfortunately, it dispels the hope for the future that it would put a halt to rising unemployment.  That is not so.  I can see nothing in this Bill to remedy these ills which are affecting our economy and our country.</P>
      <P>This is a big Bill, and it is made up of restrictions and impositions; certain modifications are introduced, certain concessions made.  They are tied up in so much red tape and so many constraints that the concessions are absolutely vitiated.  It is a big Finance Bill of some 108 sections.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the only reference in the Minister's budget statement to agriculture, our greatest single industry, is a reference to farm tax.  To refer to farm tax in the context of the present state of the agriculture industry is nothing short of an insult.  All agricultural enterprises are losing money in terms of income, Being a farmer myself, I have always been interested in the development of agriculture, not only from the point of view of the farmers but because of its potential to generate economic activity nationally.  If the agricultural industry is expanding it will reflect itself throughout the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on agriculture, I want to say a few words about young farmers and their exemption from tax.  Over the past number of years there was exemption from tax for a young farmer who inherited a farm before reaching the age <Col N="1003" /> of 35 years provided he had completed at least a 100-hour agricultural course.  In this Finance Bill this has been changed: the age has been reduced from 35 to 30 years and the number of hours to be completed by the young farmer has been increased from 100 to 150.  This is terribly unfair, particularly since the subvention to ACOT has been reduced and there is no way for ACOT to provide additional hours for young farmers qualifying for this measure.  He might have 20 hours, if the farmers will not avail of this service now as a result of this new ACOT Bill under which farmers will have to pay for that service.  Everyone in this House recognises that the tax and duty exemption is a very advanced social measure which encouraged young people to acquire holdings and ensured that elderly people gave up their holdings and allowed younger people to take them over.</P>
    <P>It is indeed very sad that the only reference to agriculture was farm taxation when it should be recognised that the farmers of Ireland never had it so hard as at present.  Because of last year's bad harvest and the continuing bad spring, cattle are dying throughout the country, especially in my own County Limerick where there is worse land than the land in Senator Hourigan's area of east Limerick or where there is worse land than in County Meath, the Minister's county and smaller holdings.</P>

It is strange, but I believe that there is snow on the Galtee mountains even today.  I heard one time that Old Moore, when he was advising <Col N="1004" /> his son before he died, told him to predict everything but not to predict snow in June.  He could nearly predict it for this year.</P>

      <P>To be serious, I know that there were schemes to alleviate hardships.  The amount of money under the free voucher scheme to eliminate the hardship in this respect was very inadequate.  Some farmers who applied for aid under that scheme did not receive any help.  If the farm development services people decided that the applicant had 75 per cent of his feed requirement, the question of the quality of the feed this year was not taken into account in assessing these applications.  Actually, I was told yesterday by the manager of a co-op that a woman who badly needed feed stated in her application the amount of feed she had but she did not state the quality and because she stated the quantity she was turned down for aid.  Other people, when they were asked to say how many cattle they owned, were advised to put down the correct number because their last herd list would be on the computer and the officials would know anyway; they would not be able to get away with it.  Strangely, people who did put down the wrong number and gave false information were never inspected and got the grants.  This was a terrible anomaly and bad administration of this scheme.  It was unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you; I am pleased with that.  There was also dissatisfaction that it was only the difference between the intervention price and the actual price of a ton of barley that they got.  It was valued at £20.  That is what I was told.  It was inadequate.  I was inclined to blame the Government.  I am delighted that the Minister for Finance is looking into the matter because of the number of cattle dying throughout the country and especially in the west of Ireland, including my own country.</P>
      <P>Motorists are hard-hit by this Finance Bill, especially motorists by necessity. Not only have they to deal with the highest rate of purchase tax in Europe on a new car but they are now faced with an additional road tax and a further increase in the price of petrol, as announced in the budget.  It is rather strange to hear the Minister express confidence in the beneficial effects of the decline in worldwide prices on our economy while at the same time he is fighting off these beneficial effects by the savage increases announced in the budget.  A car is a necessity in this day and age.  There had already been a drop in petrol sales in recent years. I deplore the increase in taxation because it is very expensive to keep a car on the road.  The Government cannot justify the heavy taxation on petrol and so on.  The reason for these taxes no longer exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government cannot also justify keeping a tax on ESB.  It is an insult to domestic consumers to ask them to wait until next September for a reduction in ESB prices when they are paying every two months.  When oil was on the up they had to pay the increase.  All sorts of excuses were used to put up ESB bills; now that the cost have come down the <Col N="1006" /> Government are trying to tell domestic consumers to wait to get the benefit.</P>
    <P>It is also an insult to the industrial, commercial and business people to say that they can only get a reduction of 4 per cent to 6 per cent.  It is about time the Minister for Energy took the whole matter in hand with a view to a reduction in energy costs realising that we have to become competitive.  The private sector and others who are trying to export goods need to be competitive in the market place.  They are operating at a disadvantage in relation to inflation and, with all the taxation there is little they can do about competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have made more finance available for road repairs.  The country roads are in a very bad condition, the worst in living memory.  I make a special case for an increase in allocations for roads in rural areas.  If this is not done soon there will be no roads at all.  I was looking at the road development plan for the eighties, which includes my own constituency of Croom, County Limerick. There is a bottleneck situation in Croom. I noticed that in the projected scheme the Croom by-pass was to be done in the 1985-86 plan, but there is no progress in that respect.  That is an area where there could be more employment given and perhaps ease the black economy.  If we could get more people working on the construction of by-passes and roadways it would help employment.  Employment is the greatest problem in Ireland and this Finance Bill has done nothing to tackle it by creating jobs.</P>
    <P>In the past three years the number of unemployed has escalated from 170,000 in 1982 to the present level of 240,000 people, notwithstanding the fact that approximately 30,000 young, talented well-educated people have to emigrate each year.  The Minister mentioned that the figures for unemployment in the past month were encouraging.  Nevertheless, when one takes into account the number of enumerators employed in taking up the census, these figures might not be real.  I read in my local paper that on the Maigue drainge scheme over 100 people <Col N="1007" /> are to be made redundant.  I made reference to this on the Adjournment of the House recently and made a plea for some tributaries and extra channels to be included.  Senator Hourigan also asked that the Maigue would be continued until the Mulcaire would be done.  It is disappointing to find out that some of the channels that I was requesting to be included in this scheme have not been included and that there is not much hope of the Mulcaire being done.  This is going to put more people on the live register. The Government forecast in <i>Building on Reality</i> that unemployment would be 226,500 at the end of the plan.  When <i>Building on Reality</i> had been in existence only one month the employment figures were well off target by 13,000 and have continued to be very much off target. There is no plan for reducing unemployment.  In recent years the number of unemployed has spiralled.  Closures and impending closures continue unabated. The incentive to work has been diminshed to some extent by the impact of high taxation, direct and indirect.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the 35 per cent deposit interest retention tax which was introduced in the budget which is included in this Finance Bill and which applies to all interest paid on deposits in banks and other financial institutions. This retention tax is commonly known throughout the country as the DIRT tax; it definitely has a dirty name.  The Minister gave the impression that it was a tax on banks and financial institutions, but that is not the case; it is a direct tax at source on the general public all of whom have already paid tax on their investments.  The Minister for Finance indicated that income tax reductions were needed immediately and that different measures like this new tax must be contemplated to achieve the overriding priority of reducing income tax.  One cannot accept that income tax reductions can be achieved only through the imposition of a 35 per cent retention tax, especially where income is not liable for tax.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept this imposition on the weaker section of the community, especially <Col N="1008" /> old age pensioners and widows.  The Minister for Finance indicated he is increasing the exemption limits while at the same time imposing tax at source on the income of those exempt.  Those under 65, whether widows, single or married, are totally dependent on interest from their deposits.  Under the Minister's proposal tax is to be deducted at source from that income.  Young people who do not have a taxable income will be subject to the same treatment.  This tax offends against every principle of justice.  The concession for people over 65 will allow them to claim a refund of tax deducted if they are not liable for income tax.  Repayments will be made to them by the Revenue Commissioners on receipt of applications by the end of each year.  Some old people are very slow to make applications and some of them might be so old that they would not bother; and, since processing of applications is a slow business, they may even have died before they get it. These people over 65 should not have to apply for a refund; it should not apply in the first instance.  What is the position of the people who exist on the interest earned from investment?  Will they have to wait months for a refund?  Most old people have not the experience of completing tax forms and many of them are afraid to make a claim for the refund.</P>
    <P>The new retention tax is a cause of serious concern to those in advanced years.  It is also a cause of serious concern to charitable and voluntary organisations.  I am a member of a voluntary organisation who are doing great work for the community.  I refer to the GAA. They are campaigning to ensure that voluntary organisations such as this would be excluded from the deposit retention tax.  The Gaelic Athletic Association are a national, cultural and community organisation.  They are voluntary in nature and have no interest in profit for profit's sake, nor in the accumulation of financial wealth.  The association's income from all levels is used to promote the national games of hurling, Gaelic football and handball and to develop club grounds and stadiums, social amenities for members and for the community in <Col N="1009" /> general; and to meet the normal costs of administration and staging of games.  This income falls short of what is required. The GAA clubs provide playing pitches and dressing rooms and erect social centres with the money they receive through voluntary effort.  At times they have to put this money on deposit and the interest from this helps them to continue their work.</P>
    <P>The GAA take on the responsibility of creating an accident fund which is solely dependent on internal association funding and earning on deposit interest.  As personal accident insurance will become prohibitive, this now is the association's sole means of giving reasonable cover for injuries to their many thousands of players.  The association have been gravely concerned about the escalating demands being made on them by way of public liability.  They are endeavouring to create a fund internally which will meet claims of up to £1 million.  This fund will be provided by subscriptions from the already hard-pressed clubs and from the provincial and central councils; it will be widened so that the association will be in a position to maximise their fund if they are to meet their responsibilities.  It was the association's intention to put this fund on deposit to earn money but this retention tax is a big blow to their plans.</P>
    <P>The GAA are anxious to meet the Minister in this connection; I believe efforts were made today to do so.  I see the Minister has gone.  I hope he is meeting the GAA.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister of State whose brother is, I think, chairman of a divisional board in west Cork, could at this late stage, see to it that something is done if possible to eliminate this DIRT tax on voluntary organisations and the GAA.</P>
    <P>The GAA are involved in vital work; they have their own insurance schemes for the protection of injured players; they have their own public liability to ensure that patrons generally would be covered. They are doing all this through their own resources.  The deposit interest retention tax is an irritant and liability for the GAA in promoting games.  I would be grateful <Col N="1010" /> if the Minister of State would convey to the Minister the concern of the many voluntary organisation in regard to the DIRT.  These organisations are involved in providing amenities for our people, including games and especially now that there so many unemployed, this should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Government are trying to &ldquo;con&rdquo; the people into believing that some wonderful benefits will accrue from the child benefit scheme.  The people were told only half the story.  This scheme will mean that for a person with three children, the increase of £36 per year in respect of each child will amount to £108.  However, what the people have not been told is that if the income-earner of the family is paying tax at the rate of 35 per cent the child benefit scheme will mean an increase of £3 per year for a family of three children or £1 per child.  In other words, the increase will amount to 2p per week per child.  This is calculated on the basis of 35 multiplied by three and taking into account the abolition of the £100 child allowance in income tax.  This is the level of increase being offered at a time when the prices of such items as milk, butter, bread, and electricity and telephone charges are rising.</P>
    <P>The increases to social welfare recipients and to old-age pensioners were inadequate.  I recently came across an anomaly where a small farmer was prepared to sign over his farm to his son if he thought he would qualify for the old age pension; his wife was earning, and on investigation, I was informed that the only deduction allowed from her earning was the PRSI; there is no allowance for PAYE or for travelling expenses if the spouse would qualify for a pension.  This is something that should be looked into as it is unfair.  This man if he knew he would qualify for the old age pension &mdash; it is doubtful because of the restriction on the deductions allowed &mdash; would willingly sign over his farm to a younger man.</P>
    <P>Every year in the House I mentioned VAT on hurleys.  I have already spoken on the serious effect the deposit interest retention tax will have on voluntary organisations, expecially the GAA, who <Col N="1011" /> have deposits on short term in the banks. VAT on hurleys is a penal imposition on the organisation responsible for promoting this national game.  The GAA are doing great work in this respect and what would accrue to the Exchequer from VAT on hurleys would be very little, but it would be of immense benefit to the promotion of hurleys and hurling.  Hurling is our national game; hurleys cost a lot and they are easily broken.  I am not calling for the removal of VAT from footballs or any other articles involved in promoting GAA games but from hurleys. I am involved in a club and already this year they have spent £700 on hurleys. This gives an idea of what it costs to buy hurleys.  Money has to be raised through raffles, church gate collections, tournaments and so on, for this purpose.  This is something that the Government could afford to remove and thereby show some goodwill towards the GAA who are doing great work in promoting our national game.  The GAA are an organisation who should be appreciated for all the work they have done down through the years.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that my colleague from the west, who will understand what I am going to say, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy John Donnellan, is present.  I was advocating last week that some rethink should be done with regard to small farmers along the western seaboard who are at present being harassed as a result of a court case, with which the Minister is only too familiar.  That court case has resulted in factual rather than notional assessments for unemployment assistance.  The net result is that those small farmers along the western seaboard are among the very few farmers who have to keep accounts &mdash; they do not have to pay tax &mdash; to try to establish their right to unemployment assistance.  I can only say this is putting these people through their own type of western hell.  The old phrase &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht&rdquo; takes on a new meaning. Some officers are making life a little easier for everybody while others are making it a little more difficult.  The Minister will understand that at the end of the day for every £1 the small farmer produces his unemployment assistance is reduced by £1.  If he produces £1,000 worth in the year, he ends up losing £20 per week.</P>

If it is a case that we are, and it is becoming evident that we are, then there is a double disincentive to these men.  The relevance I hope will now come clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to set up a small committee to examine the possibilities of having a scheme to encourage the small farmers on the poorest land in the country to get into forestry.  Obviously people involved in forestry cannot possibly wait until the crop is mature &mdash; either 20 years initially or a full 40 years to harvest it.  That is just not on.</P>
      <P>Could the financial institutions involve themselves in subsidising those farmers or in advancing something to them or could the State involve itself in subsidising them?  My own motion is that these farmers, in the first instance, should not be in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Lest the record show that I spoke against farmers I say immediately that it must, of necessity, be substituted by some other form of income.  A form of income, I submit, could come from the Forestry Department by way of an incentive to get them involved in forestry.  This could tide them over until such time as the crop arrives.  If the State or the financial institutions become involved, they can bear the financial burden and allow farmers to sell trees on their own land and make a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are my few thoughts on the matter.  I would be pleased, if, when the Minister is responding, he made reference to this submission, or, indeed, at some time in the future.  I should like to talk to him privately because I believe there is some merit in it.  There is no point in forcing small farmers to continue on unemployment assistance; nor is there any point in forcing them to produce more if western Europe is overproduced and if the unit cost of production on those small farms is higher than the unit cost of production on better farms with better type of land.  I believe there is merit in the idea.  Unfortunately, I could not put <Col N="1014" /> any figures on it but it might be worth while to put some flesh on those bones.</P>

      <P>I have no trouble with the motion or, indeed, with the amendment, because most of us here have matured enough that all we want to get are results which will benefit all the people of the nation.  I should like to put on the record my personal thanks to former Members of both Houses, mostly backbenchers, who were responsible for the forests we have today.  Ireland is in an unique situation to avail of the opportunities at present available in the whole area of timber development.  The outlook for timber growing is excellent.  We have both the soil and the climate to make Ireland the most suitable country in Europe for growing trees.  Added to that, we have a huge area of marginal land which is highly suitable for forestry. However, the percentage of our land under forest at present is the lowest in the European Community.  Approximately 6 per cent of our land is under forest compared with 25 per cent of the land in France and 30 per cent of the land in Germany.</P>
      <P>The State have been involved since early this century in a direct programme of afforestation.  A huge investment of taxpayer's money and resources, a sum in the region of £500 million, has been spent in this programme.  This has directly and indirectly created jobs in the forestry sector and in transport.  A wide range of skills, experience and technical expertise in forest industries has been built up over the years.  We are now at the stage where 60 years of investment, hard work and dedication have paid off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trees take a long time to grow.  Due to the wise decisions I referred to earlier, taken by some men and by not so many women, in the early years of the State we now have a forestry estate worth an estimated £1 billion to £1.5 billion.  It is against this background that it came to light in Barretstown last year that the present Government, for short term financial expediency, might sell off some of our forests.  I was glad to hear the new Minister for Forestry, Deputy Kavanagh, <Col N="1015" /> contradict that decision in his address to this House.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me that the decision to sell off mature forestry is a mistake and an abandonment of the commitment of successive Governments who, since the foundation of the State, have adopted a vigorous programme of State afforestation.  It also means, in effect, that the financial investment of the State in growing trees would be handed over to banking institutions and such like.  This, to me does not seem right.  There are ample opportunities for the banking institutions to take a stake in the private sector if they want to do so.</P>
    <P>Even though the State has been successful in their afforestation programme, in recent years the planting rate has gone into decline.  We now have a critically low reserve.  State planting last year was about half of the Government's target. This had come about due to the fact that the Government have not acquired or planted land in a last three years.  It is then of urgent necessity to get on target with our land acquisition programme.</P>
    <P>The case in 1986 is stronger than at any time before.  The EC is 50 per cent self-sufficient in timber needs.  Britain imports 90 per cent of its timber requirements.  In Ireland we spend £500 million approximately on timber imports.  The case for developing our forests is perhaps more relevant today than in the past.  If the Government wish to get away from policies which have been followed by successive Governments, then they should come out and clearly say so.  If they want to follow the policies of Margaret Thatcher in the privatisation of forests, they should come clean and say so.</P>
    <P>The general outlook for timber growing is that the demand is outstripping traditional sources of supply.  Everybody agrees that, with national and international shortages, timber prices are likely to increase substantially and also at a faster rate than other commodities. Therefore, the outlook for forestry investment is extremely good and is likely to remain so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> I have no block about private or public.</P>
    <P>I would welcome people who have money and want to invest it, people who can wait for the return and perhaps leave the assets of the private forests to their grandchildren or great grandchildren. Perhaps the State cannot wait that length of time.  Despite the best State efforts there is, as I have already said, still considerable scope for timber growing. There are many opportunities for private timber growers to get involved now.  I should like to call on financial institutions and, indeed, on the co-operative movement, to get more involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, the mature State forests being sold off to private banking and financial institutions and, on the other hand, asking private banking to buy land and plant the trees and by so doing creating jobs and employment, particularly when we have been spending so much time trying to think up job creation opportunities.  This should be done. It is well recognised in the industry itself that the Government's system of operation is not adequate for the proper commercial management of our woodlands. The Irish Timber Council, which represents the sawmills, have already advocated the establishment of a commercial board to undertake this task.  Indeed, the technical and professional personnel in the Forestry Division have come out strongly in favour of the new arrangement.  In a recent report on forestry the former Minister for Forestry, Deputy O'Toole, also recommended the establishment of a special enterprise section in the Department to undertake this job. However, as far as I am aware, no such action has taken place.</P>
    <P>The Government have ignored the advice of the Irish Timber Council and have totally ignored the advice of their own professional personnel.  Very little land has been acquired for development by the Department.  No work has been undertaken in the provision of roads infrastructure and in regard to the thinning process.</P>
    <P>I will not start talking about roads, because that is for another debate.  However, <Col N="1017" /> I should like to make reference to the western package.  The uptake of the forestry provisions of the western package, in respect of which substantial grants have been offered, has been very limited due to the fact that no income is forthcoming in the early stages of development.  Some method must be found to guarantee a payment of some kind to farmers who get involved in tree planting so as to encourage activity in this area. Perhaps something like headage payments might be encouraged in this area. The western package has been a little disappointing.  There is some other incentive needed and perhaps the Minister might have another look at it for us. This might be achieved under structural systems at present before the EC Council.  Encouraging forestry among small farmers would also meet another desirable objective, that of keeping our small farmers on the land.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to see a situation develop in which the big financial consortiums would buy up plantable land, especially in the west of Ireland.  It would be a repetition of the plantation of earlier times.  Again, I repeat here if people in the private sector have sufficient money the best way of showing their patriotism would be by buying land that could be not be used for tillage or grain and using it for afforestation purposes.  I trust this suggestion will be taken up by people with money to invest and who could wait for the return from it.</P>
    <P>This would create wealth and jobs because even in the old days people had jobs in forestry.  They may not have been highly paid jobs but they were very good jobs.  Indeed, Senator Michael D. Higgins will remember many good families in Clare, neighbours of his, who were reared from the good forestry around Ruane and around the other side of the town.  Those people reared great families.  Afforestation should be encouraged again.</P>
    <P>I do not have any trouble in supporting the motion and I have no disagreement with the Government amendment.  My attitude is that, when something like this comes before us at this awful time in the <Col N="1018" /> nation when people want jobs if we can create them, that surely should be first and foremost in our minds.  Together with Senator Kiely and other members of this party and, indeed, Members on the Government side I am glad that we have this motion before us.  Some would say that it should have been taken sooner but I am glad to be able to speak on it this evening even if it is only to make the Minister look again at afforestation.  I want to make it quite clear that I do not have any block about the private sector or the Department doing it if it gives jobs and creates wealth in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the generous spirit of the previous speaker who suggests that this House should be united in seeking the maximum employment potential from the development of forestry in Ireland.  I would reciprocate and say that I have no difficulty with the motion in the name of the Fianna Fáil Senators which reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to prepare and implement a plan for the maximum exploitation of our forestry resources and rejects any attempt by the Government to dispose of State forestry to private banking and financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the few remarks I have to make this evening, however, I should like to deal with the question of the chequered history of forestry in Ireland, the present requirements, as I see them for the restructuring of future forestry development, and this very question of employment potential that might exist.  You can summarise what I have to say by saying that the future of forestry is in sharp contrast to its recent history.  It offers immense prospects if properly developed.  For example, we are members of the European Community which supplies 50 per cent of its own wood requirements. Britain, our nearest neighbour, imports 90 per cent of its timber requirements and, indeed, looking at our own economy we import timber every year to the value of £300 million.  There is a genuine belief <Col N="1019" /> that those imports into our economy could be replaced.</P>
    <P>We are also in possession of a number of fine documents, including some that have come from the Forestry and Wildlife Service, telling us about the employment potential of the timber industry.  What we should, perhaps, concentrate on in the motion are what are the obstacles to the development?  I think the obstacles arise in relation to the tardiness with which the private planting policy has proceeded.  Frankly, it is the State that has developed the major forests of Ireland and, secondly, there is the question of having an integrated approach that we are speaking not only of planting but about every stage of production and not only about timber but the total environmental context in which our forestry policy is prosecuted.  Indeed, Robert Kane, if I may quote him, in his very famous inventory of the national resources of Ireland in 1844 said of the forests of Ireland:</P>
    <P>In this country we may practically exclude wood from our consideration as a fuel.  There is no feature of an Irish landscape more characteristic than the desert baldness of our hills which robbed of those silvanannas that elsewhere diversify a rural prospect present to every eye a type of desolation which has overspread the land.</P>
    <P>When you think of Robert Kane writing that in 1844, one of the images that immediately came to my mind was the kind of despoilation that has taken place in some of the Third World countries where people in the absence of alternative fuels and energy have cut their trees, have, for example, produced charcoal and so on. When the Irish Free State was founded the situation was not very much better than what he described in the middle of the nineteenth century.  When we look at the history of forestry which was my first point, we see a low level of initiative taken at individual level.  I am not setting up an ideological point.  I am simply saying if you want a forestry policy it will be State led.  I believe that history <Col N="1020" /> indicates that.  When we speak of the low level of initiative shown at individual or community level since the foundation of the State, I want to say further that, without the dedication of the Department of Forestry, the situation would be little less than disastrous.  The State's contribution to forestry has been very substantial.  In 1920, 1 per cent of the country was covered with forests and the programme of afforestation reached its peak in 1960 when 25,000 acres were planted and it has stayed at that level ever since.  At present something like 5 per cent of the land surface of the Republic is forested.</P>
    <P>Regrettably there has been a decline in planting policy in recent years.  The motion is correct to identify that.  I believe that the decision to cut back on planting was taken in the context of the absence of two fundamental policies that are crucial.  One is in relation to forests specifically and I said that it has to have this element of integration and it is to the credit of the Forest and Wildlife Service that they always had an environmental context in mind for their policies. Equally, there should have been, perhaps, a land policy.  People speak about integrating agriculture and food which is integration in the direction of the market, but, equally if you want to manage land perhaps there should be a wider land policy within which you would have forestry policy.  Then there are all the human incentives which need, perhaps, to be built on top of economic incentives to induce people to become involved.  I have no hostility to any private individual or interest who want to plant trees.  I have, though, to private individuals, who not having planted the trees, not having put in the labour would seek the benefit at the end of the stream.  When we look at the private record in planting, it is unfortunate and far from satisfactory. Indeed, one could be dismal about forestry and I think many people are and, unnecessarily so, if you look at its past record but the future for forestry is bright.</P>
    <P>I have already quoted figured of the potential existing within the European <Col N="1021" /> Community, within our larger neighbour, its economy, and in terms of our own import substitution.  I say in contrast to the private record of planting, development and planning, in contrast to the private record which has achieved so little, there is the State record from the very first time when a forestry branch was established in the Department of Agriculture and technical instruction in 1904. The Avondale Estate was purchased and a forestry center and school were established.  In 1907, when a departmental committee recommended the acquisition of land for afforestation by the State, the State programme was under way.  The increase from 1 per cent to 5 per cent is perhaps insufficient, but it is a proud record of State activity in planting, State activity in being interested in forestry, State activity in providing Ireland with trees.  We are still short obviously of a fully developed forestry programme and a fully developed timber programme but that is hardly the fault of the public service.  In the Government's plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, there is a stated target for planting.  It is unfortunate that in 1984 there was a shortfall between stated target and achievement.</P>
    <P>Let us think about private forestry.  In 1973, private forestry reached a total of 200,000 acres.  Contrast that with the State investment.  I am delighted that this motion is worded the way it is, correctly recognising &mdash; and I hope the House is united on this &mdash; that responsibility rests with the State to create the employment from forestry that we need, and to implement policies that are integrated and broad enough, that will include planting, education, harvesting, milling and the environmental aspects of parks.  Explicit policies will help.</P>
    <P>There is a very exciting future for forestry.  Even the European Community is under-supplied in relation to its needs. There is an enormous imbalance in afforestation.  France alone accounts for 45 per cent of the total area covered by forests in the Community.  France, Germany and Italy together, account for 90 per cent of the Community forests. <Col N="1022" /> We think immediately of the related and potentially integratable industry, tourism.  One has to consider the potential of afforestation not only in relation to short term jobs but to the employment that arises from lateral and verticle linkages. We should look at the models the Community offers us.  There are some limitations to what we can learn from Scandinavian and European Community examples.  First, the units there tend to be very much larger and, therefore, the potential for the multi-faceted development I am speaking about is perhaps greater there.  It is possible, however, to develop within an integrated plan a set of linkages that will generate enormous employment.</P>
    <P>There is the economic and employment potential of forestry on the one hand and the related question of the management of the environment.  The increase of afforestation is an environmental issue.  Here a question arises, a social problem.  Let us take the structure of land holdings in the western countries. Two-thirds of the holdings are under 50 acres and many are held an multiple holdings which are fragmented and so forth. How could you, by a series of individual decisions, achieve the full potential of a forestry policy?  That is one of the challenges that must be faced.  The question arises of implementing some of the recommendations made by the Forestry and Wildlife Service in its publication on the potential employment in forestry and the National and Economic Social Council's document 46 which spoke of the various options of renting and leasing.  In the Forestry and Wildlife Service's document there were initially six plans for the development of afforestation ranging from one very desirable one requiring a great deal of State investment, with massive employment potential, to one based on a thin level of incentives, the basic or minimum option.  The studies are available and they tell us that through different, attractive, social and economic options land can be acquired but that you must get back to planting targets.  That is crucial.  If the State reduces planting <Col N="1023" /> levels the record shows that Ireland's forestry potential will not be achieved by the private sector alone.  Let me immediately say that I am not setting up an ideological hurdle which would stand in the way of employment.  The NESC report 46 to which I have referred spoke about a mixture of private and State initiatives in a number of State and semi-State areas.  I wish to place on the record my belief that a policy that allows private participation at the final end of the life-time of a forest without having to accept any of the investment risk, any of the socially desirable obligations or any of the environmental obligations, would be a short term and a bad policy, would not be in the national interest and should not be implemented.  It should be possible to put together packages that would attract to afforestation institutional investors, people who manage pension funds, people who manage other funds who are looking for long term investment.  They will know from the findings of the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1981 that they can hope for a return on their money ranging from 2 to 7 per cent.  There are other studies giving the suitability of various lands.  All of these offer exciting investment opportunities. My plea therefore is this: excellent work has been done but the basic minimum requirement is maintenance of the long term fertility and productivity of plantations.  Attention should be paid to new roles for forests other than the conventional ones.  Forests should be developed and exploited in a way that minimises the risk of causing damage to any other form of agricultural activity.  The landscape should be considered.  The State needs to renew its commitment to research and development so as to enable the excellent work that has been carried out by the Forestry and Wildlife Service to be resumed and continued.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would look forward to the National Development Corporation having within it a land development unit and within the land development unit a significant and exciting role for the Forestry <Col N="1024" /> and Wildlife Service in possession of a policy on forests and potential employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody studying this question of forestry must regard it as something of a mystery that more has not been done in this area over the years. That is not to say that a good deal has not been done.  A good deal has been done but far more should have been done.  It is quite obvious that there is a tremendous potential for the forestry industry in Ireland and that that potential has not been realised.  If we look at the problem against the background of Europe we find that Europe has a serious balance of trade problem in regard to foresty goods, which now runs into £8 billion.  After oil, wood is the single biggest import into the European Community.  Quite obviously the Community needs more home produced wood and although no policy has been yet evolved in regard to forestry the Commission has produced proposals.</P>
      <P>The Commission realises that forestry must be encouraged, and I have no doubt that it will be encouraged and that eventually incentives will be offered to expand and develop the forests in Europe.  We can rely on the fact that there will be help forthcoming from the Community in due course for forests.  In general terms, something like 50 per cent of the world's forests are in the Third World.  They have been seriously depleted by western demand up to now. If this demand continues to rise, which undoubtedly it will, supplies will become increasingly scarce.  It will not only become scarce but also expensive if these countries eventually ban the export of wood in its ordinary form and export only processed timber.  We can look at the problem in the sense that there will be a world shortage, particularly in Europe, and there will be every incentive to increase our forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is in an unique position because we have the best conditions in Europe for forestry.  Forests grow easier and faster here.  Much of the land unsuitable for <Col N="1025" /> agriculture is ideal for forestry.  We have problems at present in selling our agricultural produce.  Much of our land which is unsuitable for agriculture or is growing agricultural goods which we cannot sell could produce wood for what is an assured market.  Much of the land suitable for forestry is in disadvantaged areas and, in any event, even if the Community does not produce some very specialised policy on forestry, people in those areas could be funded from the regional fund.</P>
    <P>The Irish Timber Council have submitted certain views about the position at present.  They say that the mills are below capacity, that they are frustrated in getting supplies under the present system and, because of that, employment is far below its potential.  They make some rather wide critisms of the present position.  They say that the organisation and operation of the forestry service at present is disorganised.  The deficiencies in operation which they say the Forest and Wild Life Service are responsible for are set out in Report No. 15 of the Fourth Joint Committee of the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, which states:</P>
    <P>The alleged deficiencies in the operation of the Forest and Wildlife Service are stated to be: the absence of any specialist training for its management and staff; the inordinately high harvesting costs because of faulty methodology; the lack of any policy to improve timber quality by culling and proper resource management; the absence of any marketing ability within the service.</P>
    <P>While the report of the Review Group on Forestry set up by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and which reported in November 1985, does not entirely agree with the criticisms of the Irish Timber Council, they do lend considerable support to these complaints and specifically agree that the approach of the Forestry and Wildlife Service should be a more commercial one and that the management needs to be restructured.  This report is at present being considered by <Col N="1026" /> the Minister.  It has not been implemented.  There is good reason to believe that there is considerable room for improvement in management in that area.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of private forestry is that it is a long term investment.  I would like to take issue, to some extent, with Senator M. Higgins about his remarks on private forestry.  We should have regard to the fact that in most European countries a very large element of forestry is privately held.  Perhaps the reason we have such a low amount of forestry is that it is almost entirely State-owned and that private industry has not taken part in it.  Instead of proving how bad the input of private industry has been, we should be encouraging it in every possible way.  The potential that is there cannot be achieved entirely by the State.  Consequently, we should encourage private input also.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of private enterprise in forestry is the fact that it is such a long term investment.  This is particularly true of the small landowner.  Many of these landowners in suitable areas are of an advanced age and many are unmarried.  There is very little incentive for them to tie up their land for a long period for people in whom they have no interest. There must be a way to pay an annuity or to make headage payments and some kind of forward selling to deal with this problem if we are to get results from private landowners.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to the joint committee that the involvement of the co-operative movement would be useful in this respect.  The co-operative movement could provide the back-up structures, the encouragement and possibly, the kind of annuities necessary to encourage the private owner.  This presents many problems.  It has presented problems in the past.  It is the reason why little progress has been made.  These problems are capable of being solved.</P>
    <P>Obviously, I support the motion.  The maximum exploitation of forestry should be achieved for the benefit of the State and the people.  It would be completely <Col N="1027" /> wrong to indulge in any kind of privatisation of State forests, certainly in any wide-scale way.  However, one should not be completely rigid about this.  A case might be made from time to time in small areas for the sale of areas of forestry coming to maturity and for the State to use the proceeds of these sales to plant more forests or to use the money for the benefit of State forests generally.  It must be realised that the State has to sell at some stage.  In some cases it might be good business to sell before cutting.  By doing this they would save the cost of cutting and transportation.  This is a decision which should be made on a commercial basis and is the kind of thing that is lacking in the Department.  They need more flexibility and an ability to judge what is in their best interest at any given time and to act on that basis.  If the recommendations of the report that is before the Minister and the recommendations that have been made by the joint committee are taken into consideration, we will have a flexible and commercial approach in the future.</P>
    <P>We have a lot to learn from listening to the contributions to this debate which has been an extremely interesting and useful one.  Forestry is an ideal industry for Ireland.  We have possible advantage in developing the industry.  There is tremendous potential for it.  We should make sure that it is availed of.  It needs better management, more flexibility and a commercial approach and I think that will be forthcoming.  There is a great deal of leeway to be made up.  It is not the kind of industry in which things can be done very quickly but in so far as they can be done every possible speed should be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my support for the sentiments expressed in the amendment to this motion.  I join with those who emphasise the importance of forestry and the potential it offers.  It is common knowledge that we are not at present reaching anything like our annual planting target of 25,000 acres.  That target could easily be of the order of <Col N="1028" /> 50,000, which would be more realistic. We are not realising even 50 per cent of that.  Over many years successive Governments, for various reasons, have been unsuccessful in meeting planting targets.</P>
      <P>The western package forestry scheme has not met with the success it deserves in spite of the generous grants that have been available &mdash; 85 per cent of grants have been available in conjunction with the western package for forestry development.  There must be innovative measures to attract the land for afforestation. That is the nub of the problem.  There must be an attraction for people who have land to make it available for forestry.  The acreage of land coming into the forestry pool will determine the success of forestry development.  Forestry development must not be exclusively in one direction.  It must be State-owned, privately owned, co-operatively owned, in part, and indeed a combination of all these three situations.  That is important. Circumstances in any given area will determine which combination ought to be pursued.</P>
      <P>Private ownership or co-operative ownership must start from the beginning, not when an objective has been achieved, and I would be against a matured forest being taken over by private ownership. If there is an important national asset consideration should be given to its disposal provided that the money accrued would be used for replacement of the forest.  That is an important dimension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In European terms, Ireland is extremely low in the production of forestry.  The EC is far from being self-sufficient in timber and relies on massive import levels to sustain the Community's timber processing mills.  We are talking of thousands of millions of pounds in value into the EC.  Therefore, the potential is fantastic.  The economic indicators all point to a healthy future for timber prices.  That is important.  The climate and soils here are extremely well suited to growing trees and there is a broad range of tax reliefs and benefits and so on available for persons who undertake <Col N="1029" /> planting.  We must bear in mind that there is good employment content in the development of forestry right across the spectrum from beginning to end.  This is something we must not forget, particularly when a lot of the manpower involved is unskilled.</P>
    <P>I am certain that farmers and land owners with low yielding agricultural land need some extra encouragement to switch over to forestry.  The gains from sales of thinnings and of the final crop of timber might be perceived as too long term having regard to the fact that timber only reaches full maturity in approximately 35, 40, 45 or 50 years, depending on the type of tree.  Some sort of leasing scheme is required which would bring the benefits of forestry investment forward for the small farmer who cannot afford to wait for that length of time.  Therefore, we are immediately into a leasing arena, whereby the man with the land would have that land leased from him by the State.  He would receive an income during the intervening years and ultimately he would become the owner of the land with the trees on it.</P>
    <P>There are many Irish companies very keen to invest in forestry.  Their intentions in that direction are well known. The farmer needs to get an annual return. In return the State would get the use of his land and eventually he would become the owner of the mature timber.</P>
    <P>There is a very good tradition of forestry in Ireland.  Having regard to the whole philosophy of the ownership of land, the only way to get forestry developed is through a leasing system.  We are at a stage where alternatives are needed to traditional or conventional types of farming, of which forestry is one.  There are one million acres of land that is unproductive.  That one million acres could produce forestry very effectively.  There are one and a half million acres, if not two million acres of marginal land.  There are, therefore, two million to two and a half million acres of land available for forestry development straightaway.  That is a good proportion of the total land area of this island.  That fact should not be overlooked.  We could even be talking <Col N="1030" /> about a higher figure but that is a starting point.  The outlook for timber growing in Ireland is very good.  We have the perfect soil, the perfect climate and we can beat the United Kingdom and other European countries in growing timber, particularly conifers.  We must not ignore the advantage we enjoy in this respect.</P>
    <P>There is only 5.7 per cent of the land of this country under forests at present, compared with 25 per cent in France and 29 per cent in West Germany.  Land which is marginal for agricultural purposes is most suited for forestry.  This is the irony of the whole matter.  The land in County Leitrim is second to none in Europe or anywhere else for forestry development while, as we all know, that type of land is very unsuited for agricultural development.  The EC at present is, as I said, importing thousands of millions of pounds worth of timber each year and is only about 50 per cent self sufficient in timber.  Britain, in fact, imports 90 per cent of its timber requirements.  International studies predict that timber prices are likely to increase at a faster rate than that of other commodities in the years ahead.  This is an extremely important factor in the whole matter.</P>
    <P>I talked about the very generous grants that are available.  I do not think they can be over-emphasised because for one reason or another people do not seem to understand that yet.  There are 85 per cent grants available.  There are liberal concessions in the taxation area and this again must not be forgotten.  There is free advice available from the Forest and Wildlife Service and other advisory groups in the country for the planting and management of forestry right up to the selling of trees stage.</P>
    <P>The growing of trees can be a very profitable enterprise for individuals.  It is an extremely beneficial and profitable enterprise for the State, in fact forestry plantations established at presentday costs would produce up to £12,000 worth of timber per hectare over a crop life on rotation of 40 years.  This represents a return of 4 per cent above inflation.  If the owners understood some of the forestry aspects there would be no problem.  The <Col N="1031" /> big difficulty we have is whatever road they are going to follow <i>vis-à-vis</i> forestry development the people must appreciate that growing trees is another crop.  It is very long term and therefore the man who engages in this work, if he is 30 years or thereabouts, does not expect to see that enterprise being completed.  As it is such a long term operation, there is a big selling job to be done, I believe the State has a vital function to make sure that the person who plants trees will see the year after he plants the forest, a return to him from that and that he will have an involvement in it.</P>
    <P>We import approximately £300 million worth of timber.  Apart from oil and food imports it is one of our highest import bills.  In the EC context it represents more than 11,000 million ECUs on an annual basis.  Portugal, of the 12 countries in the EC, is the only one that would be regarded as having a surplus with regard to timber.  It is regrettable that there is no policy within the EC for forestry.  I suppose one of the reasons for that is that it was never covered in the first instance by the Treaty of Rome.  The second point I would suggest is that there was never an appreciation during the better years in agriculture of the value of forestry. You are starting at a position where in fact there is not an EC policy for forestry as such.  We are badly in need of alternatives and must push very strongly that the common agricultural policy should include forestry.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the time factor and I know there are other Senators who want to speak.  In conclusion I emphasise that at a time when we have a vast surplus of milk, cereals and beef it is a very welcome alternative that we have forestry as something to develop.  There are approximately two million acres of inter-marginal land that could be added on to the couple of million acres I have already talked about.  It is an ongoing thing.  The point of stopping might be several millions from the present stage we are at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get an opportunity to make a few brief observations <Col N="1032" /> on this important motion.  I spoke on the same subject a number of times in this House and I do not want to repeat what I said then.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate An Foras Forbartha and the Department of the Environment for their very well produced report &ldquo;The State of the Environment&rdquo;, which was published last year.  It is a very comprehensive and full report.  It covers all the aspects of the environment in very great detail and, for anybody who is interested in the environment, it is compulsive reading.  Page 61 of this report shows a pattern of forest ownership in all the countries within the EC.  For Ireland 77 per cent of the forest area is in State ownership and 23 per cent in private ownership.  It is worth remarking, too, that the local authorities do not own any area of forestry.  The only other country in the same position is the United Kingdom.  It is a pity that this aspect is not brought into the open.  Local authorities, as far as I know, are empowered under section 77 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to undertake development of this kind. It is a pity that they have not done so.  It is something that should be considered by local authorities.</P>
      <P>With regard to wood it is worth while remarking that with the advancement in technological development and science no satisfactory substitute has been discovered for timber either in the decorative or structural sense.  Plastics and other materials, to some extent, are substituted but they could never compete with the natural grain either for decorative or structural use.  I do not think this is likely to change in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish timber is as good as the timber produced in any other part of the world. There are various ways of stress grading and deciding on the strength of timber and there is also the method by which experienced timber people determine how good a timber is.  Somebody who was involved in this area a long time back in my childhood told me that Irish timber was as good as timber anywhere else in the world if it got a chance.  The big problem about timber in this country is <Col N="1033" /> that in past times was felled, sawn up and put into use immediately either on the roofs of houses or whatever.  It did not get a fair chance.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we do not have a land policy.  It is very important that we would have a land policy with regard to all the aspects of land production.  We have suitable land for afforestation, as Members pointed out.  The review group on forestry went into this in great detail. A paragraph of their report states:</P>
    <P>The potential for forestry in Ireland is good.  Agricultural Institute studies identify one million hectares at present in low intensity agriculture which would, we consider, be far more productively used in forestry.  Of this one million hectares, at least 500,000 hectares of soils is ideally suited for forestry; another 500,000 hectares also has high production potential by European standards.  The Farm Management Survey shows that the return to ownership from this land is negative after allowing for labour at Agricultural Wages Board rates.  Family farm income on this land is very low and return on capital is negative.  In forestry such land would be capable of yielding, on a net discounted revenue assessment, a return in excess of 3 per cent over inflation.  The return to the economy would, of course, be much greater.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan has taken a figure of 4 per cent above inflation which is fairly close to that.  We have this potential at our disposal.</P>
    <P>I have made representations, like many other public representatives, to have land drained.  I have seen the advantages which accrue from drainage of land. I have seen crops grown on land which in the past grew nothing but rushes.  There is that short term benefit but possibly a long term benefit too.  Some people make the case that by and large, particularly with the increase of intensive farming, that the land which needs to be drained for agricultural purposes could be kept in its present state to preserve the fauna, the flora and the ecology of the place. <Col N="1034" /> In other countries, where they have to create this situation, it is a very costly operation.  We have it at our disposal and we abuse it by draining it because we interfere with the environmental aspects. The land policy should take all that into consideration including the area of land where trees should be grown.</P>
    <P>The main types of trees planted in these programmes are sitka spruce and lodgepole pine.  With regard to the land policy a good case could be made for planning permission for these areas because we change the whole environment with the planting.  There is an important reference in &ldquo;The State of the Environment&rdquo;, which brings out the point I want to make about changing the environment.  It states:</P>
    <P>Unless new coniferous plantations are sensitively designed and managed with due regard to the landscape character of the areas there may be a loss in landscape quality.  Landscape quality is a subjective concept with no generally agreed basis.  This concern is one of the major issues raised by an active afforestation programme.  Another environmental issue is the creation of extensive tracts of coniferous monoculture.  The associated fauna and flora are species poor, as coniferous litter does not encourage a rich ground flora. A feature of coniferous plantation soils is the accumulation of a partly degraded, acid needle litter.  The pool of soil nutrients is not actively regenerated.  On a long-term basis coniferous plantations on certain soils contribute towards podsolisation of the soil, which is the process by which nutrients are leached out or washed away from the upper soil horizons by acids formed from leaf litter.  Additional problems may arise from the run-off of water from forestry plantations which leads to the acidification of streams and rivers which, in turn, affects river ecology and, in particular, fish populations.</P>
    <P>This is a very important aspect.  I feel that a case could be made for planning permission in this regard or that the State <Col N="1035" /> would be in a position to enforce a programme that would not interfere with the environment.  From that point of view the State's role is most important.  We are losing our native species, broad leafed trees.  Local authorities could help in this area where new roads are made or widened.  They could plant trees along these roads.  They are not being planted at present.  I wonder why.  Local authorities could help here.</P>
    <P>Land is being bought in County Leitrim for afforestation by private individuals, I do not see anything wrong with that.  I believe that the price paid is such that local farmers who want to increase their holdings are unable to compete.  This is unfair and could be attributed to the need for a land policy.  People who buy this land will want it in close proximity to roads.  An afforestation programme should involve the provision of roads for indepth development.  I am sure this applies to many other areas as well as County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>There are good grants available.  I have found the Department very helpful when I needed information.  A major problem with regard to afforestation is forest fires. One sees in the papers where fire has ruined thousands of acres of land.  From the point of view of an investment it seems that when we talk about venture capital and getting money to invest in areas like that a forest fire must be a major problem.  We must decide whether it would be better for the State or private enterprise to invest in afforestation.  We must see which would benefit society most.  I visit a park in Doonaree quite often, it gives employment, all the visitors bring business to the shops, the hotels and the surrounding areas.  The State can take that into consideration.  A private individual would not be constrained in that regard.</P>
    <P>The co-operative movement has been referred to.  It has done marvellous work. I mention in particularly Muintir na Tíre who have a branch in almost every parish in Ireland.  When I was a youth I recall Munitir na Tíre doing marvellous work <Col N="1036" /> in my area in getting a large tract of land planted.</P>
    <P>Senator E. Ryan has stated that the pay-back is long term.  This is something that the State can cope with much better than private individuals.  I have no ideological hang-up about this.  Whichever is best for the country is the one that I would want.</P>

      <P>Whilst this motion has been on the Order Paper for some time, I am pleased with the discussion it generated in the House last week and this week.  I should like to thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.  The Fianna Fáil Senators who tabled the motion will be most satisfied with the debate and with the contributions made.</P>
      <P>There is an amendment to our motion. I do not see any need for it.  Senators Ferris and Michael D. Higgins spoke in favour of the motion.  The amendment is unnecessary.  The most important thing is that we had a frank discussion on a very important item, afforestation, which asks that we prepare and implement a plan for the maximum exploitation of our forestry resources.  The amendment asks that we take note of the Report of the Review Group on Forestry which was set up in accordance with the Government plan <i>Building on Reality.</i> I would like to commend the review group for their report.  It is a good report.  As I stated last week, the amount devoted to forestry in <i>Building on Reality</i> was very little. The annual planting target is 10,000 hectares and the current planting rate is about 6,500 hectares per year, and the paragraph that is devoted to forestry in that document &mdash; paragraph 7.70, page 146, states:</P>
      <P>Forestry: Government investment over the years 1985 to 1987 will aim at achieving the following results:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the establishment of plantations at an annual average rate of some 7,500 hectares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that we have only to assume that the Government's policy on afforestation is to plant less than the 10,000 hectares per annum which is the target.  This is a retrograde step.  I believe many in the <Col N="1037" /> House will see it in this light.  The target was not met in 1985.  At the rate of progress of their planting programme it will not be achieved in 1986.  The target of 7,500 hectares or 18,750 acres is not adequate for our planting requirements. It must be considered that there are 3,500,000 acres of wet mineral low-lying soil, which is particularly suitable for forestry.  To plant this 3,500,000 acres at the rate of 18,750 acres per annum would take over 186 years to complete, if we are to plant all the land suitable for afforestation.  This 3,500,000 acres does not include the acreage which will become available for plantation through re-afforestation.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated last week that serious problems have arisen for farmers engaged in the production of the traditional agricultural commodities in oversupply by the adoption by the EC of corrective measures of restraint on production of commodities such as beef and milk.  In the light of these developments farmers will have to examine an additional line of production such as forestry in which they can more profitably become engaged.  I am glad that the Minister realises that such is the case and that there is an urgent need for diversification to afforestation from the traditional system of farming where there is overproduction.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that there may be a reluctance on the part of farmers to change but if they are to be encouraged to plant their land, they need support during the development period while the trees are growing.  The most important incentive which can be offered to landowners engaging in forestry is some form of planting grant.  The State has provided planting grants through EC aid.  Despite this, there are not enough farmers participating in afforestation.</P>
    <P>The major deterrents are, of course, unfamiliarity with forestry techniques and lack of any interim income.  There must be compensatory payments.  I do not know if the Government intend making some compensatory payments to farmers who change from the traditional system of farming to forestry.  I do not <Col N="1038" /> remember the Minister stating if such grants will be available.  I am sure it is was considered at Cabinet level, the Minister would have referred to it last week.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the new structural regulation 797/85 the EC have made provision for compensatory payments in lieu of headage grants for farmers who are prepared to put their land into afforestation.  The western package grant scheme has changed the landowner's attitude to afforestation.  There are pockets of land in all parts of the country also suitable for afforestation.  In the same structural regulation 797/85, there is provision for a national grant system at rates similar to those in the western package.  It is essential that these grants be adopted to match the western package grant.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed when the Minister was speaking last year that he did not mention ash.  He mentioned the community forest in County Limerick where a group of local people banded together to form a company to purchase and plant almost 40 acres of land.  I was present at the opening and saw the plantation. There were 450 ash saplings planted.  The Munster Council of the GAA launched a &ldquo;grow ash&rdquo; campaign last year.  The council are prepared to make grants available to complement the Department grants for clubs which grow a minimum of two-thirds of an acre of ash.  This is necessary and must be encouraged to ensure that there will be enough ash available to manufacture hurleys for this and future generations so that our traditional game of hurling will continue to be played.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the tender system of purchasing timber from the Department of Forestry which is making the price too high and therefore prohibitive.  I should like to see this changed. Mill owners outbid one another.  I mentioned last week that processors in the north could not buy timber because of the tender system.  A forestry programme would be beneficial to tourists.  Private forestry must be encouraged and incentives should be given to farmers to plant. Oil is the largest commodity that is <Col N="1039" /> imported to the EC and wood is the next. I am delighted with the debate and I hope the Minister and the Government will act on it.</P>

      <P>Before I reported progress I was speaking about VAT on hurleys. The amount of money lost to the Exchequer as a result of an exemption of hurleys from VAT would be very small in relation to total VAT revenue.  All that would accrue according to the GAA calculation, is £350,000 from an annual sale of 100,000 adult hurleys and 150,000 juvenile hurleys.  The GAA are making a very reasonable case with regard to VAT on hurleys and also to rates on their property.  The issues involved are not of major importance in relation to the total revenue.  They are, of course, of major <Col N="1040" /> importance to the GAA.  It is felt that the GAA have a justifiable case.  Action should be taken on their behalf and there are a number of precedents for treating our native games in a special way.  I understand that the Finance Act of 1927, the Finance Act of 1932 and also the budget of 1980 exempted hurleys.  As I pointed out, before I reported progress, hurleys are different from other sporting commodities.  We are not interested in VAT being removed from other goods such as footballs.  Hurleys are a necessity for our national game.  We want to see it developed.  They can be broken easily, unlike other sports items.  The GAA have played a major part, a very vital and important role in the community life of this country.  After the tragedy of the Civil War when brothers were fighting against brothers, it was the GAA who united these families at that time and united the community.  The GAA, at present, are developing community live through the promotion of their games and especially by way of the provision of playing fields and amenities for the social benefit of the community.</P>
      <P>I should like to see VAT being removed from hurleys.  Directives issued by the EC support the GAA case in that exceptions may be made in the case of cultural bodies or non-profit making organisations in the sporting sphere.  The Sixth Council Directive of 17 May 1977 contains the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  childrens' or young peoples' education, school or university education, vocational training or retraining, including the supply of services and of goods closely related thereto, provided by bodies governed by public law, having such as their aim or by other organisations defined by the Member State concerned as having similar objects, (m) certain services closely linked to sport or physical education supplied by non-profit making organisations to persons taking part in sport or physical education, (n) certain cultural services and goods closely linked thereto supplied by bodies governed by <Col N="1041" /> public law or by other cultural bodies recognised by the Member State concerned.</P>
    <P>The GAA would definitely fall into the category of certain services closely linked to sport or physical education supplied by non-profit making organisations to persons taking part in sport or physical education.</P>
    <P>Last year I tabled an amendment. Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance on that occasion.  I quote from the Official Report of 23 May 1985.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>May I point out to Senator Kiely that I have reduced the rate of VAT on hurleys this year from 35 per cent to 23 per cent.</P>
    <P>It has been increased this year from 23 per cent to 25 per cent.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the scope for the introduction of new zero rates is severely limited.  In fact, it is not severely limited, it does not exist. What I did not point out to this House earlier on was the fact that I am already under a certain amount of pressure from the EC in relation to some of our existing zero rates.</P>
    <P>That is contradictory to the Sixth Council Directive of 17 May 1977.  I would like if the Minister would take that into consideration.  I do not know what he can do at this stage, but it is something that is very important to the promotion of hurling and to the GAA.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the deposit interest retention tax.  I said the GAA were anxious to meet the Minister.   When he went out and Deputy O'Keeffe, the Minister of State came in, I presumed he was meeting the GAA.  I hope he did meet them.  If he did not, I would like to see him meeting them soon.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister and to the House the great work the GAA are doing for the promotion of our national games and for community life, especially at a time like this when we have so many unemployed. They can utilise their leisure time in the GAA fields and not in other spheres.</P>
      <P>I was at the GAA congress this year and I hope to be there many more years. I have Dr. Loftus's address and I would like to quote from page 15 of it:</P>
      <P>May I ask, if the GAA were, somehow, to disappear tomorrow, how would the State cope?</P>
      <P>He is referring of course to the provision of community centres of which throughout there is one in nearly every parish and to the other amenities provided by the GAA.  This is something that must be recognised by the authorities, acknowledged and appreciated.  Dr. Loftus continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask, in that event, what increased proportions would a budget for the Minister for Sport assume?  As a small example may I instance that we <Col N="1043" /> are now paying almost £1 million in public liability insurance.</P>
    <P>This year, the GAA have their own public liability insurance and they intend putting that on deposit.  That is now subject to a 35 per cent rate of tax.  It means that they will not have adequate money to cover their public liability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that in the Dáil at some length.  I have to say, with the indulgence of the Chair, that the Gaelic Athletic Association should have a look at the way they dispose of their funds to see whether, in fact, the way they are using them at the moment is the best from the point of view of minimising their tax liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Loftus continued:</P>
      <P>Is it not time to face the truth and admit facts?  It is bad enough to have our enormous community contribution taken for granted by successive governments.  It is quite another matter when they put a levy on the facilities which we provide, almost altogether from self-finance, for our community on behalf of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on Dáil Éireann to end this injustice forthwith.  Indeed, in all justice, we should not have to ask.  The practical commitment to real patriotism which is freely made by the GAA should be recognised by all politicians. We do not want to be compelled to make public demonstrations but if we are compelled, then the option is made for us and this we shall do.  We shall <Col N="1044" /> leave our politicians in no doubt as to our deepest resentment in this continuing vexation.</P>
    <P>These are strong words.  Last year the Munster Council protested about this.  It was something that, as a member of the council, I did not agree with.  There is always a great relationship between the GAA and politicians.  Several members of this House are ex-Presidents of the GAA.  I refer to the late Dan O'Rourke of Roscommon who was President of the Association, the late Seán McCarthy of Cork who was another President, the late Bob Aylward of Kilkenny who was President of the Leinster Provincial Council, Senator Andy O'Brien, who was President of the Ulster Council, Denis Gallagher, a Member of the Dáil who was President of the Connacht Council, Seán Browne, former TD who was chairman of the Wexford County Board; Jack Fitzgerald, former Senator who was Chairman of the Meath County Board.  The former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, won All-Ireland medals in both hurling and football; there is Jim Deenihan; there is Seán Flanagan who won All-Ireland football medals; there is John Donnellan, Minister of State at the Department of Forestry, Séamus Kirk, Noel Treacy, Jim Tunney and the future Taoiseach's brother &mdash; Pádraic (Jock) Haughey, who won All-Ireland medals.</P>
    <P>It would be very sad for all of these people and for politicians &mdash; and I am sure Senator Browne opposite is very interested in the GAA &mdash; to see any rift between politicians and the GAA.  It would be very foolish for the sake of £350,000 if such a rift should occur.  This is what the VAT on hurleys means to the Exchequer.  The association are doing tremendous work for the youth of this country especially in creating parochial spirit and community life.  They provide amenities for the public which the Government would otherwise have to provide.  I would like if the Minister could do something about VAT on hurleys and the DIRT tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> Senator Hourigan mentioned diversification.  I would like to see diversification from products which are overproduced.  In this context I would like to say that farmers should be encouraged to take on afforestation on marginal land.  I did not see any provisions for it in the Finance Bill.  It is most necessary as was pointed out in the debate prior to this. Timber is imported into the EC and Ireland.  We have the resources in this country to produce such timber.  It should be a priority in any Government programme to ensure that we have proper afforestation.</P>

      <P>While we all complain that income tax if far too high, I notice that the Opposition are very much repeating the idea that we have crippling income tax and so on, we have promises that the basic rate will be reduced to a fraction.  All of that is fine, if, in actual fact, we are going to balance it by not giving the services that are required.  I find it difficult, as a politician, to hear some of my colleagues talking about giving big reductions in taxes and at the same time proposing no cuts at health board level.  The impression seems to be that taxes can be cut and at the same time services can be supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to the public this is double talk which we could do without.  It might appear that everything is rosy after a couple of years of hardship and cut-backs.  We could ruin ourselves by trying to spend what we have not got.  We are trying to pretend that we can carry on <Col N="1046" /> without tax.  I would love to see a reduction in tax.  I am well aware that individuals are paying too much tax.  There is no reward for people who work long hours of overtime or private individuals who put a lot of time and effort into making profit.  They are penalised by having to pay tax especially if they see people abusing our system.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the next budget, before we return to office, the Minister for Finance will be bringing in those reductions in a realistic way and that the Minister will not have to make many cut-backs in order to do it.  We have to keep services going.  We have to face reality.  I am glad this year that he has set about it by widening the tax bands.  He has reduced the 60 per cent band down to 58 per cent.  It might seem little to the individual taxpayer but when these cuts are applied right across the population of income taxpayers, obviously it means a big drop in income.  People might say that those who are in the 60 per cent band are the ones to be pitied but, on the other hand, if there is a 40p in the £ return it is not much for those who are supposed to be earning a lot of money, and for many of those on the 35 per cent it is also difficult. Ministers, especially the Minister for Finance, have difficult choices.  We are all eager to make special concessions and we can argue why certain people should get concessions but we seldom come in and give the Minister an idea where he can get extra money.</P>
    <P>On one occasion I said that Ministers for Finance should be treated in the same way as the Ceann Comhairle, who is automatically re-elected.  The Minister for Finance has to take a great deal of personal abuse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>It was very appropriate that Senator Kiely who wound up on the forestry <Col N="1047" /> debate before 8 o'clock and encouraged everyone to grow timber should immediately take over on the debate on the budget and talk about the use of ash for hurleys.  He got the case across very nicely and very pleasantly and I am sure the Minister had to be impressed by him. I would love to think that this Government was the Government that put an end to talking about VAT on hurleys because anybody involved with juveniles or a senior hurling club will realise that hurleys are very expensive and they can break very quickly.  At one stage I was arguing with a person who said that golf clubs cost a lot more and there is a lot more VAT on them.  I would suggest that unless you are a nut case playing golf and every time you hit a ball you get a slice and lose your temper and you wrap it round the caddy car those golf clubs will last you for your lifetime.  Even if you grow a bit taller than you were starting off there is no problem.  Hurleys do not last.  I can well imagine the Limerick boys pulling against the Clare lads and if they ever meet Carlow they will be in trouble because they are on the up as well and Meath are not too bad at hurling, so the Minister will have a special interest in this.  I think it would be a nice claim for the Minister to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Footballs last a long time, hurleys do not.  It is a very expensive sport to be involved in.  It is our native game and we should be prepared to make an exception for our native game, especially when it is in danger of dying.  Young lads get very disappointed if they pay even at a reduce price, for a hurley even if it is subsidised by the club.  They give their Confirmation money to buy a hurley and it might break in the first clash.  I would love the Minister in the next budget, to see that hurling gets that concession.  Every sports group can make a case for all kinds of exemptions and relief but I would not push some of the other things.  We have to take our share of these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> I know that every Minister for Finance would probably like to finish up with one rate of VAT and a lot of shopkeepers would like it too if it could work.  I know two people who gave up business simply because they spent so much time worrying about the VAT accounts that they could not tolerate it any more.  Bigger businesses are better geared but it is still difficult for them and they have to pay staff to do it.  As a percentage of their time it is something that does not affect them as much but smaller shopkeepers who are in the bracket for tax have not the same facilities and it is difficult for them.  Businesses are sometimes under pressure.  Often they have the choice of being late with their VAT payments or maybe letting workers go.  There are times when this is a genuine situation and the Revenue should take a reasonable line on it.  I know there are people who will try to cod the system but a lot of people are genuine and it is a tough time.</P>
    <P>I want to welcome the efforts to promote tourism by the reduction of VAT on food and cars, because all these things help to bring in tourists.  If they feel they are getting good value for money then they will come.  Tourism is one of the things that we should cash in on.  The weather at the moment may not be appropriate for talking about tourism but I know well that under this Government the summer will improve as well.  I do not want the Minister to make a commitment on that.</P>
    <P>The reductions are very good.  The rate on newspapers was reduced.  I notice the prices are going up.  I am sure it will not get headlines tomorrow in the paper. Without the reduction in VAT they may be gone out of existence but with VAT coming down it should be a help to many people.  I am delighted about the VAT reduction in the cinema.  I went to the Minister specially about that.  I am not saying it was done because of that.  Many small cinemas down the country were just barely ticking over and I know one in particular that was kept going because it was a form of benefit to the community and with the 10 per cent they are paying <Col N="1049" /> at the moment they will still be in trouble. At least it is a gesture of appreciation for what they are doing for the community. They could easily have closed and I was delighted that that reduction came.  I hope that with petrol prices coming down, inflation coming down, interest rates coming down, all of these things will set the scene for a recovery that is now overdue if we do not keep rushing about and spending in advance.</P>
    <P>I am glad of one other thing as well and that is the stamp duty on land transfer for farmers.  That was a very good gesture.  I know it was in longer than was planned originally but it will do a lot to encourage people to hand over land. While many of the old people were very good farmers, I think the younger farmers will have to get a chance and this is an encouragement to them.  I know it was criticised today because extra hours were put in and the age was reduced but if you are given a concession it is no harm to ask for standards.  In the long run we need the younger farmers to change a lot of our farming methods.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture gave a figure when we joined Europe in 1973 that 80 per cent of milk production went into butter and we are still putting 80 per cent of milk production into butter.  In Europe we are choc-a-bloc with every kind of commodity.  It is good to see the younger farmers coming in.  If they have done 150 hours of a course they will have new ideas.</P>
    <P>Forestry was discussed earlier and how we are under-utilising land and how it could be used if people did not have to wait too long for an income but that is a different debate.  It is something farming could change over to and it would avoid some of the butter mountains, milk mountains and corn mountains.</P>
    <P>Many farmers are in trouble with money.  They know about the Euro loans and it would be good to see the farmers getting a chance of Euro loans if they are in a position to avail of them and put them to use.  While banks have to survive I have been shocked on a few occasions at the way farmers are being treated.  I know of two cases of people who were <Col N="1050" /> genuinely paying back the banks.  One farmer paid in over £20,000 when he sold his cattle and within a few days a cheque for £40 was stopped.  I do not think that encourages farmers to continue making an effort.  If neighbours hear that they will be more inclined to leave the bank waiting for money.</P>
    <P>While banks have to survive and have to make profits they should take a very broad view of people who are trying to pay off their loans.  There was also another case of a person who paid in over £5,000 when he sold his sheep and he discovered that his money supply was cut off by the bank within a few days when they had got in a certain amount.  Farmers have to live in the meantime.  If they pay in a lump sum they still have to survive and be able to buy food.  It would be good if the Minister could help them by getting Euro loans at a lower rate and if the bank rate could come down in a way that they might not have to pay back as much. Perhaps I am asking for a lot to be done at the one time.  It is a rough time, it was a rough summer, it is a rough spring and many farmers are not going around thinking about how they will spend the profit they have been making.</P>
    <P>I am glad employment has been given a boost in the budget and especially the build-up to it where the PRSI exemptions managed to get in a couple of thousand jobs.  This is what we really want.  The more people we have working the more tax they will pay and the less will have to be paid out.  I am glad to see that happening.  I am glad that employment has been given a boost in the budget.  The PRSI exemptions which managed to get in a couple of thousand jobs are welcome. This is what we really want.  The more people are employed, the more tax will be paid and less money will have to be paid out by the State.  I am glad to see that happening.</P>
    <P>The black economy is causing quite a problem.  The Government have to be complimented on insisting that in order to qualify for construction grants and so on, the work must be done by legitimate builders.  The Minister is aware that many legitimate businesses are very concerned <Col N="1051" /> about the black economy.  The suggestion was made some time ago &mdash; and I would like to repeat it &mdash; that tax concessions to those who have paid bills to legitimate garages or builders and so on would help to eliminate those working outside the system.  We are losing doubly in the black economy.  The State does not get tax or VAT from those who are earning and who very probably are drawing unemployment benefit also.</P>
    <P>I understand full well that the deposit interest retention tax was introduced because people are able to fiddle money. That was the reason behind it.  I would worry that it might catch, say, widows, who are living on investments.  It has been said to me that they can juggle money around.  I am not so sure.  If somebody is getting 10½ per cent on their investment and have no other income the 35 per cent deposit interest retention tax will mean a reduction in income.  It does not give a fair crack of the whip to say, a widow with three dependent children.  I hope that later on we will be talking about that. Cases are being made for everyone and anyone and it is difficult.  We would want to examine that matter.  I do not know the full details.  I have asked for them.  I would certainly look forward to raising the question of that tax.  There are exemptions.  I can guarantee the Minister will not have to listen to me when he returns from the division in the Dáil.  Tá mé críochnaithe.  I know that this time next year we will be complimenting the Minister on having carried out all the things we asked him to do.</P>

      <P>In his opening speech in the Dáil the Minister for Finance, Deputy J. Bruton, said that the Government's role is to provide the best possible environment for growth and to provide special incentives where appropriate.  I could not agree more with him in that regard.  He correctly identified the <Col N="1052" /> disturbing consequences of high taxation which include boosting the black economy, adding an incentive to evade taxation and encouraging the practice of payment through &ldquo;benefit in kind&rdquo; so as to avoid high marginal tax rates.  However, what is particularly disappointing is that the measures contained in this Finance Bill and in recent budgets do not address these problems in any adequate fashion at all.  The continuing spate of business liquidations underlines the hostile climate for enterprise at a more general level.  The thrust of economic policy should be positive, supportive and encouraging.  The building and construction industry for example, so basic to our well-being, remains in a devastated state with half its workforce unemployed. Taxes, levies and restrictive legislation are forcing employers to pursue retrenchment instead of expansion programmes.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed that the most pressing economic and social problem facing the country is unemployment.  What is needed, therefore, is the dismantling of incentives against investment for employment and development.  Instead of encouraging people to save and thereby to make funds available for investment in the private sector, the Government, in effect, and I refer in particular now to the DIRT tax, are penalising savers and thereby reducing the inflow of deposits into the financial institutions.  I will return to this point later.</P>
      <P>In his opening address to the Seanad the Minister said, and I quote:</P>
      <P>We gave a commitment at the outset to tax reform in our programme for Government.</P>
      <P>He did indeed.  The reform of the taxation system was one of the main proposals on which the present Coalition Government are elected in 1982.  After three and a half years in office the Government's record on this very issue is frustratingly poor. The income and VAT changes in the Finance Bill are welcome, but they are entirely inadequate to meet the demands of present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tinkering with a tax band here or a section of business there is no answer <Col N="1053" /> to the reform to which the Government pledged themselves when taking office. What I am really getting at is that there is no evidence of a planned approach to the reform of the taxation system.  The typical answer we hear is that a transformation of the basic tax structure could not be afforded because of the financial constraints on the Exchequer. The answer is not good enough.  Indeed, this line of argument would seem to assume that the present tax system is not doing any harm.  This is far from the case. The present tax system is harmful socially because it is divisive.  Furthermore, the existing tax structure takes considerable time, effort and a lot of money to operate and what have we got to show for it?  We have highly qualified people leaving the country because of the hostile tax regime. There is also evidence that some employees are choosing not to work overtime because the net gain after tax means that it is not worth the effort.  Furthermore, there is evidence that very suitably qualified people are declining promotional positions because the net gain in pay after the promotion would not justify the taking on of additional responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>A two per cent reduction in the marginal rate is inadequate and I can tell the Minister I have first hand knowledge in a practical way in Irish industry of people turning down <Col N="1054" /> promotional positions because it is not worth their while in financial terms.  This is a constructive contribution and I would like the Minister to take it in that spirit. The minor taxation changes in this year's budget will not solve our inefficient, inequitable taxation structure.  What is needed is obvious.  A transformation of the basic tax structure and this the Government have failed to do despite their election promises of taxation reform.</P>
      <P>Let me give the House a specific illustration of a tax that is inequitable and that was introduced by the Minister's Government.  The <i>ad hoc</i> approach to changes in taxation by this Government is illustrated very clearly by the poorly conceived income-related property tax. This tax flies in the face of equity and efficiency.  It does not apply equally to all and it is calculated on a definition of income which is patently defective. Administrative time and effort is spent in collecting very small amounts.  As I see it, the only rationale for this inequitable tax is that it constitutes a sop to the Labour Party.  I would ask the Minister in all seriousness to repeal the property tax.</P>
      <P>I now want to return to the taxation on financial services.  The experience of other developed industrial countries is relevant.  I wish to acknowledge and put it on the record that the Minister for Finance is very conscious of what goes on in other countries, considers policies in other countries and has in fact taken the lessons from some countries in some of the measures he has taken.  I give him credit for that.  In most developed industrial countries they recognise the importance of the contribution made by service industries to job creation.  It is noteworthy that in the United States since 1970, 16 out of every 17 new jobs there have been in the services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With almost 18 per cent of our labour force unemployed, we in Ireland should pay particular attention to service industries because they are labour intensive. Ireland has a well educated, skilled workforce.  The qualifications of our workforce are required, especially in internationally <Col N="1055" /> traded areas of financial services and professional consultancy.  The financial services sector, therefore, should be looked at very closely because of the great scope it offers for increased high quality employment.  Ireland could become a major international financial services centre provided we create a suitable taxation and legal environment, both of which are under Government control.</P>
    <P>Could I add an additional point in relation to our suitability for the location of an international financial services sector? I am a member of the Joint Committee on State Sponsored Bodies.  We took evidence from Bord Telecom Éireann yesterday.  The chairman of that board, Mr. Michael Smurfitt, stressed the point in the course of the evidence that Telecom is now fully equipped to provide the technological equipment and wherewithal to meet the requirements of an international financial services sector.</P>
    <P>Financial services employment in this country amounts to about 45,000 people of whom 75 per cent are engaged in banking and insurance both of which are now subject to levies.  The Finance Bill places a charge of 9 per cent on the gross investment income of life assurance companies, albeit for one year.  In the case of the banks, the levy of £25 million continues in 1986.  On the face of it, these levies look like taxing institutions.  The reality is that these charges are a further tax on individuals, most of whom are within the PAYE sector.  In the case of insurance companies the policy holders will have to pay the 9 per cent levy and in the case of the banks, employees and shareholders and, especially, customers will have to carry the can.</P>
    <P>In the case of the bank levy both the Commission on Taxation and the Central Bank are on record as opposing the special levy.  I would ask the Minister in a constructive spirit to play his part in ensuring that public policy recognises the role of the financial services industry in discovered that his money supply was cut growth and the provision of high added value, skilled employment.  Supportive rather than discriminatory practices <Col N="1056" /> should, therefore, be adopted so that the industry can develop to the benefit of the entire national economy.</P>
    <P>The retention tax on interest payments could adversely affect the entire banking system.  With this new tax, pension funds might well be tempted to place money in gilts instead of on deposit and this would obviously reduce the ability of the banking system to lend to the productive sector of the economy, as returns on investment fall with falling inflation.  We must welcome the trend of falling inflation.  It seems inevitable that pension funds will substitute short term securities for deposits in the banking system.  The retention tax will have an adverse effect on the cash flow of companies which are in receipt of deposit interest.  Working capital and cash flow are the life blood of enterprises.  This new tax could adversely affect working capital and cash flow. VAT on imports at the point of entry is another example of a serious imposition on working capital.</P>
    <P>It is essential that Government should understand the role of working capital in job creation and in the retention of jobs. As a country we have a range of State institutions and services that help companies at their formative stage, for example, the IDA and CTT.  We also have State services if a company is in serious trouble and about to go out of business, for example, Fóir Teoranta.  We do not, however, it seems to me, have adequate support services for companies in between, during the main period of the life cycle.  The retention tax in the Finance Bill goes in the opposite direction. It represents a further serious imposition on working capital and cash flow, the very areas that present trouble repeatedly for companies and contribute to their demise.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to consider the retention tax as a withholding tax which would be available for refund or for credit.  Perhaps, he would respond to that when replying on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his opening speech that we are taking full advantage of the upswing.  The retention tax will serve as a distincentive to the return of funds to the <Col N="1057" /> country despite the recent realignment in the currencies because of the threat of taxation.  It is well-known that for many years past funds have literally flown out of the country.  We need these funds back not least because of the contribution they would make to reducing interest rates. The retention tax is one further misplaced measure, I submit, which will discourage investment and enterprise.</P>
    <P>I consider the Finance Bill very disappointing in the light of the urgent problems facing the country.  The Minister, Deputy J. Bruton, has identified the critical role of taxation policy.  I feel he has a very good grasp of the needs of the private sector and that is welcome.  The Bill, however, does not go near meeting the measures required to restore confidence or to stimulate growth and development. The levies on financial services and the retention tax are serious disincentives at a time when Government should be doing everything possible to abolish disincentive against investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers on this side of the House I should like to unanimously endorse the sentiments of the Minister as set out in his opening speech.  I should like to endorse also the general thrust of the Finance Bill.  This is the fourth Finance Bill since this administration came into office.  I recall that during earlier budget speeches and presentations of Finance Bill, the prophets of doom all forecasted each would be the last of this administration. Yet this administration has gone on and managed to baffle, bewilder and confound the critics.  They have come through a very turbulent, a distinctly difficult time and have managed during that period to get the nuts and bolts of the economy right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the aspects of the Minister's speech which was the central feature of the Finance Bill was the area of taxation. There is no question about it that there is unanimous agreement that the burden of taxation falls too heavily on a lot of people.  To expect that there can be an instant overnight dramatic switch about and that you can automatically switch <Col N="1058" /> from one form of taxation to another without doing so on a phased, reasonable and gradual basis, is an unrealistic proposition.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on bringing about some relief in the area of income tax.  Last year we had the broadening of the tax bands and this year the top level has been reduced from 60p in the pound to 58p.  Again although it might seem minimal to many the elimination of the 1 per cent levy on income is a welcome development.  It shows that there is overall wholehearted commitment on the part of this administration and this Minister, to address, when finances permit, the whole issue of tax and income tax.</P>
    <P>It is facile, simplistic and imbecilic to regard the business of tax redress, tax equalisation and tax equality without taking cognisance in addressing oneself to the fundamental problem of where the money comes from and how we achieve the redistributive desire and goal which everybody who would like to see.  You cannot, on the one hand, advance policies which are seen to be the answer to everybody's ails and ailments without, on the other hand, meeting a consequent obligation of quantifying and spelling out the pounds, shillings and pence and the minutia of where that money must come from. This Government have shown a commitment to reform in that area.  One hopes that many of the tenets of the Commission on Taxation will be adopted and that, before this administration goes to seek a renewal of its mandate, it will have furthermore and to a greater degree addressed the problem of equality of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there is need for responsible harnessing of the upturn of our economic fortunes.  There would seem to be a lull or an upswing, a lull in the recession and an upswing generally in the economy in economic trends here and elsewhere.  When one looks at the Government's performance, one has to look back at the whole genesis of the problem we face today.  One has to look at the record and the daunting task this Government were confronted with.  One <Col N="1059" /> must realise that, on assuming office, the situation was that our credit rating abroad was so bad that the lending institutions were about to slam the door in our faces. We had little, if any, credibility.  We were almost on the point of liquidation, if that is possible in a national sense.  Agencies and arbitrators from outside could and would, and, indeed, were about to move in unless a determined, forward and responsible thrust was taken in relation to the economy.</P>
    <P>One has to remember that, when taking office, this Administration was faced with an inflation rate of something in the region of 21 per cent.  Our balance of payments was accepted in a defeatist sense as being an inevitable part of our overall economic make-up.  We had unemployment racing madly in the direction of 200,000.  We had agricultural incomes falling 40 per cent between 1978 and 1982.  Basically, we had a whole disjointed economy.  Yet in the teeth of such a daunting prospect and in the teeth of the worst recession that this country has ever faced, the Government have managed to hold the line.  They have managed to repel the critics.  They have managed to achieve an economic performance where our inflation rate has been cut to 4.5 per cent &mdash; this without the added bonus of the recent fortuitous fall in oil prices, which is a bonus on top of the hard slog used to achieve the inflation decline in the first place.</P>
    <P>In a relatively short period of time the Government have managed to achieve a level of performance where our balance of payments, our trade figures for the first time since the war, are coming right.  One notes with considerable optimism and a degree of satisfaction that the monthly returns and trends are very much on the positive side in that regard.  Hopefully, the year end figures will be even better than last year.</P>
    <P>Again, despite the many debilitating factors, the Government have managed to redress the problem of unemployment to an extent in that at last there has been achieved a gradual U-turn in relation to the statistics and figures.  Again, agricultural <Col N="1060" /> incomes have grown during the Government's term of office and have managed to stabilise and to be maintained despite factors such as weather and other outside agents acting, which would seem to have a contrary effect.  No matter how one sees the achievements of Government, and they have been considerable in that regard, the big millstone around this Administration's neck and around the neck of every John Citizen in the street out there is the foreign debt and the foreign borrowing.  Irrespective of how we may try to delude ourselves into believing that we now have turned the corner in that regard, until such time as we meet our responsibilities in that regard, we are not out of the wood.  There is no question whatever but that future generations will be left paying for the folly of the 1977-81 period, which was an unfortunate period.  If one set out to discommode, disjoint or dismantle the economy deliberately, one could not have done so more effectively.  It was a gamble that failed and failed miserably.</P>
    <P>There are no easy solutions and no facile answers.  When talking about the distribution of money or pumping or priming or generating money or stimulating the economy, one always has to address oneself to the central feature, where does one get it?  Does one borrow, does one cut services or does one tax?  In that regard the Government have faced up to their responsibilities and have pointed always clearly to where precisely the money has come from in order to originate schemes or to bring about reform in certain areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has managed, in this Finance Bill, to generate confidence, to stimulate growth and to bring about the necessary initiatives in the economy which, hopefully, will have a wholehearted and developmental and positive objective.  One notes that in the area of employment the PRSI relief has had the desired and targeted effect.  One notes that the Enterprise Allowance Scheme is being continued.  Many people have derided that scheme but when one looks at the statistics and at the number of <Col N="1061" /> small enterprises which have been started and have managed to keep going under the scheme to date, it has been very satisfactory.  Virtually all of the businesses involved are not alone managing to hold their own but in some cases have taken on additional employees.  One notes with considerable satisfaction the imaginative thrust of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Social Employment Scheme when introduced, was derided in this House and in the other House and castigated as being nothing other than a stop gap measure, in order, as people said, to make some type of cosmetic redress of the unemployment figures.  If you talk to people who have benefited from the scheme, you will find that many of them welcome the opportunity presented to them of again experiencing the dignity of work.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Government and the Minister for Labour for recently bringing about an amplification of the scheme in the introduction of two levels, the married level of £85 and the single level of £70 and of bringing about the much needed innovation, that if somebody terminates a scheme having had one year's work he may, having registered as unemployed again, re-enter the scheme and avail of another year's work.  It is a very healthy development.  It is the type of thing we have been crying out for, the mobilisation of resources, the harnessing of resources and getting a return for money spent.  It is the type of development that could be amplified and experimented with in the future.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably, unemployment will be the big challenge of this and of every Administration.  Without being defeatist or being accused of undue pessimism, it is as well to confront the fact that the days of full employment are gone.  We have to target all our aims and objectives and plans towards achieving a reasonable level of employment and minimising unemployment.  Full employment is an unrealistic expectation.  That is a view that is shared by economies inherently stronger than ours.</P>
    <P>The budget deficit in this Finance Bill is being phased down, as the Minister has <Col N="1062" /> said from 8.2 per cent GNP to 7.4 per cent.  Of course, foreign borrowing is one of the major causes of our economic misfortunes.  In the National Plan the aim was to achieve the softer target of 5 per cent.  With the various other factors which came to bear on the economy, this was not possible.  We commend the Government on their determination to phase out the budget deficit over a reasonable period of time, without wreaking undue hardship on the citizens, on the unemployed and on the various services which people have come to enjoy and benefit from.</P>
    <P>In November of 1982 both of the major parties went to the country with two election platforms.  On the one hand, we had the main opposition party with the plan <i>The Way Forward.</i> On the other hand, we had the Government's Joint Programme for Government.  One must assume, from the overwhelming mandate given to both parties and the fact that the voters plumped largely for both parties, that there is an overwhelming political consensus among people to terminate borrowing for day to day purposes.  It is, however, a difficult political reality to grasp.  Based on the voting patterns and based on the joint objectives set down in both programmes, there would seem to be a mandate given to the Government to end the budget deficit.  Over a 15 year period, over the term of jurisdiction of four Taoisigh and seven Ministers for Finance, it can be seen that it has escalated to its present proportion and one sees the whole scale and magnitude of the task.</P>
    <P>There was an idea, for what it was worth, floated some time ago of a constitutional amendment making it mandatory to balance the budget.  It is something that might be worth dwelling on again.  The Constitution enshrines certain principles and values which have been endorsed by the people which might otherwise be let slip in a rash of political pressures.  It puts a brake on rash actions, and would-be follies or the capacity sometimes to self destruct.  The Constitution is there as a safeguard in this regard.</P>
    <P>This Government have pledged themselves to phasing out the deficit over a <Col N="1063" /> period of time.  Despite all the good intentions, on the other hand, when one is confronted with a whole spate of junk economics, as has been described recently, one has to look at the political realities.  It would be better for everybody concerned if we had consensus on the need for a constitutional obligation on every administration to have a binding duty and have as its main plank enshrined in the Constitution the need to end deficit budgeting once and for all.</P>
    <P>The Planning Board felt that Governments should smooth economic cycles by budgeting for deficits in bad times and matching surplus in good times. On the other hand, there is no difficulty in a time of need or in a time of political exigency in persuading politicians of the need to incur a deficit.  It is an entirely different matter when it comes to reversing that deficit in due course.</P>
    <P>This Government, by and large, have performed an economic miracle beyond the capacity of the imagination of most people.  They have confounded the critics of doom.  Unfortunately the perspective of the man in the street would seem to indicate that their efforts and achievements have not been largely understood or appreciated.  When one looks at the statistics based on the achievements of this administration it can be seen that there is now a greater disposal income available to people.  Living standards have increased.  There is a national wage agreement of 7 per cent.  There is a projected rate of inflation for the year at 2 per cent or it may even be possibly down to zero.  Interest rates and mortgage rates are now at a level of 11 per cent as against 16 per cent and 17 per cent two years ago.  A person with a mortgage of £24,000 has a net saving of £24 per week in his pocket without any constraints by way of tax deductions.  That is a net gain.  This is evidence of the achievement and track record of this Government.</P>
    <P>Like many other people I very often fail to see that when the inflation rate is running at 2 per cent &mdash; and possibly there is no direct linkage as I am not an economist or a financial expert &mdash; why <Col N="1064" /> banking institutions cannot be more accommodating in relation to more favourable borrowing terms.  Despite the fact that by and large, banks give a reasonable service, they operate a service that can be sometimes equivocated with that of providing somebody with an umbrella on a fine day and taking it from him on a wet day.  Anybody who had the experience of having the banks offer money in flush quantities at certain times and then putting the jack-boot in unremittingly at difficult times will share basically the sentiments that I am espousing and expressing.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government that despite the various financial restrictions on them over the years, one category which have always managed to do well from this administration has been the social welfare class.  As was recorded on the occasion of the Social Welfare Bill, the social welfare class were more than looked after in this budget in that the average increase of 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent for the long term unemployed will give these people a substantial tangible increase in their living standards.</P>
    <P>The other innovations introduced by the Minister in the Bill are also to be welcomed &mdash; the tax treatment of stock options, the share option scheme and the emphasis on share ownership.  I had the benefit of attending a dinner and listening to the Minister developing this point on the obvious consequent benefits of such schemes by way of improving the whole industrial relations scene and the encouragement of wider employee participation.  The Minister has managed to develop the business expansion scheme with a record of £5 million in year one alone.</P>
    <P>I welcome Chapter III of the Bill which emphasises the tax incentives for research and development.  Unfortunately, it is an area in which we can record grave disappointment in relation to our performance.  It is unfortunate that because of our tax regime it is very difficult to keep in Ireland people with technical knowledge.  It is something that we will have to concentrate our attentions and resources on.  It is one of the basic <Col N="1065" /> weaknesses of our whole industrial scene.</P>
    <P>We are very grateful to foreign industries for establishing industries here and for the large component element they fill in relation to our employment figures. The manner in which they have invested shows confidence in this economy.  It is a problem, nevertheless, that these industries, in many cases, are &ldquo;torso&rdquo; industries where the head and feet are one place and the decision-making voice is somewhere else.  While they perform a very valuable role in our overall economic fabric and make-up, when it comes to a long term commitment they may not have the same commitment as native indigenous industries.  It is an unfortunate pattern that sometimes they have been prone to uproot and go without any valid explanations as to their reasons for doing so.  That is why I basically share the sentiments expressed in the Minister's address that research and development is an area in which we will have to concentrate on to a greater extent.  It is an area that should be developed possibly at university level, as a satellite or an appendage to universities.  An idea floated by the Opposition &mdash; and it might not necessarily be dismissed for that reason &mdash; was that of possibly having a Minister for Science and Technology.  It is vital that we keep abreast of the most modern technological developments at home and more importantly, abroad.</P>
    <P>The relief in areas of capital gains are to be welcomed.  All of these developments announced by the Minister are stimuli to generate growth, confidence and private sector investment.  One notes with considerable pride a number of the hidden success stories of Ireland.  For example, Ballygowan Spring Water, Seery Biscuits, and the Flowers for Ireland Enterprise in Waterford, all of which in their own way have been successful. They have not received the degree of recognition that one might expect.  They should be used and put forward as an inspiration for other would be investors and entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments that always seems to come most strongly from the Opposition benches is the idea that the <Col N="1066" /> construction industry must be primed at all cost.  While everybody appreciates the employment content of the construction industry, it is, nevertheless, a fallacy and a myth to put it up front as being an economic generator in its own right.  I always tend towards the view that the construction industry should be a response to economic growth, investment and economic performance.  Therefore, it should be a gauge and a barometer of the economic climate and performance of the day.</P>
    <P>This party nevertheless has not been found wanting in relation to its commitment.  We have introduced more innovative schemes than any other administration in that regard.  One recalls that one on the main planks of the infamous 1977 manifesto was the £1,000 new house grant.  We have doubled that house grant.  We have introduced a mortgage subsidy of £3,000.  We have also introduced another imaginative scheme which has been working with spectacular success and that is the scheme for the encouragement of local authority tenants to build their own houses.  It is now part of a package that if a local authority tenant of two years standing wishes to build his own house he can now get a £2,000 new house grant, a £5,000 dislodgment-moving grant plus £3,000 mortgage subsidy.  In round figures there is a £10,000 non-repayable grant.  There is also a £16,000 loan available at 11 per cent over 30 years or the option of a Housing Finance Agency loan of £22,500 or £25,000 in the case of a local authority tenant, at varying rates of interest depending on the ability of the person to repay.  In that regard our record on this side of the House is a proud one and one that bears comparison with that of any other administration in the past.  Without apology to anyone I make my observations in relation to the fallacy of providing money for money's sake or the construction industry's sake.</P>
    <P>Section 101 of the Bill deals with the extension of the exemption on stamp duty for young farmers.  This has been a very useful scheme.  It is because of difficulties in relation to mobility and transfer of <Col N="1067" /> land that people have (a) run away from the prospect of transferring their land and (b) have run away from the prospect of paying out stamp duty in order to do so. The introduction of this general exemption for people who transfer land to a son under 35 years of age is a very welcome development.  Statistics prove that overall there has been an acceleration of the transfer of land.  Nevertheless we will never meet with the degree of success that we would like to see in this regard until such time as we introduce a proper and attractive retirement scheme. If somebody over 65 years of age transfers land, they qualify for the contributory pension or non-contributory pension at 66 years.  If somebody of 55 years of age transfers land, which would be our desire, our target and our objective, there is very little there by way of inducement for them at present other than the ordinary UA scheme.  It is long overdue and we should introduce in tandem with our European partners a proper farm retirement scheme.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;232,000 on the unemployment register and also many graduates who are fully qualified, indeed more qualified than many people in terms of modernisation and updating of their curriculum and experience and education.  Nevertheless we should be moving in that direction.  We are out of step with the rest of Europe in that regard.  Unemployment will be the litmus test of this and of any other administration.  When one looks at the figures it would seem that we have rounded the bend and there is a gradual decline in the figures.  Nevertheless one is dismayed that in 1979 one in every 14 people was out of a job and <Col N="1068" /> in 1985 it is one in every five.  The labour pool has risen quite sharply.  We have reduced the demand for labour as a result of greater technology and greater mechanisation and output productivity and demand has increased.  Nevertheless this increase is not reflected in the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will again refer to my original point. This Government have achieved much and I imagine would leave office content that they had redressed many of the ills and ailments.  They would leave office with a certain amount of satisfaction and ease of conscience if they honestly felt that they were to hand over to a responsible succeeding authority.  One notices that the most recent utterances from the Opposition party, which would purport and portray themselves as being the alternative Government, have been frightening.  Many of the hysterical predictions we saw some three or four weeks ago would send a shudder down the spine of every economist in the country because we are presented with the vintage reflationary package.  We had the Fianna Fáil dazzling package of bribes, repolished, refurbished and represented as we had in 1977.  One gets an eerie feeling that we are now quickly advancing on the tenth anniversary of the infamous manifesto and that we have not learned our lesson.  We had on the one hand a promise of a package which, when costed, came to something in the region of £800 million.  We had a promise that tax cuts were going to be achieved across the board for two-thirds of the population and that they were going to be brought under the standard level of taxation. When the Leader of the Opposition was asked on television on 20 April 1986 where the money was going to come from after weaving and bobbing with a certain amount of skill that would do justice to Barry McGuigan, he gave the old cliched answer, self-financing.  We have exploded the myth and fallacy of the argument in relation to the construction industry and the £200 million for resources.  The old pump priming act of 1977 is about to be reincarnated.  It is heartening that in demolishing these arguments the <Col N="1069" /> Government are not alone in their derisory treatment of them because one noted that on the following day <i>The Irish Times</i> described it as &ldquo;junk economics&rdquo;. The final paragraph of the editorial said:</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey promises a comprehensive strategy for recovery.  That certainly is needed; but tax cuts can form at best only a small part of any &ldquo;mature and responsible&rdquo; strategy. And if the politicians reject strategic thinking in favour of junk economics, then the outlook will be bleak.</P>
    <P>In a subsequent editorial one notices that <i>The Irish Times</i> again states:</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey's thinking is along reflationary lines.  That is not necessarily the wrong course.  In one form or another it is probably the only course now open as the economic base steadily contracts under existing Government policies.  But merely to pump money into building is not enough.  Contrary to what Mr. Haughey seems to believe there is a considerable weight of economic opinion which views building as non-productive investment.  There are scores of office blocks, factories and even dwelling houses unused at this time.  He needs to be more precise in the sort of construction activity he envisages.</P>
    <P>Reflation along the lines set out by Mr. Haughey has, in the past, largely been dissipated through imports of luxury goods or through &ldquo;invisible exports&rdquo;&mdash; holidays abroad and the like.  It is a temporary palliative, no more.  One is heartened nevertheless that <i>The Irish Times</i> is not the only arbiter in relation to dismissing these arguments.  One noted that in the wake of the Ard Fheis Colm Rapple dismissed them, and another economist Paul Tansey also dismissed them and said they would not work.  It was referred to in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> as the way backwards.  The pessimism of the Opposition in relation to the economy and the failure to give credit where credit is due is not widely shared. <Col N="1070" /> Thankfully, the Opposition's low estimate of the Government's economic performance has not been shared by and large by the business community which have responded in a very positive fashion to the courage of this Administration. When Padraig White was asked recently how he viewed the prospects for investment with the IDA this year he said he looked on the forthcoming year with cautious ebullience.  Feargal Quinn said he was convinced 1986 would be considerably better than 1985 and that we need to think more positively.  Alan McCarthy, head of Córas Tráchtála said: &ldquo;1986 should see the volume of exports growing by 4 per cent but our cost competitiveness and keeping our competitive edge is vital&rdquo;.  Richard Burrows of Irish Distillers said: &ldquo;We face the year with a lot of confidence.  We anticipate a dazzling year&rdquo;.  Leo O'Donnell, Chief Executive of Jacobs said:</P>
    <P>The most important single feature of 1986 is inflation.  If we can keep the rate of inflation down to 3 per cent or 4 per cent as in Europe we have some chance of retaining the recovery evident in parts of the economy in 1985.  It was the first year since 1980 that we have seen an increase in consumer spending.</P>
    <P>Here we are people who have been singularly successful in their own right, in their own spheres and areas, who have confidence in the economy.  We have confidence in the economy.  We believe we have charted the economic recovery of the country.  We look forward to a renewed mandate from the people to do so and to maintain the momentum.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that this Bill is quite complex and it would not be feasible to explain all the details in his address.  If <Col N="1071" /> the Minister finds it complex, how much more complicated does it seem to me? There would be no hope on my part of going into all the details because I do not have the expertise in that area.  I will select some details in the Bill and concentrate on these.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all concerned about the importance of the family.  Families have come under pressure in recent times.  This is exemplified in various ways, not least by the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1986, which will come before this House next week.  The proposed removal of all the tax free allowances for children in this year's budget is another serious blow for the family.  During the past ten years the value of the child tax free allowance has been continuously eroded.   This year the Government have decided to ignore children altogether in the tax code.  This is grossly unfair to the families of working people.  The following illustrates the point I want to make: single <Col N="1072" /> person's tax free allowance in 1970-71 was £249; in 1975-76 it was £575; in 1980-81 it was £1,115; in 1985-86 it was £1,900 and in 1986-87, £2,000.  The child tax free allowance in 1970-71 was £135; in 1975-76 it was £230; in 1980-81, £195; last year £100 and this year nil.  Taking the child tax free allowance as a percentage of the single person's tax free allowance, in 1970-71 it was 54.21 per cent; in 1975-76 it decreased to 40 per cent; in 1980-81 it decreased further to 17.49 per cent; last year it was 5.26 per cent and this year it is nil.  The logic of this regression of the child tax free allowance is that families with children are being pushed more and more into the poverty trap and are being asked to bear a higher share of the income tax bill.  The relative tax bill for a family with children was higher each successive year than that of a single person or a childless couple.  Of course, those people cannot be happy either, especially if they are PAYE taxpayers.  I am not making the point that they would be happy.  However, when the tax free allowance per child drops from 54.21 per cent of the adult allowance to no allowance at all we must seriously question the values of the society that allows that to happen.  More appropriately, we must question the values of a Government that banish children from the tax code.  The Constitution asks us to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  It does not tell us to ignore them.</P>
    <P>The following figures also help prove the point I am making: taking the consumer price index in 1975 as 100, the base figure in mid-November of 1985 this had increased to 343.6.  The single person's tax free allowance in 1975 was £575.  In 1985, in the same relationship to the consumer price index, this would have increased to £1,975.70.  The actual allowance was £1,900.  This year it is £2,000. The married couple's tax free allowance is somewhat more complicated because of the working wife's allowance.  The married couple's tax free allowance in 1975 was £920.  Taking into consideration the consumer price index in 1985 this should have increased to £3,161 but the <Col N="1073" /> actual amount was £3,800.  This year it is £4,000.  In 1975 the working wife's allowance was £230.  In 1985 it had increased to £790.  In 1985 the total figure was £3,800 and for this year it is £4,000.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for being present here tonight as I understand there are a number of meetings he should be attending.  The matter I wish to discuss is of such urgency that his presence is required.  This matter is of great concern locally especially to the sisters, parents, teachers and pupils of Listowel Convent.  Listowel Convent National School was built in 1883.  It is a two storey building with four classrooms downstairs and four upstairs.  Two additional prefabs were added in the early seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been no major alterations or renovations since 1883 to the main building.  The school was condemned in the early seventies by the Department of Health officials.  It was considered both a health and a fire hazard.  Structurally the school is rapidly deteriorating.  Major structural faults are appearing on the walls.  Mortar and plaster are constantly falling from the walls especially around <Col N="1074" /> the windows and gable ends.  Dry rot has also set in in the roof timber.</P>
    <P>The slates on the roof are loose because the slate nails are rusted from old age and weathering.  At times of high winds loose slates are often blown from the roof.  A young student had a narrow escape when a slate was blown from the roof.  Falling slates are a continuous danger to the children especially when entering the school in the morning or leaving it in the evening.  The principal of the school, Sister Kathleen, has expressed her concern on numerous occasions to me.  She asked me to raise this matter here.  There is no fire escape from the rooms upstairs. The only exit is a narrow stairs.  The Minister, as a former teacher, will appreciate the difficulty 130 children would have in leaving the school if a fire broke out.</P>
    <P>There is also a very musty smell in the upstairs rooms caused by dampness and dry rot.  At the moment there are 391 pupils attending the school, 254 of these are in the main building, divided equally between the upstairs and downstairs rooms.  If the Department of Education allow the school to go to contract in the near future, the local parishioners are prepared to provide the necessary finance immediately.  I earnestly request the Minister to ensure that the project is placed on contract as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Deenihan for raising this matter.  I appreciate the procedure in the Seanad regarding Adjournment debates but I am happy to give a brief response to the Senators comments regarding the Presentation Convent National School, Listowel, County Kerry.  I assure the Senator that the Department are equally aware that the conditions in the school are not conducive to the proper procedure in a classroom.  The conditions are unsuitable for the staff, the pupils and parents who avail of the facilities there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to erect a new school which will contain 14 classrooms, a general purposes room, a library, a medical room, a principal's room, a staff room, a <Col N="1075" /> remedial room and other ancillary accommodation.  There will be ample hard play areas for the pupils and car parking facilities.  There is the possibility in the plans for two further classrooms to be added if required at a later date.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that there has been a considerable time lapse since this grant application was first made by the convent authorities.  The access arrangements gave rise to some complications when the project reached the planning permission stage.  This took much longer to clear than usual.  Tenders have been received and their examination has been completed.</P>
    <P>The Department have under consideration the question of the release of the project to contract.  This is one of a very large number of projects where the next step is the acceptance of a tender.  The release of these cases to contract must, however, be ordered in such a fashion that the capital funds provided by the Department in the current financial year for national school buildings will be adequate to sustain regular payments as soon as construction work has begun. Obviously work already commenced would receive priority.  Projects at the contract placement stage have to take their place in due order and in accordance with the capital which would be expected to be available when work is likely to start.</P>
    <P>No doubt Senator Deenihan is familiar with the size and cost of the national school building programme.  He will <Col N="1076" /> appreciate that the Department must be careful in settling specific starting dates. I take all of the points mentioned with regard to the present condition of the school which is accepted by the Department.  The new school is at a point where we will shortly be able to decide on a date for placement of contract.  With regard to finance being made available by the local people, this would already have been settled at a stage prior to invitation to tender or the local contribution has been agreed with the manager.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Listowel Convent project is an urgent matter.  I express my sympathy with the local community in their concern that this project will start at the earliest possible date.  I assure Senator Deenihan and all concerned that I will bear what the Senator has said in mind and I will take into account the general circumstances of the case when the question of a specific starting date for the actual placing of the contract arises. No doubt that will be a burden removed from the shoulders of the Senator and the local community.  In the near future I hope to be able to allocate a specific starting date for the placing of the contract.</P>
