      <P>I have notice of three matters on the half-hour Adjournment, from Senator Ferris concerning the Irish Leathers Factory in Carrick-on-Suir; Senator Fitzsimons concerning adult education; and Senator Killilea concerning the Letterfrack group water scheme.  In view of my acceptance of the motion raised by Senator Brendan Ryan, a matter on the half-hour Adjournment cannot be taken today.  Senators Ferris, Fitzsimons and Killilea may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on that very point that I want to ask a question.  I, like many other Senators in this House, am quite dismayed with that has happened in Libya and with the American attitude to Libya.  I do not want to be misconstrued in any way that I am condoning what happened.  I think it is grossly unfair to the individual Senators who have a half-hour allotted to them here under Standing Orders to raise important matters on the Adjournment and cannot do so because of this international problem about which there is nothing we can do except place our utterances on record.  I find it rather sad that, on major problems, some of them national and some constituency, which are the private right of any Senator to raise, because of this method of raising such an international matter, we lose out.  It is wrong that Senators should be placed in that situation.  There are many other ways in which such motions should be put down and they would get the total support of this House in the ordinary way rather than depriving Senators of what is their basic right in this House by such action as has been taken today.  I wish to protest in the strongest possible way.  We have very few individual rights in this House as was proved when I asked the Leader of the House if he could do something about the withdrawal of the facility for telegrams for the Members of this House who have had that facility for the last 17 or 18 years.  I believe firmly that the rights of Senators&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will when I finish this sentence.  I am extremely upset by the consistent withdrawal of facilities which have always been available to Senators both in regard to the business of the House and in other respects.  I take exception to this attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, the Chair had to arrive at a decision about which of these matters should be taken either on the Adjournment or as a matter of urgency.  Like Senator Killilea, as one <Col N="4" /> of those who are involved, in having a specific item down for discussion, an item which in my opinion was extremely important, the Chair gave us the option, by standing or not, to decide what was the most urgent matter that could be taken within the time limit available to us.  Perhaps we should look at Standing Orders.  I stood on the Libyan matter because I consider it is of national and international importance.  I think it concerns the safety of many people in this country.  If this House is to express an opinion about it, it should be empowered to do so under some Standing Order. That does not mean that Senator Killilea's motion and mine and all the rest are not important too, but the Chair has to arrive at the decision.</P>

      <P>I do not like ruling the acting Leader of the House out of order, but he is completely out of order. The situation is that from time to time we get motions such as this.  I accept them or I reject them.  I could go no further today to meet Senators than by asking for five Senators to stand.  I can see Senator Killilea's point and I can also see Senator Brendan Ryan's point, but that is the situation.  As the Leader of the House says, if Senators want to do something it is embodied in Standing Orders. I am only carrying out your Standing Orders.  If you want to change them at any time you have the right to do so.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in that order.  It is proposed to have a tea break from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  If the business has not concluded by 6.30 we will have to take the emergency resolution, as you have so decided.  I am ordering Nos. 1, 2 and 3 on the basis that somehow we might just achieve that, but I doubt it.  I feel it is important to order them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business and respecting what has been said by Senator Killilea and other Senators, I feel that, even though it is not on the Order of Business, we should in this House congratulate the Garda on the magnificent job they have done over the past week.  They carried out their job nice and quietly and reached a successful conclusion.  The Garda have come in for severe criticism in this House on occasions over the last number of years.  I do not think we should allow the opportunity to pass without saying in this House that over the last week the Garda have continued to do a very professional job in a very professional manner.  They have overcome a very severe difficulty, which had international connotations, and brought it to a very successful conclusion. When I say &ldquo;international connotations&rdquo; I am talking about the questions that are being raised here concerning Libya.  The question of international terrorism has to be addressed in this House.  Terrorism has to be isolated.  What happened in the abduction of that woman was a terrorist act and the Irish Government, the Irish people, the Garda and the Defence Forces have conducted themselves in a manner which is exemplary.  They dealt in this instance as professionals.</P>
      <P>The Garda are very professional in their attitude and the Irish Army are also extremely professional in their attitude. We must today give credit to the Commissioner of the Garda and to every garda who was involved in bringing a very difficult international situation to a very successful conclusion without having to bring in international so-called terrorism or anti-terrorism organisations.  The Garda deserve our praise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Lanigan in a very sincere word of thanks and praise to the Commissioner and every member of the Garda Síochána who were involved at any stage in the apprehension of the kidnappers. Moving through the country today, no <Col N="6" /> matter where one stops, whether it is for petrol or at any shop or meeting someone in the street, there is a great wave of relief expressed by ordinary members of the public.  There is very sincere gladness that Mrs. Guinness has been freed and reunited with her family.  We all feel safer in the knowledge that we have a police force that has certainly done a marvellous job and achieved the desired results.  The important lesson for all to grasp from the last eight days is the fact that kidnapping does not really pay in this country and that the police force have ensured that those who attempt these dastardly crimes are not benefiting by them.  Therefore I want to join in the congratulations to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the people who has said more critical things about the Garda in this House than many people, I should unequivocally &mdash; and I know I am speaking for all the Independent Members of the House &mdash; record my enormous admiration for the job the Garda have done in the last week.  It is to their credit to bring it to such a successful conclusion.  I actually heard about it on the BBC radio news this morning.  It was particularly gratifying to hear that such an achievement and such a success by the Garda actually squeezed out the other great international story from being the number one story on the BBC radio news.  It was a great job, very well done and done in a manner which befits the traditions of a civilised police force dealing with terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with my colleagues in our tribute to the forces of law and order in this country.  Particular reference has been made to the Garda and the Army in this instance.  I discussed this matter with Senator Lanigan before we came into this House and agreed totally with his views that it is appropriate on occasions like this that the House should express its appreciation of the good work that has been done quietly this week by the Garda in what could have been a very difficult situation.  If there had been a loss of life involved in the actual final rescue, many people would be condemning the Garda if they had used excess force or <Col N="7" /> otherwise.  As it happened, the actual culmination of this matter still presented an extremely tricky situation and lives could have been lost.  We commend the people involved in the rescue who were armed that in this instance there was no loss of life and that the person who was abducted against her will and the will of the nation was safely returned to her family.  I would like, a Chathaoirligh, if you would, on behalf of the Members of the House, express our good wishes to the family for Mrs. Guinness's good health and also to express to the Garda Commissioner and the Army authorities our appreciation of how they handled this very tricky matter.  We are living in a democracy in which the forces of law and order will have to be seen to be successful and to do their business correctly.  On this occasion they have achieved our ideals of what a force of law and order should do.</P>

      <P>Before I call on Senator Ryan I would like if the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition had mentioned it to me before I came in.  Senator Kiely wishes to speak on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>If items Nos. 1 and 2 are not completed, will item No. 3 be taken this evening or will it be put back until some other week?  Could other similar motions be put back a further week?  This motion has been put back already and now it is going to be put back again which I think is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to say now because Senator Kiely has asked the question I was going to ask.  It looks as if item No. 3 will not be taken this evening because you are taking Senator Brendan Ryan's motion at 6.30 p.m. and we conclude at 8 p.m.  It is unfair, because this motion was already adjourned.  It should have been taken before Easter and it was put back for some other reason.  It is not fair to other parties and to the Fianna Fáil Party in particular who want to put forward a motion for discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the very valid points made by Senators Ryan and Kiely I would like to say that, as the <Col N="8" /> mover of the resolution in question, which calls for the establishment of a banking commission and which deals with money lending and related matters, I would be very anxious that this matter be resolved and that the vote be taken this evening.  As one of the Senators who stood when you called for five Senators I was of the opinion that the situation in Libya was one that overshadowed every other consideration.  I hope that the resolution can be concluded and the matter resolved as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask when it is proposed to take No. 20.  The Minister is here now and we have been promised this for the last 12 to 18 months.  Every time I get up in this House, which is about once a month, to ask this question I have been told that they will have word for us the next day the Seanad sits.  We have now started a new term and I would like to ask is it going to be taken in this term or in the foreseeable lifetime of the present Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader of the House clarify the Order of Business for tomorrow?  If items Nos. 1 and 2 are not completed will we continue tomorrow or will we be dealing with other matters tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Having decided on the emergency resolution it means that, according to Standing Orders, no other business can take place after that.  That is one of the reasons that No. 3, if it is not reached before that, will have to be adjourned to the next normal day for taking Private Members motions, which is on Wednesday of next week.  As Senator Higgins has said, unfortunately that is the luck of the draw.  It is a question of the House deciding what is an emergency and then having to fit in other matters according to Standing Orders.  In my opinion it will be next Wednesday before it will be taken unless there is another emergency resolution then, which could easily happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to Senator Cassidy's question, I know the Leader of the House has been in touch with the Minister's office about this and the matter will be taken at the appropriate time when it is moved <Col N="9" /> by the Government.  I would be more worried about it if I did not have other legislation to deal with.  It is important when the House sits on Wednesdays that it deals with Government legislation.  I have already ordered two pieces of Government legislation for today's Order of Business.  It is not usual to deal with legislation on Wednesday except by agreement.  That applies to the last question which was asked.  It means that we will be dealing with other business tomorrow, not Nos. 1 and 2.  We are taking Nos. 1 and 2 today and No. 3 if we get to it.  We will adjourn from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and then we will take the emergency resolution.  Tommorrow we will revert back to the normal procedure of taking motions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a major milestone in the evolution of Córas Iompair Éireann and the public transport services operated by the board.  Irish transport legislation generally has been and is undergoing an exciting period of change and development.  There are at present, including this Bill, four transport Bills before the Oireachtas &mdash; the others being the Dublin Transport Authority, Road Transport and B&amp;I Bills.  A further three Bills in relation to harbours, sea pollution and Shannon pre-clearance are in the pipeline and will be introduced shortly.  The Canals, Free Ports and Air Transport Acts &mdash; all important measures &mdash; have been enacted since 1986 began. All ten of these measures are geared to meet the needs of modern transport activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am proposing now in relation to CIE is an historical step equal in importance to the step taken in 1944 when legislation founding CIE was enacted.  There are striking differences <Col N="10" /> between the two events.  The calendar alone demonstrates that the planning for the establishment of CIE was undertaken in a war time situation where all judgments were uncertain.  Prophecies of what might happen in the years following the end of the war were completely speculative.  The fact that CIE succeeded at all is a tribute to the planners of those far off days.</P>
    <P>In their thinking, it is fair to say, financial considerations took great precedence.  The conventional wisdom of the Twenties and Thirties in the failing public transport industry was that the strong could help the weak.  Our planners believed then, and for the best part of 20 years thereafter, that an industry which through no fault of its own could no longer survive, mainly due to increasing costs and a threatened market, would be sustained and maintained by the cash contributions of strong members such as Dublin buses, and by a multiplicity of secondary elements such as line cross-subsidisation.  There were further expected benefits based on concepts like economies of scale, or integration which, in the transport area, are not as relevant as many believe them to be and probably played only a limited part.</P>
    <P>The money end worked reasonably well for nearly 20 years.  It was in the early sixties that it was finally acknowledged by the then Minister, the late Erskine Childers, that CIE had to go the way of national transport systems in almost all countries and depend on a permanent rail subvention.</P>
    <P>The management and market assumptions were less sound than the financial ones.  It suffices to distinguish between those planning days 40 years ago, when there was virtually no private transport at all, and the market of today where private transport occupies an overwhelming position.  It is extremely difficult to see how a unified management structure such as that which grew up between 1944 and more recent times coped at all with the increasing complexities of economic and social life and the pressures and changes internal to itself. The complaints so often heard about CIE <Col N="11" /> have originated as much in the management and market sectors, including the work of serving the market, as in any other.</P>
    <P>I see my role in relation to CIE in three aspects: (i) I have to get the subsidy right &mdash; it must never again revert to the excesses of growth that characterised the seventies.  The correction process is well in hand but more has to be done; (ii) the overall direction of the undertaking has to be got right; (iii) service of the market has to be got right.  The Bill deals with points (ii) and (iii).</P>
    <P>The financial arguments based on cross-supports for holding CIE together were exposed to chill reality 20 years ago. In all respects every major activity started to head for losses.  The management of CIE became increasingly pre-occupied with the financial struggle and their reputation in the market had to suffer.</P>
    <P>With the ending of the financial argument for an amalgamated system there were questions that might be asked about the system itself but they seemed to escape notice.  It did not really emerge that running a railway company was not the same task as running a provincial bus service and that the demands and needs of these two were different from the demands of a major urban transport system which in the case of Ireland and Dublin had always been a self-contained and distinctive activity until the creation of CIE.  It amazes me that a relatively small central management team kept the whole unwieldy structure going at all or managed to deal on any rational basis with all the problems of infrastructure, rolling stock, supplies, staffing, industrial relations and services.  The thought applies not alone to distinctive major activities on rail and road but out to the fringes of tour management, hotel operation, running Rosslare, keeping the canals passable and running ships to the Aran Islands.</P>
    <P>The board and management of CIE were not invariably helped by Government.  I do not wish to recite faults in Government of any party.  I can say, however, that this vast, unwieldy and struggling agglomeration could have often <Col N="12" /> been helped by clear delineation of what Government expected from it, by some better financial judgments and by less interference with the revenue earning plans of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in complimenting CIE for the benefits it did produce during what I think should now be identified as years of struggle.  And I am happy to put this positive aspect against the criticism which I have often found it necessary to make.  I also give the highest praise to the whole hearted effort by CIE at all levels to implement and bring to fruition the changes I have already introduced.  I know I can rely on a continuation of this effort to bring about this more or less final set of necessary improvements.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for retention of CIE as the parent of three new operating subsidiary companies registered under the Companies Acts.  The new companies will have full responsibility under the board of CIE for the operations of the railways, Dublin city bus services and provincial bus services.</P>
    <P>I think it would be useful to describe in a little more detail how CIE has developed over the years.  The Transport Act, 1944, brought about the incorporation of Córas Iompair Éireann as a State-sponsored transport company and the country's principal transport operator with the transfer to CIE of the undertakings of the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Transport Company Limited.  The Transport Act of 1950 established Córas Iompair Éireann as a statutory board to replace the State-sponsored company and the Grand Canal Company.  In the Great Northern Railways Act, 1958, the Great Northern Railways undertaking within the State was amalgamated with CIE.  At that time the board had responsibility for the railways (passenger and freight), bus services in Dublin and the provinces, road freight, coach and tour services and canals.  Its mandate embraced Rosslare Harbour, a number of hotels and the Galway/Aran ferry service.</P>
    <P>Later legislation made some small adjustments to the CIE role and its mandate but the statutory structure of the organisation remained intact.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> Over the years, CIE has adapted its services to meet the needs of the times. The early fifties brought a major dieselisation programme.  Since then rolling stock has been periodically updated and upgraded and extends to the current mainline carriage programme involving the construction of a fleet of air conditioned carriages at a total estimated cost of £53 million in 1984 prices in progress at the CIE Inchicore works and, as a native of Inchicore, I was delighted to be able to give the final go-ahead for that programme.  These new carriages and the upgrading of track and signalling systems have reduced journey times and improved very considerably standards of passenger comfort.  The Howth-Bray railway has been electrified at a cost of £113 million and this development has brought the railways right up to date in technological terms&mdash;the DART service is technically among the most advanced of its kind in the world.</P>
    <P>There has been periodic updating and replacement of CIE's urban and rural bus fleets.  Since 1980 CIE has undertaken a major programme of bus replacement and since then about 800 new buses have been purchased by the board at a cost of about £100 million.  Fifty new tour coaches have just been acquired by the board for this year's tourist season and for the CIE cross-Channel Supabus services.</P>
    <P>These are major capital investments but they had to be matched with stations and garage renewals and the acquisition of ancillary equipment to ensure that maintenance and support services were upgraded in line with needs.  So it will be seen that CIE has had a lot of renewal in recent years.</P>
    <P>Against its financial background it is not surprising that down through the years CIE has been the subject of a number of in-depth studies, the most recent being the McKinsey study &ldquo;The Transport Challenge&rdquo; published in February 1981.</P>
    <P>When I was appointed Minister with <Col N="14" /> responsibility for transport matters in late 1982 the serious situation in regard to the CIE finances and indeed in relation to the overall image and effectiveness of CIE was one of my immediate priorities. The deficit had spiralled and in the period between 1969-70 and 1982, during which the Consumer Price Index had increased by a factor of only 5.4, the deficit had increased from £3.234 million to £109.373 million, a factor of 33.8 &mdash; over six times more than inflation.  I think that is a very relevant fact.  I wonder if there should be an inquiry about it.</P>
    <P>When I came to office I set to work immediately on the financial problems and simultaneously began to look at the CIE organisation in the context of the McKinsey recommendations.  As a first step in tackling the financial problems, the Government approved in June 1983 a package of measures, which I proposed, aimed at not only reducing CIE's cost to the Exchequer over a five-year period but also paving the way for a new operating environment in CIE.  These measures included a new basis for determining the CIE subvention which now limits it to the lesser of either one-half of the board's revenue or one-third of their expenditure.  This was in CIE's interest as well as the Exchequer's.</P>
    <P>The package also provided for the payment of the subvention &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; in recognition of CIE's social role in providing commercially unprofitable but socially desirable services.  Expenditure restrictions were imposed on CIE as a means of introducing cash limits to contain costs.  An obligation was placed on CIE to reduce the level of their expenditure in real terms by 2½ per cent per annum up to 1988 and the purpose of the formula was to obtain a reducing subvention in line with a reducing expenditure.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to circulate with the Official Report a chart showing the reduction in the CIE net operating deficit since 1982 and projections for the future based on the subvention formula.</P>

    <img websrc="/graphics/S.0112.0015.1.gif" />
    <P>For 1983, 1984 and 1985 I am glad to say the targets have been met or bettered and this is a cause for congratulation to all in CIE and in my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition to setting the financial targets for CIE, the Government also decided that it was necessary to supplement the board's mandate to ensure that the national economic situation and Government objectives were fully reflected in the formulation and development of board policies.  A number of specific objectives were identified for CIE and included:</P>
    <P>(i)  to review in depth all aspects of CIE's operations in the interests of reducing the board's dependence on State subvention;</P>
    <P>(ii)  to review the effectiveness and organisation of CIE management and to undertake any restructuring found necessary;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> (iii)  to regard the improvement of staff morale and motivation throughout CIE as a major aim;</P>
    <P>(iv)  to extend and strengthen the role of the financial control function so as to improve the cost effectiveness of expenditure;</P>
    <P>(v)  to review board policy in relation to capital works and proposals for new developments;</P>
    <P>(vi)  to arrange at maximum advantage to the board's financial position the disposal of surplus assets or the development of those assets by third parties.</P>
    <P>When the package of measures was in place it was then necessary to turn to fundamental issues.  The consultants, McKinsey &amp; Co. Inc., who were appointed in 1979 to undertake a study of CIE, came to a number of conclusions <Col N="17" /> based on the decline in the Board's market share and projections.</P>
    <P>They recommended:</P>
    <P>&mdash;complete disestablishment of CIE into three separate organisations;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of OPO in the Dublin city bus services; the closing of CIE road freight operations, and the elimination of the sundries rail service;</P>
    <P>&mdash;centralising freight management to Dublin with operations limited to bulk traffic and the carriage of dangerous goods; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;dismantling of the company's area management structure.</P>
    <P>Having considered the future of CIE in the context of the McKinsey report, other related documents, observations furnished in response to the report and the views of the chairman of CIE, the Government were convinced that a major reform of the CIE organisation was essential.  While many of the consultants' conclusions were found to be valid, the McKinsey recommendation for the disestablishment of CIE was rejected because of the value perceived in a single board continuing to have overall control of the organisation's operations.  Another option considered was the re-organisation of CIE's responsibilities as an internal CIE matter without new legislation.  It was rejected also because such a response was not considered sufficiently far reaching to give the results desired.  The route chosen by the Government had a number of main objectives, first, to keep the deficit under control without major disruption of services or employment; second, to improve morale and the working environment generally in CIE; third, to improve the reliability and attractiveness of services at the lowest possible fares and fourth, to obtain greater transparency of the allocation of costs between the various CIE activities.</P>
    <P>In the light of this the Government decided that the reform of CIE must be such as to transform CIE into smaller, more compact operating organisations, <Col N="18" /> with clearly defined functions and hence the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Re-organisation is not the whole story. For clarity it was also necessary to set financial objectives for such an enterprise.  As a result the Government announced its intentions in <i>Building on Reality</i> in October 1984.  Members of the House will recall some of the main elements of the Government decision, which covered such matters as:</P>
    <P>1.  The requirement to reduce expenditure in real terms on the railways was extended to include 1989 and the objective was revised to the reduction in real terms of railway costs by close to 20 per cent over a five year period, an average of 3.7 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>2.  The halving of the 1983 deficit by 31 December 1989 in real terms was set as the objective for Dublin city bus services, which by the end of 1984, already had in real terms almost halved the all-time high 1982 deficit;</P>
    <P>3.  The formula for reducing costs by 2.5 per cent per annum was extended to 1989 for the provincial bus services and the services should become profitable by that time; and</P>
    <P>4.  CIE rail sundries and road freight services to be discontinued by 1 January 1986 unless they proved profitable in 1984 and 1985.</P>
    <P>It is emphasised that the railway objective needs to be achieved without endangering rail safety.</P>
    <P>There are significant advantages in retaining the board of CIE as the parent to the three subsidiary companies.  These would be more manageable units having chief executives with clear objectives and targets to achieve.  The board will vet the plans of the companies, monitor their performance and assess their competing demands for investments and funds.  The board will also be an instrument for promoting an efficient, coherent overall approach to CIE transport services generally.  At the same time the setting up of the companies will introduce greater flexibility into the CIE organisation with <Col N="19" /> each of them having its own board of directors whose objectives will be influenced mainly by the more limited mandates of the individual companies and with management closer to its staff and operations.</P>
    <P>That, in summary, is the background to the Bill before the House today.  Already two aspects of re-organisation have been put in place, namely, the transfer of the hotels owned by CIE to CERT and the transfer of responsibility for the Grand and Royal Canals from CIE to the Commissioners of Public Works which will be completed in the coming weeks.  These changes were designed to allow CIE to concentrate more completely on its transport activities and facilitated the re-organisation.</P>
    <P>Now we must build on the financial improvements of the past few years and turn to the more fundamental re-organisation as soon as possible.  This is reflected in the Bill which is not so complex as to delay its enactment but comprehensive enough to achieve the desired results. Under the Bill, CIE, I must emphasise, will not relinquish any of its statutory powers and duties or privileges but rather it will use the new subsidiaries as instruments for implementing CIE policy and as the board's agents in carrying out more effectively the functions entrusted to it by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires the Board of CIE to establish three new operating subsidiaries responsible for railways, provincial bus services and Dublin city bus services and to register them under the Companies Acts.  It deals with the delegation of functions and responsibilities to the subsidiary companies in respect of operational matters and for the provision of rights, duties and liabilities for the subsidiaries to allow them to carry out their functions.  It sets out the principal objects of the companies and provides for the assignment of CIE staff to the new companies and the protection of conditions of employment of staff transferred.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions dealing with certain financial matters arising from the proposed re-organisation. <Col N="20" /> While I circulated an Explanatory Memorandum with the Bill, I would nonetheless like to outline the Bill in some detail to the House and to highlight some of the more important provisions, particularly those which involve fundamental changes for CIE.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill, comprising sections 1 to 5, contains standard-type provisions of a general kind and for the repeal of certain sections of existing legislation. Section 14 of the Transport Act, 1950, which empowers the Minister to grant, by order, additional powers to the board, is being replaced by section 23 of the Bill which extends the scope of the existing provision to include specifically functions relating to the development of the assets of the board.  This is in keeping with the revised mandate given to the board by the Government in 1983.</P>
    <P>The repeal of section 35 (2) of the 1950 Act dispenses with the requirement on CIE to hold open public examinations for the recruitment of clerical staff and thus will allow greater flexibility to the board and its subsidiaries to determine recruitment policy and procedures in keeping with modern practice in major commercial and semi-State organisations.  This change is something which both management and unions have been seeking for some time.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill provides for the formation of the three operating subsidiary companies.  It also contains provisions relating to certain financial matters, staff transfers and protection of conditions of service and other general provisions, which are features of Acts dealing with State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 6 obliges the board to form and register the new limited liability companies conforming to the conditions laid down in the Bill and for the appointment, by order made by the Minister, of a vesting day, that is the day on which the reorganised CIE will commence operations.  This order will be irrevocable except by an amending Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The proposed names of the new subsidiares are listed in section 7 although I must say I am not totally happy with them <Col N="21" /> and I may give them further consideration.  The section also specifies that the share capital of each of the subsidiaries shall be wholly owned by the parent Board and prohibits the transfer or disposal of any share in the companies.  This clarifies beyond doubt that the purpose of the Bill is to reorganise and revitalise a State company which will continue to remain in State hands unless the Oireachtas decides otherwise on some future occasion.</P>
    <P>The Government's intentions for continuing on a long term basis the national transport undertaking is also reflected by section 17 which enables the board to transfer assets to the subsidiary companies for the purposes of their operations but excludes from those assets land and buildings which will remain in the ownership of the parent board.</P>
    <P>The principal objects of the companies and the general statutory basis for carrying out their functions subject to the directions of the parent board are set out in section 8.  These provisions lead naturally into treating of the roles envisaged for the parent board and its subsidiary companies.  Overall general objectives for the CIE organisation as a whole will continue to be set by the Government.  The Board of CIE will settle, within overall sums provided by the Government and, well in advance, the financial targets and allocations for the subsidiaries and in setting these allocations the board will consult with the Minister where necessary.</P>
    <P>It will be the responsibility of the board to agree with the boards of directors of the subsidiary companies their annual budgets, including capital investments, to monitor the activities of the subsidiaries, to ensure that the subsidiaries achieve any financial targets set for them and to provide an assessment of the performances of the operating companies in the board's annual report to the Minister. More generally the board will be expected to foster the development of a more commercial approach across the spectrum of the activities within the overall CIE remit.  In addition to the responsibilities in relation to the subsidiaries, the <Col N="22" /> board will be responsible for actively pursuing the development of CIE property and other assets, the operation of the board's International Tours Company and providing common services such as pension schemes and computer services, etc, for the subsidiaries.  I want CIE to exploit its many human skills and property assets in other directions.  I see potential for expansion here and this is something I have been encouraging the Chairman and Board of CIE to pursue. This could well be a vital contribution to the financial success of the organisation in the future and to providing the outlets for these relatively untapped, but rich, resources.</P>
    <P>The boards of directors of the subsidiary companies will be responsible under the board for the operations and activities of their companies.  This will include responsibility for finances, staff and industrial relations, marketing and customer and other services, business development, operating procedures, etc.  They will be accountable to the board in regard to their performances.</P>
    <P>Specific requirements as to the articles of association are contained in section 11 which sets out particulars of the size and structure of the boards of the operating subsidiaries.  The directors will be appointed by the Chairman of CIE with the consent of the Minister, and it allows for the possibility of the chairman being appointed chairman or director of a subsidiary company or companies.</P>
    <P>You will notice that I propose to limit the membership of each of the new boards to five members.  I see these boards as executive in nature in the interest of efficiency and effectiveness and this arrangement introduces into the State sector here the two-tier type board system, which has been so successful in Germany.  The members of the parent board elected by the CIE workforce will continue to make their contribution to the whole CIE organisation through the activities of the parent Board, which will continue to control overall policy and the operating companies generally.  The value of worker directors in the State boards is now clearly established.  In <Col N="23" /> order, however, to avoid a situation which would cut across the electoral arrangements in CIE, I see a need to introduce an amendment to the Bill at Committee Stage to ensure that the new structures maintain intact the CIE constituency for electing worker directors to the board.</P>
    <P>I might mention at this stage a further amendment which I will be introducing on Committee Stage.  This relates to the provisions of section 13 which deals with membership of either House of the Oireachtas or Assembly of the European Community.  This amendment will be designed to meet the wishes of Senators who have in recent times requested a provision whereby directors and staff of semi-State organisations will not be required to give up their directorship or stand seconded from their employment until actually entitled to take their seats in either House of the Oireachtas or the Assembly of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I know that there has been some concern among certain staff in CIE about their future in the new organisation. Section 14 of the Bill provides for the transfer of staff of the board to the companies and for the protection of their existing pay and conditions.  It empowers the board to designate existing employees for employment by a company and it obliges staff so designated to transfer to that company.  It also allows flexibility for the transfer and promotion of staff between the companies within the group. This provision highlights yet again the continued coherence of CIE.  This is highlighted by section 15, a very important provision, which enables the board of CIE to continue to organise and operate existing pension schemes for both the staff of the board and those of the companies.  It provides for service with any of the companies to be treated as employment with the board for pension purposes.  This should further facilitate intercompany transfers of staff in the future. Other important provisions in relation to staff are contained in section 11 (f) which <Col N="24" /> requires the companies to set up negotiating machinery for the purpose of negotiations concerned with pay and conditions of service.</P>
    <P>The escalation of CIE's losses between 1969 and 1982 was all the more disastrous when it is considered that overall employment in the board fell by nearly 4,000 in that period and, and regrettably, reorganisation or not, a further reduction of 500 is envisaged.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that I have been assured by the chairman of CIE that the bulk of these unavoidable reductions will be achieved through natural wastage or, where necessary, by using the existing arrangements agreed with CIE trade unions concerning redundancies.  The reductions in staff contemplated have already been discussed with the unions.</P>
    <P>The principal financial provisions of the Bill are contained in sections 19 and 20.  Section 19 is based on the usual formula for the accounts and audits of State bodies.  Section 20 outlines the borrowing powers and procedures to be followed in the case of the subsidiary companies.  I envisage, as I hope is clear from the text of the Bill, a vital role for the parent board in regard to control of borrowings by the new companies.  The powers to borrow for capital purposes are being retained by the parent board because of its overall responsibility for the CIE group.  Subsection (3) of section 20 prohibits the giving of State guarantees for moneys borrowed directly by the companies.  This will not hinder the subsidiaries in obtaining their capital needs as the board of CIE will be able to on-lend to its subsidiaries so that they will be able to carry out their capital investments in line with the capital programmes agreed by the parent board.  The guaranteeing by the State of borrowing by the CIE board is not affected.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory borrowing limits and controls will continue to apply to the new organisation as a group and all capital borrowings will continue to be subject to the approval and control of the Ministers for Communications and Finance, subject of course to the overriding statutory limits determined from <Col N="25" /> time to time by the Oireachtas.  The Bill empowers the companies to borrow temporarily, with the consent of the board, for day-to-day operating purposes subject to existing controls and within such statutory limits as may be determined from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill was drafted before the decision to abolish the National Prices Commission was announced because experience had shown that the extent to which CIE could raise fares and rates was strongly influenced by what the market could bear and that was invariably less than what would be permissible under the national price control criteria.  CIE fares and rates will, however, continue to be subject to approval by the Government.  When the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, 1985, is enacted the new Dublin Transport Authority will have a role in the approval of CIE fare increases for Dublin bus and suburban rail.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains a number of provisions relating to Córas Iompair Éireann and the subsidiaries.  The statutory obligation imposed on the board by the 1950 Act to appoint a secretary and a general manager is being replaced by section 28 of the Bill which will allow the board greater flexibility in the appointment of officers and servants.  This flexibility is desirable in the situation where the chairman holds office on a full-time basis and where the organisation is undergoing a period of major change and restructuring.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 29 of the Bill have been included on general policy grounds and require the board of CIE and the boards of each of the companies to have regard either to Government or nationally agreed guidelines in fixing the pay or the terms and conditions of staff and it also obliges each of them to comply with any directives in this regard which may be given by the Minister for Communications with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  This type of provision is not new and is drafted along the lines of a relevant provision in the Gas Act of 1976 and several other <Col N="26" /> Acts.  Free collective bargaining between CIE and its employees will continue.</P>
    <P>A large organisation such as CIE has need of continuous review so that it can adapt to face the various challenges as they appear.  In transport, changes can arise from many influences, including changes in technology and equipment, barriers to travel and trade, the relative competitiveness of the various transport modes and the transport preferences of the customers.</P>
    <P>The proposed reorganisation of CIE and the financial measures which I have outlined are designed to put the board's finances on a firmer footing and to secure the future of CIE, having due regard to what the Exchequer can afford, the interests of the taxpayer and the need to provide reliable services for the public. The Bill is designed to ensure and strengthen the future of the organisation. The reorganisation now proposed is, I am convinced, in the best interests of the travelling public, the CIE workforce and the Exchequer.  The smaller units should be susceptible to more effective management in a manner which is not possible in the case of very large and diffuse organisations.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the reorganisation provided for in this Bill is, of course, a matter for the board of CIE in the first instance.  As I said in my opening remarks I am confident that I will have the full backing of CIE management and general workforce in carrying through the new arrangements which are so necessary for their future.  The board and management are dependent on the support of all CIE employees in order to effect a smooth transition.  The future success of the new CIE will rest squarely on the shoulders of the parent board, the subsidiary boards and the workforce.  CIE and its employees have shown in recent years what it was possible to achieve in regard to CIE finances.  This inspires confidence for achieving the objectives set for CIE by the Government in the years ahead.  I say this in the knowledge that when the accounts for 1985 are published shortly they will show that CIE has had the best year for many years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> General public confidence in the transport services provided must be increased. This will be achieved mainly by improving the quality and reliability of the services.  In that connection there is hardly need to emphasise the importance of a stable industrial relations climate.  I have spoken on a number of occasions about industrial relations in CIE particularly in the Dublin city services.  My more recent references where rightly devoted to improvements in that climate.  Recent experiences are quite positive and augur well for the future notwithstanding yesterday's minor upset at Summerhill. The recent introduction of one-person-operated buses and DART feeder buses in Dublin, following agreement between the board of CIE and the unions, happily brought to a satisfactory conclusion that long drawn out saga.  The new structures with less remote management should also contribute to good industrial relations throughout the organisation.</P>
    <P>While I have set tough targets for CIE in the past three years and for the next three, I have also given a very substantial commitment to the board.  For 1986 the estimated subvention, based on the subvention formula, comes to £104.5 million.  But in addition, since I came to office, provision has been made for the Exchequer to take on board directly the interest payments on DART which is the correct approach for infrastructural projects of this kind.  Moreover, the problem of CIE's short term borrowings has been addressed and £30 million is being remitted by the Exchequer over ten years, having commenced in 1985.</P>
    <P>The capital provision for 1986 is £34.4 million mainly for new railway carriages, signalling and communications and the acquisition of buses for CIE Supabus and tour activities.  Sixty-four million pounds will have been spent in the five years up to the end of 1987 on the replacement of railway carriages.  On the present signalling communications programme £15 million was spent up to the end of 1984 and a further £14 million will be spent by 1987.  This represents a very big investment, without which the CIE <Col N="28" /> services would inevitably run down. When you consider this, the DART investment and the bus fleets, it will be readily clear that the renewal of CIE which this Bill seeks to bring about, has been accompanied by a very large investment to give it the modern tools to do the job.</P>
    <P>The recently published Green Paper on transport policy and the publication of the National Plan raise a number of very important issues which have a bearing on the longer term future of the new CIE group.  In so far as the railways are concerned, the new organisation and management structure together with the investments made in the railways give all concerned an opportunity to prove the worth of the railways and thereby guarantee their long-term future.  The closing date for the receipt of observations on the Green Paper was 31 March and the many views furnished, for which I am grateful, are being assessed.  The conclusions which we will draw from the contributions on the Green Paper will be taken account of in a White Paper to be published later this year.</P>
    <P>The problems in relation to the structure of CIE which we are tackling here have been ventilated freely in the last few years.  A certain negative approach which is based on so-called privatisation has been imported into the discussion.  I do not wish to say anything about privatisation in connection with this Bill for the simple reason that privatisation has nothing to do with the Bill and is simply a red herring in the debate.</P>
    <P>There are also, I believe, arguments based on what is seen as a threat within CIE &mdash; the threat of competition between rail and road services.  This seems to mean that there must be no competition irrespective of cost to the taxpayer or service to the public as between CIE's rail and provincial road services.  I utterly reject that approach.  There must be some competition to ensure that each new operational company will be on its toes, that each worker in each company will identify with the public entity to which he is attached, work to further its aims and take pride in its new identity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> The board of CIE will still retain its powers and responsibilities.  The board will guard against reckless or ruinous competition between the subsidiaries. Indeed, the proposed structure gets close to the optimum.  It maintains the overall framework of the integrated approach which many see as essential to our transport system.  It allows also for specifically identifiable sharing of services and supports where sharing is necessary &mdash; another argued benefit of integration.</P>
    <P>National transport issues such as CIE and its services provide a basis for a very broad debate covering a very extensive field.  I have endeavoured to give the House a comprehensive statement on the background to the changes proposed in the Bill, the motivation and the objectives.  It goes without saying that there are many issues which Senators consider relevant which I have not touched on. Omissions are inevitable in a situation like this.  I will, however, endeavour to reply to any such points in the course of my reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill in the Seanad.  It gives an opportunity for Senators to deal with a very comprehensive and important piece of legislation.  The Minister has taken a rather broad view of the history and the problems of CIE and it is a view with which I can agree.  In his address he compliments the planners of far-off days.  I recollect coming home from the funeral of Mr. Tod Andrews and listening on the radio to his recorded comments on CIE. It is true that it was always a company about which there was speculation.  Many problems were overcome in days gone by, through the War and other difficult periods of Irish history, right up to the time which the Minister rightly pinpoints as when the trouble seems to have begun, or perhaps a few years prior to it.  The troubles really seem to have begun in 1969 in CIE.  Prior to that it was a very respectable company, one which was appreciated and one which was very nationally orientated, servicing the Irish <Col N="30" /> people in every way.  I am amazed at the statistics the Minister has produced concerning the situation that pertained from 1969-70 to 1982.  He said:</P>
      <P>The deficit has spiralled and in the period between 1969-70 and 1982, during which the consumer price index had increased by a factor of only 5.4 per cent, the deficit had increased from £3.234 million to £109.373 million, a factor of 33.8 &mdash; over six times more than inflation.</P>
      <P>It is a fascinating figure.  I recollect that in this House at that time I tabled motions concerning CIE's road freight situation where archaic systems were leading us into the seventies with huge costs and tremendous losses.  It happened slightly before 1969, but the figures seem to have come together from that specific period, but I would allow it probably two or three years before the rot set in.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill itself, it is not a Bill based on the McKinsey report, although parts of it may be extracted from it.  The new system of setting up of the companies is the one on which I would like to comment.  There are a few things I would like to ask the Minister and perhaps he would be courteous enough in his reply to respond.  He said it is the German type situation now, that he has set up the companies under a holding company with three subsidiaries.  We never heard of that in a public debate here as of yet, at least I have not heard of it.  I want to make the following comments about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the holding company is a fine idea, but the holding company is the controlling company.  That is obvious from the remarks the Minister has made throughout his speech.  It is the controlling company and obviously the finger point as regards what the subsidiaries do. I cannot understand, first of all, the naming of the subsidiary companies as Irish Rail, Irish Bus and Dublin Bus. There was not a lot of mind-boggling in the Department or on the part of the Minister when they were simply branded in this way.  This it typical of how we have been in this country over the years.  If our <Col N="31" /> friends across the water make a decision and it looks appropriate for us, we will make the same decision.  We are just a bunch of copy cats and this Government particularly are a bunch of copy cats.  I thought the Minister had a broader mind than that and more ability.  I would like to see those three names changed.  They do not show much imagination.  If you had asked a child in second class at school to give names to these three companies, I am sure they could have done it.  I would welcome any amendment the Minister would bring in on this.  On this occasion if he changes the Bill in the other House he does not have to come back to the Seanad.  He will be robbed of the excuse we usually get in this House: that if we change the Bill we have to go to the Dáil to have it amended.  I hope the Minister will give some thought to the changing of the names.  Surely, with all the brains and expertise available to the Minister in the Department of Transport, we could have a little touch of flamboyance in the naming of the companies.</P>
    <P>The other question I want to raise is the question of the holding company.  I speak about CIE from the knowledge I have of it and I speak of this period from 1965 onwards.  The bureaucracy of CIE began to develop in those years.  All I am afraid of is that the Minister, who slipped through this by saying that he has provided for a holding company and three subsidiary companies, is making room for more bureaucracy.  If one stands at any of the stations in the city, and particularly the major stations, there appears to be a lot of bureaucracy.  All I hope is that this holding company is not to be just a home for all those bureaucrats instead of telling them that there is no room for them in this sector.  That is all I am afraid of and that is enough to be afraid of because CIE has been choked in recent years by a tight knot.</P>
    <P>The other fear I have concerning the three subsidiaries and this holding company is that they will be totally under the control of the Minister.  The Minister has the record in this House of taking the fast option of liquidation.  We have seen it in <Col N="32" /> Irish Shipping.  His record is not very good as regards exploring all the avenues open to him and I would be afraid that tool could be used if any of those companies was not shaping up, and perhaps without giving it the proper and dedicated attention it should get.  I would have a slight fear there, knowing the Minister's history.</P>
    <P>I would also say that, as I said in regard to the names of the different companies, we are a bit British-orientated.  This Government have a great admiration, if not a little more, for Thatcherism or that type of philosophy today.  We have seen it in many companies.  I will deal with some more of them which worked for CIE later on.  Little mercy has been shown and I do not think that is the way those things should be.  While one would like to see every place making a profit &mdash;&ldquo;profit&rdquo; is a sacred word &mdash; but a limit on profit can also be taken on board.</P>
    <P>The other option, which again would be the Thatcher inclination, would be that if one company were doing very well and the Government could do with a few shillings they could actually sell it off. This system could allow that to happen.</P>

      <P>It is not in the Bill that it can be done, but I always find it is far more important to have in the Bill what cannot be done.  We have seen these things done before.  I would like to see a phrase confirming that point of view. From what we see of opinion polls the Minister may not be much longer in the position.  However, I would like to see a protection in the Bill.  While it may not be in the phraseology of it, Ministers and Departments are well able to adjust words and rephrase statements at a later stage.  We have often seen in the past on <Col N="33" /> other matters, not perhaps as serious as this, their ability to find an escape route. I would like to see it confirmed here that they cannot and will not sell these companies.  I am not critical of the general run of the Bill.  I am critical of parts of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is true, despite what the Minister might say, that bureaucracy still exists in CIE.  Their performance over the years in the motivation of their work force has been proof.  In the last 15 or 18 years motivation of the work force has been the weakest point in CIE.  That can be seen from all the trauma and all the discomforts that were created.  The Minister, in a reference to the founding fathers of CIE, stated:</P>
      <P>In their thinking, it is fair to say, financial considerations took great precedence.  The conventional wisdom of the twenties and thirties in the failing public transport industry was that the strong could help the weak.</P>
      <P>I like the phrase, because if we take it to the period of 1965 onwards that certainly did not apply.  There are many people in this city and throughout this country who on a Monday morning discovered that rather rudely when they stood at the bus stop to get a bus and they found that there was no bus available.  That has to be said.  It is fair to say that did probably develop from 1965 onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other things as well.  The rural bus services had their traumatic periods.  The rail service had its traumas. They were all quite sudden and quite sharp.  It was not that the strong were helping the weak, but rather that the strong were strengthening themselves. That happened because the bureaucracy over those years lacked the ability to motivate its workforce.  If they were motivated properly the things that had happened over those years as regards strikes etc. would not have happened.  We had one not too long ago and we had a threatened situation yesterday, as the Minister rightly pointed out.  It is not over yet.  I cannot see the holding company, if it is to be the home of the bureaucracy that has existed in CIE, changing that a lot. <Col N="34" /> That would be sad.  It would be a very poor performance.  Now is the time for the Minister and this House and the other House to act so that that situation can never be allowed to happen again in a public service which is a necessary public service.  That is a very important point.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister considered the situation that may arise as regards feeder bus services from railway stations, particularly rural Ireland.  What proposal has he to ensure that those services are continued?  I want to give this as an example. When in days gone by we were closing all those smaller lines certain guarantees were given by CIE.  There was, in my own county, a guarantee given, when the Loughrea station was closed down, that a bus service would pick passengers up at Athymon junction and take them to Loughrea.  Loughrea is the third largest town in our county.  Today no such service operates despite the guarantee given at that time.  It is a sad reflection on the bureaucracy that that happened.  I give that as an example because I can foresee that with the two separate companies making two separate decisions, both I assume based on financial considerations, the bus service may well say: &ldquo;That does not pay us&rdquo;.  So the service is cut.  Where is the guarantee for people who use the mainline service?  Is there a guarantee that Irish Bus will take those people to meet Irish Rail?</P>
    <P>There is another point that one would have to make.  It is seldom one hears praise of CIE.  However, there is one aspect of CIE I would like to praise and that is the educational programmes and the apprenticeship programmes which were always carried out by CIE.  They have produced many fine people in their particular fields.  I would like to know from the Minister whether all these three companies are going to take on board any apprenticeship course?  Will this new holding company be responsible for it or will it be each of the three individual companies dealing in their own individual field?  It is very important that the knowledge and training that has gone on in the past will be continued, because, particularly from a rail point of view, safety is a <Col N="35" /> major factor and if we do not train the personnel correctly for that particular service we cannot expect to get it.  That is a statement of fact.  I would like to know where this training and apprenticeship fits into this new structure.  Who is responsible?  Despite the odd accident that happened the safety of CIE, particularly on rail, has to be commended.  I would like to be reassured that the programme that has kept it that way in the past will keep it that way in the future as well.  If that is not spelled out clearly then it will cause concern.</P>
    <P>Regarding the bus company, anything that could be done about Dublin buses would be an improvement.  If Dublin Bus is to be the machine to move city bus services into line I welcome it, apart from its silly name.  I have watched Dublin buses over the years as an observing motorist and I cannot tolerate the situation that has appertained.  I pass by Conyngham Road practically twice a week at all hours of the day and night.  I fail to understand how, whether it is peak time or weak time, that yard is always full of idle buses.  I do not understand how, at the peak periods, with so many people to be transported, we can afford this luxury. There is a traffic light across the road from it and I take such offence at what I see that I normally count the buses in the yard.  I have not yet seen fewer than 36. This is something that has annoyed me over the years.  That has to be bad organisation.  I do not know if anybody can speak about the other bus stations but that is what I can tell you about it.</P>
    <P>If anybody is coming in here tomorrow at 1 o'clock, which I expect is a peak time in the city, at 5 o'clock tomorrow evening would they look at some other bus station and count how many idle buses are standing there?  It is little wonder that Dublin city buses began to lose money over recent years.  That sort of nonsense cannot be tolerated and somebody has to be responsible for it.  As the Minister pointed out in his speech here today, £110 million was paid out for buses in recent years and we have added on to the fleet recently on the tourist side.  This sum was <Col N="36" /> paid out for public transport and yet in the main city of this country they can afford in one station to have not less than 36 buses, double deckers and single deckers, standing idle.  I wish the Minister would try to explain it to me.  I am sure it would annoy him as much as it annoys me or any other public representative.</P>
    <P>Who will be responsible for leadership in an adjustment, for example, concerning the rural bus services?  You have this great social service where you can afford to send a 55 or a 58 seater bus jogging up and down the road at the wrong hours of the day to carry people who do not want to go anywhere except to get to the local shop or maybe to the local village or maybe just to go for a spin for the sake of a spin and come back again.  I wonder what the Minister proposes to do about sharpening up the rural services, thinking about people who want to go to work early in the morning, thinking about people coming home from work in the evening at the different hours they finish their work.  I think the social service bus, the one on which old age pensioners travel could be much smaller.  In the rural outposts like the ones in my constituency a bus half the size would suffice, a larger type mini-bus would do.  There would be less rattling and shaking and the people would be far more comfortable and would not be thrown all over the bus on the roads for which we are now renowned.  I feel sorry for old people because the bigger the machine the bigger the bumps.  I was in Leenane recently and I saw old people coming out of the bus at 1.15 p.m. and they were pale from all the shaking and rattling they received going along the roads of Connemara.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's duty when he is replying to give us an indication of what he wants as regards the services.  At the same time he should remember that there is a saving in all this and there is profitability in it.  The social aspect is very important but it can be cut down to size and not have this ridiculous situation that has been allowed to continue for far too long. That has not been the responsibility of the Minister but the responsibility of the <Col N="37" /> bureaucracy that has operated within CIE.  There must be scope in the outback areas for Irish Bus to co-operate with the postman.  It is a novel idea that the postman could take individuals to collect their pensions in different areas rather than have this 54 seater drive all over the highways and byways of the country. These are all money savers and things that have got to be taken on board.  They are important to the people of the community rather than having this monstrosity continuing to hog the roads of the outward places of the west of Ireland in particular.</P>
    <P>The other question is the question of redundancies.  I would like the Minister to outline to us what the situation is with regard to the proposal that was mentioned of 500 redundancies in CIE.  Has any progress been made to date?  What has happened to that golden figure of 500?  Is it there now and if it is not there now what is the figure that is there now? I do not know what has happened.</P>
    <P>I noticed that many of the senior members of the workforce of CIE seem to be on retirement now. Could the Minister tell us how many are left to be brought into this scheme?  Could he tell us, when he is replying, how many people he now feels are left to be declared redundant and what method is to be used to achieve the figures he so eagerly said in the past he would achieve?  That has to be told to us.  I should like to know how many have gone and how many have to go and what is the process?  I think that is important.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say anything about privatisation in connection with this Bill for the simple reason that privatisation has nothing to do with the Bill and is simply a red herring in the debate.</P>
    <P>It could be a red herring in the debate, but it is not a red herring out in the street. I will tell you why.  The private bus people who have invested enormous amounts of money to give a service &mdash; a very fine and cheap service &mdash; to the rural parts of this <Col N="38" /> country, to and from this city in particular, have to be taken on board.  They have to be respected for their achievements. No matter what we say about CIE their ineptness in the past allowed them to come in.  They allowed individuals to come in and many of them are fine young people who are doing a fine job.  They allowed the private bus situation to develop because they failed themselves to give the service that those people give.</P>
    <P>I think the ordinary transport consumer in this instance has got to know now and quickly what is their position in regards to this very fine service in general which is in operation.  When CIE were demanding from Galway city to Dublin £21 return on their rail carriage, there were operators in Galway who were offering for £5.50 a return on their bus. Included in that service, let me say, was a cup of coffee in a glass cup, plus a video machine so they could pass the time watching a programme on that bus.  For four times that money and more they were put into a carriage.  They got a cup of coffee in a paper cup.  It was probably half spilled by the time they got back to their place and they paid at least 50p for it.  They paid an astronomical figure altogether if they had a light meal.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, on behalf of the people who do not use CIE because CIE did not and do not give the service, that the Minister has got to introduce a Bill in this House to allow a private company to operate a service to compete with CIE. I no longer want to hear the old stories that have been fired around that they are not paying their drivers, that their insurance is not up to date, that some of them are probably collecting the dole while they are driving the coaches to the city.  I know the reputable companies involved and that is the furthest thing from the truth.  That old nonsense is not going to get us anywhere anymore.  They do not want to be accused of working outside the law, because I think that is the worst accusation of all that could be made.  They are all taxpayers.  They are all big investors in those coaches and they are all giving the services.  I could pinpoint the services they rendered on <Col N="39" /> numerous occasions which CIE refused &mdash; taking workers to Galway city in the mornings and home again in the evenings and the teachers in Galway city teaching in Tuam town who got a service from them down in the morning and a service back in the evening.  CIE totally refused to have anything whatsoever to do with that route and those people were licensed by the Department, and rightly so, to give the service.  Now it is a fine service and one which is used.</P>
    <P>Those are the matters which have to be looked at.  It is not good enough for us to have here the formation of Irish Rail, Irish Bus and Dublin Bus.  These are all good.  I acknowledge that.  The other aspect of the private bus operators is that legislation to enable them to operate within a set down law has to be brought before this House.  I speak not alone for myself on that matter but on behalf of many members of my party and, I am sure, other parties who would like to see this matter formally legalised.  In no way by saying that am I saying that they are operating outside the law now. I should like to see legislation for them so that their operations could run concurrently with the services provided under the legislation at present before the House.  That can be done.</P>
    <P>We have viable services from areas where there is no other public service at all.  The Minister himself knows of an area in the constituency adjoining me where there is a very fine service to Dublin daily and back.  There is no other public service for them except that one.  I cannot see any reason why, for example, that service could not be licensed under the law the same as Irish Bus will be licensed under the law.  If there was some competition for Irish Bus, it might be the best thing of all to wake them up a little. I think competition is the life blood of trade.  That was an old proverb around the west of Ireland in my time and I do not see anything wrong with it.  When the private buses in Galway began to operate a daily service from Galway City to Dublin CIE began to make special offers. <Col N="40" /> How is it they could do it then?  The first 50 people into a CIE train in the morning could get going for £5.  It made you rush in in the mornings.  Why did they not think of that ten years ago and not allow the situation to develop?  There was never any thinking there.  I sincerely hope that we will now have a good competitive company which can give service for the money they extract from the travelling public.  I should like to think that it is not a red herring, as the Minister said.  It is not a red herring in regard to the situation in the street.  I hope the Minister will outline in his reply the specific date he proposes to bring in legislation to allow private bus companies to operate and to allow the fine services which they give to many people throughout the length and breadth of this country to be continued. That is very important.  I want to make that point in passing because it is a public demand nowadays that that should be done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the three companies and the fear I had in relation to liquidation, while there are other Senators here to speak on this matter who know it in a more detailed manner than I do, I wanted to talk about the situation concerning the company which built the buses, Bombardier.  I do not know the exact details.  I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach does.  I am sure she will be able to deal with the matter in more depth than I.  I think they are a marker for what I have said concerning liquidation.  I believe there are 200 jobs gone in the main factory.  I believe that there are 250 further jobs gone in the smaller subsidiary companies. I think that that expertise is a loss to this country.  It was a quick act of liquidation. That is why I should like to see the Minister put into this Bill that none of those three companies be liquidated.  I am sure the parent company could not be liquidated.  Perhaps it could, too, if the other three were gone.  What would it be doing then except looking after the chief executives &mdash; inherited from CIE I am sure. They would have to put themselves into that position too.  This Bill should contain guarantees that the soft option of liquidation is not the one we seek.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> I give Bombardier as the example where the soft option was liquidation and the consequences were tremendous.  The great tragedy of this country today is the number of liquidations in every sphere of life where no assistance or help seems to be available to help any company.  When a nation is faced with a Government like that which we have now, who do not seem to care about the workforce, it is our responsibility in this House to ensure that protection for such developments as this have got to be spelled out clearly and not by just a passing phrase as if it were not important.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it will not be Fianna Fáil's intention to oppose this Bill.  As I said at the beginning, I do like many parts of it.  I have noted a few in which we certainly have reservations.  I speak basically on my own behalf but also on behalf of many Members of the Fianna Fáil group here in the Seanad to whom I spoke today on this matter.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the amendments the Minister will bring in concerning the naming of those three companies and I do hope that he will exercise a bit of imagination to try to give us something better than a basic British name and which is a copycat performance to which I take exception.</P>

They are the people who are responsible for the irresponsible statements made about Knock Airport and Fine Gael men hired them, including the Taoiseach and the Minister himself.  It does not behove the Minister <Col N="43" /> to even comment on Knock Airport anymore.  Rather take it and allow it to happen because it is going to happen anyhow.  In spite of the Pale, it will happen.  Let there be no fears about that?

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. If anything, a Bill such as this is overdue in this House in order to look at the necessary organisation of CIE.  If it has been approached through a very serious examination of that company, not just by McKinsey but also by the Department and the Minister.  The present period of re-organisation in CIE, of course, is not simply the parameters of this Bill, because to any outside observer these times within CIE must be very challenging times.  This Bill is clearly the most major piece of legislation in relation to the provision of public transport by CIE since the Transport Act of 1950, when the present statutory body was set up. Currently we also have the Dublin Transport Authority Bill about to be debated in this House and we have had in recent times quite a close examination of the performance of CIE and the steps taken by the present Minister in particular to <Col N="44" /> put some order on the Finances of that company.</P>
      <P>The financial problems in CIE, as the Minister outlined earlier, of course date back the best part of 20 years.  More recently the financial problems were resolved in a package laid before Government and provided for by Government in June 1983.  It is very encouraging to hear from the Minister on Second Stage that the controls that have been set up to allow for the continuing operation and development of CIE have not just been successful by way of the subvention given to the company.  It appears that 1985 was the best year yet in relation to that company and the way in which the company, led by their chairman, have managed to cope with the financial subvention in the interest of getting much greater improvement in CIE's position.</P>
      <P>As a layman looking at this Bill, not somebody who has had a great knowledge or close experience of the operations of CIE, we are dealing with an area of quite considerable complexity.  On the other hand, it seems to me that the essential thrust of the Bill towards establishing the holding company and three subsidiaries operating on a smaller but more compact operating arrangement would seem, in the long run, to be a model which has been very successful in Germany and which could well succeed here.  I am sure it will lead to improved performance, more effective management and a much greater understanding of the workforce of CIE, of the company they belong to and a much greater bond of interest in their organisation to the extent that the company will clearly be much more intertwined with the individuals who are taking part in it.  It is clear to me in dealing with this Bill that many of the issues which face CIE in the course of the period following enactment have been carefully thought out and should lead to a very successful period of operation for the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some areas which concern me and, perhaps, the Minister could deal with them.  One is the actual decision taken to divide up the Dublin buses and <Col N="45" /> the two companies in rural Ireland dealing with rail and the provincial bus services.  What I wonder here is whether it is entirely feasible for the rail service and the provincial bus services, which to a large extent operate out of the same premises and up to today use the same staff, will be divided up in a manner which will increase the efficiency of the two companies, or will there not be a great deal of complex difficulties faced by those who are involved in rural Ireland?</P>
    <P>It is clear that the establishment of a separate bus service for Dublin will be successful.  It was successful in the past. I do not see why it cannot, outside the present arrangement, operate well again as an entity.  I wonder about the success of the provincial bus and rail services operating in very close tandem at present, whether it will be possible to divide them up sufficiently and not to have difficulties between the two services in the area of staff and premises.  That kind of difficulty has been faced by CIE before.  We had the difficulties of the bus districts here in the city operating even from the same street.  We had problems of breakdowns and difficulties of availability of buses for another district when those breakdowns occurred.  Will increased costs and more complex problems for those trying to deal with the new companies arise when the rail and provincial bus services operate out of the same premises and service the same public?  It is clear that many people travelling as customers to provincial towns use the bus service to their final destination.  I raise that as an issue which may be something the Minister could outline in more detail when he gets to his reply at a later point.</P>
    <P>The other issue I should like to seek some general clarification on is the establishment in this Bill of the holding company and the three subsidiary companies. Presumably the holding company will act as the source of clearing up difficulties between the operating companies for the city bus, provincial bus and the train services.  It needs to be sorted out between one service and another as to the best way of developing the overall needs of <Col N="46" /> the community in the form of public transport.  I presume that the holding company will iron out these difficulties and will be constantly in the business of dealing with matters that need to be resolved between the companies.  For example, the position which might be considered by the provincial bus service that instead of operating as much of its services between the major cities, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and so on they concentrated their bus fleet to a large extent on servicing the needs of people between the different towns and accelerate the provision of rail between the major cities.  That form of rationalisation of services would need to be considered not just by the subsidiary companies but by the main board of CIE. I take it that in the establishment of the holding company the needs of rationalisation between the different subsidiary companies will be borne in mind as being important in the furuture.</P>
    <P>There are a number of questions I should like to pose at a later stage when we reach Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief because this is an area in which I am not very knowledgeable.  Nonetheless, I am very concerned with the matter under discussion.  Senator Killilea referred to other Members who would follow and who would be more knowledgeable than he.  Although he looked in my direction I tried to avoid his glare to make sure he was not accusing me in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Killilea I welcome the fact that the Bill was introduced in this House.  Since becoming a Member of this House I have seen many important Bills initiated and there are many other which I would like to see in the not too distant future.  I am not sure if I would refer to this Bill as being a very important one but nevertheless in so far as it will help in the area of transport I welcome it.  CIE have come in for criticism over a very long period, some of it sustained, some of it unfair and some of it fair.  There is also the other side to the coin.  In dealing with CIE we all have come in contact <Col N="47" /> with officials and workers who were kind and generous such as conductors who helped out the elderly, those who were feeble and those who had problems.</P>
    <P>A few months ago I spoke to a friend who had travelled by train on a Sunday afternoon excursion to a football match in the south of Ireland.  He sent his 12 year old son to the canteen to buy cigarettes where the official refused to sell them to him saying he was too young and if his father needed cigarettes he should come for them himself.  I would like to commend that worker.  The father of that child was rather proud of the CIE worker who in a busy situation took what might be regarded as an unpopular option. Nevertheless he was concerned enough to refuse to supply this young boy with cigarettes.</P>
    <P>There are many areas with regard to CIE where the same would apply.  In making representations to CIE over the years, in meeting their officials and on the occasions they have come to meet us on the urban district council, they have been civil and helpful.  I would have no complaint in that regard.  I would like to refer to the aspect that does not get publicity, the one which is very important.  I realise that it is much easier to be generous when looking in from the outside.  It is not easy for those involved in long queues and long waits to be as generous.  At a time when people are looking for comfort and are not prepared to wait or be inconvenienced, people with cars who want to drive up to the shop door and park illegally.  In such situations when you are very much involved, it is not possible, perhaps, to be objective. Nevertheless, I did have to avail of public transport for a very long period in my life and I want to emphasise that particular aspect.</P>
    <P>I have not been fortunate enough to have been able to travel abroad on many occasions.  When I was in London, for example, I noticed that traffic moved much smoother due obviously to the restrictions on private cars and good planning along with many other reasons.  At traffic lights delays were for much shorter <Col N="48" /> periods.  I see no reason why the same could not apply equally well in Dublin. We have the practical experience of other countries to fall back on.  The congestion and delays which occur in this city at different times can be attributed to many reasons which I will briefly refer to later. These are some of things I noticed and they are particularly noticeable to an individual who has not been outside the bounds of this country very often.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill the McKinsey report recommended three companies. Here we have four, the holding company and the three subsidiaries.  Instead of eliminating bureaucracy this is going to exaggerate it.  I would have very little grouse against the officials I have dealt with directly in the local authorities and other bodies.  In most cases they were tied down by the rules and regulations. These put a damper on the situation. Dividing up CIE in this way may very well be justified from the point of view of planning and may result in improvement. There is the danger which has been referred to earlier that it could result in bureaucracy.  Every effort should be made to avoid this.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea also referred to the possibility of liquidation of these subsidiaries.  While there is very little likelihood of that happening, the possibility is there. The possibility is also there to sell these companies.  Senator Killilea has gone into that in some detail and I am not going to dwell on it.</P>
    <P>CIE have been regarded as a very poor company in motivating workers.  I am not knowledgeable enough to go into this in detail but it is fair to make that comment. I am wondering will this Bill do anything in that regard.  I note the attempt for greater worker representation.  In the past, trials have been carried out without consulting the workers.  The workers were not even aware that the tests and trials were in progress.  This is unfortunate.  For any company to succeed there must be motivation of the workers so that they have this urge to succeed and enjoy what they are doing.  If this Bill succeeds even to a small degree in this regard, it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> Reference was made to the closing down of a company which manufactured buses and this was unfortunate.  It is over and done with and there is no point in going into it in any detail.  It was unfortunate that we lost this facility and it would take a long time to build it up again.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the further closing down of rail services.  I gather that this is unlikely to happen.  I am glad to note that, because the closing of the railways was unfortunate in many regards. Possibly, it would have been difficult to justify retention of the railways from the point of view of finance alone, but the closures meant that small towns suffered. I am thinking of towns like Oldcastle and Kells which suffered in a way that they cannot easily recover from.  They also suffered in many other ways through the closing down of small schools, the police barracks and small Protestant churches. These have all contributed to denuding the country.  Indeed, at the time some of the railway lines were closed there was talk of converting some of them into roads.  Unfortunately, this did not happen.  In the years since then houses have been built and other buildings have been constructed across these lines.  It would be impossible at this stage to reopen them.  I am glad that there is no rush to close any more of these railways.</P>
    <P>Inchicore has great potential in the work that is being done.  The skills which are there are not being exploited and could very well be exploited outside CIE. It could be done in such a way that it would not interfere with the private sector.  CIE have been opposed to private encroachment.  This is understandable, but those availing of private services would not agree.  Private services have played their part.  It would be wrong that private companies in competition with CIE would get the cream.  They should have to compete fairly.  Nevertheless, there is a part to be played by the private companies, particularly in rural areas. Part routes could possibly be covered by private companies.  I am sure there must be some way that the private companies can play their part as at present they seem to be doing considerable business, <Col N="50" /> whether unfairly or otherwise I am not in a position to say.  I would like to see this aspect developed to some considerable extent because it is very important to set down parameters both for CIE and the private companies.  I am sure that this can and will be done.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the dispute in relation to one-man buses has been resolved.  One individual in charge of a bus has a very difficult and onerous task, particularly when we read about attacks in urban areas and the dangers in recent times. Any man in charge of a bus has a difficult job and it is one which I would not like to have.</P>
    <P>CIE have played an important part with regard to tourism.  Tourism is very important.  I have made representations at different times to CIE with regard to extending the Boyne Valley tours and with regard to other matters in relation to tourism.  I want to say that I have never been disappointed; I have been listened to.  Obviously, the company would not be in a position to accede to all the requests made; but with regard to reasonable requests the officials have gone out of their way to be helpful, particularly in extending the Boyne Valley tour to Kells. I am glad that it has been a success.  I am sure there are other places within that general area which could also be taken in by that tour.</P>
    <P>I note that we will have an amendment in regard to Irish names.  I feel that the Irish name will be sufficient.  I do not see any point or reason for the English equivalent in this country.  If we are ever to get back to the use of the Irish language, Irish names should be used.  In many areas we are losing out.  Instead of using Irish names, housing schemes are called after places mentioned in &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dynasty&rdquo;.  The names of our townlands and place names should be used in Irish only.  I cannot see any problem about it.  There is no difficulty.</P>
    <P>In relation to the motion coming up soon regarding the Committee for the Irish language, I should like to put it on the record that this is an area where we have lost out very much over the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> With regard to place names, it was unfortunate that the decision taken in the early years of the 19th century regarding the Ordnance Survey was to use a mixture of names rather than the authentic Irish name.  Here we are with a Bill in 1986 giving the names in both languages.  I see no reason to use the English language in this regard.  I would recommend that we get a suitable name in the Irish language only and use that.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the Green Paper on Transport Policy which was published in November last year.  I agree that this is a very important document.  It is one which covers all of this area in very great detail and in a much wider sense than we are dealing with under this Bill.  This Bill is restricted. It is in three parts.  Sections 1 to 5 contain provisions of a general kind which we get in all Bills passing through the House. Section 6 to 22 deal with the formation of the three operating subsidiary companies, certain financial matters and other provisions, many of which are standard features of Acts dealing with State-sponsored companies.  Section 23 onwards deal with some additional matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer very briefly to a few of the points raised in that document on transport policy, particularly under urban transport.  It is appropriate and very much in order to refer to them when dealing with this Bill.  The section under urban transport referred to commuting from the suburbs and stated that it tends to be increasingly based on cars, partly from choice and partly because the public transport system fails or is unable to provide a sufficiently attractive alternative. These public transport problems arise from both internal and external factors. Increasing car use and proper services resulting from increased traffic congestion adversely affect the numbers using public transport.  As more people opt to use their cars congestion increases and this reduces the effectiveness of public transport even further.  The failure of the public transport system to provide a flexible, reliable and attractive service <Col N="52" /> can adversely affect patronage levels.  We are in a situation where we have a reaction between one and the other, a type of vicious circle.</P>
    <P>I want to say that in all of this it is the people who matter.  I have made the case many times for development in rural areas for those who want to live there.  I realise it is not easy to make that case.  It must be borne in mind at all times that we are dealing with people.  I spent some years living in the city where in the summer time if people decided to go to the seaside they would queue up for a bus that would never come.  They would queue at the end of a line that would never be taken up in a bus.  It is a problem which you would not have in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper stated that there is no easy solution to urban traffic problems.  It was rather unnecessary and rhetorical to say this, but nevertheless it was important to say it.  Of course, it is a very difficult and complex problem.  The aim of traffic management is to achieve optimum use of the road network through improved signalisation, one-way systems, parking controls etc., with the best possible balance between the private and public transport.  It is necessary to get that balance.</P>
    <P>People have asked in the past whether private cars should be allowed into the centre of Dublin and the question has not been satisfactorily answered.  It is most important that it should be.  I am well aware that people want to drive right up to the shop door and, if public transport could be provided in such a way as to suit these people, I am sure they would avail of it.  That is the important aspect.  When I speak about the rural areas I realise there is a problem with regard to profitability.  In other ancillary areas you could make the point that, where people decide to build in remote rural areas, a car or a second car is needed.  In those situations, apart from providing satisfactory roads and infrastructure, there is the extra cost of this second car which leads to wage claims and many other problems.  I understand that; but at the same time there should be provision for those who want to live outside the urban areas and there <Col N="53" /> should be satisfactory infrastructure including public transport.</P>
    <P>The document on transport policy also referred to the desired move from private to public transport.  For this to be achieved it refers to the measures which would be necessary such as the placing of restraints on the use of private transport, specifically, parking controls generally.  I am not too sure if that could be accepted without question.  It also referred to adjusting the prices for long-stay parking. There is far more involved in this respect than just deciding on parking fines.  At present, with so many people out of work, if that is all that is needed or if that is a considerable part of what is needed, it would simply mean getting more traffic wardens to police the streets to get offenders to pay more.  That is one aspect that I would question.  We will have a greater opportunity to do so when we are dealing with the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  It is one of the areas that will come directly within the ambit of that Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the deficit over the years in the Dublin city service.  It is noticeable in the graph supplied that that devicit rose considerably between 1975 and 1981.  It has decreased and stabilised over the last two years.  I accept the Minister's statement that it is expected that this will decrease further, particularly over the next four years.  The graph also gives us a picture of the millions of people carried by the Dublin city services.  Unfortunately, this has gone down considerably between 1975 and 1981 and it has more or less levelled out over that period.  This is difficult to understand in a situation where we have a growing city.  It is difficult to understand that we even have a growing city.  By and large, the growth of the cities has been due to the increase in employment.  People moved towards the city centres and the urban centres for employment.  At present, employment is not there.  From that point of view also there should be some discouragement of centralisation and some greater incentives given towards decentralisation in this regard.  It is difficult to understand <Col N="54" /> why the numbers have not increased and this is something which is of considerable importance as regards this Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, before any road transport can function satisfactorily we must have a proper network.  In many areas we do not have that at present.  Whether we are talking about rural or urban transport, the actual road work is of the utmost importance.  I have mentioned before on a number of occasions that the roads from north Donegal to Kells and right through Cavan are grade one.  The Kells-Navan road and the Navan-Dublin road is quite satisfactory until one reaches Clonee. From Clonee into Dublin we have a bottleneck.  I understand that this road will be improved in the coming year.  That is the intention and I hope it materialises. Sometimes, and indeed more often that not, there is a delay for one reason or another.  We seldom see things achieved before their time.  In this regard the sensible thing to do in the early days would be to provide a proper infrastructure and roadwork around the city.</P>
    <P>Here we have a situation where people coming to work in the morning find themselves behind a JCB or some slow moving traffic and because of the narrow road there is a bottleneck.  For the most part there is a path only on one side.  This causes a hold up of traffic.  No matter what Bills are brought into this House and no matter what improvements are made with regard to CIE if we do not have roads wide enough, properly aligned, with a proper surface and without potholes, they will not be of any use.  I am glad this road is being repaired.  I am not bringing it up because I am involved. I bring it up in the general sense that it is the worst road into the city.  No matter what Bill is brought into the House, with that kind of set up I am sure we would have still further crisis in CIE.</P>
    <P>What can a bus driver do if he gets into a situation where he cannot make time and where people are waiting in queues for much longer periods?  It is necessary to start at the beginning.  CIE should be given the proper opportunity to make a success of public transport.  They should <Col N="55" /> be given the facilities and above all the finances to make this viable before we start to be critical of them and to make them the scape-goat for problems for which they should not be responsible.  If all these things are taken into consideration in so far as this Bill is concerned, I welcome it.  Planning is necessary in relation to the nitty gritty of public transport.  When we are dealing with the Dublin Transport Authority we will be able to go into it in much greater depth than at present.  It contains aspects of far greater detail which we do not have in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the urban aspect. I want to make it clear that I am also equally concerned with the rural areas. While the city people may have to wait-for very long periods, in most cases the bus arrives at some stage.  In the more rural areas there are people who are unable to use public transport because it is not there.  In this regard some attempt should be made to provide mini-buses for areas where the roads are too narrow or where the numbers involved are too few. If this is done and if some genuine attempt is made to deal with all the problems that we have in this area, success will come and we will have more people availing of public transport.  In so far as this Bill succeeds in an improvement in transport, I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome this Transport (Re-organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Bill.  I want to compliment the Minister and the Government or bringing it through.  I do not like to wish things a speedy passage through the House but it should be passed expeditiously after a good and thorough examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE is one of the large semi-State companies that comes in for much flak.  I suppose they earn most of it but that is too simplistic because it is a powerful organisation.  It employs tremendous people, people with great heart and great expertise, craftsmen and other people, who give a really good service.  In parts of the organisation where the personnel <Col N="56" /> are very exposed to the travelling public. I suppose there are points which grate on some people's nerves.  We cannot have an altogether perfect service in any sphere. That is why I am very happy that the Minister is tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea to try to unscramble the egg that was nicely scrambled in the 1932 Act and in subsequent Acts.  Back 30 or 40 years ago big was beautiful and I suppose it still is.  The independent rail companies, the canal companies, the bus companies and the tram companies were all eventually amalgamated into a monopoly.  I do not know if there was competition within the various sectors of CIE. If there had been greater competition between the various in-house services it might have been much better.  I remember back in the forties, in the lean times, when we used to draw beet to the railway station in Abbeyleix, when the Waterford train would pass down, the old porters, if the train was a few minutes late or early, would accuse their watches of being slow.  They believed that the train had to be on time.  It always was on time and they would change their watches accordingly.  If the train was at 5.30 p.m. and their watch was 5.31 p.m. they would change the watch because they would not accept that the train could possibly be late.  Over the years CIE, and I suppose many other companies, lost that great <i>esprit de corps</i> that sets it out.  I do not think the transport service will make a great profit or give a fantastic service until that <i>esprit de corps</i> returns to the country and to the service.</P>
    <P>I would like very briefly to make one or two comments on the service.  I do not want to be critical of CIE.  I recognise the great work that they do and the difficulties that they have.  Here in Dublin the CIE bus service would need, somewhere near O'Connell Bridge, a square like the Piazza Silvestro in Rome where one can, by walking 40 or 50 metres in any direction, have 30 or 40 different bus services without having to traipse the full length of the quays or half the length of O'Connell Street to try to find which bus one needs.</P>
    <P>Transport which accounts for 25 or 27 <Col N="57" /> per cent of GNP, is a completely underrated industry.  When the powers that be in successive Governments handed over the monopoly situation to what could be described by some as an indifferent outfit, CIE lost a lot of their imagination.  At one stage they just closed down rail lines, cut off branch lines or closed down services.  It would be a good idea now if CIE would identify their loss making services and offer those loss making routes to the private sector and see what they would do.  I suppose it is not as simple as that. If we take a small private operator with a 45-seater coach and two or three mini-buses, his overheads cannot be compared with the overheads that a big semi-State organisation like CIE would have to spread over any particular route.  At this stage CIE should identify the loss-makers and allocate them out.</P>
    <P>No matter what CIE do they are not able to give a comprehensive service. There is an excellent express bus service going across the country, but they only stop in the towns and the large villages. That means that the people who live in between or who do not live near the approved bus stops have to rely on the private bus operator who offers the same journey, whether it is from the provincial towns to Dublin or wherever, for about half the price or less.  The one criticism I have &mdash; and I can only look at the services as far as my own constituency is concerned &mdash; is that the middle management, the people who make the decisions, do not see what the travelling public want. They should be pandering to the public. they should not be just trying to see what the public require and what the public are going to use, they should be tailor-making a service to meet the local demand.  If the demand is not there they should create it.  They have been spoiled by successive Governments who footed the bill and made up for deficiencies. Personnel in CIE are as good as you will find in any other part of the public sector. They should be given greater flexibility and greater autonomy to try to utilise the facilities they have and to provide the public with a service.</P>
    <P>I hope that the present situation, where <Col N="58" /> there is a link between the road services and the rail services, will continue.  Perhaps on some of the routes that CIE now find less profitable they might be able to improve that situation by introducing smaller or less expensive coaches.  There should not be a duplication of services. They should endeavour to create the infrastructure that would meet the needs and the facilities of the towns and the areas they are servicing.</P>
    <P>There must be a lot of ambiguity about the subsidy that the Department of Social Welfare pay to CIE in respect of free travel.  I do not know what that amounts to and I do not know how it is calculated, but it should be clearly indentified.  I accept that there are people in this country, especially retired pensioners, who should be encouraged to travel and get around and keep an interest in life.  I accept that they should not be asked to pay the economic rate of travelling.  I do not subscribe to the idea that a monopoly organisation should get a subsidy irrespective of whether they are giving a service to the people at whose behest they are supposed to be providing a service. There are hundreds of thousands of pensioners here who do not have any occasion to use the free travel service. The passengers should be subsidised and not the company.  I do not know how that can be done but I am sure there must be some means of devising it.</P>
    <P>The rail services have been updated to a great extent.  In the main the inter-city service is very good.  There is also a lot of old rolling stock.  The last time I was in Paris I was getting on the Metro and there was a brass plate on the door step with the date 1914.  It was still going strong.  Just by virtue of the fact that the coaches are old there is no reason to believe that they cannot be comfortable. There is certainly no excuse for them not being clean.  With the continuous railroads, where there is not a bang every 50 or 60 feet, the older coaches could clang on for ever.  I hope the new company that will have responsibility for the rail services will endeavour to expand the present mileage of railroad rather than curtail it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> CIE should seriously look at the possibility of having a DART link brought to Heuston station.  One can travel to Dublin very fast on the mainline train services and then, depending on the time of day, can spend a long time getting across the city.  I do not see why that link between Heuston and Connolly stations cannot be made by the DART service so that people wanting to go to Dún Laoghaire or to the north side of the city would be able to get there or to a station quite near it.  That would be a service that would be used.  The only problem with Dublin at present is that one cannot get through it.  I understand there is a link between those two important stations which should be used.  If CIE would use the infrastructures they have and put them at the disposal of the public, the public would be happy to pay for them.  I hope that the new companies will exploit every possible avenue to ensure that every bit of infrastructure that is there will be maintained and put to good use.</P>
    <P>From a policy point of view, because transport is such an important factor in the lives of all our people it should certainly be upgraded.  I hope the Minister will be able to impress on his colleagues in Government the necessity for setting up these three new companies on a very sound financial footing.  I do not think that the cost of setting them up or establishing the necessary modern infrastructures should be cut back in any way.  We are giving a new lease of life to transportation not only in the city but in the country as a whole.  The people who take on the responsibility to do this should look at the whole problem to find the best possible way of endowing future generations with a workable system and a system that serves the people.</P>
    <P>In a press release which I received from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions they give a rather guarded welcome to this proposed legislation.  They conclude by saying:</P>
    <P>The Unions think the proposed legislation should be amended in consultation with all parties.  Suitably amended, <Col N="60" /> this legislation would help in improving the services provided by the National Transport Company.</P>
    <P>While they finish their press release very well, they have not been very complimentary to the idea of the Bill earlier on.  The message in this press statement of 14 March 1986 underlines the attitude of the CIE group of unions to their work in CIE.  The point they miss is that the whole idea of having a semi-State transport organisation is that the organisation must be there to service the travel interests of the people.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that everything the Government proposes, such as CIE, should be looked at from the point of view of creating jobs.  I knew jobs are very important, but we must be realistic. We want a transport system which will transport people to their place of work or elsewhere.  It should not be a social service for employing people.  I respect the people who do an excellent job in CIE and in every walk of life.  However, I do not agree that the very fact of a person having a job must be secondary to the purpose of the service being provided.</P>
    <P>I hope that the input the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will make to the successful launching and establishment of these three new transportation companies will be positive.  I hope that they will put their best people on the board as worker-directors to ensure the easy, smooth and efficient running of the company.  The people are entitled to this.  I wish the Minister success with the Bill.  There are many points in it that we can address ourselves to on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that there can be a greater utilisation of the private sector in the reorganisation of the company. The semi-State interests will still have almost a monopoly.  They will certainly be the biggest contributors to the entire service.  I hope that it will be Government policy to encourage the private sector to move in.  There should be a new system of licensing introduced in the transportation service, not as a means of raising taxation but as a way of ensuring that there will be a service on particular routes for the <Col N="61" /> people.  The Government and the Minister responsible will be in a position to retain an input, a control and a guiding influence on it so that we will have an effective and successful service in this regard.</P>
    <P>One of our big problems as an exporting nation is our remoteness from the lucrative markets in Central Europe.  I hope that the Minister in his policy on transportation will press at European level to expedite the establishment of a European transport policy that will recognise our remoteness on the western periphery of the European Community. The export of our goods to European markets should reflect some kind of transportation subsidy, not just to featherbed the people who are in the industry, but to make our exporters more competitive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to sound a cautious warning note at this stage of the debate. Senator McDonald prompted me into making this comment when he said that he hoped for a speedy passage of this legislation.  I refer to the Minister's opening speech in which he stated that the Bill was an historical one.  It is historical legislation and the whole concept of it is of major consequence.  It will need the fullest discussion by this House, by the Minister and by various interests, and not alone the interests of the workers involved in CIE.  If we are to have a successful set of companies, whether we settle for two or three, it is important that the people who will be involved in the running of them in the future will have every opportunity by way of discussions with us in the formulation of proper legislation which will reflect their interests, expertise and views on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party in particular have had the longest possible link with the transport system and with those who are engaged in it, whether it is the bus service or the rail service.  It is because of this extremely long link with the workers in the transport authority that our party have taken it upon themselves from the publication of the plan <i>Building on Reality</i> which addressed itself to the problems in CIE, to set up a specialised committee <Col N="62" /> with a lot of expertise, much of which might be already available to the Minister and his officials.  It is available to us as a political party.</P>
    <P>Because of this and the submission they have made and the reservations that have been expressed about this legislation, it will need a lot of debate and discussion. It will need a lot of reassurances from the Minister in his reply to the Second Stage debate and indeed every section on Committee Stage.  I am suggesting, in fairness to the legislation and to the Minister who is bringing it forward, that it will be a long debate.  I hope that at the end of the day, when we have completed our deliberations, the end result by way of legislation will be something that can be workable and that can address the worries and concerns of those who are working in CIE at present.</P>
    <P>When we have a strike in CIE, whether it is official or unofficial, everybody screams about how difficult it is to work with that company and the problems that are created by it.  All of us forget the magnificent service that this organisation has given to us down through the years from the time of the division of the railways into the regions until it became the responsibility of Córas Iompair Éireann. There is no better public transport authority in any part of the world, given the financial restrictions that were always on them.  The kind of service that they have given has been second to none.  At times we are quick to criticise and we are very slow to give credit where credit is due.</P>

      <P>For the matter under Standing Order 29, as raised by Senator Brendan Ryan, the time limit is an hour and a half.  May I suggest that the Minister would be allowed 20 minutes to reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter which concerns the immediate need for the Government to take whatever steps are possible by diplomatic means and through the United Nations to allay the threat to world peace resulting from the American bombing of Libya.</P>
      <P>The first thing that needs to be made perfectly clear on this issue is that terrorism in all its forms is abhorrent.  Terrorism cannot be justified by either previous experience or anticipated future experience.  All of us in this House have had all too frequent occasion to denounce atrocities within this island.  I still remember with some terror the first of the series of bombings in Dublin and the one which took place outside Liberty Hall.  I had the great good fortune to be ten minutes earlier than I would usually be in walking past Liberty Hall that night.  If I had not been ten minutes earlier I would not be here tonight because I would have been dispatched, as was the intent of those who planted that bomb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us therefore is in any position to do other than condemn all forms of terrorism.  This can often be unprofitable for us politically in the short term and present difficulties for many of us in various activities we are involved in.  Thus the anger of the United States' administration in the face of various acts of terrorism against innocent citizens of the United States is altogether understandable.  Their anger is understandable and the frustration of a major power in the <Col N="64" /> face of terrorism is equally understandable.  Let it be said, too, that the anger of the Catholic population of Northern Ireland in the face of injustice, and indeed in the face of murder and atrocity on many occasions, is also understandable.  The anger of the black South Africans in the face of appalling repression and murder and various other forms of destruction is understandable.  In particular also the anger of the Palestinian people is understandable.</P>
    <P>But that does not justify or create a moral climate which justifies acts of terrorism on behalf of any of those three groups.  Both our own Government and the Government of the United States and all the Governments of the European Community have made this clear again and again.  My position has always been that I could not justify to my own conscience the use of force to achieve any objective, however desirable.  That has been my position and continues to be my position.</P>
    <P>It is therefore in the light of the distinction between justifiable anger and actions taken in the light of justifiable anger that we should discuss the recent activity in Libya.  What actually happened in Libya was, in my view, the use of violence to achieve a purpose which is more appropriately achieved by political means.  It was a use of violence, in my view, to achieve a political objective.  It was a use of violence, in my view, far more designed to satisfy US public opinion than to achieve the objective which it ostensibly set out to achieve.  What happened in Libya has been defined as self-defence. I would say that the whole world at this stage knows Article 51 of the United Nations Charter off by heart.  It does need to be said that in all the coverage on both British television channels and, given that the British Government did accept the legality of the United States action, no international lawyer could be found by either British television channels who was prepared to say they believed that what the United States did was justifiable in the light of the Charter of the United Nations. I heard almost all of the coverage on both channels last <Col N="65" /> night on BBC and ITV and I neither saw nor heard any international lawyer who was prepared to justify in legal terms what has happened.</P>
    <P>Let is be clear, if what was done was unlawful then it deserves to be condemned, however understandable the anger of those who carried it out.  Why was the United Nations Security Council not invoked before this action was taken? Why was the evidence that was available not brought before the United Nations Security Council?  I must say that my suspicion is because a good bloody nose for an obscure enemy far away is a good way of gaining political popularity at home, particularly when you do not have any messy consequences to be seen at home.  The action of the United States television network in declining to broadcast fully pictures of the victims of the US bombings because they were too gruesome for their viewers contributed quite generously to creating that impression.</P>
    <P>We are now all to be threatened by the actions of the United States Government.  We are not threatened any more by Arab terrorism, by IRA terrorism; we are threatened by the implicit legalisation of the use of force by big powers who are irritated by the activities of small powers, the justification that at some future date an activity which happened today can be dealt with in the name of self-defence by the use of superior force.  We have to conclude that in justifying the disproportionate use of savage violence in Libya the President of the United States has engaged himself in the activity of international terrorism because he has justified the use of force to achieve an objective that in my view could have been achieved by other means.</P>
    <P>It is in that light that I think our Government should have taken action. Our Government ought to have taken action first of all by addressing the moral issue involved, not by understanding the feelings, the provocation or the frustration but by addressing themselves clearly and unequivocally to the moral question involved &mdash; was it right or was it wrong? If the Government want to say that it was <Col N="66" /> right because they understand, then let it be said.  It is bad and it is upsetting that an action of violence on this scale has not evoked or elicited from the Government a response which clearly underlines their view on the morality of what was done. Our Government have often and quite rightly denounced acts of violence before.  It denounced the invasion of Afghanistan quite rightly; it denounced activities of violence in Central America quite rightly.  It refrained in this case from making its own position clear as to whether it believes what was done was right or was wrong.  It seems to me a choice ought to have been made and in the interestes of Irish standards of international morality that should have been made clear.</P>
    <P>What has been lost in a confused attempt to avoid offence to the United States administration has been our right to take a moral position on international issues.  We are now in a position of being part of international compromises where murder is no longer murder when it is done in the name of a great power.  When children are murdered because of the deliberate decision to bomb targets that are close to where large numbers of people live, that is murder.  It is murder in law, not an accident.  If somebody recklessly uses force in a way which threatens the life of innocent people, irrespective of the motive involved, the people who have been killed have been murdered. Let it be made perfectly clear that irrespective of what the Libyans did &mdash; and I am prepared to believe that many of the things they are accused of they did do &mdash; it does no justify retalatory murder.  That is a recipe for barbarism.  That is a recipe for international barbarism to replace international law.  Let it be said that if you begin to &ldquo;understand&rdquo; the use of force as a reply to violence then all sorts of activities, including in some cases the activities of the Provisional IRA, can be justified.</P>
    <P>Violence is wrong.  The circumstances cannot be used to excuse that violence and should not be used to excuse that violence.  I support the struggle for liberation in Southern Africa.  I do not condone <Col N="67" /> the use of violence.  I support the struggle in Central America. I do not condone the use of violence in the struggle in Central America.  I do not approve of violence. It has been counterproductive.  Equally, I do not condone the use of violence by the United States administration to achieve objectives of a political nature which in my view will not be achieved and which will simply add to the President's stature in the United States.  I regret the fact that somebody who has associated himself proudly with the terrorists who are attacking the brave people of Nicaragua can suddenly draw himself up to his full moral stature and denounce terrorism elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I regret the fact that we seem in this country to have lost, unfortunately, the capacity to make independent moral decisions about major international issues.  It would be particularly regrettable if issues connected with American aid for this country under the Anglo-Irish Agreement were to cloud our consciences and our capacity to make a choice because this sort of activity, this sort of international terrorism by a superpower is precisely what can lead us down the slippery slope to international nuclear conflagration.  It is only the exercise of moral choice and the exercise of moral authority by countries like ourselves that can deter large nations from such activities.</P>
    <P>We have now got an opportunity to make up for the opportunities we have lost up to now.  I would invite the Minister to begin to take whatever diplomatic actions are possible and to act through the United Nations to say, first of all, that we do not believe that this action was justified, that we do not believe that this action was right.  He can use whatever form of words he then wishes as long as he is prepared to say unequivocally that what was done in the name of the United States in Libya was morally wrong and now in fact threatens the security of all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity of outlining the Labour <Col N="68" /> Party's position in relation to the recent events that have taken place in Libya and also to take advantage of the opportunity, which I am glad we have been afforded, to address the questions that have arisen. I very much agree with the previous speaker that the recent events constitute a great threat to the normal procedures of international law and diplomacy.  I might say in that regard that the enormous dangers that are now created by recent events are ones that are not confined only to Libya.  They extend to Central America. In that regard I want to be very specific and say that some of the difficulties which preceded the recent bombing by the United States planes of Tripoli was a dispute concerning jurisdiction in the Gulf of Sirte.  An offer had been made that that matter could have been considered by the International Court of Justice.</P>
      <P>The view of the United States foreign policy advisers that has been offered to their President has been one of rejecting the authority of the International Court of Justice.  In relation to the mining of Nicaragua's ports where the court heard a case &mdash; and this is something that can be confirmed when the President of the Court visits Ireland this week &mdash; in that case equally the United States Government denied there was jurisdiction in the International Court of Justice to hear the case.  Indeed &mdash; and I want to be very specific about this &mdash; Jean Kilpatrick, before her departure from the major role which she held in the United States in relation to foreign policy in respect of this issue had taken to the habit of referring to the International Court of Justice as the United Nations Court of Justice.  In many ways it is seeking to link it with what is regarded as the less than wholehearted support that the United Nations enjoyed in the United States.  It was an attempt to denigrate the work of the court.  What we are now witnessing is the full, horrific effect of the events that have taken place this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to ignore an international court such as the International Court of justice is really the equivalent to removing, brick by brick, what stands in the way <Col N="69" /> of a reliance on violence and a reliance on force.  International law and international diplomacy are built on the concept of reason and it is informed usually by some concept of morality.  There is neither morality nor reason in the events that we have witnessed this week.  I cannot see how international codes of behaviour can stand intact if the adherence to them is conditional on the perceived threat to itself, of a very large superpower.  Of course, the United States has every right to be concerned about terrorism.  As Senator Ryan has said, all of us are concerned about terrorism.  But is it a response to terrorism to take the actions of individuals and groups and extend them on to an entire country and, if necessary, direct your response at targets that include civilian targets?  Is that not in itself an act of gross state terrorism in response to terrorism itself?</P>
    <P>Those of us who are believers in democratic socialism have always opposed terrorism for the very simple reason that the reactions that it has encouraged have often been ones of greater repression and oppression.  We have seen it as not serving the cause of equality or of liberation or of any of the values of socialism.  I refer to democratic socialism.  For that reason the Socialist International has again and again condemned terrorism. What is at stake in this case is that an institution had been rejected some time ago in relation to any of the preliminary difficulties.  It has been decided that by sheer force of might by arms, one will assert what is presumed to be a response to the threat to one's citizens nationally and internationally.  A mockery has been made of the United Nations Charter.  It is appropriate that the Minister is here with us this evening because we must remember that the United Nations Charter is not the property of the Soviet Union or of the United States but the property of all of the signatories of that Charter.  It has been a very significant achievement that stands between them and the barbarism of the naked exercise of power.</P>
    <P>When one reads Article 51 of the United Nations Charter there is no way <Col N="70" /> that it can be construed as justifying the actions of a military kind such as have taken place.  It is ridiculous to suggest that one can allow the occasional act of revenge in relation to, say, an act of murder on the basis that the relatives of the dead person had been offended and they are entitled to see something of an example.  It is the confusion of revenge with retribution.  It is the confusion of both with deterrents.  Neither revenge, retribution nor deterrents are accommodated in the concept of self-defence which is included in Article 51.  In the spirit of Article 51 the further development of that was that force would not be used as a response by a party that felt that it had action directed against it.  It is very offensive in many ways to find that the attitude of the British Government and of the United States Government is effectively one of trying to write their own meaning of words into the very phrases of the United Nations Charter itself.</P>
    <P>It is illogical to suggest that by the direction of large scale, indiscriminate strikes against a country one can deal with individuals in that country or individual groups. It is very interesting that West Germany did not ask for this action after the events that had taken place in a place of entertainment within its own jurisdiction.  In that regard the statements from the West German Government have been ones which suggested that a response other than a military one would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>I know there are many others who want to speak, but I want to warn against what I think is a construction of the events that perhaps the consequences justify the action that was taken.  It is too early yet to speak of the consequences.  Equally, I know no place in the civilised code of foreign policy of any country in the world that justifies actions on the basis of consequences.  That is a very primitive pre-legal type of thinking and it is before reason and it does not include reason itself.  I feel that around Colonel Gadaffi there has been constructed an immense demonology.  I do not intend to delay the House but in today's <i>Irish Independent,</i><Col N="71" /> page 10, Richard Lay, who is usually resident in the United States and files his comment on Richard Lay's America but who is obviously not giving the location from which he is writing in today's paper, writes &mdash; and we can learn a great deal from the way he writes:</P>
    <P>As he sits in his desert tent Ghadaffi is fired by a vision of a different world &mdash; this would be one great Islamic state which would combine all that is best in Arab civilisation...</P>
    <P>He also says:</P>
    <P>The other key to Gadaffi's personality is his family background.  He has indeed come a long way since his birth in a goat skin tent in the Libyan desert.</P>
    <P>Later, he continues:</P>
    <P>Ghadaffi has been married for the past 16 years and has six sons and one daughter who all share his capacity for a relatively frugal lifestyle.</P>
    <P>He goes on to paint a picture of a backward, third world country led by a madman that is of little consequence and that therefore on this kind of ethnocentric cultural imperialism you can mock a people and can direct your anger against an entire nation on the basis of a caricature of its leader.</P>
    <P>I am not defending Colonel Gadaffi. There are many things about his fundamentalism which I would reject and which the party of which I am a member could not accept.  At the same time one cannot move from a gross distortion of a character to justify the actions that have taken place.  I am not being naive.  Yes, there have been actions of terrorism and yes, some of them have been alleged as having their source in Libya.  I think we are entitled to see the evidence for this. If we do not ask for that evidence, by that logic, after the brutal murder of the English Ambassador to Ireland one could have justified the bombing of Dublin.  For example, if the Sandinistas had enough air power &mdash; which they have not &mdash; one could justify the bombing of Miami. The fact is that one cannot operate on a logic <Col N="72" /> like this unless there is the capacity to do so and the moral will to do so.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to say and to repeat something which I feel is necessary for me to repeat, that these comments I am making by way of criticism are directed against the Reagan administration's foreign policy.  They are not anti-United States because there are many people in the United States who disapprove of the actions which have taken place in their name.  I regret that it has been so often necessary for me to draw that distinction for people who want to confuse what is our criticism and condemnation of actions of an administration such as the Reagan administration with condemnation of the United States people themselves.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on this note.  I remember very well when President Reagan was visiting this country.  I had read his language at that time and the language of the people who advised him on foreign policy.  I read it again only three days ago.  George Shultz had this to say.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Nicaragua is a cancer that has to be removed.</P>
    <P>That is the language of the people who are accusing Colonel Gadaffi of being a madman and of those who say that the fundamental Islamic statements of Gadaffi something that are incomprehensible to the Western mind.  The Western world is led by somebody who refers to a neighbouring country that has a sovereign independence as &ldquo;a cancer&rdquo;.  That is what we have to live with.</P>
    <P>When President Reagan visited this country &mdash; my opposition to his foreign policies, I regret to say since that time have deepened &mdash; I spoke in the name of the graduates of the National University of Ireland, whom I represent in this House.  I said that I felt it was a mockery of law itself to confer a doctorate of laws on somebody whose foreign policy views were ones of the rejection of the international fora of law, such as the International Court and the United Nations agencies, the undermining of UNESCO and so forth.  I repeat it now.  I feel that <Col N="73" /> these actions have brought further shame on all of those within the university system who lent themselves to that process of conferring a doctorate of laws on somebody who has presided over these actions in the last few weeks.</P>
    <P>What we have seen is an appalling departure from all the civilised norms of international conflict resolution.  Conflict resolution has an old history in international diplomacy and in international law.  Around it, after the horror of World War II, were carefully constructed codes of conflict resolution.  Within them there were developed certain codes of human rights.  The taking together of individual incidents and the appalling consequences of terrorism, when they constitute the justification of the removal of a defence between barbarism and people &mdash; which the international codes are &mdash; is a retrograde step for humanity.</P>
    <P>I equally think &mdash; and I say this as my last point because the mover of the resolution made reference to it &mdash; that there is a problem in all of this.  It is the one that I emphasise: is there any issue which is of no concern to a small country like ourselves?  I read quotations about Libya.  Those remarks have been written about Ireland by people who were not friends of Ireland in our past history.  The fact of the matter is that in regard to all countries who joined the United Nations in the sixties, the countries who developed human rights codes after World War II, the relationship under the United Nations Charter is a relationship between equals; and what people have as equal is their commitment to the morality of interntional conflict resolution.  When that is suspended by cynicism, by lies and by deceit you are back then to a relationship of the powerful.  That is the atmosphere in foreign policy at the present time, when we see a naked confrontation between two dominant powers, and we are asked to accept a theory of spheres of influence.  It is absolutely important in that respect that Ireland, as one of those equals under the Charter, take an independent position in trying to make the case for the morality of <Col N="74" /> international conflict resolution through the accepted procedures, and no consideration of interest.</P>
    <P>One of the editorials in the papers this morning said that Ireland has been treated generously by the power involved &mdash; the United States.  No consideration must temper the moral demands of a country to speak out when events like these take place.  I will give an example in domestic law.  It is as if some very cruel person perpetrated some appalling actions in different places and you said: &ldquo;I will understand if the people take the law into their own hands and proceed to eliminate the perpetrator of the crimes&rdquo;. We would regard it as suspending what we had evolved by way of our legal procedures.  In the international sphere that is exactly what has taken place.  Friends of the United States people are required, I believe, to speak out clearly and unequivocally in condemnation of what has taken place this week and which has resulted in a cruel and uncaring loss of civilian life.  In the next few days and weeks it will probably be justified by some other consequences, that it has served to dissolve the fear of the major power that was involved.  We have a simple choice: to live life internationally according to the dictates of what will eliminate the fears of the super powers, or to live life according to the tenets of international diplomacy and the courts of justice that have been carefully evolved. I urge the Minister to make a strong statement in defence of these fundamental principles on behalf of the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this motion.  I believe the actions taken by the US in the last few days represented a threat to world peace.  I believe the Government should take such steps as it can to allay this threat and to calm down a very serious situation indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little doubt that Libya has been concerned in terrorist activities in recent times.  I understand the anger of the US that certain citizens have been killed as a result of actions which they <Col N="75" /> consider were either taken by or encouraged by the Libyan Government, but we must try to put that in perspective.  Libya is not the only country in that part of the world or in any part of the world that is taking part in terrorist activities of one kind or another.  The very word &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; is open to interpretation: an act may be a terrorist act when looked at from one view while from another point of view it may be perfectly justified.  I do not want to get involved in that for the moment. I agree that Libya has been guilty of terrorist activities and that the United States Government have considerable justification for feeling angered and annoyed by some of the actions which they attribute to Libya.  But certainly Libya is not the only country and cannot be isolated in that way.  The US seems to have a kind of fixation about Libya and attributes to Libya every terrorist act at present.  It is interesting to see the comment by Chancellor Kohl when he read that the US is quite convinced, quite certain that what happened in the discotheque in Germany recently was perpetrated by Libya.  He said it was surprising that the US did not put these facts before Germany in whose territory they occurred.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Member of this House deplores terrorism and is anxious that every measure possible should be taken to prevent terrorist acts and to eliminate them as far as possible.  But the action by the US has been condemned by every country in Europe, with the exception of the UK, and even in the UK a very strong body of opinion has condemned it in spite of the action of the Government there.  In the papers today the word that was used in describing the reaction in countries throughout Europe again and again was &ldquo;dismay&rdquo;&mdash; dismay that the US, whom most people in Europe regard as a friendly nation, should have used methods which are clearly contrary to international law and to the Charter of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Of course, the suggestion that the US was justified in doing this in self-defence <Col N="76" /> simply cannot be accepted as being anything like a fair interpretation of the UN Charter.  There was dismay, not only because the US did something which was contrary to the Charter of the United Nations, but did something which, even if legally permissible, far from solving the problem will only make matters very much worse, will only escalate the violence and encourage further violence in retaliation.  So, even if it was permissible, it is something which is reprehensible and unfortunate because it will merely make matters worse.  The fact is that one cannot fight terrorism by using terrorist activities or methods.  The bombing of a city and the indiscriminate bombing and killing of civilians in a city can scarcely be described as anything but a terrorist act.</P>
    <P>The assumption that if a country does something which you consider reprehensible that that entitles you to take any military action you think appropriate is a very frightening one indeed in this nuclear age.  President Regan said in relation to what he did in Libya &ldquo;We did what we had to do&rdquo;.  The way in which that was said, the kind of assumption that once you made the judgment that a certain thing had to be done then that, in a sense, had to be the right thing, is rather frightening.  One cannot but be apprehensive as to how far this approach by the United States will be carried.  It is more than likely that the USSR will continue to do things that the United States considers reprehensible.  How near are we to the day when the USSR does something which the US considers is going too far and President Regan will tell us he did what had to be done?  I am sure we will not be around to know the full details of what had to be done.</P>
    <P>Like everyone else in Europe I am astonished and dismayed that a country for which I have such affection and admiration should do something of this kind.  I know we in this country have affection and admiration for the United States.  It is quite true that we have close ties with them and that we should have and do have a great deal of gratitude to them for the ways in which they have helped us in the past.  On the other hand, <Col N="77" /> that cannot blind us to the facts of what has happened and to the lack of morality of what has happened.  I believe that what they did was entirely unjustified and entirely misguided.  We must speak out, as almost every country in Europe and throughout the world is speaking out at the present time.  Not only do we owe it to ourselves because of the threat to world peace, but we owe it to the United States because we do regard them as a friend.  I would hope that the world reaction and in a small way the reaction in this country would have some effect on the United States and would help to deter them from taking similar action if a similar situation arises in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commence by drawing attention to the sharp contrast there was between how the Garda Síochána dealt with the kidnapping of Mrs. Jennifer Guinness and how President Reagan dealt with alleged acts of terrorism by Colonel Gadaffi.  I would like to offer sympathy first and foremost in respect of the children of Colonel Gadaffi who were both killed and injured in this outrage and secondly to those other Libyans who were similarly affected and thirdly to Fernando Ribas-Dominicci and Paul Lorence, the two United States pilots who were lost in the attack and whose people will grieve them no less than those who mourn their relatives and dear ones in Libya today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan mentioned the word &ldquo;dismay&rdquo; in his contribution.  He was very fair in talking about the dismay which friends of the United States felt in relation to what happened yesterday. However, one would not be so quite dismayed when one considers the record of the person who ordered this attack.  One of the most appalling aspects was to hear President Reagan go on record on the international media and quote such an eminent authority as the great Irishman, Edmund Burke, on the suggestion that all that bad men need to succeed is that good men should remain silent.  The implication was that this was an act of a good man.  I do not believe that violence, and particularly premeditated violence, <Col N="78" /> can be the act of a good man and certainly not of a good man in a good state of mind.  He also said that this strike had won only a single battle in the &ldquo;world war&rdquo; against terrorism.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the whole thrust of Senator Michael D. Higgins's address. If unilateral action is to be taken like this and if those who have the most power are most likely to get away with it, we will indeed have a world war on our hands before we know it.  It is because the United States is such a strong nation that the little nations of the world, who feel so dearly for their freedom often so hardly won, should make such representations as they can to show the big nations that we will have no truck with this and that if necessary we will form our own organisation of non-aligned and neutral peoples, a United Nations, if you like, of the non-aligned peoples of the world, to bring those who have this terrible <i>quantum</i> of power to their senses before they bring us all to destruction.</P>
    <P>It would be worth considering the effect of capitalist penetration with its virus of consumerism on the Third World countries before we become too morally virtuous about how we are going to deal with international terrorism.  We are all concerned about terrorism, no one more so than someone who lives in Northern Ireland and particularly at this time.  But if the British Government had done a Ronald Reagan on Northern Ireland in response to terrorism Northern Ireland would not exist today; it would be flattened.  I am quite certain there have been far more acts of terrorism in Northern Ireland, from many parties, than have been perpetrated by Colonel Gadaffi.  If this is to be the way in which we cope with such, then indeed there is little hope.</P>
    <P>However, out of this some good may come.  It may help us to clarify our ideas on violence, collective violence, international violence and personal violence. It may help us to clarify our perception of the effects of over-centralisation of power and ask questions about what we are going to do in the future to decentralise power.  Above all else it will ask us <Col N="79" /> to look at the value of international law and ask us to pose a question to the United States: since when has a so-called peace-loving nation been able to exercise such lethal sentence without first exposing the evidence, then having a reasonable trial and using the agencies which are available and which Senator Higgins has already mentioned?</P>
    <P>Above all else, it must ask us to question the way in which the United States is evolving.  Most Members of this House have probably had relatives, either in the past or recently, emigrate to the United States of America and most of us have great friendship with the United States. One would have thought that the 600,000 who died in the American Civil War would have been enough to teach a lesson about violence.  America entered the First World War reluctantly, the Second World War belatedly.  The United Nations Charter was evolved after that war.  A Declaration of Human Rights was signed by the United States of America.</P>
    <P>There was great hope in the forties that we were moving into a period in which the type of overreaction which we have witnessed in the last 24 hours would be a thing of the past.  It is up to our Government, therefore, to remind the United States of America of its international obligations as a leader, and also as the most powerful nation in the world, so that it can provide hope for mankind. Last year there was hope for détente between the USA and the USSR, hope that we might gradually de-escalate violence rather than run the risk of more of it.  This is undeclared war, and let there be no doubt about it.  If we insist that the police in Northern Ireland be accountable to national law, we must also insist that powerful nations like the United States be accountable to international law.  The USA by this action has abrogated its right for the time being to be thought of as a peacemaker.  It is time for us all to look at the accretion of power centrally.</P>

      <P>I will conclude.  I was waiting for a prod from my fellow Senator here.  No pun intended.  I would just like to make one proposal.  This, more than anything else, convinces me that Ireland must remain neutral, must evolve a philosophy of positive neutrality, must join with the non-aligned and other neutral nations of the world to create a great network of peacemaking, positively neutral people throughout the world.  We have now learned our lesson.  We do not need nor do we want nor should we be under obligation to military alliances of any sort.  We should have a distinctive future for ourselves in the affairs of this world.  We have the Irish diaspora, we have a great network of goodwill throughout the world.  Do not let us squander it in alliances which have been mooted from time to time.</P>
      <P>Finally, let me hope that if the United Nations cannot do what was expected of it, we should give the lead to form the united non-aligned nations of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I have never rejected any of your suggestions and I am delighted to comply with this one.  It is with a certain amount of regret that I join in supporting the motion put down by Senator Ryan.  I would like to take up a point which Senator Robb mentioned.  I see very little point in Ireland remaining neutral if we are not prepared to condemn actions like the American action in Libya yesterday.  I see very little point in our even maintaining the farce of neutrality if we will not stand up against the United States on issues like this where the rest of the world believe it is morally wrong.  We might as well be in NATO and a pawn of the US <Col N="81" /> and not make any superficial or hypocritical points about being neutral because this sort of action by the Government, this failure to take on the Americans on something like this, makes a complete farce of our neutrality.  I am sorry to have to say that but I am afraid it is true.</P>
      <P>Yes, I think the United States must certainly be condemned for what they did in Libya yesterday.  It is true for two principal reasons.  One, because all constitutional parties in this country have always maintained on other issues and ones which are much nearer to home that violence should not be replied to with violence.  All the United States is doing on the issue of Libya is swapping innocent lives for innocent lives.  It is inconceivable that the United States did not know that this attack would take innocent lives in Libya.  They knew that.  The other reason is a far more specific one.  I no longer believe that President Reagan is sincere about his condemnation of international terrorism.  I would like to support what Senator Higgins said on this: President Reagan is currently supporting terrorists in Nicaragua.  He is currently supporting terrorists against a legitimately and democratically elected régime in Nicaragua.  If there is to be justification and if we are to give President Reagan the benefit of the doubt and say he overreacted, we still have to criticise him on the principle of combating international terrorism because he is not consistent on that himself.</P>
      <P>I believe also that the United States carries a special responsibility as the leader of the free world on issues like this.  The United States is showing us an example of straightforward bullying in this issue.  There is no doubt that if they wanted to they could wipe out Tripoli. There is no doubt that they can kill as many people as they like there.  It is a power with which they will completely overwhelm if necessary.  This did not need to be proven, but they decided to take this course presumably to pander to opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I think Colonel Gadaffi in this debate has got off pretty lightly, to be honest.  It is absolutely right <Col N="82" /> that we should in the few minutes left to us equally condemn the acts of terrorism that Libya has been perpetrating.  Let us not quibble about whether Libya is guilty of international acts of terrorism, let us not even demand the evidence from the United States.  I do not think that in the mind of any reasonable man there is any doubt that Libya has committed some very dreadful acts of international terrorism and there is evidence for it, but the answer to this is not to retaliate with terror.  The answer to this is for the international community to get together and make constructive proposals to combat terrorism.  I regret the failure of the EC Foreign Ministers to come out with any specific proposals to combat international terrorism on this crisis.  What they issued, unfortunately, was a rather weak call to Libya to abide by international law and not to practise international terrorism. That, they knew perfectly well, would not have any effect at all.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in this debate, while condemning the United States, should be switched to a certain extent to condemn international terrorism, to condemn all those who indulge in it, whether it is state terrorism from the United States or whether it is cowardly terrorism from a small country like Libya.  I would ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to think again about diplomatic activity, to think about sanctions against Libya or any country which supports terrorism of any sort internationally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that this motion is in a restricted setting because it is difficult to clarify one's thoughts in a few minutes.  I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the way he has handled this situation from our point of view so far.  I listened with interest to his broadcast on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; last night and any fair-minded person could not quarrel with his approach.  He was very conscious of the Irish situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> our trade links with Libya.  We have important agricultural exports to Libya.  On the other hand, if the subsidies that are provided by the EC for exports to third countries <Col N="83" /> were changed, perhaps those trade links might not be as important to us as they are at present.</P>
      <P>From listening to the debate, I believe many of our colleagues must not have been listening very carefully or reading the speeches and taunts of the President of Libya especially towards the United States over the past six or eight months and even more.  In no uncertain way Colonel Gadaffi has thrown down the gauntlet to the US Government.  I am not saying that the US were right to respond, but nevertheless when it comes to international terrorism Colonel Gadaffi has set himself as leader of that world movement.  He has made it quite clear that he supports international terrorism in every place possible, including our own country.  We should bear that very much in mind.  I subscribe to our national policy of neutrality.  We should endeavour to live that policy as well as giving lip service to it.  There must be a balance here.  Many of the speakers here this evening have conveniently, perhaps, been unable to recall the countless numbers of Libyan service people who have been expelled from practically every country in Europe, from France, Germany, Holland, Turkey.  Even this year, and it is only in the fourth month now, there must be seven or eight different countries in Europe who are forced to expel agents of the Libyan Government.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that a power like the United States finds it necessary to fire a shot across the bows of that small country.  Indeed, when one looks at the situation on the continent of Africa as a whole and sees where a little more than half of the countries there are unable to feed their own populations, it is a crying shame that so much money is spent on armaments in all of those countries and especially in Libya.  Indeed it behoves most of those countries if they can change their warlord situation, to endeavour to put the interest of their own ordinary citizens first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to condemn the United States action and I am quite sure that they have been tried and it is very difficult <Col N="84" /> to handle acts of terrorism especially when they are taken against interests of a Government on some other national territory.  That makes it very difficult for the United States.</P>
    <P>We had extremes here this week culminating in a great success by our own Garda this morning in regard to another diabolical act of terrorism.  That is the kidnapping of a quite ordinary innocent person.  In relation to such actions, there are very few sanctions that can be taken on behalf of the ordinary law-abiding people.  We should look with some understanding and feeling towards the United States who, in the main, are the bulwark of the defence of western civilisation.  I do not say that the United States were right but certainly they were provoked and it is only a few weeks since Colonel Gadaffi challenged the United States to do something about it.  Here in our own country the last arms find was labelled the People's Republic of Libya or whatever. We are not talking about something in the middle of the Mediterranean.  We have it here on our own doorstep.  I have never been a guest of any of these Middle-Eastern countries, nevertheless, I read on a weekly basis, the propaganda that emanates from the embassies that have many friends on all sides of this House. I should just like to compliment the Minister on the way he approached this difficult problem and I wish him success in his efforts in representing the Irish Government's view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better start at the end rather than at the beginning.  Senator McDonald mentioned propaganda coming from various embassies and various interest groups in this country relating to the Middle-East.  I should just like to refer him to the Irish version of the word &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo;.  There are two Irish versions, one is &ldquo;Bréag scéala&rdquo; and the other is &ldquo;fíor scéala&rdquo;.  I suggest that if he does an analysis on what he gets he will get more &ldquo;fíor scéala&rdquo; than &ldquo;bréag scéala&rdquo;, if he is getting propaganda material.  However, the word &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; is misused and over-used.  I am very sorry to hear Senator McDonald <Col N="85" /> compliment the Government on their stand on this issue because it did appear to those of us who are against international terrorism, who are against terrorism, that our Government in a sense were prevaricating.  They were suggesting that if the Americans did it, it was all right.</P>
      <P>It was suggested by the Minister yesterday in the Dáil that the terrorism all over Europe emanated from Libya.  It was suggested that he did not say it.  There has been no evidence as yet produced that the bombing of a discotheque in Berlin was caused by Libyans.  If it was caused by Libyans, I would suggest yes, if the Americans or if NATO are so good at producing and gathering evidence that such an attack was going to take place, if they were so good as to be able, as Mr. Shultz said, to listen from a device in Berlin, to a Russian diplomat brushing his teeth in East Berlin, why were they not able to stop somebody going from East Berlin to West Berlin to commit this atrocious crime against humanity?  If they are so good at listening, why do they not act to prevent terrorism instead of going out and indiscriminately bombing the city of Tripoli and indiscriminately bombing Libya?  If they had asked the Israelis to take out the positions in Tripoli and the position in Libya that they wanted to take out, the Israelies would have taken them out because they have the knowledge and they have the techniques to do it, instead of doing what the Americans did, indiscriminately bombing a city in which there is an enormous number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Europe are a prolific people. We in Ireland have proportionately more children than any other country in Europe but when one goes to a Middle-East country or a north African country, one of the things that one notices is the number of children and there is no way that the Americans took that into account when they indiscriminately bombed Libya.  I have no love for Colonel Gadaffi. I have no love for Libya but Libya is a very small country and Libya is being accused of being a training ground for international terrorism.  I should like the <Col N="86" /> Minister to get up here this evening and give me one instance of international terrorism which has been proved to emanate from Libya.  International terrorism is a horrific fact of life at present.  International terrorism is not something that the Americans are going to get rid of by indiscriminately bombing or attacks on a small nation.  It may be very good for the home constituency and Jerry Fallwell and gentlemen of his ilk in America can say &ldquo;we have proved that we are a strong nation&rdquo;.  The Americans may be able to justify by this attack the fact that they were beaten in Vietnam, that they were run out of Korea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that they have no world options but in the internal politics of America President Reagan is now Rambo II, Rambo III and not alone is he Rambo II or Rambo III but he has 80 per cent of the public of America behind him in these attacks on a small neutral nation.</P>
      <P>Where do we start?  As was said in this debate by Senator Robb, if an American is killed in an accident as happened in Khartoum yesterday, are the Americans now going to attack Sudan?  There were 25 people killed in Miami last night and none of them was a shooting accident: they were deliberate provocations; they were deliberate attacks on innocent people.  Do the American Government now intend to bomb Miami?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in the world now is one of international terrorism which is not involved with any particular cause.  The Middle East is a tinder box and America is trying to light that tinder box.  There is no doubt that we have situations in the Middle East.  We have the Lebanon if the Israelis moved out of there in the morning, there could be peace.  Did the United Nations do what they said they would do in 1948 and create two states? They created one; Israel was the only State to be created by it.  They did not go along with Resolution 181 of the United Nations Charter which stated that there <Col N="87" /> should be a separate entity for the Palestinians.  The Lebanon is a particular entity. The Palestinians are a particular problem.  The Iran-Iraq war is a particular problem.  The involvement of international terrorism in the world is a particular problem.  The tactics of America at present in going in and suggesting they are going to stop international terrorism by taking out one of the smallest nations in North Africa of six million people, which is very close to the population of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>They decided that because Colonel Gadaffi made exaggerated statements he is the person who is going to be &ldquo;taken out&rdquo;.  President Reagan said that he was &ldquo;a mad dog&rdquo;.  I would suggest that the President of America who says of the leader of another country that he is &ldquo;a mad dog&rdquo; has to have something wrong with him.  I do not think I would call the Minister for Foreign Affairs a &ldquo;mad dog&rdquo;.  I would not call Deputy Garrett FitzGerald a &ldquo;mad dog&rdquo;.  I would not call the leader of any country in the world a &ldquo;mad dog&rdquo;.  That person has the right to lead his country as he sees fit and the people who are behind him follow him.  He is there since 1969.  He is the longest serving leader, apart from Yasser Arafat, in the Middle East.  We may not agree with what he does but the fact is that within his own country he is the leader.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to ask the United Nations to meet and the UN have suggested they will meet next week.  Next week?  The whole of Libya could be annihilated between now and next week. International diplomacy is something which I cannot understand, particularly when one considers that the daughter of the leader of an independent country has been killed and his two sons are in hospital having been &ldquo;taken out&rdquo; as the President of the United States of America has said.  It is a sad day for the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not anti-American.  I have the <Col N="88" /> greatest respect for the American people. I have a brother married to an American citizen.  He is an American citizen.  His father-in-law was the Rear-Admiral who was in charge of the first recovery ship in the satellite situation.  But the Americans are being led by a man who decides to take out an independent country without any justification&mdash; even though some people may say that there had been justifiable reasons for attacking Libya for individual acts, not acts by Libyans.  The only Libyan who was in any way connected with an international act of terrorism was in London when a policewomen was killed by a shot from a Libyan in the Libyan Embassy or whatever it was.  If the Minister can get up here tonight and state specifically that the acts of terror that have been committed in the world have Libyan connections, I would say that I would agree with him.  President Reagan said that the act of terrorism carried out at Vienna Airport came about because of Libyans.  It was proved by the Austrians that the Libyans had nothing to do with what happened there.  It was proved that there were connections through Syria, through Hungary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should just like to reply to what Senator Lanigan has stated.  He may remember the incident of the <i>Claudia</i> ten or 12 years ago.  That was Libyan.  It has been proven to be Libyan.  He may not have heard the news tonight at 6 p.m. when Chancellor Kohl said he had independent evidence, irrefutable evidence, of the connection between Libya and the bombing of the discotheque in West Berlin last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened very carefully to the <Col N="89" /> debate in this House this evening which has provided us with this important opportunity for a detailed and comprehensive discussion of the tragic confrontation between the United States and Libya.  That this has been a matter of great concern in this House is clear from the contributions made.  It is also a matter of very grave concern to the Government.  I placed that concern on the record of the Dáil yesterday when I had the opportunity to set out the view of the Government about the crisis when I spoke in that House.</P>
    <P>The most immediate concern and greatest priority of the Government in present circumstances must be to safeguard the welfare of Irish citizens in Libya.  This has been a concern also voiced in the course of this evening's discussions by one Senator, and the discussions yesterday in the Dáil.  There are at present about 500 Irish citizens in Libya, most of whom are there on a temporary basis.  The information available to us is that most are safe and well and, indeed, we would hope that all our citizens will be able over the next few days to report to us in similar terms.  My Department, both directly and through our Embassy in Rome, which as Senators will be aware is accredited to Tripoli, has in fact succeeded in making contact with a number of Irish citizens in Libya in the last 36 hours.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has also set up a special emergency telephone service to take calls from members of the public who are seeking information about relatives or friends in Libya.  Telephone communications with Libya remain open, though inevitably there are delays.  The airport in Tripoli, however, is still closed and there are as yet no indications of when it will reopen. We have sought the assistance of other Community states who have resident Embassies in Tripoli and they have been good enough to help us with our requests.</P>
    <P>The current crisis in US-Libyan relations and the tragic events of Tuesday morning have their origins in a recent wave of terrorist attacks directed against the US and against US citizens.  These attacks have for the most part taken place <Col N="90" /> in Europe and have also involved death or injury for innocent Europeans.  As the Seanad may be aware, a young Irish girl was injured in the bombing of the Berlin discotheque earlier this month.  The Americans believe that they have incontrovertible evidence linking these terrorist outrages to Libya and have made some of that information publicly available. Other states, including today in a very clear and emphatic way the Federal Republic of Germany, have publicly pointed to proof of Libyan involvement in terrorism.</P>
    <P>The Government share the concerns of the United States about international terrorism.  I note that this concern has also been strongly echoed in the debate tonight.  I regret, moreover, that this resurgence of international terrorism has provoked the current crisis in US-Libyan relations, leading to the US bombing of Libya and the tragic loss of life which has occurred.  For our own part, we believe that political methods provide an effective framework to combat terrorism and to ensure the isolation of all who carry out terrorist outrages or who connive in or support terrorism.  That has been a centrepiece to our own response to the mindless folly and savage toll of terrorism in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Anybody who looks at the record of my party and of this Government, not just in its present term in office but in the entire history of my party, will find is based on the resolution of the problems of terrorism by dialogue and by politics and not by terrorism.  I give second place to nobody in this House or outside this House in my defence of my party in that regard.</P>
    <P>Together with our European partners, we have engaged in an intensive cooperation in the struggle against terrorism.  The framework of the European approach was set out in the declaration of international terrorism which the twelve Foreign Ministers adopted, against the background of the attacks on the airports in Rome and Vienna at their meeting on 27 January.</P>
    <P>I happened to be in Rome airport last Saturday in the aftermath of that attack.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> It is not a happy place to go through now where there are soldiers with guns walking in pairs almost every 20 feet of the airport, where people are quite nervous sitting in that airport or moving through it.  I think people who mindlessly or who deliberately attack innocent travellers going about pleasure or business in an international airport certainly deserve the title and the odium that has been heaped on them either directly for their part in those attacks or if they support or train the people who engage in those attacks.</P>

      <P>In that statement the Twelve strongly condemned terrorism and emphasised that states which give support or cover to terrorists should not expect to have normal relations with the twelve.  Furthermore, they adopted a programme of action designed to strengthen their co-operation against terrorism and to protect their citizens against terrorist attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this week in The Hague the Foreign Ministers of the Community states met again to review the problem of recurrent terrorism, once again highlighted in the TWA aircraft bombing and the bombing in West Berlin, and to consider the worsening crisis which was developing, as a consequence of this terrorism, in US-Libyan relations.  In their statement, issued following their meeting, the twelve ministers reiterated their strong concern about international terrorism.  They emphasised that states clearly implicated in supporting terrorism should renounce such support and respect the rule of international law.  They called upon Libya to act accordingly and they rejected as unacceptable the threats made by Libya against member states which deliberately encourage recourse to violence and which directly threaten Europe.  In the context of the developing crisis in the Mediterranean and in order to assist the achievement of a political solution, the twelve also underlined the need for restraint on all sides so as to <Col N="92" /> avoid further escalation in the region with all its inherent dangers.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat our deep concern about the serious escalation of tension in the Mediterranean.  In addition to the bombing carried out by the United States in Libya, there was in the course of yesterday an attack by Libya on the Italian island of Lampedusa.  Fortunately, there were no casualties in that attack.  There are reports today, still unconfirmed, of fighting within Libya itself.  I take this opportunity to repeat the Government's appeal to all sides to avoid any additional action which would escalate international tensions and lead to further tragic loss of life.  We ask that efforts now be pursued in good faith by all concerned to achieve a peaceful outcome of this crisis.</P>
    <P>The Security Council yesterday morning resumed its consideration of the crisis. We are not at present members of the Security Council.  However, our Permanent Representative is closely following the debate at the council and is in close touch with his Community colleagues, three of whom &mdash; Denmark, Britain and France &mdash; are members of the Security Council.  The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Perez de Cuellar, has joined all of those who have appealed for restraint so that a peaceful outcome may emerge.  I understand that the Security Council will continue its consideration of the crisis tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The Government have remained in constant contact with our partners in the European Community throughout the present crisis.  Tomorrow a special meeting of EC Foreign Ministers, which I will attend, will be held in Paris <i>en marge</i> of the meeting of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.  The convening of this special meeting clearly highlights the profound concerns felt throughout Europe about ongoing developments.  It would not be appropriate for me at this stage to preempt the conclusions of that meeting. But the meeting gives to all concerned the opportunity to consider the full range of issues that arise and to make clear the terms of the European response to the present crisis, a crisis which we hope will <Col N="93" /> be peacefully resolved so that stability can be restored in the region.</P>
    <P>I thank the Seanad for the opportunity they have given me to contribute to this debate and to present the concerns of the Government about the confrontation which has occurred.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised by Members which I do not think I will be able to reply to in full but I will do as many as I can.  Concern was expressed by a number of Senators about the moral position and the legal position of what has occurred.  I want to emphasise very strongly the Government's commitment to the place of morality and of law in international affairs.  Ireland is fundamentally committed to the peaceful settlement of disputes and to the rejection of violence as a method of achieving any other ends.  I repeated that a number of times in the House yesterday and I repeat it again today so that there will be no doubt about our commitment to that.</P>
    <P>We are also committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes and our opposition to terrorism need not be in any doubt. We share the concerns of the Americans about terrorism.  American citizens have been the victims of terrorist attacks.  I do not think it is for Ireland to defend the United States.  It is quite capable of defending itself and, indeed, has done so in the Security Council.  Because of our own experience in Ireland I think we can understand the indignation of the frustration of the American people faced with the terrible scourge of terrorism. I must stress again that we believe the problems of terrorism can be solved by political means and we hope that will happen in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> I made the point that Chancellor Kohl said this evening that he had irrefutable proof of Libyan involvement in what happened in West Berlin.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb made the point about a united nations of small nations, nonaligned and committed to peace.  That is an idea I should not like to see take root and flourish, because what is important is that we all work within the framework of the United Nations and the provisions of the Charter.  Small nations can press their interests by drawing on the political and moral support of the Charter which United Nations membership affords us and any loosening or weakening of that Charter would not particularly be in the interests of a small neutral country.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by saying that the Government share the serious concern expressed by the Senator about this crisis.  We have taken steps to protect the well-being of Irish citizens.  We are endeavouring, as soon as Tripoli Airport opens, to get an officer from our Embassy in Rome into Tripoli so that we can be absolutely sure that all Irish citizens are safe and well.  We will be encouraging a peaceful resolution to the crisis and we will, of course, be co-operating with our partners in the Twelve in an endeavour to achieve that goal.  We share the concern of the US about international terrorism because their citizens have been victims of these tragedies.  We believe that terrorism can be defeated by political means.  We are working with our partners in the Twelve to try to achieve that.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 April 1986.</P>
