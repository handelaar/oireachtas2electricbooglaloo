      <P>I have notice from Senator Jack Fitzsimons that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that adult education is given a proper place as an integral part of the educational system with adequate resources.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael D. Higgins of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to pursue measures that will assist in the safe return of an Irish teacher at the American University in Beirut.</P>
      <P>I regard both matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Fitzsimon's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken from 8.10 p.m. to 8.40 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senator Higgins may give notice for another day of the matter which he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House when it is proposed to take No. 34.  I asked about it some weeks ago and the Deputy Leader was to let me know.  I have had no communication from either the Leader or the Deputy Leader since then.</P>

      <P>With reference to Senator Lanigan's question, the Courts Bill is awaiting the availability of the Minister and the priority which the Government and, indeed the House, are giving to the legislation they want to deal with.  The Health (Amendment) Bill which it has been agreed between the Whips to take today, is an urgent measure, as the Senator would know as a member of a health board, in that it enables health boards to recoup certain funds.  The industrial Development Bill is also urgent because it involves financial arrangements for the IDA.  It is because of that that they are being given priority.  No. 5 is ordered for immediately afterwards and will be taken at that time.  I want to apologise to Senator Cassidy about Item No. 34.  I am not sure what communication or what promise the Leader of the House gave but I will make inquiries about it to see where the Minister has that item in the order of priority.  It has been treated here as a Fianna Fáil Private Members' Motion <Col N="187" /> and it is a matter for the Senator to nominate the time when he would like to take it on the next occasion when Fianna Fáil have Private Members' Motion.  If he wishes to opt for that time for the debate I am sure the Minister will oblige.</P>

I am anxious to get the Bill as quickly as possible for the reasons stated.  I want to co-operate with Members who wish to amend it. Item No. 34 on the Clár is in fact what Senator Cassidy asked me about.  He is obviously mixing it up with his Wireless Telegraphy Bill which he keeps asking about as well.  Can the Senator make up his mind as to which number he is asking about?</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, I will give the Opposition all the time they require for amendments if they so wish, but I did discuss this matter with the Opposition last week.  I had hoped to get the Bill last week and it was to facilitate the Opposition spokesman who was not available last week that we decided not to take it then.  In case Senator Lanigan might not be aware, I did have discussions with Senator Fallon, and got agreement about taking this Bill today. There is a certain element of urgency but naturally if Senators want time for amendments I certainly will give them the time.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill now before the House is to enable charges to be made by health boards for hospital in-patient and out-patient services on persons in respect of treatment of injuries received in road traffic accidents when the injury is caused by the negligent use of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and where the person has received, or is entitled to receive, damages or compensation in respect of such accident.</P>
      <P>The principle of recovering the costs of the treatment of road traffic victims can be traced back to the Road Traffic Act, 1933, and the most recent provisions were contained in Article 6 (3) of the Health Services Regulations 1971 which were made under section 72 of the Health Act, 1970.  These regulations were challenged in the <i>Cooke v. Walsh</i> case and the Supreme Court judgment of 16 December 1983 declared that the regulations were <i>ultra vires</i> the power of the Minister and were void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Health Act, 1970, was debated, the then Minister for Health made it clear that persons who received damages or compensation for injuries received in road traffic accidents would <Col N="190" /> be required to pay for hospital services received in respect of their injuries.  He indicated that this would be covered by regulations which he intended to make under section 72 of the Act.  The Act was passed and subsequently the provisions made in Article 6 (3) of the Health Services Regulations, 1971, were availed of to make such charges until they were declared <i>ultra vires</i> by the Supreme Court in December 1983.</P>
    <P>The provisions which I have now brought before the House provide specific authority to enable health boards to reintroduce charges for hospital services provided &mdash; and I would stress &ldquo;provided&rdquo;&mdash; for persons who receive damages for injuries received in a road traffic accident.  Such charges must be raised in advance so that they can form part of the claim for compensation before the courts.  The case and amount of damages will be decided by the courts.  If successful &mdash; and I stress that phrase also &mdash; the charges will be payable out of the compensation awarded.  If unsuccessful, the charges will not be payable.</P>
    <P>I have also made specific provision in the Bill for the waiving of the whole or part of the charges in cases where the compensation payable to the injured party has been reduced by the courts by reason of contributory negligence by such person or where the amount of damages is insufficient to meet the charges.  This will protect the injured person from any hardship which might arise in meeting the charges.</P>
    <P>In addition, the charges will not be legally recoverable by the health board until compensation has been paid, thus ensuring that the accident victim will not have to meet any costs until his claim for damages has been settled.</P>
    <P>As to the detailed provisions of the Bill itself, it is a short Bill containing only four sections.</P>
    <P>Section 1 sets out the definitions used in the Bill and these definitions are mainly contained in other pertinent legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) gives specific power to health boards to make charges for hospital in-patient or out-patient services on persons injured in road traffic accidents <Col N="191" /> who have received or are entitled to receive damages or compensation in respect of the accidents.  The charge payable is not specified but would normally be the average daily cost per bed day in the hospital concerned.  This will vary depending on the hospital involved.</P>
    <P>I should make it quite clear at this point that there is no retrospective provision in the Bill and consequently these charges will arise only for cases where the injury occurs after the enactment of this legislation.  Services provided in respect of injuries received prior to the enactment of this legislation will be dealt with in accordance with the existing provisions of the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) allows health boards to waive the whole or part of the charge raised where the amount of damages received is either insufficient or has been reduced by virtue of contributory negligence of the injured person.  This provision is necessary in order to prevent hardship on the injured party.  Subparagraph (b) of this subsection is a technical provision which enables the courts to disregard the discretion of the health board to waive charges in deternmining the amount of damages to be assessed.</P>
    <P>Section 3 simply provides for the recovery of sums due under section 2 and, as many of the court cases on road traffic injuries take a considerable time to resolve, it also provides that charges shall accrue on the date on which damages are paid or on the date on which the services were provided whichever is the latter.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the short title, collective citation and construction.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill for a Second Reading I want to emphasise to the House: (1) charges have been levied in these circumstances since 1933; (2) insurance companies have been paid premiums to underwrite these risks; (3) the Exchequer should not be called upon to bear the costs of negligent drivers; and (4) adequate precautions have been taken to ensure that no hardship will accrue to the injured party.</P>
    <P>Loss of income from charges in respect of road traffic accident cases since the <Col N="192" /> Supreme Court decision has aggravated the difficult financial position of health agencies.  The reimposition of these charges is therefore essential.  It is currently estimated that the charges to be levied could provide income of up to £4 million per year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that the delay in introducing this Bill has cost the taxpayer millions of pounds over the past few years.  The Supreme Court in the case of <i>Cooke v. Walsh</i> decided, among other things, that hospital and medical fees incurred by a person in a road accident could not be recovered against the negligent driver who caused the accident because the injured party was entitled to these hospital services free under the Health Acts.  When we talk about something being &ldquo;free&rdquo;, it is true to say that that is an incorrect word to use because, as we all know, nothing is free in this world, whether it is in this area of legislation or hospital charges or any other services that have to be paid for by somebody.</P>
      <P>The effect of the Supreme Court decision of 1983 was that these hospital charges were paid out of public funds &mdash; in other words, by the taxpayer who is paying his insurance premium.  We will come back to that in a moment.  As a result of this Bill, I have no doubt he will be paying a higher motor insurance premium in the future.  The suggestion that hospital charges should be paid by the taxpayer rather than by the negligent car driver is not tenable.  There are many taxpayers who do not own a motor car and clearly there is no reason why they should have to contribute through their taxes to provide hospital services which are needed as a result of the negligence of drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason to expect people who cannot afford cars to pay for expensive hospital services which are caused by negligence and dangerous driving of motorists.  There is some similarity to the present insurance levy which, as a result of the PMPA episode, is now paid for by all non-life policy holders.  That includes old age pensioners paying modest fire <Col N="193" /> premiums.  They are penalised for the ills of that company and they were primarily a motor insurance company.  There is a near comparison there.  Going back to the question of whether or not the taxpayer will be paying extra insurance premiums, I think it can be said with certainty that the interministerial group of the Cabinet &mdash; I am not sure if the Minister is a member of that group &mdash; who investigated motor insurance premiums were clearly informed by the insurance industry that the Bill would increase motor premiums.  As we all know, it is the stated commitment of the Government that they would endeavour to reduce motor premiums, but this is not helping to reduce the motor premiums which are clearly very expensive at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am referring to insurance quite a lot because, obviously, it is an insurance/ health Bill.  While we might have some reservations about the Bill, we would not oppose it.  Coming back to the insurance/health aspect, I feel that in some way an opportunity has been missed by the Minister and his Department in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>The whole situation regarding road traffic accidents, insurance claims and hospitalisation could have been rationalised here, to the benefit of the health boards, the insured and the insurance companies.  The definition of in-patient and out-patient services is that assigned to them by sections 51 and 55 of the Health Act, 1970.  This would mean that the cost of vocational assessment and training is neither chargeable nor recoverable.  It could be argued that a person injured in a road traffic accident here has an incentive in some way not to avail fully of the various excellent rehabilitation services which are provided.  We all agree that there are excellent rehabilitation services.  The more rehabilitation given to a person, particularly in the area of orthopaedics which is almost certainly the result of car accidents, the greater the recovery and the better the person will be as a result of this rehabilitation.  But almost certainly if that happens, the less the injured party will receive by way of compensation.  There is some argument <Col N="194" /> for deferring calculations of compensation until the injured party has availed of whatever rehabilitation programme has been recommended following the medical assessment.  Indeed, I would even suggest, so far as awards are concerned, that a comparison could be made to what happens with front seat passengers who are not wearing their seat belts, almost certainly their claim is reduced by about 25 per cent automatically.  An argument could be made that unless rehabilitation services are fully adhered to a compensation claim might be reduced because of that.  That would help to reduce insurance costs and the awards.  However, it is proper for us to agree to improve the situation in which 465 people were killed and over 8,000 people injured in road traffic accidents in 1984.  There could have been and should be a greater liaison between the Departments of Health, Environment and Justice in educating motorists to the fact that they are, perhaps, driving with too much drink, that they are not wearing seat belts.  This area was missed in the Bill.  The Government have a duty to see that everything that can reduce accidents is followed through.</P>
    <P>I can recall here a recent Bill in this House, the Road Traffic Amendment Bill, 1983.  I was disappointed at the time that the Minister for State, Deputy O'Brien, would not accept an amendment of ours which was simply to increase fines on people for obvious continuous driving without third party cover.  Our amendment provided that notwithstanding anything in the Road Traffic Acts, in the case of the inadvertent non insurance of a vehicle a person shall be liable on summary conviction to a minimum penalty of £100.  In the case of deliberate driving without insurance the minimum penalty of £350 should be imposed.  That amendment was reasonable and one that would have helped the insurance industry and it certainly would have helped this problem of no insurance but, unfortunately, the Minister did not see his way to accept the amendment despite, as I said, the strong commitment there is to reduce motor insurance.</P>
    <P>There is a further insurance aspect to <Col N="195" /> it in regard to this Bill and, perhaps, the Minister would comment on it.  What happens in the case of a person who is injured and is paid by the Motor insurance Bureau?  Is there any regulation for that situation and will the bureau be expected to pay in the same way as an insurance company would pay a claim that is legally binding on them?  Are claims made by the Motor Insurance Bureau subject to this legislation?  The question then is what happens if a health board is paid by an insurance company for injuries to a claimant who has been in hospital and who finds that they have to go back for hospitalisation after the claim has been settled after maybe two or three years &mdash; say arthritis sets in or something like that?  What is the result of that situation?  Can we further go back and can we further claim in a situation like that?</P>
    <P>There are many instances we could give and, as I said, I see this very much as an insurance/health matter, for obvious reasons.  Payment of claims is something that would apply in the area of health as well, in the area of payment of the health boards, of, perhaps, a periodic payment rather than a lump sum.  I am aware of a case of a young child who had suffered serious injuries in a car driven by his father.  The father was adjudged to have been negligent.  There was a large award paid by the father's insurance company and not long afterwards the child died and the award became the property of the father.  You had the case of the father profiting from, if you like, his own wrongdoing and, certainly, the purpose of periodic payments would be to adjust the compensation paid more closely to what it was intended to achieve.  This could be followed through in regard to payment to the health boards for out-patient or in-patient services.</P>
    <P>The problem with the Bill, too, for health boards is one that I am sure is worrying them.  At the moment it is costing them £4 million as the Minister said.  The long delays that are taken to settle claims &mdash; five and six years are quite <Col N="196" /> common &mdash; mean that the health board must wait five or six years for the money when this Bill is passed.  The explanatory memorandum clearly states:</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1985, is to enable health boards to make a charge for in-patient or out-patient hospital services on a person who received or is entitled to receive damages or compensation caused in a road traffic accident.</P>
    <P>It raises a question in the case of a commercial vehicle such as a van or small lorry: there is no obligation on the owner or driver of that vehicle to have full passenger cover.  Yet, if a passenger is injured as a result of the vehicle hitting a wall, does this Health (Amendment) Bill apply in such a case?  There is no insurance in force.  Or take the case of an ordinary, insured person who hits a wall where there is no third party vehicle involved and the driver is injured.  He is in a road traffic accident &mdash; that is what the Bill says &mdash; and there is no insurance company to pay his compensation.  I know the Minister has referred to a waiver scheme but I am thinking of a case where a person could afford to pay.  What happens in such a case?</P>
    <P>The Bill could have been better if more consultation had taken place with the insurance industry.  An aspect of the Bill which disappoints me somewhat is that there is nothing in the legislation or, indeed, in the Minister's statement to indicate his concern about the question of litigation and compensation involving the health services and consultants.  As we all know, the involvement of consultants in court cases clearly disrupts the normal administration of the health services.  This should be examined with a view to improving this position.  There is very good reason why the present legal set-up should be examined to see if it still serves the best interests of our people or if a more practical or simpler method can be devised whereby consultants would not have to attend the High Court for days and, possibly weeks, waiting to give evidence when they would be better employed in their hospitals.  Why could <Col N="197" /> not a very detailed medical report be supplied showing the injuries and the prognosis &mdash; or perhaps even a tape if that would be acceptable in a court?  This would be better than the situation where these very busy specialists have to be away from their work waiting for an appearance in the High Court which can take anything from days to weeks.</P>
    <P>Another aspect would be the loss to the Department of Social Welfare in terms of the social insurance fund through payment of disability benefit to persons injured in road accidents.  Everything that can be done to reduce the size of the social welfare bill should be done.  The number of people out of work as a result of injuries is growing and is of huge proportions.  If this matter were examined it could be a major contribution to the social insurance fund as it would save unnecessary withdrawals and drawings from it.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a health board only can make a charge.  In the case of patients being treated in public voluntary hospitals will these hospitals be obliged to notify and supply the necessary information to health boards to facilitate the making of the charge?  Public voluntary hospitals are not referred to in the Bill, which is an obvious omission.  Will a claim fall to be made by the health board in whose area the patient is being treated? For example, if a person who is a native of, say, Athlone in the Midland Health Board region is injured in an accident, say in Cork, and has to be brought to a hospital in the Southern Health Board area, I presume that the health board in the area where the hospital is situated will have to bill him.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.  That is not fully clear.  Will the income received by health boards in respect of patients treated in public voluntary hospitals be retained by the health boards or will it be collected by them on behalf of the hospital concerned?  Will a consultant be entitled to charge a patient whose income at the time of receiving the injury did not leave him or her liable to pay consultants' fees for ordinary hospital treatment? There is no reference to that in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> This is an important Bill.  Perhaps an opportunity has been lost in not going further down the road on the insurance aspect of it.  It is not a Bill that we would oppose but I would like to say that it was a chance to take a fresh, new, even radical look at what is necessary now for the future.  Just because the system has been operating successfully since 1983 does not mean that there is no room for improvement.  While we are saying that the Bill is necessary I feel that with greater consultation and greater cooperation we might well have had a better Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable health boards to make a charge for in-patient and out-patient hospital services in respect of a person who is entitled to received damages or compensation for injury in a road traffic accident. As such, I welcome the legislation.  While fully supporting the principle underlying the Bill, I have certain reservations about some of the technicalities of the Bill which I will express later.  Indeed, I give notice now that I will be putting down amendments in relation to certain aspects on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>This is an interesting Bill for a socialist Minister to promote and perhaps it reflects the Minister's pragmatic socialism which we have come to appreciate over the past three-and-a-half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The items in respect of which payments may be claimed and in respect of which the health boards may recover are items of special damages which, until the Supreme Court decision in the case of <i>Mark Cooke v. Patrick Walsh,</i> were normally recoverable.  The result of the Supreme Court decision in that case was that the statutory instrument made under the 1970 Health Act, by virtue of which such damages were claimable, was declared <i>ultra vires</i> the power of the Minister.  The effect, therefore, of this Bill would be to put somebody, the health boards in particular, back into the situation that existed prior to the 1970 statutory instrument and to provide a firm statutory basis.  When the 1970 Health Act was debated in both Houses of the <Col N="199" /> Oireachtas this point was raised and the then Minister for Health gave assurances that damages in respect of personal injuries arising out of road traffic accidents could include a claim in respect of hospital service charges.  The unfortunate thing is that the statutory instrument which allowed that situation to become operative was badly based.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I mentioned the underlying principle of this Bill and I suppose the question we are faced with today in terms of broad principle is whether the Exchequer should bear the cost of negligent drivers on the one hand or whether the cost should be borne by the negligent drivers themselves through their insurance companies on the other hand.  I have favoured the latter approach and for that reason I support the principle underlying this Bill. I might say in passing that, if one supports that principle, one must take cognisance of the principle underlying certain other legislation which allows people recover damages in respect of injury caused.  I refer to the malicious injury code which allows damages to be recovered from a local authority in respect of damage to property under certain circumstances. Certainly, if one accepts the principle underlying this Bill then there is a very strong argument for seeing that the malicious injury code is abolished and for putting the onus on property owners in all circumstances to insure their property against malicious damage.</P>
    <P>Likewise, if one accepts the principle, the argument can be put forward that the criminal injuries compensation scheme should be completely abolished and not merely whittled down in its operation, as has been done recently.  I just make those points because I think they are relevant to the principle underlying this Bill.  It is important that the Oireachtas and the Executive get their minds clear about what is to be the principle underlying claims for damages in respect of compensation arising out of injuries caused. It would appear that we are now operating on various bases in respect of different types of injuries arising under <Col N="200" /> different circumstances.  There is certainly a conflict as between the two principles I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention some of the specifics contained in this Bill.  I will go into these in greater detail when we come to Committee Stage.  First, section 2 (1) (b) states:</P>
    <P>...in-patient services or out-patient services have been, are being or will be provided by or on behalf of a health board in respect of injury.</P>
    <P>The Minister said here today, and the Minister of State said in the Dáil, that this provision will not operate or cannot operate retrospectively.  That was read into the record in both Houses.  Certainly, on a clear reading of that subsection it cannot be so construed: the subsection can be construed as stating that the provision can operate retrospectively.  If this Bill is enacted as specified it will then be possible for a health board to institute a claim against a person in respect of services provided where a claim has arisen between December 1983 and the present time and where a claim may very well be settled.  I am not satisfied, if we enact this Bill as specified, that such a situation will not arise.  Other than that, we depend on the goodwill of this Minister or the goodwill of the health boards.  When it comes to a question of money or the scarce resources the Minister referred to, then the goodwill is something which is not a very strong argument.</P>
    <P>I am extremely worried about that section.  Whereas I accept that the Minister's commitment that the Bill will not operate retrospectively has been given here today in good faith, and likewise given by the junior Minister in the Dáil in good faith, I am not at all satisfied that it will prevent a health board from operating as against that commitment. Health boards have been known to operate against the Minister's wishes in the past in other areas and they may do so in this area also.</P>
    <P>The second point that worries me is the final paragraph of section 2 (1), which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> ...the health board shall, notwithstanding any thing in the Health Acts, 1947 to 1985, make a charge upon the person who received or is entitled to receive such damages or compensation in respect of the said in-patient services or out-patient services.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the words &ldquo;or is entitled to receive&rdquo;.  Circumstances may arise where a person does not receive damages.  Circumstances may arise where a person does not institute a claim, for good reasons.  Certainly, if the Bill is enacted in that form, this gives the health boards an opportunity to pursue such a person under those circumstances even where damages have not been recovered.  That is something that requires to be looked at and something that must be prevented.</P>
    <P>The third area of concern I have is in relation to subsection (2) (a) (i) and that is where the health board may waive, having regard to the amount of damages or compensation.  I do not think that that section is sufficiently protective in cases where the amount of damages may be minimal.  It is a subsection that should be looked at between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am also very concerned about the operation of section 2 (2) (a) (ii) and that is the power of the health board to waive in cases of contributory negligence, presumably where such has been established by a court of law or where such has been agreed upon between the parties where a case has been settled.  The subsection as drafted says that under those circumstances the health board may waive.  The Oireachtas should impose a positive duty on the health board to waive.  For that reason, I will be putting down an amendment to the effect that the health board shall waive under those circumstances and that the amount recoverable should be <i>pro rata</i> in relation to the apportionment of negligence.</P>
    <P>The situation could arise where somebody institutes a claim and the court could hold that a person who institutes the claim is 50 per cent responsible for the accident.  The court may hold that the amount of damages awardable is, say, <Col N="202" /> £100,000, that person would then receive £50,000.  To my mind, if the amount due to the health board came sufficiently within the ambit of the amount received by the plaintiff, then I am not satisfied that the health board would have any regard for the contributory negligence aspect and would pursue their claim in full as against the injured party.  The amount that a health board should be able to recover under those circumstances should relate to the contributory negligence award only and should be limited to that level.</P>
    <P>The fifth point which causes me concern &mdash; and I am outlining these things in some detail in case we are having Committee Stage today so that the Minister may be on notice as to what I will be raising &mdash; is in relation to section 3 (2) which deals with the operation of the limitations in relation to claims of this nature.  The section reads:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to Part III of the Statute of Limitations, 1957, a cause of action against a person in respect of a charge under section 2 (1) of this Act shall be deemed to accrue on the date on which damages or compensation are paid by the person liable to pay such damages or compensation or on the date on which the services to which the charge relates are provided, whichever is the later.</P>
    <P>I believe that section should be changed to provide that the operable date should be the making of the award by a court of competent jurisdiction in a case where a matter is proceeding within terms of litigation or where a matter is settled without resorting to litigation on the date on which the compensation is paid.  That can have a substantial material effect on a claim in a situation where the Statute of Limitations would be raised.</P>
    <P>These are the points I want to make in relation to this Bill.  It is a technical measure.  I have outlined my reservations regarding certain of the technicalities underlying the Bill.  So far as the principle of the Bill is concerned, I fully support it.  I fully support the Bill for that reason but I would hope that the Minister will <Col N="203" /> take cognisance of the points I have made on the technicalities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also supporting the Bill in so far as it goes and with the reservations mentioned by Senator Fallon and subject to the amendments which he mentioned he would be putting forward.  The case is one to which no reasonable person could take exception. My contribution will be very short because it is an area with which I am not familiar and also the Bill itself is very brief.  It deals solely with the consequences of motor traffic accidents.  The first question that comes to my mind is why accidents outside road accidents are not included.  We have very serious accidents with machinery on farms and other places.  I am sure that they are covered in some other way but the first question that comes to my mind is why could we not have an all-embracing Bill which would cover any accident, insurable or otherwise?  This could perhaps make the Bill a better one.  However, it is related to motor traffic accidents, the figures for which are very high.  According to An Foras Forbartha, in 1984, 465 persons were killed and 8,210 were injured at a total cost of £220 million, which is a very considerable sum of money.  The first thing we must do is think of the causes of these accidents and what can be done to eliminate them or reduce them considerably.  Drink, unquestionably, is a very big factor.  As a nation we consume far too much alcohol and I welcome any move which helps to reduce this consumption.  In this respect the new laws on opening hours, if introduced, will not be a help; in fact they will make the situation far worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speed is another problem.  Everybody seems to be in a hurry no matter where they are going.  When I am coming up to Dublin I drive at a reasonable speed, but cars and other traffic pass me by at a speed far in excess of the 55 miles per hour limit.  While I know there have been many prosecutions for excessive speed within the urban boundaries, I do not know many cases where people have <Col N="204" /> been prosecuted for speeding outside those areas.</P>
    <P>Carelessness and bad manners present another serious problem.  No matter where I drive &mdash; and I am sure this is not only related to myself &mdash; I encounter drivers who hoot their horns continually for the slightest mistake made by anybody.  This is downright bad manners and does nothing to help people.  There is also the criminal element involved in the stealing of cars and speeding.  I heard on the radio this morning that the chains which were to be provided to apprehend these people are not available throughout the country but only in a restricted urban area.</P>
    <P>Seat belts are most important, and it is encouraging to learn that 70 per cent of drivers wear seat belts.  But this compares with 90 per cent in other European countries and some attempt should be made to improve on our figure.  The Garda do their duty.  They have far more serious problems to deal with, but it is important to wear a seat belt and I do not think anybody has any doubt about that.  Anything that can be done to reduce accidents would be welcome.</P>
    <P>Education is very important and the Health Education Bureau do a very good job in the whole area of concern for health.  Perhaps if more funds were at their disposal they could do far more.  In this area advertising would be an important factor, and I am not thinking of the conventional advertisement.  Actual situations should be shown, the problems related to accidents, what caused them and how they could have been avoided. This type of advertising would be educational and would help considerably.</P>
    <P>Some people would say that there are vested interests in the area of motor accidents, in the legal and medical professions, but I am quite sure that while many people reap a very good harvest from motor accidents nobody would be so evil as not to want to see the situation improved.  A large sum of money is involved and the Minister told us that the charges to be levied could provide income of up to £4 million per year.  In many cases this money is paid a long time after <Col N="205" /> it becomes due.  Could some means be provided for payment at the appropriate time and, if not, is there an interest charge for delays, because in many other areas where money remains unpaid for some considerable time there is an interest charged on it?  Does this apply in this instance?</P>
    <P>Where serious injury takes place and there is a problem about car insurance, compensation is paid from a special fund. This is admirable, but where a commercial vehicle is involved there is no payment.  I know of one situation where two young girls who took a &ldquo;lift&rdquo; to a dance were seriously injured and because they were not properly covered in the van they got no compensation.  If they had been in a motor car they would have been compensated.  This anomaly should be eliminated.  The only difference was that the van did not have windows in it as a car would have had, but in all other ways it was similar.  It was a small vehicle that took these people from one place to another.  I would ask the Minister to look seriously at this problem because these two young girls were seriously injured and disabled to a considerable extent for the rest of their lives.  They were also disfigured to some extent and there was no compensation available for them.  This is wrong.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon has referred to the consultants and expert witnesses and I am sure some way could be found to avoid the waste of time attending a court hearing.  Anybody who has attended as an expert witness at a court, or indeed as any kind of witness, knows that time means nothing in the court.  The person could be held all day and indeed for many days. I would agree with Senator Fallon that some means should be found to reduce this time because a consultant charges for all his time, even the time he is not in the witness box and that to a large extent, while he may be paid for it, is wasted time.  Something should be done in this area.</P>
    <P>There is also the effect on health services in consequence of these accidents. Beds are taken up, particularly in orthopaedic hospitals, and other cases are kept <Col N="206" /> waiting for a long period, for example, hip and knee operations.  People suffer in this respect.  Doctors and experts would have far more time to make progress in the area of rheumatism and arthritis if they were not detained due to accidents which occur through carelessness.</P>
    <P>Inevitably there will be an insurance increase and I wonder has the Minister taken this into account.  What increase might we expect?  As Senator Fallon has said, there is a special committee attempting to see that insurance charges are reduced.  They are far too high at the moment.  In many cases very high payments have been made and many of us know of incidents where high payments were made to people who unfortunately did not live long enough to enjoy the money and it passed to relatives and people not so closely related.</P>
    <P>I, too, would like to know what the situation is regarding voluntary hospitals. The prime concern of the Minister is for the health boards.  At the same time the voluntary hospitals fill a very important role.  I am sure it would be the concern of the Minister to see that voluntary hospitals are paid in the same way and continue to do the important work they are doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the charge is not specified but would normally be the average daily cost per bed at the hospital coancerned.  I notice that the consultant's fees are not included.  Perhaps this is the concern of the consultant himself, but I am sure there would also be cases where the medical people involved might be remunerated by the hospital.  Is that charge also included?</P>
    <P>As the Minister has told us, the principle of recovering the costs of road traffic victims can be traced back to the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  This was disrupted in 1983, due to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <i>Cooke</i> v. <i>Walsh.</i></P>
    <P>There is nothing contentious in the Bill except, as Senator Fallon said, it does not go far enough.  The general thrust of the Bill and the general principle is one to which no reasonable person could take exception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>You should not, and neither should the Opposition.  It is important to protect the taxpayer in a situation such as this.  At present, with the anomaly that has arisen out of this court case, the taxpayer is funding, by way of services provided, insurance companies which are already charging a premium to cover this particular risk.  The Supreme Court decided in December 1983 that the then Minister did not have the power under the 1970 Act to make a regulation which would allow us to charge for services given in road traffic accidents.  I am satisfied, as an insured road user, that my premium was not reduced as a result of the December 1983 court <Col N="208" /> decision.  The insurance companies have been charging a premium to cover this risk and since that court decision have not reduced their premiums.  The taxpayer is now at risk of having to compensate the health boards for the services they gave to road traffic victims.  It is appropriate that we should legislate to allow no loophole for the Supreme Court to make a decision.  That is a fault of the 1970 Act. The then Minister, the late Mr. Childers, committed himself to ensuring that charges could and should be made where decisions were given in court and he implemented that.  Indeed, a previous Act going back to 1933 had been implemented.  I found, when I was a member of a health board in 1983, that this decision left the health boards in a very vulnerable position.</P>
      <P>One can argue that a person who was a medical card holder and who had a road accident was entitled to hospital services. However after a substantial award, three or four years later, it would be arguable whether a person was still entitled to the health services.  That can be applied to the whole 1970 Act, which ensures that everybody is entitled to free hospital services.  It is only at certain levels of income that a person is obliged to pay consultants' fees.  In court cases everybody is compensated by the decision of the court, including the consultants' and witnesses, except the taxpayer who in this instance is represented by the health board, which provides emergency services.  I am satisfied it is appropriate that we should tidy up the anomaly that is there.  I am also satisfied that the existing premiums charged by insurance companies take into account the fact that they are likely to be called upon to meet this charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some interesting points have been raised by Senators.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with them in his reply.  We can then make a decision as to when we will take Committee Stage.  If we get assurances and have a discussion on possible amendments, the Minister can reassure the House as to how we can move on this legislation.  I am satisfied that it is necessary legislation.  I am satisfied that it is relatively simple: it is regularising a <Col N="209" /> situation which we all thought prevailed under the 1970 Act.</P>
    <P>I would like a few points clarified.  They deal particularly with court cases and decisions of the court.  Senator Fallon made the point that the insurance company will be paying the money and that they will be deciding.  I take it the legislation refers to decisions made in the court which will allocate expenses for the injured party.  The consultants will be compensated for their time and efforts.  The hospitals will be covered.  But this is presuming that the case goes to court and that a jury or a court will give a decision in favour of the plaintiff.  However, if an arrangement is made between two insurance companies that rather than go to the expense of going to court they will settle the case outside court for, perhaps a larger amount of money and if the person benefitting has already been a patient in a hospital, how will the health board know what goes on behind the scenes or what settlements are made outside court?  Does this Act give power to the Minister or the health board to recoup directly from the insurance company the expense involved in the provision of the service?  The Minister is talking about allowing health boards to waive charges where the court awards an amount which would not cover the hospital charges.  I am not sure what the overall loss to hospital services is.  A figure of £4 million was mentioned.  Is this an annual figure or is this the loss incurred since the court decision of 1983?  Most medical services given, except in extreme cases where people are hospitalised for an extended period, would run at £2,000 or £3,000.  If a decision is arrived at by an insurance company confidentially, how will hospitals and health boards become aware of that decision?  What I want to avoid is people having to go to court to get compensation so that the health board can be paid because the Bill mentions &ldquo;decisions of the court&rdquo;.  If I could have clarification of that it would make me happier about what we are doing.  We all want the boards to be compensated for the services.  We all know that people are paying insurance premiums to cover that.  We do <Col N="210" /> not want the insurance companies to get away with this legitimate charge.  We also want to ensure that the legislation is not draconian and that there would not be loopholes in it.  Chief executive officers of health boards have quite substantial powers of discretion in regard to medical cards, hospital service cards and a whole lot of other areas which are decided in offices.  People can make direct representations, and we all do.  Discretionary powers are ones that always worry me. They have worried me in the social welfare area.  They have worried me in the supplementary welfare area.  I have already put my views on that subject on the record of this House.  I do not like discretionary powers.  If one can have something that is black or white it is probably better.  Discretion is the better part of valour, they say, but I know that discretion can even be politically motivated.  In a small democracy it is appropriate when given a discretion, to make a decision based on the evidence before one and not on who presents it.  Let us ensure, if we are giving discretionary powers, that they will be used for the benefit of the person who is expected to pay for their hospital services although at the time of the accident they would have been entitled to free hospital services.</P>
    <P>I do not have any problems with this legislation.  I served on a health board for many years where we thought we had this power.  It did not create any problems for us.  It gave us a source of income for a service we were giving.  The service we give is a good service in spite of some of the comments made by some people and the criticisms that have been levelled at the Minister.  It is a service that a lot of people do not appreciate until they require it.  It is often only when they require a health service that people are prepared to pay for it.  The PRSI contributor has no option.  He has to pay for it out of his pay packet every week.  I have found that people who have the discretion to pay for the service, because they are either self-employed or in a category outside of the PAYE sector, have allowed bills in health boards to accrue for a number of years.  It is only when <Col N="211" /> they require the hospital service that they look for the facility to pay back the four or five years of arrears which they owe.</P>
    <P>There has been an improvement in this area, but it has taken a lot of coaxing to get people to pay their health contribution.  The boards have been so inept at collecting this contribution that the Government had to resort to putting it into the area of the Revenue Commissioners to collect it.  That is the attitude among a section of the public who always ensure that they have their VHI contributions paid up and that they benefit from their VHI membership although they have benefited also from a lot of direct public input into the provision of the basic services.  They never dream for a moment that the taxpayer has to be compensated in any way for having built the hospital, provided the hospital with staff, provided food, medicine, doctors, nurses and so on.  That is part of the PRSI and the taxpayers' input.  The VHI is the exclusive right of other people who require a personalised service.  That is very nice, and if people want that service they are entitled to have it.  But let us ensure, if we are giving a public health service, that in an area like this, where there are people insured in another way, the health boards will be compensated appropriately and that we will have some revenue accruing from a situation where up to now, because of the Supreme Court decision, we have not had that power.  It is appropriate to put the matter right.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would respond in his reply to some of the points we have raised.  We would then be in a position to decide when to take the Committee Stage.  I am anxious to regularise this and I want to facilitate the Opposition or anybody who wants to put amendments down.  Nobody intimated to me until today that they had problems with the Bill.  Perhaps we could come to some agreement between the Whips about this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few brief comments on this Bill.  The explanatory memorandum states that the purpose of the Bill is to <Col N="212" /> enable health boards to charge for hospital services provided to a person who received or is entitled to receive damages or compensation for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident.  Like the previous speakers I agree with the principle of the Bill although I, too, would like to be informed about what the position is in relation to persons who receive damages or compensation in respect of injuries suffered in accidents of other kinds.  I wonder if the situation is that these people are entitled to the services that their eligibility under the Health Act entitles them to, or are they also liable for hospital charges.  As has been stated by the Minister, the necessity for this Bill arose because of the decision of the Supreme Court on the 16 December 1983 in the case of <i>Cooke</i> v. <i>Walsh.</i> The position prior to that case was that a person who was treated in hospital for injuries received in a road accident had to pay for such treatment irrespective of his or her entitlement to services under the Health Act.  This was because article 6 (3) of the Health Services Regulations, 1971, excluded from the class of persons with full eligibility for hospital in-patient and out-patient services those who required treatment for injuries received in a road traffic accident unless it appeared that such persons would not be entitled to receive damages or compensation from another person in respect of the injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that it was conceded in the <i>Cooke</i> v. <i>Walsh</i> case that but for this regulation the plaintiff would have been entitled to hospital services free of charge.  The Supreme Court decided that the regulation in question was <i>ultra vires</i> the Minister because it purported to exclude from the benefit of the services a category of persons whose exclusion was in no way authorised or contemplated by the Health Act.  The effect of that decision has been that health boards can no longer charge road traffic accidents victims for hospital treatment merely because they were road accident victims.  Accordingly, the position since has been that, irrespective of whether a patient is a road accident victim, he or she must be provided free of charge with <Col N="213" /> whatever hospital or medical treatment he or she is entitled to under the Health Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides in section 2 that the health board shall make a charge against the person who is injured in an accident or against his or her personal representative in respect of that person's in-patient and out-patient services arising from the accident.  The effect of this will be that if a person is injured in an accident the relevant health board will be obliged to hold that person responsible for hospital charges arising out of the accident. Section 2 (a) provides that under certain conditions the health board may waive the whole or part of any charges due to them.</P>
    <P>This waiver, of course, is limited and one would be dependent upon the discretion of the health board.  The phrase used in the section is that the health board &ldquo;may waive&rdquo;.  A position could arise whereby a person might be seriously injured in a road traffic accident and might be hospitalised in intensive care for a month or two months thereafter and might subsequently die.  That person's personal representative might not be aware of the legal situation regarding claiming compensation, might do nothing about the matter and would then find himself being pursued by the health board for possibly a huge medical bill.  It could also happen that a person might decide not to bring a claim arising out of an accident as such a person might feel that he or she had a very flimsy case on the issue of liability.  Here again this person would be liable under the proposed legislation to pay the health board.</P>
    <P>One can also envisage how this proposed legislation could affect the possible settlement of claims.  There might be a case whereby a person suffered very serious injuries which resulted in huge hospital bills.  However, that person might be in trouble on the liability aspect of the matter.  Often in such cases the relevant insurance companies make efforts to settle the claim for considerably less than the full value.  In the normal course of events a person who is made such an offer might be well advised to <Col N="214" /> accept the offer because of his position on liability.  Under the provisions of this Bill it would seem that such a person would have to consult the relevant health board first to see what their attitude would be to their expenses, because if a person was being offered a settlement on a fifty-fifty basis he would probably have to be satisfied that the health board would also agree to their costs being settled on a fifty-fifty basis.</P>
    <P>One could have a situation where a claim might be worth in its full value a figure in the region of £400,000 of which £200,000 might comprise of hospital bills. In that case, if a person was very weak on liability and if an offer of £100,000 was made, it would be unwise for the person involved to accept that offer, even though it might be a very good offer, without first consulting the health board.  If the case was settled for £100,000 then the health board could not only recover the £100,000 settlement from the injured person but they could also sue him for the balance of the fees due.</P>
    <P>Like the other speakers, while I agree with the principle of the Bill, I have reservations about it; and I certainly agree with many of the reservations that have been expressed by Senators Fallon and Durcan and the other Senators who have spoken.  On the final page of his speech the Minister, in recommending this Bill to the House, made four points.  He stated that charges have been levied in these circumstances since 1933.  We all have to accept that point and agree with it.  Secondly, he made the point that insurance companies have been paid premiums to underwrite these risks.  I accept that insurance companies do, in computing their premiums, take into account the risks of treatment costs and medical costs.  He also stated that the Exchequer should not be called upon to bear the cost of negligent drivers.  Again, we would have to agree with that point.  However, I have reservations about the fourth point he made, which is that adequate precautions have been taken to ensure that no hardship will accrue to the injured party. As I see it, the injured party in many <Col N="215" /> instances will be at the mercy of the discretion of the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not stated what the position will be in the case of people who receive out of court settlements or settlements from the Motor Insurance Bureau.  Neither has he stated what the position will be of persons who might be entitled to some compensation or damages but who for one reason or another do not claim.  He has not stated what the position will be in the case of a person who receives a settlement without admission of liability or without an admission of negligence.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (a) refers to the fact that the injury must be caused to a person by the negligent use of a mechanically propelled vehicle.  As we are all aware, on occasions compensation is paid without any admission of negligence.  This can be particularly true when the compensation is paid for mental distress.  I would like to know what the position will be of persons who receive compensation where negligence is not admitted.</P>
    <P>Also I would like to ask, in relation to section 2 (c), who will determine whether a person is entitled to receive damages or compensation.  In my view, only a court can determine whether a person is entitled to receive damages or compensation, but the Bill here would appear to put the onus of so deciding on the health board.</P>
    <P>The Minister also seems to imply in his speech that the waiver will only apply in the case of claims which are determined by the courts.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that the waiver will apply to all claims irrespective of whether they are determined by the courts or whether they are arrived at by way of an out of court settlement.  Indeed, as a previous speaker has said, I would like to see that section strengthened up very much in that I would like to see a situation where the board would be obliged to waive either the whole or part of a charge in certain cases.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the principle of the Bill, I have reservations about certain sections of it and I will be very interested <Col N="216" /> to hear the Minister's reply to the points I have raised and to the point that have been raised by other Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this Bill opens up a debate about many aspects of the obligation of the State to cope with the accident victim and the way in which he is to be compensated.  In welcoming the spirit of the Bill, in sharing some of the concerns that have been expressed about the way in which it will be operated and the wording of it, it is important for us to identify the three areas which have been a cause of concern and which have been expressed by various Senators.</P>
      <P>First of all, there is the area of personal compensation for accident; second, there is the cost to the health services and rehabilitatory services involved and, third, the cost to the rest of us in the form of the State and the taxes we pay to the State for the service we provide and the way in which we compensate people affected by accidents.  I can introduce the subject right at the coal face.  In my experience as a surgeon one-third of all the work I do is traumatic and urgent that is, it is the result of some form of accident whether it is an accident at work, accident at home, accident on holiday, accident on the roads or accident through civil disturbance.</P>
      <P>It has always struck me as very odd that in certain circumstances you could fall and paralyse yourself and get nothing, no compensation from anybody, and in other circumstances you can get vast compensation, you can die the next day and your relatives can be rich for ever afterwards.</P>
      <P>It has been alluded to by Senators that one needs to look into the whole area of how compensation is paid and on what grounds it is paid.  It is quite at odds to fall off the Giant's Causeway, fracture your back and get nothing &mdash; it is looked upon as it was your own fault &mdash; and to fall off a step ladder in the Oireachtas and be able to sue the State for thousands of pounds for the same injury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to illustrate another point. I remember a man in Ballymoney being <Col N="217" /> shot through the thigh about 12 years ago.  We brought him into the hospital, looked after him, rehabilitated him as best we could, and sent him home.  The great day came when I got the solicitor's letter to write a report and say what state he was in.  When this citizen who then lived among us but is now in exile, arrived into the out-patients department, he hobbled in with a stick and suitable facial contortions.  I examined him, and being fairly gullible by nature, I thought he was in a severe state of decomposition as a result of his injury and I duly wrote a solicitor's report.  Fortunately that report, through procrastination, lay on my desk for a number of weeks.</P>
    <P>In the ensuing time the glorious twelfth of immortal memory was celebrated in the streets of Ballymoney and I went out to watch the bands passing from the front of the hospital and to my utter amazement I saw my erstwhile injured man walking out with the best of them in his best suit making for the field.  I was able to go back to the letter and put a PS to my solicitor's report that &ldquo;since writing this I have had an opportunity to observe your client marching with his lodge on the 12th July and he seemed quite remarkably to be restored to his normal state of health.&rdquo;  I only mention that in passing because there is the professional class conspiracy and there are also some conspirators who are not in the profession in relation to the whole area of claims. There may be the exception but nevertheless they exist and one needs to be very wary.</P>
    <P>When we move into the area of cost to the State, cost to the insurance companies, cost to the taxpayer we should start to look at how these costs are met. No one who is practising in the area of trauma and who has been asked to give legal reports will be unaware of the ridiculous situation in which you give a report, two years later you are asked to give another report on the same person, two years later again you are asked to give another report, and finally the case comes to court and is duly settled.  For all of these reports you are expected to send in a fairly handsome fee and if you consider <Col N="218" /> that you are not the only surgeon involved, that there may be two or three not only in your own town but in other towns, and then you arrive in the court and there is introduced this extraordinary thing which I thought should have been alien to justice: you are asked which side you are on.  I thought if one was giving evidence one should be giving evidence regardless of sides but I am told that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I hope I will see the day when the fees that are paid to people like myself for legal reports and for going to court are made public and that we know where we stand in relation to the amount of money that is going to the professional, expert witness because that comes out of the insurance company.  That needs to be said because otherwise we have got a professional class conspiracy going on behind closed doors.  The onus is on those who do not believe that there is such a thing to be prepared to push out into the open exactly what money passes hands when cases go to court and when expert witness is given.  I look forward to the day but I think I may be a very old man before it actually comes about.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up the points raised by Senator Fitzsimons in particular because he spoke almost as though he was in a casualty accident department. Of course he is absolutely right.  The cost for accident surgery would be greatly diminished if we paid serious attention to prevention.  I know the Minister is very keen on prevention as indeed former Ministers for Health have been.  I could not emphasise enough the need to get across that seat belts are part of the law of the land and if there was no other distinction to be made between the North and the South of Ireland one could make it in the area of seat belts.  One sees very few people driving around in the North not wearing seat belts.  I can hardly ever see anyone wearing a seat belt in the Republic in spite of the figure of 66 per cent which was quoted today.  I have even asked a taximan in Dublin where his seat-belt was and the man looked at me absolutely thunderstruck and dismayed.  Then I have to ask: &ldquo;You do have a seat belt <Col N="219" /> law down here&rdquo;.  Sometimes one wonders.  As a person who opposed the introduction of seatbelts on the grounds that it was an infringement on individual freedom of liberty and so on, I am now a complete convert.  I see it in my own practice.  I no longer have to sit through the night.  One, two or three hours stitching up peoples faces in particular.  There is no doubt that if seatbelts were properly used there would be a dramatic fall in the incidence of need for hospital attention, the costs that go with it and the unpleasantness for those affected.</P>
    <P>The next point is about speed.  I have been driving up and down to Dublin &mdash; I used to come by plane, then I went by train and now I come by car because of the fact that I had a problem in the hospital last year which literally shook the living daylights out of me.  I have been coming by car since and I drive at a fierce speed.  I have never been stopped nor have I ever felt that there was any likelihood of my being stopped by anyone in a speed car.  There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that the incidence of accidents is related to speed and the faster you go on Irish roads the more likely you are to have accidents.</P>
    <P>The state of the roads is important but more important is the MOTing of cars. It is no good driving carefully if the brakes do not work.  Part of the greatly decreased incidence of road traffic accidents in the North has been due to these factors, (1) they are very fortunate due to the subsidised money that has come in from across the water, to have excellent road surface; (2) the MOTing of the cars; (3) seat belts; and (4) the greater attention paid to random testing of blood/alcohol, urine/alcohol or the breathalyser test on the road.  These are all very important.</P>
    <P>When we move on to the area of insurance, there is a trend in western society where your friend asks if you are insured and, your garage asks if you are insured. The implication in the first case is that he will sue if you are insured but he will not bother if you are not because it is a trivial injury.  Then the garage asks.  Will the hospital now find out if you are insured? <Col N="220" /> What effect will this have on hospital charges?  We need to be very careful that we do not move into an area where the health boards see the possibility of recouping money through insurance companies on victims of accidents.  I am sure the Minister will have that taken into account by the time this Bill is enacted. There seems to be a trend in that direction, and it has had very regrettable effects, along with the increase in litigation, on the practice of surgery and on the practice of medicine in general. People are now practising with one eye on the patient and the other eye on the legal process, and not necessarily making the decisions which are correct for the patient because of the worry and concern about where it might land him if there is a legal complication.</P>
    <P>Important points were made about the time taken up in litigation.  You only have to go to the High Court and do a quick check on how many consultants are standing around.  One should also ask who is doing their work?  If you are a full time consultant it is arguable that any fees accruing should not be accruing to you at all; and if you are a part time consultant is more time than what you are contracted for being allowed for extraneous activities such as attendance at court?  All of these things are brought to mind by the proposal to introduce this Bill.  I have been part of the system.  I have seen it.  I have criticised it.  I have been part of the criticism.  We should discuss these matters quite openly because vast sums of money are undoubtedly involved in the whole processing of litigation for compensation claims for accidents.  It is important at the end of the day to ensure that those who suffer injury get the compensation which is due to them and that that compensation is reasonably allocated and is justly collected.</P>
    <P>There is need to look into the whole area of accident compensation, not just road traffic accident compensation.  Road traffic accidents are only one section of that 33 per cent of common surgical practice which reaches our hospitals and which costs the State so much.  I welcome <Col N="221" /> the Bill.  The health service should not be paying for other people's negligence.  At the same time those who find themselves in a hospital bed must be protected.  I also feel that the citizen in general should have the same sort of protection, regardless of where he has his accident or what causes it, as is implied by the insurance cover of people affected by road traffic accidents and, of course, he should receive the same service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the points which I had intended to speak on have virtually been covered by earlier speakers, so I do not intend to bore the House by repetition.  This Bill is fairly necessary and has wide support in the House.  It arises because of the Supreme Court decision in 1983 which declared that the Minister's powers with regard to the recovery of hospital costs for accident victims under the Road Traffic Act were null and void. There has been some reference during the afternoon to negligence of one kind or another.  I wonder is the Minister for Health a bit negligent.</P>
      <P>This is a very simple Bill.  During the past two and a half years health boards have lost very considerable amounts in their incomes.  During that time they have been faced with making decisions, as has the Minister himself, which were of a very extreme character and which, many would agree, reduced the quality of the health services in the country.  I am asking this House is it then proper that we should wait two and a half years for an extremely simple Bill which returns the power to the Minister which he was understood to have prior to 1983.  That is an inordinate amount of time for the Minister and his officials to bring to this House this Bill, which is widely supported, is very necessary and seems to deal with the nuts and bolts of that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not put an estimate on the amount of money which has been lost. Obviously, the insurance companies took this risk into account in determining their premiums.  Why should those of us who are members of health boards be faced with the day to day problems of trying to cope with carrying on the health services <Col N="222" /> in the face of cutbacks when there was a mechanism available all of this time which would have brought significant funds into the health boards?</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to indicate to this House the estimated loss of income to the health boards over the past two and a half years arising from this Supreme Court decision.  Would he indicate to the House to what extent during 1986 the health boards have assumed income from this source in the knowledge that this Bill was coming before the House?  If it passes all Stages it will have about six months to run.  Has an estimation been given to the health boards and have they in turn estimated what their income will be arising from it and has this been taken into account in the overall decisions which are being taken in relation to their budgets?</P>
    <P>The cost to health boards as a result of traffic accidents is quite enormous.  We know that 80 per cent of the surgical and medical activities in the orthopaedic hospitals is catering for accidents.  I acknowledge that a number of those accidents happen at home and not on the road.  However, it is a safe bet that more than 50 per cent of the time of the consultant, medical and nursing staff in the orthopaedic and rehabilitation centres is taken up in dealing with accident victims. Therefore, I support all the Senators who have pleaded for a more positive attitude towards the prevention of accidents, whether it is an improvement of roads, a reduction in the level of alcohol which people who take charge of cars consume, defective vehicles, more comprehensive coverage and detection on the part of the Garda of habits which tend to lead towards accidents.</P>
    <P>We need to concentrate on that area. While we are talking about funds and about ways to increase the health boards' funds, the real trauma, the real problem, is for the victims, many of whom are deprived of their lives and others very considerably deprived of the use of their limbs for very long periods.  While we acknowledge that the health boards and the hospital services have to be available to give the best possible service to these <Col N="223" /> victims, the cost of this should not have to be determined prior to the services being provided.  This Bill is very necessary and I am absolutely at a loss to know why it could not have been introduced two years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw a distinction in respect of this Bill between the principle of compensation or of reimbursement to the health boards of the expenses which they have incurred as a result of treating road traffic accident victims and the actual method which the Minister proposes to introduce to bring about that objective.  I am unenthusiastic about the principle but I can assure the Minister that I have no intention of objecting to the principle and that I know it is a matter on which people have different viewpoints.  There is not a correct side or a correct view on it.  We are really deciding that it is better to have slightly higher levels of motor insurance premiums and slightly lower levels of taxation. In the long term, we are shifting resources from one side to the other.  I could have very little objection to the Minister's objective in doing that, as long as we realise that is what we are doing.</P>
      <P>It is simplistic to ask whether premiums have come down in the intervening period of time.  Premiums are adjusted from time to time and take into account every single factor which makes up the insurance risk.  This, of course, is just one such factor.  It is impossible to prove that premiums have not gone up by as much as they would otherwise have gone up but that argument will be made by the other side.  It is simplistic to suggest that this should have given rise to a reduction in insurance premiums and it did not.  I do not think we should approach it along that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Senator Smith is a good one.  I do not understand why the Minister should have to wait for two and a half years to introduce this Bill.  No doubt he will tell us the reason for that.  I was quite interested to hear what Senator <Col N="224" /> Robb had to say about the whole principle of compensation for accident victims generally.  It is true, of course, that a very convincing argument can be made against substantial capital sum payments. I must say that I find myself in sympathy with the general viewpoint that these capital sum payments should not be made on a philosophical level.  However, the problems that would be created by substituting for that, for example, a weekly payment, is such that you would reinforce dependency in the population.  If lump payments have any benefit they have the benefit of bringing to an end the period of time in which people who have been subject to these injuries must, even subconsciously, consider themselves to be still suffering from whatever disability they allege they have been suffering from.</P>
    <P>It is not just a question of honesty.  It is a question of a subconscious feeling that I hurt my neck or my back in a traffic accident and it does not clear up until after the court case is over.  If you have a situation where people are going to be paid a weekly sum for the rest of their lives it could become a growth industry. Everybody will want a weekly sum which will be a guaranteed income for the rest of their lives.  I know the Irish people and that is the way they would react to that scheme.  They would react to it in the same way as certain sections of the population react to the disability benefit scheme, that it is some kind of a scheme which can be used for the granting of premature old age pensions to people rather than granting them protection for temporary disablement or permanent disablement which was the original purpose.  Maybe lump sum payments are a bad idea but I am not altogether convinced that the alternative of weekly payments is suitable to the Irish temperament.  I would need much more persuasion before I could support that approach towards compensation.  The whole business of compensation is one which must be tackled at some time in the future and I look forward to participating in that debate.</P>
    <P>I accept the principle contained in the <Col N="225" /> Bill but it has one major defect.  Senator Cregan by his look, obviously does not agree with me.  The major defect which the Bill has is in subsection (2) of section 2 which has already been referred to by a number of Senators.  The granting of a discretion to the health board there may give rise to considerable difficulty in practice.  The Minister may be able to say that on the previous occasion no great difficulty was encountered.  Times change and this is a new scheme which is starting from scratch.  The health boards are under pressure for money in a way that they have never been under pressure for money before, and I think it is only right that they should be under that pressure. They are under pressure and any Minister for Health whether it is the present Minister, a substitute Minister from the same Coalition or in any possible alternative Government, will have to keep the expenditure of the health boards under control.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances the Minister is introducing this scheme into a climate where the health boards are under great pressure for money.  It is in that context that we should see what problems might be created by the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in subsection (2), the first sentence of which states that a health board may waive the whole or part of a charge. Subparagraph 1 of subsection (2) (a) is quite reasonable because that is a discretion to cover the general cases that may arise from time to time that we cannot anticipate.  The second one is more specific.  It seeks to establish a situation as to what will happen when there is a degree of contributory negligence.  It seems to suggest that the health authority would in such circumstances rebate the amount of their charge to take into account the amount of the contributory negligence.  It fails, of course, to impose any obligation on the health authority to do that.  That could have disastrous consequences for the person who has been injured.</P>
    <P>I can give some practical examples of it.  Take the case where a person suffers an injury.  I am not talking about a <Col N="226" /> dramatic injury but a broken leg or something like that which requires a little bit of treatment and from which there is a complete recovery.  We will say in those circumstances that a person decides to go to the Circuit Court or the High Court at a lower jurisdiction of that court and is entitled to a compensation in respect of their injuries in general damages, that is for pain and suffering in the past and in the future say, £10,000.  We will say their medical expenses for the sake of argument amount to £5,000 giving a total potential award of £15,000.</P>
    <P>Let us, first of all, consider what will happen if this goes to court.  We will say the court ascribes to the individual concerned 60 per cent of the responsibility for the accident and against the defendant 40 per cent.  The result of that is that the person is entitled to reclaim only 40 per cent of £15,000 damages, £10,000 for general damages and £5,000 for medical expenses.  In other words the person will get a cheque ultimately for £6,000.  This is after a court award.  This is not a settlement case.  On receipt of that cheque for £6,000 it will fall on the health authority at that stage to determine what portion, if any, of the £5,000 medical expenses they will in fact collect from the individual.  The general tenor of what the Minister has said is that they will collect £2,000.  That is 40 per cent of the £5,000, leaving the person with a net £4,000, which would be the correct calculation.  But there is no obligation on the health authority to make that remission.</P>
    <P>The health authority may decide that it is going to charge £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000 and the legislation as drafted will support it in that decision.  So you could have a situation where a person in receipt of £6,000 could have to pay £5,000 to the health authority and receive in respect of the injury a sum of only £1,000 in general damages in circumstances like that.  You can do many calculations which will arrive at a different set of figures, but the principle is still the same.</P>
    <P>When the court awards a sum of money, that award is a separate judicial <Col N="227" /> decision-making from the decision-making which will take place later when the health board will decide what to charge.  Any occasion where two separate people decide on the same issue gives rise to a potential conflict.  A court might decide that in certain circumstances a person should get only 40 per cent compensation, but the health board might decide in its wisdom not to accept that assessment of the position and there is no obligation on it to so do.  In those circumstances you can see that, while of course it is reasonable to assume that the Minister means that they are to limit their charge to 40 per cent and it is reasonable to assume that the health board will do that in most cases, they will, in so far as I have been able to ascertain, be under no statutory obligation to so do.  That places the person on whom the charge falls in a considerable disadvantageous position.  I do not know how he can successfully challenge a decision by the health board, taken after his court case has been settled, to charge the full amount or an amount which does not rebate to the full extent of the contributory negligence.</P>
    <P>That is the problem that arises where the decision is by the court.  Consider the problem that would arise when you come to settle a case.  Most cases are settled, in spite of what people say, before anyone gets substantial lawyer's fees.  That is something which should be encouraged rather than discouraged.  This aspect of the case as applied to the problem of settling cases is going to mean that the tendency will be for more cases to go to trial because of the problems that may be created by settling a case.  Consider the case I mentioned earlier: damages of the order of £15,000 &mdash; £10,000 general damages and £5,000 medical expenses.  A person is offered before the hearing of the accident a sum of £6,000, the full value being £15,000, and there is a question of liability.  It would appear that before accepting that figure of £6,000 a decision would have to be got from the health board as to what portion of the £5,000 medical expenses they would <Col N="228" /> remit in the event of the person accepting the £6,000.  In order for the health board to make that decision they would have to be advised by someone as to what the full value of the case is.  They would have to be advised that the full value of this case is £15,000, the plaintiff proposes to accept £6,000 and, therefore, he is, in effect accepting 40 per cent of the full value and will remit down to 40 per cent of what the total bill is.  But are there people in the health board competent enough to be able to make that assessment on their own?  If so, will their assessment agree with the assessment of the professional advisers of the plaintiff?  One can see that the number of problems this could give rise to is significant.</P>
    <P>Very often in the court itself &mdash; particularly in the Circuit Court and certainly where settlements are made &mdash; settlements are made on the basis of nobody mathematically calculating what the degree of contributory negligence is. That is something which is not really identified.  Somebody says a case is worth £100,000.  The insurance company makes an offer of £60,000.  You may decide to accept it because you might decide in the circumstances that the person does not want to appear in court.  There are a number of additional reasons why sometimes amounts which are less than the full value of the case are accepted, even in circumstances where liability is not an issue or they are accepted where liability is not an issue to the full amount of the discount being offered to them.  How will these people be fixed with regard to the payment of their medical expenses?  Who is going to advise the health board on that?  Will the health board undertake to take, in normal circumstances &mdash; I am not talking about the exceptional circumstances &mdash; the certificate of a solicitor or a barrister that the settlement represents a discount of so much?  You can see the difficulty that that gives rise to with regard to the settlement of cases.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the problem of the settlement of cases can be solved, but it would be of considerable assistance if there were two provisions included in this Bill which are not included in it.  One <Col N="229" /> is that a statutory obligation should be placed on the health board to take into account the degrees of contributory negligence where that has been judicially determined.  That is the first point. Secondly, I think some appeal mechanism in the other cases should be available for the dissatisfied plaintiff who accepts a settlement in a case and finds himself subsequently in dispute with the health board with regard to the amount of the charge.  An appeal mechanism of some kind should be made available to cater for that problem.</P>
    <P>It appears that this legislation is required quickly by the Minister.  I appreciate that.  It would be unrealistic of us on the one hand to expect him to explain why it took two-and-a-half years to produce the legislation and then delay it.  A delay of sufficient time to enable the Minister and his advisers to consider the points that have been raised in this House would be appropriate.  In those circumstances it is important that this Bill would receive mature consideration.</P>
    <P>Of course, it may well be that the Minister has considered all these matters. It may well be that the Minister, recognising the difficulties in this Bill, has pondered for many months on these problems.  It may well be that he has considered every point that has been raised here today.  I have no doubt, knowing how well Ministers are normally briefed in these matters, that these problems were considered.  But the fact that the Minister intellectually satisfied himself as to the correctness of the method which he proposed to solve these problems is only part of the problem.  He must then develop that to such an extent that he can persuade us of the error of our ways too, if in fact our ways are in error.  That requires time.  That requires a balancing of the various factors.  I would have imagined that if these problems had been considered by the Minister I would have suggested that it would have been helpful if they had been referred to in the Minister's Second Stage speech.  It may well be that the Minister has overwhelming and convincing arguments as to why there <Col N="230" /> will not be problems by the granting of this discretion to the health boards.</P>
    <P>The granting of this discretion, which is a discretion in cases which go to court, and which has been exercised after the exercise of another discretion by a different tribunal and the capacity of two separate decision-makers to make two separate decisions to the detriment of the plaintiff, is something that worries me.  I do not think it has been adequately catered for.  You have got to trust one tribunal to set the standard.  If the court says 40 per cent, 40 per cent it is.  If the court says 50 per cent, 50 per cent it is.  I know that does not solve the problem of settlements but at least that part of the problem would be solved if we were to grant to the court the decision-making power with regard to the percentage of contributory negligence.  I am not sure how we can solve the question of settlements.  One of the problems that might arise is that a disagreement on the terms of a settlement could necessitate the hearing of a case which would otherwise settle prior to going to court.</P>
    <P>Taking all these factors into account, I think the Bill is obviously welcomed by the vast majority of Senators in the House in so far as its objectives are concerned.  Our duty is to satisfy ourselves that the implementation of the objectives, which are shared by the majority of the Members, is helped and not hindered by the detailed terms of the Bill. In that regard the Minister must at this stage have formed the view that there exists among a cross-section of the Members of the House, and people in this area both professional and non-professional, some disquiet with regard to the practicality of the way in which the Minister has tackled the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be very long on this Bill.  It is a Bill that is welcome even though it is overdue.  It provides for the payment to the health boards sums of money to which they are entitled.  I am not sure what Senator O'Leary was getting at because he seemed to be protecting the client the whole time and not giving the protection to the health board <Col N="231" /> that this Bill purports to give.  I thought that this Bill was a means of giving the health boards payment for services which had been rendered to people who had been involved in accidents.  What Senator O'Leary suggested was that if they did not go to court, and make a settlement for less than the amount they claim, the health board should then waive their part of the charges to the percentage that the compensation has been reduced.  If there is a charge levied by the health board, and if the client accepts less than he originally claimed, why should the health board waive that proportion of the charges or compensation that had been looked for by the client.</P>
      <P>It would appear to me that when people are looking for compensation as a result of an accident they are going to inflate what they would settle for so that they will get a reduced amount of money. What Senator O'Leary seems to be suggesting is that if there is a reduction in the amount sought by the client, there should be a percentage reduction in the charges by the health board.  I do not think that should happen.  If the health board have a charge, irrespective of the compensation that is granted out of court or that is granted in court, the health board should be legally allowed to receive the costs incurred by the client irrespective of whether the client was partly negligent or fully negligent; otherwise how is the health board going to be able to deal with their finances.  We now have the situation in which it is suggested that the cost of the health board will be built into any compensation case being made by a client and when the case is settled the health board will be compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present it is taking up to three or four years for compensation cases to get through the courts.  This means that the health board which has provided a service today will not be paid for that service for three to four years.  Will interest be built into the health board charges in accident cases to compensate them for the loss of their moneys over the settlement period and if so is this not going to increase the <Col N="232" /> amount of compensation being asked for by a particular client?  The health boards are finding it extremely difficult to keep going at present.  Unless they get some sort of interest compensation as well as the actual amount of cost incurred by them in the beginning, they will be very much out of pocket at the end of the day. I would like to get clarification from the Minister on waiver of the whole or part of the charges.  Why should there be a waiver of the costs of the health board under any circumstances?  If somebody is getting compensation for an accident they should have to pay their medical expenses to the health boards.  As a member of a health board I feel very strongly about this.</P>
    <P>A number of points have been raised regarding the incidence of road accidents and their causation.  There is no doubt that speed and drink play a major part in the cause of accidents.  I sincerely hope that Senator Robb does not find that his remarks to the House do not rebound on him on his way back up to Belfast this evening.  It is very dangerous to say that I have never been stopped in a speed trap.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ran into three in the one day and all outside my own county which should not be worse but it was. Speed is a major factor in accident causation and results in higher insurance costs and costs for services for people who have been hurt.  I am glad to see that the European Commissioner is taking up the matter of speed.  As of now it is suggested that a two year MOT test be applied to all motor vehicles.  It is overdue that this should take place.  We have seen the MOT test on heavy duty vehicles implemented over the last six years.  There is absolutely no doubt that the standard of heavy duty motor vehicles on the road has improved.  Because of the higher standards and the fact that an MOT certificate has to be granted each year the number of accidents caused by heavy duty vehicles has dropped.  As we are in <Col N="233" /> an economic recession, new cars are not being bought at the same level as they should be bought.  This has resulted in too many cars which are not roadworthy being on the roads.  It frightens one to see when one is driving the number of cars with only one headlight and equally frightening is the number of cars with only one tail light.  If they cannot afford to put a bulb in the tail light or in the front, I would hate to see the condition of their steering, shock absorbers or brakes. There is no doubt that lack of maintenance allied to the fact that people do not have to maintain because they do not need an MOT certificate is a major cause of accidents.</P>
      <P>The question of seat belts and the condition of roads was raised again by Senator Robb.  In country areas once you get off the main roads and get on to county roads the potholes, overgrown ditches and hedges are causing more and more accidents.  I agree with him totally when he suggests that there should be random testing but the random testing should be of vehicles and drivers.  If, over a limited period, one had random testing of drivers and vehicles, not alone for alcohol based problems, but for their sight or their physical condition, I think that a number of drivers would be off the road.</P>
      <P>If there was a proper system of road checks for cars approximately 50 per cent of the cars which are on the roads would immediately be taken off as unsafe.  It worries me that this Bill is going to increase the cost of insurance.  There is no doubt that it will, at a time when insurance premiums are at a premium.  I am not too sure what the statistics are as to the number of uninsured vehicles on the road at present but there is no doubt that any further increase in insurance costs will disimprove that ratio of insured to uninsured vehicles and as one who was the victim of an accident caused by an uninsured driver I can assure you that it is a very costly situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point which I would like the Minister to address &mdash; something which Senator Fallon and Senator O'Leary also raised &mdash; is the situation whereby all compensation cases have been dealt with on <Col N="234" /> a lump sum basis up to now.  The cost of insurance could be dramatically decreased if claims were met over a period rather than in lump sums because once the compensation sum was assessed and put into a fund, the fund would be earning interest and the victim would be paid on a regular basis out of an interest-bearing fund.  If a fund like this was set up the cost of insurance should decrease.  As has been pointed out, in many cases where very high compensation has been paid the unfortunate victim of the accident, or the recipient of this high compensation, has not lived very long after the accident. Unfortunately the higher the level of compensation, the higher the level of injury and that would indicate that the person would have a shorter lifespan than would normally be expected.</P>
    <P>An investigation should take place as to the feasibility of phased payments in compensation rather than lump sum payments.  I read of a case where a person broke an ankle in a leisure resort in Ireland and as a result at 15½ years of age got nearly £700,000 in compensation.  If that money were invested at current rates of interest &mdash; that person would not have the use of this money until he reaches 21 &mdash; by the time that person reached 21 he would have over £1 million to invest. With £1 million of investment there is no doubt that the award was inordinate and I do not think that anybody could suggest that the purpose of compensation was ever meant to give an increasing return to somebody who has been in an accident.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not going to help in the cost of insurance, it equally will not decrease the length of time in which litigation takes place.  One of the major problems at present is that it takes too much time to get cases to court.  Sometimes the solicitors do not want to bring their clients to court until they have a full indication as to their recovery.  Doctors do not want to make a final assessment as to the long term or short term difficulties arising from an injury and it is often virtually impossible to get all the parties together in a short time and therefore the length of time in which litigation takes place is <Col N="235" /> too long and something will have to be done to get that cost down.</P>
    <P>The only criterion set down as to what the hospitals can charge is the cost per day, on which health boards are going to lose out.  Nevertheless, having suggested that there are reservations and we must look into the conditions of our roads, our vehicles and our drivers, this Bill is welcome but only to the degree that it is fully implemented giving full compensation to health boards which is the purpose of the measure.  At this stage I am not too worried about what happens to the person who is injured because that has nothing to do with this Bill.  I would like to see this waiver section taken out so that, when charges are made by health boards for hospital in-patient and out-patient services, in respect of treatment of injuries received in road accidents when the injury is caused by the negligent use of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place, and where the person receives or is entitled to receive damages or compensation in respect of such accidents, the health board will be fully compensated for their outlay in every circumstance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I deal with one particular issue first of all.  The question has been raised by Senator Lanigan and Senator O'Leary that there might be an increase in motor vehicle insurance premiums arising from this Bill.  I see absolutely no reason whatsoever why there should be any such increase because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I never said such a thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We can check the record but that was certainly the inference that I took from the comment.  I want to deal with that issue.  It is important to point out that in December 1983 when the Supreme Court made the judgment it automatically relieved the insurance companies of about £4½ million to £5 million a year of such payments.  They were transferred over to the health <Col N="236" /> system, to the hospitals and indeed straight on to the Department of Health. I estimate that the insurance companies have gained about £25 million to £30 million by virtue of that Supreme Court decision and the important point arising out of that is that in 1984 there was no reduction in premium rates arising from the Supreme Court judgment.  There was no reduction in 1985 and there was none this year and from the date of enactment of this legislation the imposition will go back on to the insurance companies.  They can, speaking quite bluntly, having had a respite of about £30 million, well and truly take this obligation back without in any way increasing premium rates. Indeed it is notable that in the intervening period many large outstanding claims have been settled &mdash; indeed the expedition with which they were settled might raise some eyebrows &mdash; and the backlog of cases has been cleared, some cases running to five or six years back.  That is my first point regarding the prospect of passing it on to the consumer in that framework.  That should not happen. There is absolutely no reason why it should happen.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of lump sum payments raised by a number of Senators and the prospect of their being phased, this is a matter entirely out of my hands because as Senators well know it is entirely a matter for the courts to decide the form and manner of payment. On the comment made by Senator O'Leary that we should substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; as to the discretionary element relative to the health boards, it is essential that there be a degree of waiver prospect for a health board.  It is quite possible, particularly bearing in mind the legal aspect of those accidents, that the plaintiff may have died.  The sum of money may be quite small.  The claim may not be worth pursuing to any inordinate degree.  In that framework the statutory, mandatory obligation on the health board could prove to be onerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, we must be careful on the question of collusion in terms of claims and collusion between an insurance company <Col N="237" /> and a plaintiff, for example, who may deliberately seek to have reduced the amount of compensation relative to medical claims.  A health board in that framework must have a substantial discretion to ensure that they are paid money which they deem is due.  Some claims by health boards can be quite enormous.  In my own constituency we have the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre.  I know of people in hospital for years who are on life support machines and it is important that the health system should have flexibility in ensuring that the hospital budgets have moneys coming into them from the insurance system to enable them to maintain such patients in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>Senators raised the question of occupational injury benefits.  Basically, bearing in mind that the Department of Social Welfare have the liability there and the Department of Health are equally involved, it is not necessary with that kind of cross payment to have that system introduced.  Senator Mullooly in particular raised that aspect.</P>
    <P>The essential difference in all the arguments here this evening is that motor insurance is a compulsory statutory requirement on the part of citizens. Therefore, the reason why there is an enabling provision in the Bill is that the health boards must levy in advance of the settlement of claims.  The fact that a health board will levy a particular charge on a patient does not necessarily mean that the patient is going to get all that money or that the health board will be recouped all of that money.</P>
    <P>The pre-levying of the patient enables the patient to go to court to face his solicitors, to launch his claim, to seek a settlement and that claim will have to be tabulated in detail by a health board. Nowadays one is talking about anything up to £800 a week in terms of ordinary hospital maintenance, leaving aside exceptional cases of surgery and so on required in many accident cases.</P>
    <P>It is also important to bear in mind that the situation is covered where there is an out-of-court settlement.  The claim will be on the table, even where there is an <Col N="238" /> out-of-court settlement.  A health board will still be enabled to inquire of the person who is being levied as to what happened each claim so that there is no prospect of collusion or a deliberate reduction; in other words, the account will be accrued and presented.  If a person enters into an out-of-court settlement which is manifestly inadequate and departs with £X,000 in their pocket and no provision for the health board, the health board are enabled to seek payment the ordinary way.  That power is now devolved on the health board itself.</P>
    <P>The question of voluntary hospitals was also raised and how they will relate in this matter.  There is a clear-cut provision that we will make the arrangements.  The health boards have arrangements already with the voluntary hospitals and will issue the accounts on behalf of the voluntary hospitals.  Since the health board is the statutory body for a given area providing the health services, the bills will be issued by the health board, having obtained them from the voluntary hospitals and will provide the service in that regard. This is an important point.  Particularly in the greater Dublin area where we have a preponderance of voluntary hospitals in operation.</P>
    <P>The question of postponing awards until all services have been provided is a matter for the courts and for the legislation eminating from the Department of Justice.  As I indicated previously, the question of periodic payments, phased payments, that again is a matter for the courts.  While I support many of the sentiments expressed here by Senators in relation to those matters, they are outside the ambit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan was concerned about the impact of retrospection and the prospect of it being employed in the Bill.  I sought the advice of the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General in relation to this matter.  This Bill arises from intense examination at Supreme Court level and the parliamentary draftsman is absolutely clear that there is no question of retrospection in it.  I am anxious that the Bill be enacted as quickly as possible.  It has now been before the <Col N="239" /> Dáil since the end of June 1985.  There was protracted delay in going through the Dáil because of the Dáil not coming back until October and then we ran into the budget shortly after Christmas.</P>
    <P>The other matters relating to the Statute of Limitations and so on are conventional enough within the framework of the Bill.  These, by and large, are the main points I make.  It will be of considerable benefit to the health boards to be able to get back on stream the collection of these moneys arising out of road traffic accidents.  From my experience driving around the country, I can tell Senator Robb that it never ceased to amaze me, even in the comfort of a State car and the relative safety of it, wearing a seat belt, the lack of the regard for life of our drivers.</P>
    <P>The preventative aspects raised here by Senator Fallon about the education of drivers is a matter for the Department of Environment.  We have a great deal of work to do in this area to bring home to people the absolute need for great care and bearing in mind the volume of cheap alcohol consumed in this country.  Drink prices have not increased over the past three or four years, something which is of dubious benefit to the Government in terms of popularity and which might well be regarded as a contributory aspect to legislation of this nature.  But that is by the way and I do not want to dwell unduly on it.  These are my broad observations at this stage and perhaps during the Committee Stage members may want to deal with some other aspects which I have not as yet had a chance to deal with.</P>

      <P>It is only fair to make a point.  The Minister said in his summing up on Second Stage that he was very anxious to get this Bill disposed of.  This Bill came before the Dáil in June of 1985 and the Dáil did not come back until October, 1985.  The point to be made, in fairness to the Members of this House is that we did come back in September 1985.  We have been sitting non stop since that time.  We would have been at the Minister's disposal to deal with the Bill any time since then.  It is a pity that a measure that is important and technical, is, in effect, being rushed through this House.  I do not say that in any way critically of the Minister but it is a point that should be put on the record, that all too frequently Members of this House are being forced to rush through technical legislation.  I have regard for the Minister and personally admire him very greatly. He does not like to hold up legislation but it does, nevertheless, have a bearing on the effect of our deliberations.</P>

      <P>In page 2, subsection (1) (b), line 32, to delete &ldquo;or will be&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this change of words, the worry would be that a subsequent condition set in after a claimant had been paid his compensation and after the health board had been paid their due entitlement for hospitalisation and in-patient and out-patient treatment.  Let us say some other condition set in four or five years later as a direct result of the accident, the danger would be that the health board would subsequently be entitled to go after that person.  If the person had to go to hospital or receive in-patient or out-patient treatment, the health board would pursue that patient on the grounds that the ultimate cause of the injury was a road traffic accident. Health boards are at the moment and probably for the next ten years will be very anxious to get as much revenue as they can.  They will seize every opportunity to get funds.  Unless this section is changed, in my opinion, it will give the health board the opportunity to go after that person for the cost of hospitalisation for the second time, even though the insurance company has paid up on the <Col N="243" /> first occasion.  Certainly, that is something that we would have to be worried about.  When the award is made, we will be told that is the award plus what hospitalisation has cost.  The health board will get their due financial entitlement for the stay in hospital and in-patient and out-patient services.  Something may happen. I gave an example on Second Stage: say in four or five years time arthritis or some other condition sets in as a direct result of the initial accident which hospitalised the person in the first instance.  If the health board can then proceed in the knowledge that their resources will be scarce they can go after the claimant and recoup money for the second stay in hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Lawyers are often criticised for the delays on their part in bringing personal injuries actions to completion.  One of the reasons is that it can often take time for doctors to give a definite prognosis as to the nature and extent of the injuries suffered by the injured party.  For that reason I do not agree with Senator Fallon's amendment.  In accepting any claim or in compromising any claim, one should be sure of the full nature and extent of the injuries sustained by a person.  In the event of there being a possibility of these injuries continuing, then one should be able to evaluate the cost of providing treatment in respect of those continuing injuries. Therefore, it is only right that the health board should be able to recover in respect of any cost incurred by them in respect of continuing injuries.  It seems that this subsection, as drafted, allows them to do that on a continuing basis.  Having said that, it does put the onus on the injured party or on the injured party's advisers to ensure that the matter is not settled or compromised too speedily.  For that reason I cannot find myself in agreement with Senator Fallon.</P>

      <P>The costs involved in continuing treatment can only be estimated.  I am sure that it would not be possible in any given case to calculate or compute accurately what the costs will be.  If the compensation or damages awarded to a patient is inadequate to cover the continuing costs, then it appears that this section will leave the patient liable to provide from within other elements of the compensation awarded a sum in respect of the additional treatment costs which arise.</P>

      <P>I support the points that have been made.  You cannot be absolutely certain of how a very serious injury is going to evolve over years.  No matter how much you may try, it will be extremely difficult.</P>
      <P>Let us take the case of severe burn as a result of a road traffic accident.  The person injured may have to go back into hospital 20 times, or even more, for various skin grafting procedures and reconstructing procedures over a large number of years.  I am certain that if those three words stay in the Bill this will indeed be a cause of great escalation in the charges of insurance companies to clients, because they will have to cover themselves.  There comes a point where one has to accept the State's obligations in relation to ongoing treatment of such a person.  To emphasise the point again, in spite of all the legal and medical expertise, it is almost impossible to quantify how much complication is going to cost over the years, how many attendances at hospitals will be necessary, what these will involve and how often they will occur.</P>

      <P>Much mention has been made today of the case of <i>Cooke v. Walsh,</i> the case which held to be <i>ultra vires</i> the power of the Minister in the regulations made under the Health Act, 1970.  In relation to the point made by Senator Fallon, it may be relevant to <Col N="245" /> point out that that case, which was an appeal against a decision of Mr. Justice Hamilton in the High Court sitting without a jury, related to special damages in this area which amounted to £99,000 approximately.  That figure was apportioned as between £69,000 in respect of charges incurred for hospitalisation and health board charges up to the date of hearing, and £30,000 in respect of an evisaged future cost of hospitalisation and treatment.  The fact that courts make award based on expert evidence which takes account of future cost justifies the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>Is it envisaged in the section that the health board will charge in anticipation of the treatment that may be required at some future date?  If that is so and if the charge is in excess of the amount required to pay for the treatment what will happen to the excess amount? If the patient dies during the course of the treatment the health board will have charged an amount in excess of the amount which should be duly charged for the treatment provided.  What will happen to the excess amount that has been charged by the health board?</P>

      <P>I am in total agreement with the conduct of the case by the legal and medical advisers on my behalf on this issue.  Unquestionably, if the amendment is accepted it will, with respect to the Senators moving it, cause enormous problems for the health boards in terms of the provision of future maintenance for persons requiring long-stay hospitalisation or, indeed, hospitalisation for life arising out of such accidents.  The adoption of the amendment would preclude a health board from anticipating a claim in a levy on the part of the health board.  While admittedly a health board in notifying the victim of the accident, would only specify the amount of money incurred to date, it would, nevertheless, indicate &mdash; so that he could lodge in court &mdash; how much it is likely to cost him in future on an on-going basis in the event of additional hospitalisation and medical <Col N="246" /> treatment on a continuing basis being required.  It would then be up to the court to determine the amount.  If one were to delete the words &ldquo;or will be&rdquo;, then inevitably a health board would be precluded from such an anticipation.  That would pose grave difficulty for a health board in dealing with such cases.  On reflection, the thrust of the Bill and the purpose of it, would be substantially diminished if the amendment was adopted.</P>

      <P>What the Minister has stated in relation to anticipatory demands by the health board is interesting.  I will take the case of a person who has been charged £5,000 or £10,000 for services rendered in the past.  In the opinion of the health board he will require the services of another £10,000 a year indefinitely into the future.  Supposing they make this claim and, as a result, the court decides that it is going to give only £5,000 a year into the future for some reason or other, can the health board still charge £10,000?  Will it exercise its discretion here?  Is it entitled to charge £10,000 a year if the person actually uses the services subsequently to the extent of £10,000?</P>

      <P>The computation of medical costs is unquestionably done on a general actuarial basis and on an argumentative basis between the plaintiff's representatives and an anticipatory prospect.  One would have to in year one &mdash; most likely for 1986 &mdash; to multiply £800 per week by 52.  With anticipation one may have to have a major actuarial debate on the precise estimate of cost. We now have young children with broken backs, broken necks and broken pelvis, arising out of accidents who will be in hospital for the rest of their lives fed by a tube.</P>
      <P>Many of them will live for a long time. The cost of that can be computed and it must be done.  The costs are quite substantial.  It is those moneys which insurance companies will be obliged to provide for in a settlement.  We are talking about £4 million to £5 million per year in 1986 terms.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator M. Higgins on Wednesday, 19 March 1986:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Finance to establish a Commission on all aspects of credit, and its availability, such a Commission to address itself <i>inter alia</i> to the problem of money lending, both by unlicensed moneylenders and by those with licences charging over the legal rate; that it further incorporates a review of the provision and curtailment of credit in different circumstances and to different groups by commercial banking systems and that it reviews the long-term requirements in relation to credit of vulnerable groups, individuals, businesses, etc. and that it reviews these matters from the perspective of protecting consumers and that finally it be empowered to review any such matter as it shall deem appropriate for the pursuance of its objects.</P>

      <P>I shall not be very long. I am glad this motion came before us.  It addresses itself to a very fundamental and central area of life and one that is gilded over very often with far more glamour than it deserves.  It is interesting, if I may make a small theological digression, that the single greatest difficulty that the Roman Catholic Church has in the area of papal infallibility has to do with the whole teaching on usury.  A Pope at the turn of the millennium or sometime subsequently denounced usury in such categorical terms that it is very difficult still to justify an adjustment in moral teaching to allow money to be lent with interest. Consequently, many people feel that that Pope renders the whole teaching on infallibility somewhat dubious.  Many other things which they have done subsequently would add to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is about money lending, credit and so on.  I find many things relevant that other people would not in these matters.  I have said what I wanted to say.  I was addressing myself to the whole question of the morality. Traditionally, in Western civilisation, there has been a question mark placed over the lending of money with interest. It has always been regarded conventionally as somewhat suspect and somewhat less than the proper behaviour of a proper Christian in Western civilisation.  The most categorical reflection of that was that pope whose name escapes me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are far more aspects of money-lending.  The legitimate lending agencies such as banks would deeply resent being categorised or even mentioned in a <Col N="249" /> motion which also deals with other less savoury forms of money-lending.  However, we do need to address ourselves to the motives and the values which motivate the whole financial services sector. The sort of lectures, arguments and difficulties which we have presented to us in the area of wage claims, claims to be compensated for the cost of living, which are usually based on appeals to our commonsense or patriotism or our sense of the common good are arguments which the financial services sector tend to believe they themselves are exempted from.  We have the recent evidence of the fight of funds from this country because of the unusually high value of sterling relative to our currency and the possibility of a &ldquo;Killing&rdquo; being made in Irish pounds at some future date, related also to the high interest rates in Britain, and the necessity which then developed in this country for interest rates to be raised in order to entice back all that money or keep it within our country.  The role of the financial services sector in the export of capital in a way which undermines this economy is one of the issues which a commission such as the one proposed in this motion should examine.</P>
    <P>One of the images of the entrepreneur which this country has been saddled with in recent times is the brave individual who mortgages his house a second time in order to set up a small industry.  Am I alone in finding something almost immoral in an individual having to put his family home at risk in order to start an industry?  I do not regard that as some sort of model of entrepreneurial activity: I regard it as an appalling reflection on a society that a person who has an idea, who is prepared to risk his current secure career in order to develop that idea, is also given the additional burden of realising that if the idea does not work out his family's future security in terms of a home is threatened.</P>
    <P>I find it appalling that people have to go to the extent of mortgaging their homes in order to persuade our excessively profitable financial institutions to lend relatively small sums of money.  It should not have to be like that.  The basis <Col N="250" /> on which financial institutions operate ought to be changed so as to avoid that sort of penal imposition on people in order to secure a bank loan.  I think it should not have to be like that.  The basis on which financial institutions operate ought to be changed so as to avoid that sort of penal imposition on people in order to secure the bank loan.  They all say that they are holding their depositors' money in trust and therefore they are obliged to do these things.  Some of their recent adventures, particularly in the insurance area, would suggest to me that when it comes to the possibility of big killings and big profits the banks are quite prepared to take high risks but when it comes to the small individual trying to generate real work in manufacturing industry they tend to take a very different view.</P>
    <P>We need to treat the whole area of the financial services as a unit and to somehow pretend that there is a fundamental distinction between the licensed moneylender and your local bank manager is to escape the essential reality that both of them are in the business of handing out money to people who would then pay a quite substantial price for having access to that money.  I am not suggesting that bank managers and licensed moneylenders should be categorised along with illegal moneylenders, but the two areas are similar manifestations of one of the experiences of most people &mdash; that of having to ask somebody else for money that they need for necessities and which they have to pay for, over their lifetime in some cases.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, illegal money-lending is probably one of the other cancers in our society which has spiralled in growth over the last ten years as people have experienced further hardship upon further hardship.  &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; in particular deserve to be congratulated for what they did to expose some of the excesses involved in that area.  A commission to investigate the whole area of lending is more than overdue.</P>
    <P>There are many other things that one could ask.  For instance, the banks have a very tidy little business, amounting to <Col N="251" /> something close to multiple millions in the area of bridging loans.  There is hardly a loan made by a bank which is more secure than a bridging loan because the amount of cross guarantees they need between lending agency, solicitors, borrowers, etc. is enormous and yet they choose to charge the interest for bridging loans at the highest risk rate of interest. In other words, you are charged interest as if it was a high risk loan even though it is probably the least risky lending that the banks undertake.  It appears to me that they know they have cornered a market, that they have a monopoly, in the area, that there is no way around it for most people and therefore they say: &ldquo;Let us screw them for every penny we can get and charge the maximum rate of interest which we can impose within the law&rdquo;.  It seems particularly cruel that this should be done at the expense of people trying to buy a house.</P>
    <P>The glamourisation of lending and the trivialisation of the problem of repayment was particularly tragically underlined in the last 12 months by the case of a young person in Dublin who became entirely depressed by the scale of borrowing and eventually committed suicide and the coroner at the time attributed his suicide to an excessively easy lending policy followed by a particularly harsh imposition of terms for repayment by a particular bank.  The whole area of dealing in credit, the whole area of holding money on deposit, the whole area of handling money which is to be lent to other people is far too important to be dominated by those whose primary interest is the maximising of profit, not by the creation of wealth but simply by the maximising of their own opportunities. There is no wealth creation in the financial services sector; it is simply a question of manipulation of other people's money and other people's needs.  Therefore I welcome the motion and I congratulate the members of the Labour Party for putting it down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>When our group decided to put down this motion it was before <Col N="252" /> the actual television presentation of the problem.  When we decided to table it as an urgent matter for debate in the House events had taken place which ensured that it was imperative that the Government would address themselves to the problem of credit in its total perception, that is credit, whether it is by official lending institutions like banks, building societies, credit unions or any other agency which allows money to be given to people without an element of security or by the tragedy of money-lending as we know it.  The Minister will know, as her constituency was mentioned particularly in the recent television programme, the devastation that can be caused by unofficial moneylenders or moneylenders that are licensed but are abusing their position to solicit further business and creating situations where people never actually get out of a debt situation.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Michael D. Higgins, presented the resolution, which is worded to establish a commission on all aspects of credit and its availability.  I am sure that we are open in our view as to the type of legislative controls a commission would have.  We will be listening with interest to the Minister's response.</P>
      <P>We feel that the Government have a responsibility to set up some from of responsible body that can address itself to the problem outlined in the resolution. We know of legal moneylenders who charge over the proper rate and we know of unofficial moneylenders who charge anything they wish to people who are caught in a poverty trap &mdash; and there are people in the poverty trap through no fault of their own.  We have unfortunate people, who presently would be termed deserted wives and in some instances deserted husbands, who have difficulty in proving to the satisfaction of the Department of Social Welfare that they actually qualify for benefit because of the technicality of determining whether the husband walked out on them or whether they were forced or battered out of the home and had to leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these embarrassing questions are asked of people in that poverty trap who <Col N="253" /> they find themselves with young families with no visible income.  They are totally dependent on the supplementary welfare scheme which can be used at the discretion of supplementary welfare officers. One finds that the amount of money that a deserted wife with two or three children can get from the State is minimal and is not sufficient to sustain the family in frugal comfort, even in rural areas where it is possible to have access to fresh vegetables and so on.  Moneylenders exploit that situation.  They know of these people; they become aware of these people; they drive to their doors and offer them money; they offer them clothes for their children; they offer household goods and effects and so on on a deferred payment system which, if you are in need, seems a tremendous boon.  If people want to buy clothes for their children and suddenly somebody appears on the doorstep with a legitimate book and suggests that they may have a pair of shoes for the child, or a dress for £1 a week, that is exactly how the person looks at it.  Those items can never be paid for under the system of credit that the moneylenders give.</P>
    <P>At Christmas time also they exploit in a most devious way unfortunate people who are subjected to all the barrage of advertising at Christmas time, especially in homes with no income and with children needing what they would consider as Santa Claus.  Then &ldquo;Santa Claus&rdquo; arrives at the door suggesting that on the back page of the book they can have in addition to all the things already given on an easy payment system, a sum of £50 for Christmas, as if it was a gift.  you find that the person over the next 12 months pays back almost £200 for the facility of£50 on Christmas Eve.  There are people in my constituency and other areas also who are being subjected to that type of pressure by unofficial moneylenders under the guise of providing another service. Were it not for some of the non-statutory agencies, the voluntary bodies working in the field both at the social service level and at the level of St. Vincent de Paul, many of these people would never be able to get themselves out of their difficulties. <Col N="254" /> One would never think that in 1986, with the social welfare system as we have developed it down the years, trying to improve and keep it at a level that has not been achieved even by our European colleagues, this situation could arise. There are other demands we are unaware of, things happen on the ground and create situations where people fall into this poverty trap.  I am anxious that the Minister and the Department of Finance would address themselves to this problem.</P>
    <P>It would be improper of us, as Members of this House, if we did not pay a special tribute to the whole concept of the credit union which has blossomed among us.  These credit unions are offering credit at about 6 per cent, which is less than half the rate the commercial banks charge for credit.  They do that in a very private way.  They lend money to people to enable them to get themselves out of situations they got into.  It is appropriate that they would be given credit for what they do.  They do it at local village level, at branch level in towns and it is done on a voluntary basis.  I would ask the Minister to look at areas in which she could assist the credit unions by creating some kind of fund which would enable them to employ more staff on a full time basis, because at that level of interest on loans they certainly cannot compete with the banking institutions as regards the number of staff they can employ or the office hours they are open.  The more available that kind of credit is to people in the poorer categories, the more likelihood of the moneylenders being unsuccessful in his devious operations.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned St. Vincent de Paul because I am aware in my constituency of the sympathy and understanding that tremendous voluntary organisation has shown for people who are literally without food or clothes and are hungry &mdash; and there are people like that in the country.  Some people say it is their own fault and some cast aspersions on them. But there are people in difficult situations created by problems completely outside their control.  It behoves all of us to <Col N="255" /> ensure that they are assisted in every way possible.</P>
    <P>The other change which has taken place, in the countryside especially has been the advent of the supermarket.  The supermarket nowadays is demanding cash at the till for all purchases.  The day of the family grocer, sadly, is on the way out.  Formerly people could go to their family grocer and get a certain amount of credit for food.  They paid for it on children's allowance day or on pay day or whenever they had money.  There was a trust between the local family grocer and his customer; it was always there in our time.  That day is gone.  You have supermarkets in every town in the country with no interest whatsoever in people who are in difficulty.  I ask the Minister, when she does set up a commission to ensure that every possible avenue is explored in trying to assist people who are in need and also those who are in the business of giving credit, particularly credit unions, which perhaps could be the answer to the problem if they were recognised for what they are in the towns and villages of Ireland.  If we address the problem in that way we will root out these people who are guilty of the cardinal sin of exploiting people to such an extent that they get themselves into a credit situation they can never get out of.  That is a tragedy for a country that was always responsible for its poorer people and always had a regard for their needs.  I am sure that the Minister will assure us that that caring society is still with us in this electronic, technological age &mdash; the age of credit cards and the age of plastic money and all the other easy ways of paying for everything until the bill comes in at the end of the month. That is everybody's problem; it refers to us as well as to the poorer people.  It is a system we must be conscious of and we must also be careful of it.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for their response to our motion.  Their contributions have recognised the problem as we all see it. I am sure the Minister has first hand information on it.  I know she has probably been approached by people with this <Col N="256" /> problem at her clinics.  I know she has a commitment to try to do something about it.  It is a pity also that particular politicians exploit the situation and boast about it on our national airwaves, which is unusual in the area we are talking about, because normally anybody involved in that area would want to shy away from publicity.  Some of them were arrogant about the fact that they were giving a service to people who needed it, but in the process they exploited these people for everything they had.  I am worried that, as Senator Ryan said, people can do desperate things if they find themselves unable to meet the normal bills for electricity and gas, food, clothes and all the basic essentials.  We should address ourselves, as a Government and as a House, to this particular problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to make a contribution on this important subject. The Members who tabled this motion should be commended, all the more so when we hear, as Senator Ferris has said, that the motion was tabled before the recent exposure in the media.  I would be inclined towards Senator Ferris's views also.  Where we have a problem we want to solve we should first look to the structures which are there to see if we can deal with that problem, structures which have proved themselves.  In this instance I would be making the case, like Senator Ferris, that we have the credit union which has done so much and is doing so much in this area.  Much more could be done if more assistance were forthcoming from the Government.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the motion in relation to the objective, at the same time I would feel somewhat unhappy with the commission because it is a long term project; there is a certain amount of bureaucracy and at the end of the day I am not too sure that most people have been satisfied when commissions have been held before.  Nevertheless, I agree with the broad terms of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must, like Senator Ferris, pay tribute to the recent media exposure on money-lending, especially by RTE.  The media <Col N="257" /> play a very important part.  They are criticised very often&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;but in this area, where they do so much good, we should not overlook the positive side. On RTE, we have so many imported programmes, like &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dynasty&rdquo;, which show an opulent style and an unchristian way of life and, many would say, an immoral way of life which is foreign to us.  Many people are critical of and offended by these films, where violence is shown on our screens.  We have a means here, through our TV programmes, to show our own way of life, the way of life we would want.  If more money were made available to project the kind of image we want to project, this would be a great counterbalance.  These programmes were educational.  Perhaps more advertisements could be included on the national media.  When I spoke earlier this evening I mentioned advertisements.  I feel the best ones would be showing what transpired in actual situations, the problems people had and how they overcame them. People can be educated in this way, particularly young people.</P>
    <P>Perhaps not so many young people were watching the recent programmes. They were programmes in which, by and large, they would have little interest. The schools have a large part to play in teaching thrift and a certain frugality which is necessary, a balanced approach to life.  I am not preaching perfection but in Ireland there is too much drink and there is so much money spent on drink. People are poisoning themselves, by smoking and spending too much on it. Betting shops are making big profits.  The unemployment problem is massive and we have related problems.  It is very important that in our schools' civic programmes thrift is thought, how to handle money so that people will not be pushed into an embarrassing situation where they will have to borrow money at rates of interest far above the legal limit whether from registered or unregistered, legal or illegal moneylenders.</P>
    <P>I believe that for people who get into this situation&mdash;I know of some of them <Col N="258" /> and we all know of some of them&mdash;it is like a situation where they are sinking in a swamp and the more they try to get out the more they get involved.  We all know the old adage, neither a borrower nor a lender be.  The moneylender has made unreasonable profits.  We have a tradition of borrowing.  We are all aware of that.  I wonder if it is the same in other countries. Would they have the same problems? I doubt it very much.  It was the same situation back in my youth.  I remember when I was going to secondary school in Kells there was a loan bank in the town and payments were made every Friday. It was one of my duties to bring in the money from people I passed along the five miles of the way, paying their money weekly.  They borrowed something between £5 and £20, hardly any more than £25.  The money was paid back at one shilling per pound per week.  There was a certain amount of money taken out at the start and that was over 20 weeks. If they missed one week there was a fine of 3p.  I remember that vividly.  Those people had to get somebody to sign for them before they got the money.  That money tided them over problems and, of course, the people who vouched or went guarantor for them, when a problem arose, coaxed and persuaded them and in that way, I suppose, helped them to pay back.</P>
    <P>Even small farmers had to borrow. When people nowadays read in the papers what may be termed the fortunes which farmers leave in wills and so on in reality most of those farmers would be in a bad way.  I recall that back over the years small famers had to borrow money to buy stock.  they repaid it when the stock was sold and in that way they had a certain dignity, although there was no profit in it.</P>
    <P>Of course society today is very changed from that time.  There are many areas I could instance where this change is obvious.  There are young people moving, for example, into local authority housing schemes.  We see many problems there. People have no savings.  We have seen where they move in and have no furniture.  I know of one particular instance <Col N="259" /> where, in a housing scheme in this city on a Sunday, the parish priest could not have his dinner.  He was going around to try to get pieces of furniture to help people in that situation.  When we criticise our priests and our clergy and religious of all denominations we should remember the important work they do in this area outside religion.</P>
    <P>We have the problem in Dublin where people were moved out to the suburbs. As I said here before, it was a political decision.  The reality of the situation was that in the suburbs it was possible with a certain amount of money to buy more land, to build more houses and therefore to satisfy more people.  The unfortunate part of it was that these people were taken out of their own ground, their roots and their culture in the inner city, where the shops were close at hand, where they had friends and in-laws to call on.  Sometimes a wife might not be a very good cook and they could call to their in-laws. When they moved out they were alone and adrift.  There was no dignity there and they had to borrow.</P>
    <P>In urban areas more than in the country there is a day to day way of life.  The people live for the day.  I agree that voluntary organisations have done trojan work.  Senator Ferris referred to the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  Senator Brendan Ryan referred to the suicides caused by financial problems, but equally tragic were the broken homes; and very often when voluntary organisations moved in it was too late.  I often thought in many instances it was a case of keeping the rat's head over the water.  It is not a very picturesque metaphor.  Though it may not be very Christian to say it, it might be nearly better to let him sink and drown.</P>
    <P>With regard to the credit unions, I would agree totally with what Senator Ferris has said.  The credit unions have done marvellous work.  They are doing it at present.  I know from personal knowledge and experience in my own town of Kells.  I am a member and I have a loan from the credit union.  I know that when a member calls for a loan he or she is called in and given advice.  Many people <Col N="260" /> call in desperation, in tears, and many people are thankful to the credit union. Women have come in on many occasions on the point of a nervous breakdown, taking tablets, because the husband might not even know that money was borrowed.  I have seen, even in my own town, and still see, an individual collecting openly for a lending agency.</P>
    <P>The people themselves own a credit union and this gives them a dignity.  They are pooling their resources.  In Kells we have 2,500 members with a savings of £1,200,000.  There are personal loans of over £900,000.  This, as Senator Ferris has said, is not unique to one place.  This is happening all over the country.  When members of the parish borrow they are really borrowing from one another.  The borrowing rate is 12 per cent on a sliding scale and the shares are ensured up to £2,500.  If someone dies with that amount, £5,000 will be paid to the relatives of that individual after 55 years.</P>
    <P>I could go into many more areas of the credit union &mdash; the voluntary work done by the directors and the supervisors, the weekly meetings, the trust put in young people, the trust put in everybody who wants to borrow because people are taken on their merit.  It is the record over the years that matters not the big income or the big wage.  The person is taken for what he is.</P>

      <P>I meant also, if I had time, to pay tribute to Canon Hayes, founder of Muintir na Tíre, who did trojan work in this area.  I mention him particularly because I am fortunate enough to come from the parish where he ministered first, the parish of Kilbeg where he did so much work in this specific area.  Above all people, he brought dignity to the working people and to those who had nothing.  In that parish his name is still remembered with gratitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, it is desirable to give help to the credit unions.  We must remember that no help was given to them over the years by way of tax exemptions.  The new <Col N="261" /> interest charged at present puts them on the same plane as all the other institutions.  But here we have an institution that has proved itself, that is able to help, and it would be far more useful than a commission.  It is in a situation where it is working and, like Senator Ferris, I recommend that the Minister consider giving help to the credit unions.  It would be far better than the long term effects of a commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House is very wide-ranging.  It calls for a commission to examine all aspects of credit &mdash; its availability generally and to individuals and groups, long term credit needs, the problems of moneylending and the protection of the consumer, that is to say, the borrowing public.  Not surprisingly, the debate has covered much ground and Senators have made several interesting points.  I hope to deal with the more significant of them and to explain the Government's position.</P>
      <P>I would agree with Senator O'Leary that this motion is drafted too widely. The proposed commission would be required to examine the macro aspects of credit, in other words the overall supply of credit in the economy, its allocation between the various economic sectors and the future requirements for credit. But, in addition, it would be required to consider what might be called the micro aspects of credit, that is the impact on the borrower or potential borrower.  The commission would find itself switching from the great issues of the economy to the more personal issues, for the individual, of getting credit on the wrong terms or, perhaps, not getting it at all.  These are important but they are of a different order of magnitude.</P>
      <P>Senator Higgins seemed to want to tackle both facets.  On the macroeconomic elements I would have to say that I do not at this point see a need for an official inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last credit commission was established in 1934 and reported in 1938.  This <Col N="262" /> investigated the general system of currency, banking, credit, public borrowing and lending and the State's involvement in sectoral credit.  A similar commission now would have to have similar broad terms of reference.  At that time the institutional arrangements for regulating banking and credit were limited.  In fact, the entire financial system was much less developed.  The position now is quite different.  We have the Central Bank, which licences and supervises banks and lays down monetary and credit policy. Among the general statutory obligations of the Central Bank is that of ensuring the welfare of the people as a whole in matters of credit.  We have also a larger and more sophisticated banking system and financial markets operating in a more developed and diversified economy.</P>
    <P>The level of credit expansion within the economy is set by the Central Bank by reference to the state of the economy generally.  Senator O'Higgins talked about the general thrust of monetary policy.  He specifically suggested that it should not be narrowly based but should contribute to a reversal of unemployment and to the growth of our productive capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past credit guidelines were directed specifically to ensuring that productive investment was given priority.  In the 1986 Monetary Policy Statement issued by the Central Bank on 6 March, which the Senator selectively quoted from, it is clear that lending for productive purposes will continue to be encouraged.  The document also made it clear that credit guidelines were no longer being used because there was no need for them.  For a number of years now demand for bank credit from the private sector was below the level which the Central Bank had indicated would be acceptable. There is, therefore, no lack of credit within the economy.</P>
      <P>In fact, the demand for credit has been limited due to general recessionary conditions.  I believe that the recovery in economic activity now under way and the rapid fall in inflation will stimulate a renewed demand for credit.  I hope that the banks will give priority in this situation to the needs of the productive, wealth generating sectors in industry and agriculture, both for investment funds and working capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware that different sectors and individual firms complain about the supply of credit, the level of interest rates, security and guarantees and the other general terms on which loans are made available.  I am also familiar with the complaints about the lack of venture capital.  I have never hidden my conviction that the lending agencies could and should do more to assist new businesses to get off the ground.  It is not that we lack official support, through the IDA and tax concessions but there is a reluctance in this country to take risk, which is only slowly breaking down.  I am not saying it is all the fault of the banks and, indeed, banks with their obligations to savers may not always be the best people to embrace new ventures.  Irish business too has too much loan capital.  We need new risk equity investment, through the Stock Exchange or outside it via special <Col N="264" /> venture capital funds.  In this regard, I have welcomed the establishment of the new Smaller Companies Market and to show his support for this development, the Minister has included in the Finance Bill certain changes relating to capital gains tax.  I hope this new development will be very successful.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that, unlike in the 1930s, we now have the institutions, the agencies and the developed financial system that enable us to operate monetary policy, to assess the credit needs of the economy and to provide for them.  There is no lack of inquiries, reports and special interest groups.  For example, in the industrial sector the financing of the traded sectors was investigated by the National Economic and Social Council in 1984.  I do not see a need for another investigation into credit at this general level of the economy.</P>
    <P>The main source of credit in our economy is, of course, the banking system. Within any overall guidelines on credit the banks decide on the allocation of funds.  This means, among other things, that they must have due regard to the creditworthiness of the applicant.  Depositors invest with banks in the expectation that the bank will use their money wisely and in a prudent way.  This means not lending on a non-commercial basis.  To do otherwise is not the proper role of a bank and would be an irresponsible use of moneys which are, in fact, the savings of the people.  I was glad to be reassured in the debate that no Senator had in mind that banks or other lenders should be obliged to lend on any basis other than a commercial one.  Yet it would be easy to draw the contrary conclusion from the remarks of both Senator Higgins, Senator Harte and indeed Senator Ryan.</P>

      <P>Only specific bad debts may be set off and the Revenue Commissioners must be satisfied that they are genuine before they are allowed.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary suggested that there is a need for a separate commission on banking.  He instanced particularly a need to look at the expansion of banking in the future.  I could not agree.  There have been several reports on the banking system in Ireland such as the NESC report which I have already referred to. In our modern society we have several fora where these issues can be aired without the need for the establishment of a commission which would take time to report and might not add greatly to our existing knowledge.  The Central Bank is, I know, concerned that banking changes should not harm the general welfare of the people, the banks' customers or their shareholders.  The Senator mentioned the ICI affair.  This case taught us a number of lessons and I know the bank is bearing them in mind in its supervision policy. Bank supervision is a dynamic matter which develops and responds to changes in banking organisation and practice.  At present banking is changing very rapidly and supervisory authorities are having to react quickly and frame suitable policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, it is not correct to say that the expansion of the banks overseas is uncontrolled.  Internationally, it is now accepted that the responsibility for bank <Col N="266" /> subsidiaries or branches abroad lies with the supervisory authority of the parent bank in co-operation with the host country.  I would also point out that, arising from an EC directive, regulations were made last year which require the Central Bank to supervise banks and their financial subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, a practice which the bank was already carrying our for several years anyway.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Senators to bear in mind that banking internationally is undergoing great changes.  We in this country cannot remain aloof from these developments.  Banks, like other companies, must be allowed to grow and to expand, to provide employment and to give improved services to both agriculture and industry.  This growth must of course be done on a prudent basis but I do not see a need for a commission to chart future policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the other aspects of credit covered by the motion.  I called these the &ldquo;micro aspects&rdquo; earlier on but, on reflection.  I suppose they are more the social features as they affect borrowers, primarily individuals.  This is an element which all Senators have raised in this debate.</P>
    <P>A feature of modern living is the change in society's attitude to credit, as Senator Fitzsimons underlined this evening.  Whereas formerly individuals saved over a period of time in order to purchase goods, the tendency now is to look to credit to secure immediate satisfaction of one's needs.  This change is a result of many factors, such as the rise in real incomes, the increase in people's expectations and the fall in the value of real savings in a period of high inflation.  All of these changes have been associated with a significant increase in the demand for credit.  In addition, credit institutions have changed their approach too and are now more willing to make credit available.</P>
    <P>The results of these developments are that people are much more tolerant of relatively high levels of debt in relation to their resources and incomes.  The lending institutions also are often less rigorous in the assessment of creditworthiness.  Both <Col N="267" /> parties tend to have a more relaxed attitude to borrowing and lending.  Inevitably there are people who get too heavily into debt and who cannot meet their obligations.  There are others whose creditworthiness just runs out.  They become bad risks.  And there are yet others in our community who simply do not have access to credit because they are part of the large proportion of the population who have no relationship with a bank or their social position is such that they would not be considered for credit.  Such people may have serious problems and may be driven to fairly desperate solutions, including recourse to unlicensed moneylenders.  All Senators are clearly concerned about abuses of moneylending and I share that concern.  It is a fit subject for debate as an issue that affects the lives of quite a number of our more vulnerable fellow citizens.  As Senator Ferris has pointed out, in my own constituency of Wexford we have a tragic record in relation to unlicenced moneylending as was ably highlighted in a recent media programme.</P>
    <P>Moneylending has been the subject of much public discussion lately and some alleged abuses have been brought to light.  The Government are concerned that individuals should be protected as far as possible.  As the Minister for Justice has pointed out in the past, in reply to questions in the other House, the Garda authorities pursue all alleged breaches of the law in relation to moneylending. However, the Garda authorities face certain difficulties in investigating offences since the people making the allegations or the borrowers may be unable or unwilling to give information.  Also the irregularities cited are not always criminal offences.  For example, the charging of excessive interest is not a criminal offence.  It is often thought that charges in excess of 39 per cent are illegal.  The Moneylenders Act of 1933 does mention a figure of 39 per cent.  However, this is in the context of a provision which allows a court, in proceedings brought by a moneylender for recovery of money lent to re-open the transaction and give relief <Col N="268" /> if the transaction is adjudged harsh and unconscionable.  The law therefore provides the remedy in the case of excessive interest being charged to the borrower. However, that remedy is in the hands of borrowers if they wish to use it, when moneylenders seek to bring civil proceedings against them.</P>
    <P>The Government have an open mind on changing the law in relation to moneylending.  The Minister for Justice has given an assurance that he will consider introducing any amending legislation which may be found necessary.  However, as all Senators are aware, the moneylending abuses are part of a much more complex social problem and cannot be solved by legislation alone.</P>
    <P>I recognise that for one reason or another individuals, especially the disadvantaged members of the community, may have problems securing credit or with the terms on which they can borrow. Their situation is not in all cases entirely hopeless.  Senators Harte, Ferris and Fitzsimons drew attention to the important work being done by credit unions over many years.  Credit unions are nonprofit making organisations, organised on the basis of a common bond of region, vocation or religion, for example.  They are pre-eminently community self-help organisations.  They provide a safe place for the savings of local people and assure them that should they need to borrow they will, as members, be eligible for a loan at reasonable rates of interest.  The typical credit union is run by a managing committee elected from its own members.  In this way the unions are responsive to the needs of their members and can provide a personal service.  They are particularly valuable because their structure enables them to be of assistance to people who might be intimidated by larger and more impersonal financial institutions.  Credit unions are widespread in Ireland, with over 470 unions and over 500,000 members scattered throughout the country.  At the end of 1984 they had total assets of £270 million and outstanding loans of £216 million.  I would commend credit unions as a real <Col N="269" /> source of saving and borrowing in the community.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that borrowers, as consumers, may need protection.  Several Senators, particularly Senator Lanigan, wanted more information to be given to borrowers.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has always exercised functions in relation to prices, restrictive practices and consumer protection in the banking sector.  It has been instrumental in bringing about considerable improvement in the information banks provide to customers about the terms of credit.</P>
    <P>The Government announced recently changes in the legislation governing prices and restrictive practices.  There will be a streamlining of administrative practice by the amalgamation of the present bodies into two new fair trade bodies. The Government have decided also to end the special exemptions from the general law which some sectors of economic activity, including banking, enjoy.  The Government propose to bring banking within the ambit of the general law on restrictive practices and consumer protection.</P>
    <P>An order is being drafted under the Consumer Information Act, 1978, which will require all advertisements and notices that make reference to the cost of credit to show the true cost of that credit expressed as an annual percentage of credit granted.  This will standardise the method of calculating the cost, the frequency of payments, plus the interest and other charges payable.  It is hoped to present this order to the Oireachtas in the near future.</P>
    <P>I might also add that work on a new Central Bank Bill is well under way in the Department of Finance.  If the Minister for Finance considers there is a need to improve the role of the Central Bank in relation to consumer protection and related matters, he will include suitable provisions in the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the access of women to credit there has been a perception that women have been treated unfairly by the financial institutions and have been denied fair access to credit.  The Minister of State with responsibility for Women's <Col N="270" /> Affairs is examining this problem in the context of the general question of implementing the UN Convention on equal treatment of women.  Should any action be found necessary the Government will bring forward the necessary proposals.</P>
    <P>I have indicated the areas where I see Government having a role.  The major function of Government in a modern economy in the area of credit is to ensure that sufficient credit is provided, within the economic parameters, to fund sustainable economic activity and growth.  The second function of Government would be to ensure as far as possible that credit is made available to those sectors where it can be put to the best use, in the overall national sense.  For example, credit should be used primarily to finance production and employment at home rather than an unsustainable consumer import boom.  But, in our system of private enterprise, Government must stop short of trying to do those things the market can do better.  It is no part of the business of Government in normal times to allocate credit between competing interests or to direct bankers to give preference to particular borrowers, whether they are corporate or individual.  If, as a matter of national policy, the State wishes to aid or give preference to certain interests or sectors, it has various means of doing so, for example, the IDA, the tax system, or grants.</P>
    <P>Third, it is the duty of Government to hold the ring, to ensure that the weaker party can secure fair play and proper redress.  That is what we are doing in the consumer protection legislation and the changes which we propose to make therein.  That is the purpose of the Moneylenders Act.  I will not pretend that people do not fall through the safety net. They do and some always will because, in the end, we are faced with the results of individual choice and individual decisions.  We have to educate people and inform them so that each person will take the best possible decision in relation to his or her circumstances&mdash;the decision he or she can live with.  This process should begin in the home, where the values of thrift and caution must be nurtured.  The <Col N="271" /> educational system has a part and also consumer groups, trades unions and, indeed, the financial institutions themselves.</P>
    <P>This debate will have served a useful purpose if it brings home to people the risks attached to over-dependence on credit and the dangers of borrowing on onerous and harsh terms without taking proper account of the ability to repay. The peace and happiness of many people can be shattered by excessive recourse to borrowing.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are important social aspects to borrowing.  I want to assure the House that the Government are prepared to take whatever measures may be needed to correct proved abuses and to assist people who are genuinely trying to order their affairs prudently.  Our approach is practical and realistic and the fullest consideration will be given to the points raised in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by apologising for the couple of occasions on which I interrupted the Minister of State but I am sure that the House will agree with me that it is very difficult to sit on one's seat and listen to one's remarks being systematically misconstrued and indeed being misrepresented.  I would also like to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is good to see women rising to the office she has and I congratulate her on that.  Unfortunately, listening to her speech has made me more convinced than ever of the need for this commission.  Let me state again the simple principles of the resolution which is in the name of the Labour Party Members in the Seanad.  It called on the Minister for Finance to establish a commission on all aspects of credit and its availability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the mish-mash that is contained in the Minister's speech, there have been many commissions on credit, one of which is referred to in the Minister's speech, the 1934 commission.  Some of the fundamentals of this commission are misconstrued in her speech.  It said on the question of availability of credit <Col N="272" />&ldquo;such a commission to address itself, <i>inter alia,</i> to the problem of moneylending&rdquo;. Yes, indeed, there are two aspects.  There is the question of the present abuses.  A specific question was put by me when I moved this motion.  If the law is adequate why are the cases which were reported in Galway last year not being proceeded with?  The Minister for Finance sat where the Minister of State is now and his officials took note and yet I am asked to wind up this discussion on this motion without an answer to that question.  The people who are abused by the moneylending system, by the inadequacy of the law, by the slowness of the procedures are entitled to an answer to that question.</P>
    <P>The speech was in itself, when it was not abusive and misconstruing remarks made in the House, curiously evasive in practically every substantial matter of the motion.  It did not answer even that small question.  To move to another matter, it fudged the issue of the relationship of women to credit.  As someone interested in the rights of women I find it offensive it is so bad.  It states:</P>
    <P>In relation to the access of women to credit there has been a perception that women have been treated unfairly by the financial institutions and have been denied fair access to credit.</P>
    <P>Is it true or is it not?  What is the opinion of the Minister for Finance?  I am an elected Member of this House seeking his opinion.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said the Minister of State for Women's Affairs is examining this problem in the context of the general question of implementing the UN convention on equal treatment of women.  I congratulate the Minister for Women's Affairs.  I am a member of the Committee for Women's Rights which is trying to do the same thing.  The Minister of State also said, should any action be found necessary the Government will bring forward the necessary proposals. What is the reaction to the evidence offered in this House of the refusal of access to formal credit by women and the results it had in forcing women to go to less than the formal sources of credit?  It <Col N="273" /> is evaded by the high minded people who wrote this mish-mash of reaction, ignorance and evasion that I have just listened to.</P>
    <P>I have just listened to a little lecture as to what should be the question and what should be the subject matter of a commission; because you decide that there are two aspects to the work of the commission as it is proposed, the overall supply of credit and the particular deficiencies in the laws available now.  I know that.  I would hardly have worded the motion the way I did if I had not adverted to that very reality.  The only satisfaction I have got is that both points have been ignored.  I find entertaining &mdash; I will come to that in a moment &mdash; the manner in which the provision of money from public taxation to the IDA is neatly confused with the supply of credit to Irish industry, which is a notion on which I would fail a first year economic student of mine in first term at university.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this motion is that it called attention to the question of people who are licensed charging above the rates. I asked in moving the motion and other Senators have also asked, for a resolution of the question whether people who are charging service charges above the 39 per cent are or are not breaking the law and if they are breaking the law, how will the law be amended?  We got no answer.</P>
    <P>The motion also incorporates a review of the provision and curtailment of credit in different circumstances and to different groups by the commercial banking system and that it reviews the long term requirements in relation to credit of vulnerable groups, individuals and businesses.  I referred in my speech to the stop-go policy of supplying credit for the purchase of agricultural land which every economist in this State knows had the result of inflating the price of agricultural land in the seventies.  That issue is not addressed in the reply.  In fact this speech could have been written by the more rabid PR section of the most chancy bank in the country.  I had in mind here the differences between people who need priming capital to establish a venture and people who need it after the venture has <Col N="274" /> been established in the first few years and so forth.  Let us have a rational discussion about that.  Instead of that we got a semi-hysterical rejection of reasonable arguments that were put forward.  The motion finally stated that the commission be empowered to review any such matter as it shall deem appropriate for the pursuance of its objects.  I am moved, having listened to the reply to this debate, to, in fact, insist on it being put before the Seanad and it will be my intention, if necessary, to call a vote on this motion. It is a very important one.</P>
    <P>I want to say, and I say so very unemotively, that I take exception to the reference that I quoted selectively from documents that had been published by the banking system.  If I made such an allegation in this House I would substantiate it.  It is not substantiated in the speech we have just heard.  I would require proof of it.  I find it quite disgraceful and cowardly to make such a remark. The Minister of State said that a similar commission now would have the same broad terms of reference as the commission of 1934 which reported in 1938.  Is anybody trying to tell me that the credit requirements of the economy in 1985-86 are similar to the ones of 1934-38?  The whole experience of Irish business in every aspect of it, farming, small businesses, major businesses and so forth, is that the supply of credit is very limited.  Where is the response to my arguments about the short time span of the banking system?  There was no reply to that.  Where is the reply to the question about the collateral required by the commercial banking system?  Where is the reply to all the comparisons made to the European credit philosophies and systems?  They were all ignored in favour of a semi-abusive rejection of arguments made by Senator Harte and I.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins talked about the general thrust of monetary policy.</P>
    <P>The language, the way that remark is made, tells you a lot.</P>
    <P>he specifically suggested that it <Col N="275" /> should not be narrowly based but should contribute to a reversal of unemployment and to the growth of our productive capacity.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat it for the dense.  Let me repeat it for those who chose not to understand.  What I am saying here is that an objective record of bank lending policy, opinions I quoted by a former Member of this House, including Senator T.K. Whitaker, suggested that there was an excessive availability of credit and finance from the banking system for speculative ventures rather than productive ventures in the Irish economy.  I repeat that it was available for speculative ventures rather than genuinely productive ventures with employment creation aspects.  I did not want to be proved right by the debacle of people who suggest &mdash; I ask the House to bear it in mind &mdash; that a bad debt provision by a banking system is supposed to be its credit policy.  The bad debt provision by a banking system, which includes a major bank that invested in bush fires, the relegation of football teams, the collapse of airlines, all those daft things that would not be taken by anybody else &mdash; the whole conglomerate of these kind of bad risks is supposed to constitute a credit policy. It would be laughable if it was not coming from officials within the Department of Finance.  It is disgraceful as a comment within the banking system.</P>
    <P>The 1986 monetary policy statement issued by the Central Bank on the 6 March is the one I am supposed to have selectively quoted from.  The Minister of State also said:</P>
    <P>...it is clear that lending for productive purposes will continue to be encouraged.  The document also made it clear that credit guidelines were no longer being used because there was no need for them.</P>
    <P>I repeat my remark.  I would like, when the Minister for Finance or whoever stands in for him comes in to this House, that they have the courage to say where I selectively quoted from this document. The document is in the Library of the <Col N="276" /> House.  It is a nice cheap little reference, trying to suggest that the old-fashioned people who are trying to resurrect the corpse of old-fashioned credit policy are speaking for some kind of orthodoxy and that the rest of us have no knowledge of economics.  I was lecturing on credit and the history of economics before the Minister for Finance was heard of in politics.  There is this statement by the Minister of State further on that the 1930s exhausted the capacity of the Department of Finance for a credit commission.  &ldquo;My God&rdquo; is all I have to say to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also said:</P>
    <P>There is no lack of enquiries, reports and special interest groups.  For example, in the industrial sector, the financing of the traded sectors was investigated by the National Economic and Social Council in 1984.  I do not see the need for another investigation into credit at this general level of the economy.</P>
    <P>It will be news for the people who work in NESC that that particular report constituted the equivalent of a commission on credit.  I will come back to the House and offer them their opinion on that kind of a remark.</P>
    <P>I want to make the following point very clearly.  The Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned the ICI affair. This case taught us a number of lessons and I know the bank is bearing them in mind in its supervision policy.  Bank supervision is a dynamic matter which develops and responds to changes in banking organisation and practice.</P>
    <P>What does this mean?  &ldquo;This case taught us a number of lessons&rdquo;.  It taught the citizens that they would have to pay.  It taught the banks that they could go back to the Government to bail them out Then it is represented in a Department of Finance prepared document that bank supervision is a dynamic matter which develops and responds to changes in banking organisation and practice.  This, I suppose, could be kindly construed as <Col N="277" /> saying that even the most stupid of speculative fools may learn sometimes and change their practices.  But to put it into a speech to Seanad Éireann, replying to a motion calling for a commission on credit and for a review of banking policy, is asking us to accept too much.  Banks, like others, must be allowed to expand and grow.</P>
    <P>The Senators who put down this motion knew exactly what we were doing.  We knew the difference between a charitable institution and a bank.  We simply said there are numerous abuses taking place at the moment.  We asked that a commission be set up.  May I give a practical example of the reason for short term abuses.  The people who are being charged over the rate by legal people, and who are being abused by illegal people, have said that if such a commission came into existence they would travel and give evidence before it when they would not give evidence locally.  Equally, we looked at the question of what was a charge and what was the interest rate.  We looked for clarification on that.  The law needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>We looked at the question of selling in kind through commodities and the building of an interest component into it.  That needs clarification.  We wanted a response as to how the law will be changed to remove the social blight of all of this illegal activity.  I reject the daft notion, based on some concept of original sin, that says &ldquo;If only individuals were more canny and not spending too much and if they were not influenced by consumerism and so forth.&rdquo;  One Senator after another in this House said that when children are coming up to first communion, when people move into a new house in a housing estate, they are not mindless, daft consumer, mad fad buyers.  They are people under enormous pressure from the wrong kind of society to look after their children and to buy things they badly need.</P>
    <P>The second set of purposes referred to in our motion addressed the fact that the country is teeming with people with ideas and an anxiety to work.  We simply said: <Col N="278" /> is it not reasonable to ask a commission to anticipate the needs of agriculture over a long period of time, the needs of small industries, the needs of industry, to look at the credit policies in other European countries, to say that you will accept an idea, a piece of technology, that you will change the time span for investment, that you will change your concept of collateral?  This is not asking the banks to be a charitable institution.  It is asking them to change their conceptions of themselves from being glorified old-fashioned money banks within the concept of British banking into being modern day credit institutions.  As long as we have this kind of thinking, when the banks PR can find its way into Seanad Éireann in response to a motion that was well meant, it fills me with depression.</P>
    <P>I must say, as a citizen and as a taxpayer, I find it offensive that speculative ventures, nationally and internationally, can receive credit on better terms over longer periods with less security than genuine productive ventures.  I challenge this point.  Where in any published account of an economy is the bad debt provision of a banking system accepted as the main core of its credit policy? The bad debts from the bush fires, the relegated football teams, the collapsed airlines and all the buildings which blew up which nobody else would take &mdash; Ireland's banking credit policy.  I believe that there are productive ventures.  We need to have credit available for them. Certainly, let us have a mix of credit, credit available through the banking system, soft loans, the whole question of grants-in-aid, depreciation allowances and so on.</P>
    <P>I suggest that from 1934 to 1986 is a a reasonable length of time.  There are enough messages coming out &mdash; not from socialists but from the Confederation of Irish Industry, from small farmers, from the Irish Farmers' Association, from consumers' banks and so forth to have a commission that will look at the overall supply of credit and will immediately, when it starts its work, dispose of the abuses in relation to moneylending. People are concerned that a commission <Col N="279" /> would take too long.  It is my view that a commission would afford the privacy that different people, like the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the credit unions, are telling us is necessary if people are to come forward and give evidence of abuses.  Equally there are commissions, including the Whitaker Commission on the prisons, which was established quickly, met quickly and produced a report quickly, and gave us a very fine report.</P>
    <P>I end with a plea.  Credit is something and economy is something that is within the understanding of our citizenry.  If it is not within the understanding of our citizenry we will fall into a backward dilapidated economy that will never supply the growth we want.  There is one word which is attachable to this motion.  It is all about one thing.  It is about accountability.  It is saying that credit, the supply of it to different sectors in different circumstances, short term and medium term, should be accountable to a public policy in Ireland.  The people who do not want this motion want to continue the worst kind of accountability that exists in Ireland at the present time, the non-accountability of the credit system and specifically the banking system within it.</P>

    <P>SECTION 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>As amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are related they may be discussed together.  Both are in the name of Senator Fallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1) (c), line 3, to delete &ldquo;is entitled to&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;will&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendments, which asks that the words &ldquo;is entitled to&rdquo; be replaced by &ldquo;will&rdquo;, is that there is a clear difference between &ldquo;is entitled to&rdquo; and &ldquo;will&rdquo;.  For example, one might be a patient as a result of a road traffic accident, be concussed and have to spend up to three nights in a hospital.  The person involved may never decide to seek damages or claim compensation.  Therefore, while he would be entitled to damages, it does not follow that he will ever pursue a claim.  Therefore &ldquo;will&rdquo; in this instance would be a preferable word.  For example, there might be a claim by a third party against, say, a relative or a friend who might have knocked him down. While he has been in hospital with minor injuries, he might never pursue a claim for damages, but the health board assume once it was a road traffic accident that he would have claimed.  Therefore, if you had a case where one might be weak on liability issues, while he might be entitled to, and everybody would feel he was entitled to claim compensation, it might not be pursued for the reasons I have given.  Those words in the amendment are preferable to those in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is that bills will be issued by the health boards to enable the individual to process the cost of services as part of his special damages <Col N="281" /> claim.  If the amendment were adopted by the House, the particular bills, or charges, or whatever one might wish to call them, could only be issued to persons who had actually received damages. Therefore, a very difficult situation would arise.  As the section now stands these bills can be issued to two groups of persons: to persons who received damages or who are entitled to receive damages, namely, all of those who may have a claim.  This is where the health board effectively ensures a degree of recoupment for the cost of treating road traffic victims arising out of their compensation claims.  Therefore, if it transpires that the person was not entitled to receive damages, of course under the section the claims and the bills are automatically null and void.  This is provided for within the Bill itself.  That is the best framework the Attorney-General, the parliamentary draftsman and the Department could come up with, bearing in mind that this particular section of the Health Act has been the subject of intense scrutiny at High Court and Supreme Court level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that in the situation where a person is a victim of a road accident and is subsequently hospitalised he may have a claim which would require compensation to be paid. If he opts not to pursue that claim, as a personal decision for him or her in those circumstances, what would be the position in relation to the hospital charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is pretty clear-cut under the Bill.  It is only where a claim has been pursued and where compensation has actually been paid arising out of a road traffic accident that the particular charge automatically applies. Otherwise, if he is under the £14,500 he has free hospital cover; if he is over that limit he has to have the conventional payment.</P>

      <P>Bear in mind that the Supreme Court in December 1983 very clearly ruled that the situation was <i>ultra vires.</i> It would be quite inappropriate and totally improper on my part to suggest that there should be retrospective implementation of the Bill.  Very careful cognisance was taken of the situation. The advice which I received, and which I totally accepted, was that there was no need for a specific provision in the Bill relating to retrospection because of the <Col N="283" /> general principle that, unless a very contrary intention appears, an enactment is presumed not to have any retrospective effect.  Therefore, there is no necessity for the amendment.  I am glad that the Senator has tabled the amendment to enable us to make the matter absolutely clear despite the fact that the health boards in the process have lost about £25 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that it will not be retrospective?  There is more than one way of looking at it.  Does that mean it will not apply except to accidents occurring after the coming into operation of the Bill or to claims settled after the coming into operation of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

Any substantial cases which might arise after today's date are not going to be settled before the end of the year.

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not really deal with the point when he was replying to the Second Stage speech.  You could not disagree with the substance of what the Minister said but he did not deal with the problem that I see will confront potential litigants as a result of the enactment of this legislation.  As I explained on Second Stage, there are two separate and distinct problems which will arise. One is in respect of settlements in cases which go the whole way and which are ultimately decided by court, and the other is the problem that will arise in respect of settlements which are made out of court.  If one looks at the position with regard to settlements, the position will be something like the following. When a settlement is proposed in an action and where there exists in respect of that action a claim by the health board in respect of services provided in the past or, alternatively, services being provided at present or in the future, that claim will have to be taken into account by the plaintiff when settling the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What procedure does the Minister envisage to ensure that a <i>bona fide</i> settle ment arrived at &mdash; I am not talking about tricksters or anything like that &mdash; by the plaintiff and his professional advisers and the defendants, which, because of a problem on liability, is discounted in some way or to a certain extent?  What <Col N="285" /> guarantee will there be that that discounting element will be the same element of discounting as will be accepted by the health board for the purpose of exercising their discretion under subsection (2)?</P>
    <P>I am not talking about a trickster situation.  I am talking about a genuine situation where the professional advisers of a plaintiff recommend that he or she should settle for a 50/50 basis because there is some difficulty on liability or some degree of contributary negligence.  They advise that a claim which is worth £200,000 should be settled for £100,000.  Within that £200,000 claim there might be £40,000 for past, present and future medical expenses.  The reduction of that claim by half would mean in ordinary circumstances that there would be a similar reduction in the £40,000 owed to the health board.</P>
    <P>If they, <i>bona fide,</i> settle that case for 50/50, is it possible at a later date for the health board to say that the case should not have been settled for 50/50, that it should have been settled for 60/40?  Will there be a system for monitoring this? Will it be necessary to get approval of the health board before you make such a settlement?</P>
    <P>My second point is in respect of cases that are settled in court, cases which are actually tried, where the court decides that it should be a 50/50 liability basis, that there should be a 50 per cent contributory negligence basis.  Will that be automatically accepted by the health board?  It appears to me that on the basis of this subsection they do not have to automatically accept it.  In they do not have to automatically accept it, disputes will arise.  If disputes arise, how will they be resolved?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of a major dispute arising, it would have to be settled on the basis of an ordinary debt by a court of competent jurisdiction.  One can envisage a situation where the plaintiff's solicitor may be unpreoccupied &mdash; I would not like to attribute any other circumstances to him &mdash; to put the particular claim of the health board as part <Col N="286" /> of the special damages.  If that were so, it could be open to the health board to query the amount on a direct basis, on the basis of charges due.  More particularly, there is still open to the health board, not a mandatory obligation but rather a prospect open to the health board to waive whole or part of a charge if it considers it proper to do so, having had regard to the amount of damages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The discretionary element was deemed to be very necessary as part of the section, namely the introduction of &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  On that basis, it was felt that in equity to a particular individual who may have received a particularly bad degree of damages, the health board cannot vary a judicial award; it has no function in relation to the variation of the totality of an award but the health board are still free, in a conventional way, arising from other aspects of the treatment given to a person, to negotiate with that person on charges which may be due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a dispute either on the basis of a settlement outside a court or inside court, ultimately what you are saying is that the health board can take all the money which a person gets up to the maximum of what it is assessed to be.  The court's award will be for pain and suffering and for special expenses.  They can go beyond what he got for special expenses, eat into what he got for pain and suffering and take all the money.  Ultimately that is what the Minister is saying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that any self-respecting solicitor, &mdash; and there is a large number of them around &mdash; would be extremely loath to hand over a penny of his client's cash until the dispute with a health board had been resolved.  That can only be resolved in court itself, so that ultimately the matter would have to be settled by another court of jurisdiction, not the <Col N="287" /> court in question.  Perhaps, the Senator could come back to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us concentrate for a moment on what would happen in a situation where the court makes the award.  I realise that where settlements are made people can say settlements could be good or bad.  There is an element of discretion involved in those settlements.  I wonder if the Minister could go along with us in this way.  Could we change the Bill so as where a court makes a determination of contributory negligence that that determination must be applied to the charge as calculated by the health board?  Under the Bill as it stands at present that is not the case.</P>
      <P>During the sos Senator Durcan, who will be contributing later, I am sure, gave me the following example.  Take somebody who has a very serious illness, say a paraplegic whose case is worth £400,000 of which £100,000 is in respect of medical expenses.  In that case the £100,000 might be an underestimate rather than an overestimate, because remember it is past medical expenses and future medical expenses.  Say, it is worth £100,000 of the £400,000, it goes to court, there is a dispute on liability and the court holds that the paraplegic was responsible for 75 per cent and the defendant responsible for 25 per cent and makes an award of £400,000 to which the appropriate percentages are applied and the paraplegic gets £100,000 into his or her hand or, indeed, into the hand of a solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the Minister's intention that the £100,000 charge of the health board should have the same 75 per cent 25 per cent ratio applied to it and that the health board in those circumstances should get £25,000 and the paraplegic £75,000 as his damages for the pain and suffering, etc.  But the problem as I see it in the Bill as drafted at the moment is <Col N="288" /> that it would be open to the health board to say &ldquo;No, in spite of the award of the court we will not discount it.  We will have regard to the amount of damages, we will have regard to the question of contributory negligence, but we will exercise our discretion which this subsection gives us and in this case we will not make any discount&rdquo;.  Where the person has got £100,000 into the hands of his or her solicitor the health board say they are insisting on the full £100,000 for looking after this person in the past and in the future.  This leaves the paraplegic without anything in respect of the pain and suffering, which was the major portion of his or her claim.</P>
    <P>That problem appears to me to exist. If the Minister can persuade me that the problem does not exist, I will be very happy.  I have no problem beyond that. But it appears to me that in a case like that &mdash; and, of course, it would apply similarly to other cases at a different level &mdash; there is a problem.  The problem is very dramatic in cases involving paraplegics or quadraplegics where you have high medical expenses and contributory negligence.  You could have the case where the wrong exercise of discretion by the health board would give rise to a situation where the paraplegic or quadraplegic would get nothing into their hands in respect of their general damages.</P>
    <P>The Minister might say that if there is a dispute it can go to another court.  That is what the Minister said before he went to vote.  That is true.  But that court will have to judge it on the basis of the legislation and the legislation appears to say that the health board is entitled in certain circumstances where it considers it appropriate to demand the full amount. Unless there is a denial of natural justice, I do not think it will be open to the court to find that the health board are not entitled to pursue the full claim.  It appears to me that in those cases to leave a discretion with the health board is to place at risk the full general damages which the person has got in cases where there was a substantial degree of contributory negligence.  If the Minister can <Col N="289" /> say that I am wrong, I will be very happy to accede to the passing of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that view.  I touched on it on Second Stage and I made the point about contributory negligence. I also made the point that at the moment and for the future the health boards are and will be hungry for money.  If they feel they are owed a debt of £50,000 or whatever, they will look for their full pound of flesh.  They will not worry one iota whether or not there is contributory negligence or whatever.  Because of this section they can do so.  The Minister must seriously consider changing this section in some way to allow for the difficulty we see in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I apologise for not being here to move amendment No. 6.  I was detained elsewhere and I endeavoured to get here but did not succeed.</P>
      <P>There are four points I should like to make in relation to section 2.  The first point has been dealt with by the Minister while I was absent.  That is the question of whether this provison can operate retrospectively or not.  Certainly on reading section 2 (1) (b) it would seem that the provision can operate retrospectively.  With all due respect to the Attorney General and the draftsmen who have advised the Minister that it does not operate restrospectively, I can only comment that it was their offices who obviously advised on the regulations which were made under the 1970 Act which were subsequently, for very obvious reasons, held to be <i>ultra vires</i> the power of the Minister for Health at that time.  I must put on record my unhappiness at that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is in relation to section 2 (1) (c) which says &ldquo;or is entitled to receive damages...&rdquo;.  Further down &ldquo;the health board shall, notwithstanding anything in the Health Acts, 1947 to 1985 make a charge upon the person...&rdquo;.  In other words, there is a positive onus and duty on the health board to proceed against somebody who is entitled to receive damages, whether that person <Col N="290" /> receives or does not receive damages.  A situation could arise where somebody out of ignorance does not proceed with a claim.  Time passes and the Statute of Limitations becomes effective against that person.  The health board may still, by virtue of the liberal operation of the Statute of Limitations specified in section 3 of this Bill, proceed against that person. It seems to me to impose a positive obligation on the health board to proceed and I am worried about that provision.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    <P>I would like to come to section 2 (2), which was the subject of some discussion already when the amendments were being discussed. This is the subsection which gives the health board power to waive under specific circumstances.  It is a discretionary power under which the health board will have, power to waive &ldquo;having had regard to the amount of damages or compensation, and interest (if any) thereon, received by the person liable to pay the charge in respect of the injury to which the charge relates...&rdquo;. I presume what is meant there is a case where a small amount of damages is awarded or where somebody settles their claim for a small sum of money, so the health board may consider for various reasons that they should not proceed.  I would like the Minister to clarify that and more important, subsection (2) (a) (ii) which deals with the situation where there is an element of contributory negligence involved.</P>
    <P>I am extremely worried for the reasons which Senator O'Leary outlined that the situation may arise where an award is made of substantial damages, say £400,000 and the court holds that the plaintiff was 75 per cent negligent.  The plaintiff in such a case would receive £100,000.  The charge which is due to the health board may be £50,000.  The health board may very well say we will go after our full bite of the cherry because the plaintiff still has £50,000 left.  That is why when I was putting down an amendment to this subsection I tried to provide that the health board would agree to a <i>pro <Col N="291" /> rata</i> element, in other words, the maximum that they could obtain under such circumstances would be the percentage amount awarded on a contributory negligence basis.  The fourth point is that I would like the Minister to spell out precisely what section 2 (2) (b) means because I have read and re-read that subsection and, quite frankly, I find it difficult to comprehend and perhaps the Minister would explain it to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator O'Leary and Senator Fallon on the points they were making.  As we all know, it is not uncommon for a case to take four, five or six years before the litigants get into the courts and have it heard and settled.  It is only natural that the health boards will also have to wait that length of time to see what the situation and the outcome will be.  Having to wait that length of time, the health boards could consider that they were entitled to charge their full fees.  It would probably be the severely handicapped, the long term patients suffering from accidents that would suffer most in this case.  It is the people that would really need the money that are very badly affected and indeed could be left with nothing at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to sum up we have been discussing this section in the Minister's absence.  Our anxiety is just to have the legislation as good as possible.  The Chair in giving its decision on this section, particularly subsection (2) (a), gave its decision based on the fact that this amendment would create a charge on the Exchequer if it were framed in the way that Senator Fallon has suggested.  It is for that reason that we have a problem.  If the Chair in his wisdom and consultation with advisers decided that this section could create a charge, well, then, our case rests on that because we are worried that the health boards will be looking for their pound of flesh; if we put in an amendment to ensure that they do not get it then that proves that it would create a charge.  That is why we want to make <Col N="292" /> sure that the Bill is as tight as possible.  I do not mind some areas of discretion, but we have experience of discretion in this area, and it does not always work in the interest of the person.  It works in the interest at times of health boards who could be in difficulty about trying to ensure that their books are balanced or if there is money due to them.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister has tried to explain it in the best way possible to reassure us in this area but if a matter is decided in court, as outlined by Senator O'Leary, and if the health board still pursue their legitimate claim as they see fit, they will have to go back into another court situation and the court would have to take account of the amount of discretion that this legislation gives.  I do not know if the second court can give any other interpretation than that the Bill is there.  Certainly, if I had this case and we had gone down along this road and we enacted the legislation as it is and I felt that there was an anomaly and I went to the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman would immediately quote the section under which health boards make their decisions.  That is our problem with it.  We need reassurance from the Minister; otherwise we might be suggesting to him that on Report Stage he put down a ministerial amendment if he feels that we are creating a charge at this end.  If it is conceded that insisting on this amendment &mdash; if we can get it on the Report Stage &mdash; would create a charge that is confirmation that all our worries are not groundless.  Perhaps the Minister would try to clear up all the worries we have about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well appreciate the concern of Senators in this regard. One of the things which I would do and which I assure Senators that I will do, is that in writing to the health boards, arising out of the enactment of the legislation I would make quite clear the basis on which the health boards should act.  If one wants to boil it down to a particular sum of money in this regard we can take the £400,000 figure mentioned with a 75 per cent contributory negligence, and <Col N="293" /> £100,000 would be received by the plaintiff.  If there was a health board charge of, say, £40,000 the health board knows that the same ratio would have to apply and would be seeking in effect its £25,000 out of the £100,000.  It is difficult enough for the health boards in any circumstances to get any money out of people, particularly arising out of compensation cases and damages cases.  Where somebody is held to be 75 per cent negligent and feels that he has been done out of £300,000, the problem of the health board will be to get their hands on the £25,000 in the first instance.  You could well imagine how difficult that is going to be.  Inevitably, in a proportion of those cases &mdash; and very rapidly this will happen &mdash; they will finish up in another court of competent jurisdiction whereby the sum due to the health board on foot of the charge made by the health board will be contested anyway, most likely by a solicitor who would reassure his client that he will bring the CEO, the programme manager and the accountant of the health board to the cleaners once again and will certainly contest what they would regard as a draconian imposition on them by way of a charge.  I will certainly be saying to the health boards that in such settlements they will have to take account of the degree of contributory negligence, if any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that under section 3 which is explicitly there for the recovery of charges by health boards, any court of competent jurisdiction would first take clear cognisance of the intent of section 2 (2) and would have to take into account the obligation on the health board to grant a waiver; and, secondly, have regard to the amount of damages received, the interest on those damages and then the degree of contributory negligence arising out of that.  I do not think a health board could sustain in a court of competent jurisdiction an excessive demand.  Most health boards are reasonable in that regard and bearing in mind that persons who suffer severe injuries arising out of such accidents and so on, are not exactly great examples to be dragged through the courts by a health board. <Col N="294" /> A health board invariably acts in a sensitive way.  I find, going through the files in my Department, the biggest problem is to get any money out of anybody for anything in this country in relation to the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we are all delighted with the Minister's exposition of the position as it stands and the directive he will give to the health boards.  I would like to ask the Minister, if that is the intention, why does the legislation not say it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, because there is a world of compensation for personal injury, for damages, for executorships.  Persons die in some cases and subsequently the degree of complication relative to this whole question is so vast and the range of special damages for people arising out of road traffic accidents is so multifarious that it took a long time to get the parliamentary draftsmen to produce this legislation.  Admittedly, they were wrong in the previous regulations but I am sure the calibre of Parliamentary Draftsmen has improved enormously over the years.  They were deemed to be wrong by the Supreme Court in terms of the original regulations made.  Therefore great care has been taken with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As you well know, the best constitution of a country is the one which is written on a postage stamp and the best Bill is one which is written in very short, precise terms without all the extreme qualifications.  This is why this is a short Bill to enable just that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Cassidy's aside there summed up the entire position that too much care has been taken with regard to this Bill and I would agree with him.  If we look at section 2 we see two things of interest.  First, we see that the health board shall make a charge.  There is a positive duty, there is a positive obligation, an onus on the health board to <Col N="295" /> make a charge against a person who has recovered damages and who has incurred charges to the health board.  The health board shall make a charge, it says; and yet in subsection (2) (a), which deals with waivers, under certain circumstances the health board is there afforded a discretion &mdash; the health board may waive.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Cassidy.  Great care was taken with the drafting of this Bill.  It is a pity that the health board was not given some discretion as to whether they should make a charge or not, but the health board are given no discretion in the legislation.  The Bill states that the health board &ldquo;shall make a charge&rdquo;; the health board &ldquo;shall move&rdquo;; the health board &ldquo;may waive&rdquo;.  That is what I object to in this Bill.  The Minister said tonight that we are in times of strained financial circumstances, resources are scarce. Under those circumstances the health board will decide that they cannot waive. That is the problem we are faced with. That is the problem that somebody who is awarded £100,000, which is 25 per cent of the total award, is faced with, because on the basis of contributory negligence they are held 75 per cent responsible. It is under those circumstances that the health board will decide that they cannot waive the charge and there is no obligation on them to do so.  That is my first point.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Minister did not clarify the meaning of subsection 2 (b).  I would like the Minister to clarify that for me. That is a subsection which I have read and reread.  I have read it in the context of the entire section and I have read it in the context of the entire Bill and I still have not been able to grasp it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The health board would have almost no role in relation to recovery if it was purely discretionary on the part of the health board to impose a charge in the first instance.  The purpose of it being obligatory on the health board is that the person is in receipt of health services.  The person is going to be involved one way or the other in a compensation claim and at that time there is no way <Col N="296" /> of knowing whether or not the person is going to get compensation, and the person must prepare the claim.  Therefore, it shall be obligatory on the health board to give that person a document stipulating the cost incurred in his treatment to date which would broadly indicate the type of treatment he is getting, the kind of trauma he has suffered, and that would form part of his damages claim.  We would have a queer kettle of fish if it was discretionary on the part of the health board to do this, because subsequently it could transpire that the person would be virtually taking action against the health board for failing to give him documentation to enable him to present his case to his solicitor to bring into court saying that there were charges upon him requiring special damages. That is where the situation is largely protective, and it is anticipatory where a charge arises upon a person who received or is entitled to receive such damages. That is a prospective anticipation of a person being entitled to receive such compensation in respect of the in-patient or out-patient services.</P>
      <P>The health boards have discussed this situation with us and, as they see it, that is the only basis on which they can operate it.  They must have, in effect, statutory authority devolved on them to so do. That is my brief comment in that regard and I do not see how one can dilute the Bill or shift the emphasis within the Bill at this stage in a way which would be of any further benefit.</P>
      <P>Regarding paragraph (b), this is a technical cover whereby such a power to waive a charge cannot be taken into account in proceedings for determination of the amount of damages.  Without this cover it is possible that the court could award a lesser amount of damages knowing that the charges can be waived or could be reduced.  That gives the court a degree of technical cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, going back to the <Col N="297" /> original comment of the Minister, where he said that he was prepared to write to the various health boards explaining the position, let us assume that the Bill is passed in all Stages without amendment tonight and let us assume that the Minister writes to the various health boards next week, what happens in three or four years' time when there is a situation, which has been referred to, of a person getting an award of, say, £100,000 and there is proof of 75 per cent contributory negligence which would reduce his claim to £25,000, assuming the bill from the health board is also for £25,000?  The letter from the Minister would not be worth the paper it is written on.  The court would say the Act says that the health board may or may not waive and they would take every penny of the £25,000. Some health boards may avail, may decide that they should do this, but the law is what is going to count on the day. Having regard to that, it is still not too late to change this Bill to comply with the aspirations and beliefs of many Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The degree of the waiver, the amount of the waiver and the discretionary non-collection would be recorded in the health board as a health services charge which was incurred by the health board.  As we know, in relation to road traffic accidents people can be in hospital for six or nine months or for longer and there is a very large sum of money involved in those circumstances. There are other factors involved which frequently have to be taken into account. One million persons or 360,000 subscribers are covered by VHI.  The plaintiffs solicitor might well argue about moneys accrued to a health board from VHI income if the person was in a private or semi-private ward for a period of time or transferred from one hospital to another or where the person required private specialised care.  All these factors would come into the computing of a particular final account, but the health board have the discretion.  Our problem in many respects relating to health board accounts is that there are so many representations <Col N="298" /> made in respect of people who owe money to health boards, there are so many people who get magnificent services from hospitals and the day they walk out the door of the hospital &mdash; with no disrespect to my fellow Irishmen and women &mdash; they leave a box of chocolates with the nurse, but they do not pay their bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is unfair to say that being a Member of Seanad Éireann is an exercise in frustration and being a Government supporter in Seanad Éireann is an exercise in total frustration &mdash; leaving aside the excellent amendments accepted by the Minister to whom we must pay tribute for his attitude during the passage of the Dental Bill some time ago and other amendments he has made. Normally, the position is that Bills are fairly well torn asunder in the other House, or else ignored.  It creates a situation where this House is expected to adopt the same attitude.  I do not think I am being unfair to anybody in saying that the examination on Committee Stage of the Bill in this House is throwing up problems that were not considered before. We are entitled to a response to those problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of the Bill does not worry anybody in the House, so far as I can establish.  I am not wildly enthusiastic about it, but it does not cause me any concern.  It is re-establishing a position which existed until 1983.  That is fair enough.  If the Minister accepts the logic of what we are saying with regard to the question of contributory negligence, I do not see why he could not change the Bill along the following lines: leaving the discretion with regard to subsection (2) (a) (i) and inserting either a different subsection or a different paragraph between (1) and (2) that a health board shall waive <i>pro rata</i> a charge under subsection (1) of this section in a case where there is contributory negligence on the part of the person who was injured or any amendment of that which would have similar affect.  It would allow health boards to have a general discretion in cases, for example, where settlements are <Col N="299" /> made elsewhere or a general discretion to respond to the circumstances of the day as they find them.  It would deal specifically with the problem of contributory negligence and where a determination of the court existed it would put a statutory obligation on the health board to acknowledge that judicial interpretation. I do not see any reason why the Minister could not consider an amendment along those lines.  By inserting between (I) and (II), with reference to (II) that a health board shall waive <i>pro rata</i> a charge under subsection (1) of this section in a case where there was contributory negligence on the part of the person to whose injury the charge relates or one for whose act he is responsible, having regard to any reduction in the amount which would have been received but for contributory negligence.</P>
    <P>That deals with that part of the problem.  It does not solve the problem but it makes a major contribution towards easing the position which we feel will exist on the passing of this legislation: that justice in this respect will be dependent on the goodwill of the health board rather than the statutory entitlement of the citizen.  The Minister is quite right, of course.  Perhaps a court would shoot it down anyway if they went overboard.  It would not stand up in constitutional law if they adopted the kind of suggestion which I made.  But we cannot depend on the court for that kind of interpretation. It should not be necessary for a person to go to the extent of taking the health board to court in order to establish that principle when we have the opportunity of introducing it in the legislation.  That is what we are there for.  I suggest to the Minister that he consider making an amendment like that in the interest of clarifying the position.  The Minister says it is not actually changing the position, that it is what he means anyway.  But it is establishing in statute what the intention of the Minister is in any case.  I do not see anything wrong with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with Senator O'Leary.  We all know our health board <Col N="300" /> officials and CEOs would be very fair and competent people if we left it to their discretion.  Most of those cases take three to four years and, often longer, five and six years.  If a person had a very bad accident and had to be hospitalised for six or nine months and probably semi-invalided for the rest of his or her life &mdash; most people have to go through the trauma of one High Court case in a lifetime.  It is probably a very emotional and stressful time, but the last thing anybody wants is to have to go through a second High Court case.  This could even push it on for a further two years, creating further costs and further annoyance to everybody concerned.  If we could change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; it would leave us all happier.  The Seanad are known for scrutinising all Bills to the fullest extent. The Leader of the House in a recent remark in a Sunday paper, when he said that there was a higher class of debate in this House, was perhaps being factual. That is certainly true in the case of this Bill.  I would appeal to the Minister to accede to the concern of all Members on all sides of the House and to amend the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our duty here is to produce the best legislation possible.  Our duty is to ensure that we have clarity within the statute law.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;clarity&rdquo;, bearing in mind the background to the Bill.  At this stage it may be no harm to recall that background. Sixteen years ago this House and the other House were debating the Health Bill, 1970.  At that time the then Minister for Health envisaged this type of situation arising where a health board would have to charge for services provided following injuries sustained in a motor accident. The then Minister for Health said we could do it by introducing regulations which he would make under the appropriate section of the Bill when enacted.  The then Minister did so.  But the Supreme Court held that he was acting <i>ultra vires</i> his powers as conferred by the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is unusual in that we are now trying to legislate for a situation following <Col N="301" /> the <i>Cooke</i> v. <i>Walsh</i> case.  We are trying to legislate for clarity.  We are trying to legislate to ensure we will not have grey areas here.  Above all, we are trying to legislate to ensure that we do not have fuzzy law.  What we are doing in legislating in this way is legislating for and enacting fuzzy law, legislating to introduce more grey areas.  For that reason I would ask you to accede to the request of Senator O'Leary, Senator Cassidy and others. I would ask you to give this a re-think. We can amend this provision on Report Stage.  I am quite sure the Members of the other House could deal with the matter speedily tomorrow.  This Bill shot through the other House in record time. I am quite sure the amendment that has been suggested, the wording of which I am sure can be produced by the excellent parliamentary draftsman who has already been complimented by the Minister here tonight, can be found acceptable to the other House tomorrow.  There is no reason, therefore, why this Bill cannot be enacted in a clear, simple form rather than in a fuzzy, grey manner.</P>
    <P>I would express extreme worry once again about this section as it stands.  It is a minefield into which not merely injured persons or their dependants, but health boards, should not be allowed to drift.  I would ask you to prevent that situation happening.</P>

      <P>As the Senators well know, I would have little hesitation in acceding to a request of that nature if I genuinely thought I could formulate, even for Report Stage, a particular amendment &mdash; going back to the other House would not worry me &mdash; in the interests of not being too fuzzy or too obscure about it.  I have a genuine problem.  I would point out, in fairness to my predecessor, the late Erskine Childres, that on the regulation which the late Minister put through.  The High Court found firmly in our favour and firmly supported the regulation.  The Supreme Court overthrew it on appeal.  The fuzziness is not all ministerial.  I remember a Deputy of the other House, a friend of mine, was driving along in County Meath <Col N="302" /> when a fellow with a horse box pulled out in front of him.  He went straight into it, he had to bring the case all the way up to the High Court.  On the steps of the High Court &mdash; I remember him telling me, and he was a very tough Deputy, well known to give vent to his frustration &mdash; they settled without admission of liability, without any question of acknowledgment of contributory negligence, even though the farmer who owned the horse box was fully insured, ironically with the same insurance company as the then Deputy. That company went bang afterwards, not arising out of the settlement, I can assure you.</P>
      <P>There are many cases where there is no admission of negligence.  There are a large number of cases where there is no allocation of damages and there is no distribution of damages, other than a lump sum settlement after much heckling which goes on for months and finally there is a settlement in an ante-room or on the court steps.  What does the health board do in that situation?  A health board has to have discretion.  It has to say: &ldquo;That particular individual got £180,000&rdquo;.  We as health boards do not have watching briefs at every road traffic accident litigation in the country.  We get minimal information.  We just get a return of information.  We have to say: &ldquo;We have a bill for £80,000.  We know he got so much.  We are going to look for so much and we are going to settle for so much&rdquo;.  We are not going to be unreasonable about it because of one simple factor.  He will not pay us.  He is not at that stage handing over any money.  So the health board must look for its money. It must justify what it is looking for.  It must produce its evidence in a court if it is contested and there is not a solicitor in this country who will hand over a brass farthing of his client's money to anybody unless it is literally torn out of the cash box in his desk.</P>

      <P>That is what they are there for; protecting their client's money and getting interest at the same time.  On that basis, the amount due to the health board is settled.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would consult with the Attorney General or my colleagues in the Department but I would have great difficulty at this stage other than saying to the health board: &ldquo;You now have enabling powers.  We would not be requesting you to act in a draconian manner.  If you did you would not get your money because it would be contested.  A health board going into another court and losing their case or getting partial settlement, stuck for substantial damages again and caught, would find themselves in dire trouble.  I have to leave it in that framework, but I can assure Deputies that I am quite prepared to write to the health boards in that framework and make it quite clear to them that they must take into account the amount of the damages, the interest paid on it, the degree of contributory negligence and the amount thereafter remaining.</P>
      <P>The health board at this stage will have incurred a substantial degree of cost.  It will be waiting until the money comes, because uniquely in Irish law, uniquely in this Bill, no penny can be got by the health board until after the award has been actually paid.  It might take five years.  Indeed you could have a situation where a health board might be due £20,000 from the year 1986.  They would not see a penny of that until 1991.  They would get no interest on it, but nevertheless there is a lot of money involved. There is about £4 million to £5 million a year involved.  In the interest of our health services, it is essential that this issue should be resolved.</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's concluding remarks about considering <Col N="304" /> this matter overnight, I think we would be prepared, in the interest of good legislation, to allow that to happen.  We should review it tomorrow morning after the Minister gets legal advice on it.  This would ensure that the legislation would be properly enacted, which is our role and our duty as legislators.  The Minister will realise that any legislation that comes before this House is properly dealt with in an effective manner, even if it means sitting late.  We want to do the job right. The Minister has given us a commitment that he will consider it overnight.  Is he suggesting that he would be ready first thing in the morning and we could order it for 10.30 a.m. and go straight into the Report Stage then and discuss it?  I propose we do that if the House agrees.</P>

      <P>I was out of the debate early in the day.  Many people do not have regard for the Minister but I have quite a regard for him.  I am sure we on this side of the House, the few of us who have stayed for this very important debate, would agree to what the Leader is proposing but, I worry deeply about any letter that goes from a Minister of April 1986, to health boards that are going to be done away with.  We are going to have a different type of health board before he leaves the Ministry unless something else removes him sooner.  I agree absolutely with Senator Durcan and Senator O'Leary.  I do not know for the life of me, why what he, as well as Senators Durcan and O'Leary, believes in cannot be put into this legislation, or what he as a Minister is going to write to the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the best heart in the world, we will go out of here now and we will agree with the Minister he will still come in the morning and tell us that some legal person has advised him that this cannot be done.  When the Minister is gone out of the Department and maybe some of us are still left here with another Minister for Health, this Bill is what will rule on claims and what the person injured will eventually have in their pocket.  There are two very good lawyers advising the Minister on the Government side of the <Col N="305" /> House, Senator O'Leary and Senator Durcan.  They are asking him to include this in the Bill with the support of the Opposition rather than sending letters to boards that he is going to change before he leaves the Ministry.  I have a holy horror of them anyway, whether they are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, and CEOs do not know what they are at half the time.</P>

      <P>The oracle has spoken. The Minister has agreed to ruminate overnight.  I want to thank the Minister for his agreement to delay the matter until tomorrow morning.  The Minister is carrying through his record of allowing us to amend virtually every Bill he brings into this House whether initiated here or in the other House.  I sincerely hope that the Minister in his talks on this section and this problem will respond constructively along the lines which have been suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support that sentiment and hope that something comes out of it.  I want to instance what I think would be a factual situation.  I am sure Senators Durcan and O'Leary will agree with me.  For example, take the case of a front seat passenger in a private car which is involved in an accident.  The front seat passenger is injured and is not wearing a seat belt.  Insurance companies will automatically tell you that a claim of, say, £100,000 is reduced by roughly 25 per cent.  Therefore, there is £75,000 of an award.  Let us assume that the health board charges come to £20,000.  Will the health board say they are prepared to take £16,000 or will they look for their full £20,000?  They will say: &ldquo;You have got £75,000 of an award.  Our bill is £20,000 and that is what we want&rdquo;.  That is a factual situation.  I am not talking about other cases where a little bit of contributory negligence may be argued. It is a well known fact, as solicitors will tell you, that if a front seat passenger is involved in an accident and is not wearing a seat belt the claim is reduced by 25 per cent.  Knowing health boards I would say that under this Bill they will say; &ldquo;Our <Col N="306" /> bill is for £20,000 and we want every penny of it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his agreement to look at the matter overnight.  That is very helpful.  So that the Minister will be fully appraised of what the concerns of the House are I think we should refer briefly to the second matter to which the Minister himself quite rightly referred and which I did not refer to during the course of my initial contribution to the debate on this section. That is, what is going to happen in cases where agreement is reached and that the case is settled not as a result of a judicial decision, which is the first problem, but as a result of a compromise by the parties of the action?  The Minister himself quite rightly says that a lot of these cases are settled outside the court.  The settlement of cases outside the court should be encouraged because it saves money, it reduces what the lawyers get and that is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is going to be that, as the Minister has outlined that time table, the following is what will take place.  The plaintiff on the steps of the court house or otherwise, advised by his solicitor and barrister, will compromise the action and accept a certain sum of money.  That sum of money, if it represents less than the full value of the case, will represent a real compromise.  After that, discussions will have to take place with the health board as to what discount, if any, they will allow on their charges.  I must advise the Minister that in those circumstances no legal adviser is going to accept such a compromise.  A client could not be advised to accept a compromise when one does not know what the health board are going to charge.  It could be done if the charge was a potential £5,000 out of £50,000 but where there is a significant compromise situation one could not advise somebody to reach a compromise on the basis of future discussions with the health board.  How could one say to a person, take £100,000 and we will afterwards discuss with the health board whether they will charge £50,000 or £10,000.  Nobody would ever agree to a <Col N="307" /> compromise like that on the basis of such an uncertain outcome.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is saying with regard to the cases that do not go to court is that in respect of those cases compromise will not be possible.  With those cases either one of two things will happen: either the prior approval of the health board will have to be sought to the compromise which will lead to total chaos or alternatively the case will not be compromised at all out of fear that the person advised will be damaged by the ultimate demand of the health board.  As a result more cases will go to trial.</P>
    <P>There are two problems which we should keep separate.  The first problem can be sorted by a simple amendment. The second problem is a lot more complicated.  It is a problem which the Minister must yet confront.  In respect of a claim where the medical charge for past, present and future care is significant no legal adviser will advise a person to settle a case at less than full value on the basis of the prospect that the health board will ultimately compromise the amount of money which they are claiming.  It will not happen because the solicitor would undoubtedly be leaving himself open to a negligence action if he failed ultimately to get the health board to compromise their charge to the expected extent.  They are practical realities.</P>
    <P>There are two problems for the Minister to consider.  One in respect of cases which go to court, which I think is very easily solved, and the other, which is not so easily solved.  The Minister should seriously consider conceding on the court award system.  It will write into the legislation the principle of <i>pro rata.</i> That will be an aid and a help in the question of compromising.  If the health boards are under no obligation to accept even a <i>pro rata</i> payment where the court adjudicates, they will feel under less obligation to accept it where the court does not adjudicate.  I thank the Minister for his open approach to the matter.  I think those matters should be considered.  I am hopeful that having considered them, the <Col N="308" /> Minister will come back and solve our problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Once one enters into the uncharted waters of <i>pro rata</i> reductions being formally enshrined in legislation, which would be such a major issue it would take some time to consider, certainly not overnight.  I do not think the parliamentary draftsman could possibly look at it in a short time.  If it were a question of the House being satisfied that it was mandatory on the health board to a more substantial degree following the change in this Bill, I could go along with that.  For example, the first line of section 2(a) whereby a health board shall waive the whole or part of a charge, which puts a firmer obligation on a health board in that framework&mdash;I think that is possible. On the hypothetical case, I would be prepared to accommodate the House in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two factors to be taken into account.  First, for 15 years the health boards were operating this system and operating it quite successfully; and, by and large, they were operating a degree of discretion and substantial waiving of whole or part of the bills as they arose. There was no great problem in that regard.  They never resorted to massive litigation.  There is substantial precedent available which could be drawn upon by the insurance and legal experts in the <Col N="309" /> event of that situation arising in future. The health boards and the law agents of the health boards are well aware of these precedents.  Therefore there is a protection already there in the event of this situation arising.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I think it is highly unlikely that any solicitor or legal adviser would urge a client to accept something like £40,000 if he was aware &mdash; and he would have to be aware because he would have fought the case through &mdash; that the health board was claiming £20,000 for services rendered.  That figure would be available to him.  He therefore is fully aware of that.  Whereas the insurance company may be offering £60,000 they know that the health board would not settle on the basis that the full £60,000 be retained or that the client retained £55,000 and the health board would settle for £5,000. From casual inquiry to the health board, he would equally be aware of it.  Therefore, to that extent the parties are far more aware of their prospects.</P>
    <P>This is not a new enactment.  I doubt if I could accept a <i>pro rata</i> concept being introduced into legislation &mdash; in other words, devolving on a health board a mandatory obligation to accept a court decision on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  The implications and ramifications of that on a health board in terms of its proceedings would be such that I think a serious precedent would arise.  Certainly, within the framework of a statutory body having this imposition imposed on them willy-nilly in terms of charges arising, I doubt if the Government or if I could accept a change in that regard.  I could, I think, do this much and do it entirely on my own initiative in deference to the strong views in the Seanad, which have been more than interesting.  They have been particularly concerned about the kind of situation which can arise, namely, that there should be a much stronger obligation on the health boards to waive whole or part by deleting the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and inserting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  But let Senators not be under any illusion.  There is still a section which says &ldquo;if it considers it proper to do so&rdquo;.  It is not phrased particularly eloquently.  I hope the Parliamentary <Col N="310" /> Draftsman will forgive me for saying so. Nevertheless, that particular consideration is still there.  However, it does strengthen it.  Now it is that they &ldquo;shall&rdquo; waive whole or part of a charge if they consider it proper to do so, having regard to the two contingencies in subsection 2 (a) (I) and subsection 2 (a) (II).  Perhaps we could reach agreement on that and enable me to get a few bob for the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Removing the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and producing the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; does not do anything whatsoever there. It makes section 2 (2) (a) (I) a little bit senseless because the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is not applicable in relation to that.  But, more importantly, what it does is this.  It allows a health board in a case where there is an element of contributory negligence, where a plaintiff is held, say, 75 per cent responsible and he gets a quarter of his award, 25 per cent, in those circumstances to say &ldquo;Right, we will take 5 per cent off our bill&rdquo; and they have complied with their obligation.  To my mind, that would not be acceptable.  The introduction of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; does not solve the problem.  In fact, it can create other problems particularly in relation to section 2 (2) (a) (I).  I would ask the <Col N="311" /> Minister to consider the overall problem either overnight or between now and next week, because it is a very serious problem for the reasons that Senator O'Leary outlined in his last comments on this section with which I fully agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank-the House for this opportunity to speak on this important matter.  I welcome the Minister to the House and I wish him well in his appointment.  This is a very wide area and I can only touch the surface here and there, I will go through it as fast as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> Most people find difficulties with definitions of adult education, so I will not dwell on them.  Suffice it to say that for today's adult and the adult of tomorrow there will be little choice but to be an adult learner.  No longer is it possible to say that one's education can be completed in the first 17 years or so of one's life.  The concept of learning throughout one's life must now be instilled in students from their first day of schooling.</P>
    <P>Adult education can take many forms and cater for many different levels of need.  It must be flexible and quickly adaptable to changing needs and developments.  It should not be an adjunct to the educational system as a whole but rather an integrated part of it.  It should not be a follower-on of the education system, depending on the cast off or limited resources of other branches of the system, but rather it should be the leader, leading the way into new technologies, pioneering new methods, updating skills, including those for its own personnel, and generally responding at local level to the problems of its time.</P>
    <P>An adult is an autonomous being and as such must be given a say in the decisions which effect him or her.  Things which sometimes seem trivial or unimportant to some are responding to needs not associated with everyone else's well-being, but to that person they are most important.  Adults wish to choose the methods by which they will learn. These can vary from structured, directed, imposed and subject-centred to unstructured, self-directed, agreed and student-centred learning experiences.  Adult education must no longer be seen as something one does in the winter evenings to shorten the season.  It must become and continue to be a vibrant force in maintaining that freedom which is the consequence of education and which can be lost in a world where obsolescence is affecting everyone's lives at a pace which continues to accelerate.  It may not be the panacea for all our ills but adult education certainly can go a long way to reducing or preventing some of them.</P>
    <P>A recognition by Government of the <Col N="314" /> contribution which adult education can make would go a long way to making it acceptable to the masses.  The present attitude of Government that adult education should be self-financing not only makes it seem unnecessary but leaves it available only to those who can afford it. Is this the mark of a caring Government?</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about equal opportunity.  There are two ways to reach the top in any profession or business. One way is to continue on in education right through third level and post-graduate and to then enter the profession or business at the top or within sight of it. This option is not open to all, but only to those whose parents or guardians can afford it, and they are a small minority. This method also puts a very heavy burden on the State and the taxpayer since it is very heavily subsidised relative to the number who enter it.</P>
    <P>The second path to the top is more difficult and much longer, and for the majority it is out of sight, unattainable, as are the rewards that go with it.  This group, the majority, leave school at second level, many without finishing their studies and enter the job market at the lower reaches.  They will have to fight their way up every inch of the way, proving themselves to all and sundry, and only very few will make it.  They may get into the professions, but again it will be against the odds.  Now when this group first enter employment they immediately start contributing through their taxes to the education of their own age group at third level.  They are in fact contributing to those who will later enter employment at levels way above themselves and better remunerated as a result.  The higher educated groups attain this at the expense of those who could not afford third level education in the first place and who have been contributing for five to seven years towards those in higher education.  This is not equality of educational opportunity for all.</P>
    <P>In order to redress this imbalance, those who do not or cannot in the first instance avail of third level education should be entitled to compensate, at the <Col N="315" /> State's expense and through the developed adult education system, with whatever further education they require during their working lives.  With the rapid social and technological changes affecting to a greater extent the less well educated, the need for a commitment is now greater than ever before and will become even more acute in the future.  The concept of paid educational leave could be linked to this proposal and the ILO Convention 140 ratified and implemented. The necessary commitment should now be given by Government and phased in over the next three to five years.</P>
    <P>A simple system of education credits could be introduced which would relate to the number of years an individual might have but who did not have third level education.  For example, a scale could be drawn up on the the basis that one could be subsidised at third level for seven years.  Then, if one only attended for six years he or she would have one credit which could be cashed in at any time later in life.  If one did not attend third level at all, he or she would be entitled to seven credits.  Credits could be cashed in against recognised courses at recognised institutes whenever the person felt the need.  This would be particularly appropriate for unemployed and unwaged persons, especially in times of recession, when they could improve their employment potential.  This system would be more cost efficient since recipients of credits would be educated as required and would not be part of the &ldquo;brain drain&rdquo; where we get no return on our investment.</P>
    <P>Responding to needs is of critical importance.  The recent report of the Commission on Adult Education pointed to the lack of awareness, misunderstanding, lack of knowledge of the nature of adult education and the lack of participants from among the working class people and the rural dwellers.  If adult education were perceived as contributing to the welfare of these people rather than something only available to the more financially better off, then adult education could make some inroads in assisting <Col N="316" /> with the many problems associated with the lack of education of the working classes and the less well off.</P>
    <P>Over recent years much effort and attention was focused on the plight of our younger population.  More recently, with the decline in the birth rate, that population bulge has gradually moved into the lower reaches of the adult population. New and different types of problems are starting to emerge, as many of those who were the youth change status from single to married and start raising their own families.  Many of these will never have known secure paid employment and for those fortunate enough to have had some employment the nature and patterns of work will continue to change.  Jobs which ten years ago appeared secure will in many instances become obsolete.  The greater role of women in society, their increasing roles at work, their increased availability for work, their wish to return to work after family rearing and the laws on equality will increase their number in the workforce.</P>
    <P>Robotics and new technologies will reduce the labour intensity of many jobs and reduce the number of monotonous, repetitive jobs.  This in turn will reduce the number of semi-skilled jobs and replace many with more highly skilled service and maintenance work.  Whatever solution is found to the great problem of unemployment it is certain to create more discretionary time for everybody.  These and other factors mean that the needs which can be met by and through adult education are ever changing.  Therefore, positive strategies must be developed and the constraints to participation in the provision of adult education must be eliminated.  Adult education must always respond to adults' needs for basic education and provide, free, a programme of literacy, numeracy, communication, life and coping skills.  This programme must be fully and properly resourced.</P>
    <P>The recent report of the Commission on Adult Education entitled <i>Lifelong Learning</i> has, by its very title, recognised the problems and indicated the main thrust of the solution &mdash; lifelong learning. <Col N="317" /> We must remove the barriers to participation.  Very few would disagree with the concepts in <i>Lifelong Learning.</i> Most would see them as a very positive response to the problems and as a way forward, provided the proper commitment is given to providing the structures and removing the barriers to participation.</P>
    <P>Adult Education is not seen as part of the education system.  It is more often seen, wrongly, as a facility for providing leisure time activities to those who can afford it.  At present for those who can take the trouble to find out there is a vast comprehensive programme embracing areas from literacy and basic life skills to courses leading to nationally and internationally recognised certification.  Adult education will only be acceptable when it is seen to have a contribution to make to the educational welfare of the communities it serves and as a response to their needs throughout life.  For many these needs are for free or low cost programmes or through the credits system mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The Government must give recognition, commitment and support to adult education.  This may well have started with the recent decision to provide the <i>ad hoc</i> VEC adult education boards with a budget, however small, for literacy and community education.  In the more recent Green Paper <i>Partners in Education,</i> the previous Minister for Education failed to follow through when the adult education boards did not receive any standing in the summary of the main proposals.  The adult education boards should have been structured in, thereby recognising adult education as an integral part of the education process.  Failure to do this makes one wonder if the Government are taking adult education seriously.  It is indeed very serious if they do not recognise the potential and present goodwill of providers and public alike.</P>
    <P>The policy of self-financing in adult education must be removed and a system introduced which recognises inability to pay and other constraints which prevent many from participating.  For certain courses recognised for the purpose the <Col N="318" /> system of credits proposed earlier should be available to participants.  Households where both parents are unemployed, husband and wife, should be charged only a minimum fee.  This should also apply to old aged pensioners and identified disadvantaged groups.  It should apply to all courses, since for many in these categories the development of discretionary time is of great importance.</P>
    <P>The regulations governing receipt of benefit under the social welfare system must be changed so that the unemployed are not prohibited from attending day time courses.  Surely it is more appropriate that they constructively occupy their time and they will still be available for work and not in the black economy as some would accuse.  Creches should be provided free or at very little charge in order that women with children can readily attend day adult education courses.  A counselling service should be provided in each adult education board area so that adults, whether requiring literacy or third level education, could be properly advised and directed.  The youth employment levy should provide funding to adult education boards to provide early school leavers with compensatory skills, industrial and business skills, communications skills and an introduction to modern technology.</P>
    <P>The lack of tutors in rural areas is due in the main to the penal system of taxation which makes teaching evening courses most unattractive, taken in conjunction with the preparation, distance to centre, poor remuneration, unsocial hours and lack of resources suited to the needs of adults.  Some method of tax incentive would encourage professionals to return to servicing adult education. Adult education should provide the base for new technologies where teachers and business people could learn about these before introducing them to classrooms or business situations.  This would be more efficient all round.</P>
    <P>Daytime adult education provision should be encouraged.  It is not.  Indeed, it would seem that barriers are raised which prevent the continuation of developing programmes.  These barriers take <Col N="319" /> many forms &mdash; the non provision of resources, the withdrawal of resources, rooms or buildings, no commitment towards upkeep or replacement of equipment, no adequate provision for literacy schemes, no organisational people at local level, no creche provision for women with young children, examination regulations which militate against adults on second chance courses, no suitable adult qualifications geared to part time learning, no easy access to third level or open university courses.</P>
    <P>Anyone can set himself or herself up as a provider of adult education.  The black economy is full of people who find it more lucrative to go it alone, not subject to interference from tax laws, rather than to be part of a structure where the penalty is not alone the tax taken but the harrassment when the powers that be become aware of additional income. How easy it is to operate with no tax, no insurance, no overheads, no administration, no accountability, no commitment and cash in the hand.  Perhaps the time is ripe for requiring all providers to be registered before they are allowed to run such programmes.</P>
    <P>The method of appointing school officers with full-time jobs on the basis of points generated in the system two years previously and attempting a comparison with posts of responsibility in the post primary system is a deterrent in attracting suitable, committed personnel to these positions.  There is no incentive for the <i>bona fide,</i> non-statutory, voluntary provider to co-operate with the statutory since there is no commitment to sharing resources or expertise.  The statutory agency depends on a points system to provide the personnel to run the scheme; so, in fact, they tend to be in competition.</P>
    <P>Action, therefore, is needed in many areas including the following.  A Government commitment to the concept of lifelong learning.  The Government should withdraw the self financing regulation.  The Government should provide all necessary literacy and basic education free as a right of every citizen.  The Government should remove the barriers <Col N="320" /> to participation by the unemployed and subsidise their attendance at all courses they attend; courses which enhance their employment prospects should be encouraged and should be free.  The Government should ratify the ILO Convention 140 on paid educational leave.  The Government should take the necessary steps to implement the educational credits scheme by 1988.  Any revision of the Green Paper <i>Partners in Education</i> must place the adult education boards firmly in the structure, on a county organised basis and at the same level as schools' boards of mangement.  Adult education directors at school principal level, one for each population district of 50,000 to 60,000 people, should be appointed to respond to the growing needs and demands for adult and community education and should be available to assist all <i>bona fide</i> organisations, who should be registered with the adult education boards.</P>
    <P>A more appropriate system of appointment of local area officers should be devised, and, in areas where adult education registered activity exceeds 15,000 attendance hours for the previous year, this position would be at vice principal level. Further &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; posts should be created &mdash; the &ldquo;B&rdquo; post for each additional 5,000 attendance hours and an &ldquo;A&rdquo; post at 10,000 attendance hours.  Daytime provision of adult education should be positively encouraged and all new post primary schools and school building extensions where adult education is on offer should have provision for adult education included.  This could be available to the school after the adult education provision had been met.  This should include creche provision.</P>
    <P>A locally devised system of examination for adults, having parity with the existing system but taking the adult point of view, should be put into operation before 1988.  Negotiation should take place immediately to enable Irish citizens full access to all Open University courses and awards.  Some funding from the youth employment levy should be provided to adult education boards to provide special education and pre-work <Col N="321" /> programmes for early school leavers.  In order that the best qualified people will service the programmes in adult education and taking account of the other elements &mdash; unsocial hours, preparation time etc. &mdash; and not wishing to increase the burden of fees on participants, all payments for teaching on adult programmes should have a flat rate of 10 per cent applied.  A counselling service should be set up in every adult education board area.</P>
    <P>As a former part-time teacher and one who enjoyed getting a diploma in part-time adult education teaching, I have a great interest in this area.  I want to pay tribute to all the people who have been involved in adult education.  I would like to pay tribute particularly to the VEC in my own county and to Mr. Jim Marsden, the adult education officer in County Meath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzsimons has raised many interesting and useful ideas in the field of adult education.  The first thing we have to do is to define what we mean by adult education.  I would like to quote two definitions.  The first comes from the report of the Murphy Committee in 1973 which defined adult education as:</P>
      <P>The provision and utilisation of facilities whereby those who are no longer participants in the full-time school system may learn whatever they need to learn at any period of their lives.</P>
      <P>The second definition comes from the report entitled <i>Lifelong Learning</i> of the Commission on Adult Education in 1984, which defines adult education in these terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adult education includes all systematic learning by adults which contributes to their development as individuals and members of the community and of society apart from full-time instruction received by persons as part of their uninterrupted initial education and training.  It may be formal education which takes place in <Col N="322" /> institutions, for example, training centres, schools, colleges, institutes and universities of non-formal education which is any other systematic form of learning, including self-directed learning.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that both definitions distinguish between initial or full-time education, on the one hand and adult education, on the other.</P>
    <P>In that sense adult education is distinct from mainstream educational provision in this country, as indeed it is in most countries but in another sense, adult education in the terms of the motion is an integral part of the Irish educational system to the extent that most of it is provided by regular educational establishments.  Vocational education committees, for example, have traditionally been the main providers of adult education programmes and it is appropriate that I should pay tribute to the sterling work done by the committees in this field. I note with pleasure the tributes paid by Senator Fitzsimons.  Community and comprehensive schools, of which more than 50 have been built over the past 20 years, have, as part of their brief, made provision for the education of adults in the communities served by these schools. Indeed the involvement of the local community at the planning level had added an interesting dimension to the courses offered by these schools.  The voluntary secondary schools have also made educational provision for adults.</P>
    <P>I need hardly add, of course, that a great deal of educational activity for adults is organised outside the regular school system.  I am referring here to the work of voluntary organisations who have made a significant contribution to the development of adult education. Some examples may suffice to indicate the general nature of this voluntary endeavour.  For example, the ICA provide weekend and week-long courses in the association's residential adult education college in County Louth.  Dublin based organisations, such as the People's College and the Dublin Institute of Adult Education, cater for a wide range of adult <Col N="323" /> education needs from basic education to courses of a high academic standard. These and many other voluntary organisations came together with the statutory agencies over 15 years ago to form a national association for adult education which is well known to us all under its Irish title of Aontas.  This in turn gave rise about eight years ago to the National Adult Literacy Agency which concerns itself with the specific issue of adult literacy and numeracy, a matter in which the Government take a special interest.  I mention these organisations, in particular, since, among others, they are in receipt of an annual grant-in-aid from my Department.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the second part of Senator Fitzsimons's motion, the issue of the funding of adult education and, by implication and extension of that, the measure of the Government's interest in this subject.  I take issue with Senator Fitzsimons when he quotes from the Green Paper and then makes the assertion wondering whether the Government take adult education seriously.  I want to assure the Senator that the Government do and the proof of their seriousness is as follows.  It has been Government policy over the years that adult education programmes should be provided without cost to the State, that is to say that the income from fees must be sufficient to defray the costs of providing the traditional type of adult education course.  This kind of course lasts from ten to 20 weeks on the basis of one or two evenings and deals with matters of an academic, vocational, cultural or indeed recreational nature.  As far as that kind of course is concerned there is no change in Government policy.</P>
    <P>I should like, however, to bring to the attention of the Seanad and of Senator Fitzsimons in particular the terms of paragraph 5.28 of <i>Building on Reality</i> which states:</P>
    <P>The Government have agreed to provide over £1 million by 1987 in funds to the VECs to enable them to establish courses&mdash;free of charge or at <Col N="324" /> a nominal sum&mdash;in community education and in literacy.</P>
    <P>This Government, therefore, are the first&mdash;and I emphasise this to Senator Fitzsimons&mdash;in the history of the State to make specific resources available for adult education.  This demonstrates the Government's commitment to the development of educational services for adults and particularly to the services for the disadvantaged sections of our society.  It also accords recognition to adult education as an element in its own right distinct from the traditional full time levels of our educational system.</P>
    <P>This special funding will be made available to the adult education boards through the VECs.  These boards, as the Senator is aware, were recommended in the report of the Commission on Adult Education.  The recommendation was adopted by my predecessor who set the necessary machinery in train to have the boards established.  An Adult Education Board has been established in every VEC area and I should like to acknowledge once again the effective co-operation of the committees in that regard.</P>
    <P>To sum up then, the Government have demonstrated their commitment to the development of adult education services in the clearest way possible, by making separate funding available.  In these straitened times that is an achievement in which I take some personal satisfaction.  It represents a significant advance on the traditional approach to adult education and it is an approach which, as circumstances allow, we will be able to develop further in the years ahead.  I am obliged to Senator Fitzsimons for his interest in this subject and I know that the many issues raised by him in his contribution have potential value and I assure him they will have the consideration of myself and my officials.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 April 1986.</P>
