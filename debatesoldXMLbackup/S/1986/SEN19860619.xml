      <P>I have notice from Senator John Connor that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that the Saharwi Question is on the Agenda of the next meeting of the EC Heads of State on the basis of self-determination or independence for the indigenous population of Western Sahara.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mick Lanigan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give a commitment to ensure that the Irish Battalion of UNIFIL remain on duty in the Lebanon and to exert pressure at home and abroad on the UN to pay to Ireland any moneys due for service rendered with UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael Lynch of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the progress to date in the renovation work to the Garda Barracks, Oldcastle, County Meath, <Col N="1032" /> since the matter was raised in the House on 20 November 1985.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Thomas Hussey of the matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the extension to Lavally School, Tuam, County Galway.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Connor's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken from 5 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.  Senators Lanigan, Lynch and Hussey may give notice for another day of the matter they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take items Nos. 1 to 6 as they appear on the Order Paper.  Nos. 1 and 2 are Money Bills.  That is why they are being brought forward today.  No. 3 is not a Money Bill but almost a Money Bill.  I am grateful to the Opposition for their agreement to take this Bill today.  In regard to Nos. 4 and 5, the Second Stage debate has been commenced in each case.  It is proposed to continue with the Second Stage debate today but not to conclude it.  In each case the Minister responsible has a public engagement elsewhere and would be anxious to reply in person to the debate. Therefore, the proposition is, in regard to Nos. 4 and 5 coupled with No. 6, that the debate would be continued as long as Senators are offering and that the debate would be adjourned and completed next week.  I think it would be appropriate to suspend the sitting for an hour at some suitable time in the business around 12.30 or 1 p.m.</P>

    <Title>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1986:  (  Certified Money Bill )   Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to provide for the further financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited by extending the industrial assistance limits in current legislation to provide for the continuation of SFADCo's industrial and tourism/ traffic development roles.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the Bill provides for an increase from £120 million to £130 million in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares in the company; and an increase from £60 million to £105 million in the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid, voted annually, which may be made to the company.</P>
      <P>Share capital subscribed to the company is used for capital expenditure on the industrial estate at Shannon and in the mid-west region and west and south Offaly.  The main headings of expenditure are land acquisition, construction of factories and ancillary works.  A small proportion is expended on tourism projects of a capital nature such as up-grading of the Bunratty Folk Park.</P>
      <P>The grant-in-aid moneys are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to companies on the Shannon Industrial Estate.  The financial assistance relates to grants for plant and machinery, training schemes, acquisition of buildings, rent reductions, technology transfer and research and development. A substantial part of the company's running expenses relates to the administration of their small indigenous industry programme in the mid-west region where, however, grants for various programmes come from the IDA under full delegated grant giving authority to Shannon Development.  I should add here that the major proportion of administration of costs are generated by the company from own resources primarily from rent on factory space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to running expenses, it is also relevant to point out that the significant element of these arising from the company's tourism activities used to be <Col N="1034" /> met by a special grant-in-aid for which the Minister for Tourism was specifically accountable notwithstanding the fact that the amount comes within the overall limit being amended by section 3 of this Bill. Following reassignment of ministerial portfolios earlier this year, responsibility for this expenditure now belongs with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which change will I hope facilitate a more coherent and integrated approach by the Department to their role in relation to the company.</P>
    <P>Accumulated expenditure by Shannon Development under the share capital and grant-in-aid headings as at 31 May 1986 amounted to £91.6 million and £60 million respectively.  In fact the grant-in-aid limit has been reached and the company have been relying in the meantime on a combination of own resources income and bank borrowings to meet their obligations. It is therefore a matter of urgency that these limits now be increased.  It is estimated that the increases proposed will suffice until 1990. I should stress in this regard that the Bill is merely an enabling measure which increases the funds which the Dáil may annually vote for the company.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development's objectives are succinctly described in their annual report as follows: to ensure the growth of Shannon Airport in trade, passengers and services; to ensure the realisation of the potential for economic development inherent in Shannon as a location for industry; to develop and test concepts and systems which will lead to a dramatic growth of small indigenous industry in the mid-west region and west and south west Offaly, and to do so in a manner which will pioneer future national policies; within this function to conduct a standard-setting pilot programme for food processing.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate here to report on progress under these headings, particularly since the last legislation increasing the company's financial limits was passed in 1983.  First, it is encouraging to note that overall traffic in 1985 has again reached the level attained in the 1977-79 period, and has been showing a steady increase <Col N="1035" /> since 1983.  Within that trend, terminal traffic of 665,000 in 1985 was the highest figure ever recorded at Shannon and while international developments are not conducive to new records being set in 1986, the decisions of Pan American Airways and Delta Airlines to begin scheduled service into Shannon from the US in 1986 are most welcome.  The company's success, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, in attracting these airlines highlights, however, the continuing over-dependence of Shannon Airport on its west bound connections, and it is to be hoped that they can emulate this success in continuing to increase their UK and continental traffic.</P>
    <P>In relation to the development of the Shannon Industrial Estate, while it is true that employment on the zone is less than the peak figure attained in 1981, the decline has not been great and it is again encouraging to note the upward trend in employment since 1983 to its current level of 4,400.  Concomitant with this has been a continued strong growth in exports from the zone, and more importantly, a continued widening of the positive trade balance.</P>
    <P>Developments in relation to small indigenous industry are possibly most encouraging of all.  When the company undertook this role in the region in 1978 there were 3,000 people employed in some 350 small firms, of which 20 were exporting.  There are now 5,300 people employed in 700 firms of which 100 are exporting, and within that overall increase of some 75 per cent there has been an increase of 190 per cent in employment in firms assisted by the company. A very positive aspect of this part of the company's operations is of course the virtually uninterrupted growth of employment in this sector, which is of course vitally important to the future economic wellbeing of this country.  It was the obvious success of this programme that led to the nationwide regionalisation of the IDA's small industry programme.  This was completed in 1985 and means that the administration of the programme, including decisionmaking <Col N="1036" /> on grant applications, now rests with the regional small industry boards supported by 130 IDA staff at regional level.</P>
    <P>Apart from the intensive promotion of small indigenous industry, which is the most significant example of SFADCo work being adopted nationally, other examples of initiatives which have led to the growth of this sector in the mid-west being adopted on a national basis are the workspace concept, the matchmaker programme, now nationally embodied in the linkage programme, and start your own business courses.</P>
    <P>While these initiatives relate specifically to the small indigenous industry role it is interesting in passing to note some of the other important developments pioneered by SFADCo since they have been set up.  These include the development of mediaeval banquets, Rent an Irish Cottage, development of Ireland's first new town, establishment of the innovation and micro-electronics application centres and the world's first duty free airport industrial estate.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the company also have the role, assigned to them in the White Paper on Industrial Policy, of conducting a standard-setting pilot programme in food processing.  Already a detailed report on progress to date has been submitted by the company to the Department of Industry and Commerce and consideration is being given to how this progress can be accelerated.  Work so far has concentrated on promotion of the food processing business, identification of new products and development of food enterprises and food buildings.  An example of this is the experimental food kitchen in Raheen, Limerick which, in conjunction with the IIRS, will ensure that first-rate technical facilities will be available with units constructed to the highest food regulatory standards of prospective markets.</P>
    <P>Also of relevance in this context is the appointment of a Minister of State for Food based jointly in the Departments of Agriculture and Industry and Commerce, followed by the establishment of a permanent food committee <Col N="1037" /> which has, <i>inter alia,</i> the mandate of assessing the feasibility of the recommendations in the various recent reports and studies on the food industry.</P>
    <P>A major development affecting SFADCo since passage of the 1983 legislation has been the publication of the Industrial Policy White Paper already referred to.  As the major provisions of this were incorporated in the Industrial Development Act, 1986, Senators will be aware of the detailed changes being made therein.  Suffice it to say in this context that Shannon Development will be implementing the new policy directions in their industrial development work relating to greater selectivity in industrial incentives, a shift from fixed asset investment to technology acquisition, marketing and research and development, and a greater concentration on internationally traded manufacturing and service activities.</P>
    <P>The Dáil's Public Expenditure Committee report on Shannon Development was both timely and informative in the context of our current deliberations.  This will, of course, be the subject of detailed debate in the Dáil, and its specific recommendations on various aspects of the company's operations will require careful scrutiny.  It is, however, relevant at this stage to note the conclusion that the company have been highly successful at their appointed tasks of promoting traffic through the airport and encouraging small industry throughout the mid-west region.  Indeed, the value of the company's work has also been acknowledged in most positive terms in the OECD's report &ldquo;Innovation in Irish Industry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In this brief review of the activities of Shannon Development I have demonstrated that the company are doing everything within their power to successfully carry out their multi-role mandate.  The moneys provided for in this Bill will enable them to continue to do so for the next three to four years and deserves our support.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the <Col N="1038" /> Bill.  The mid-west seems to have dominated the Seanad with the Harbours Bill, the preinspection facility for Shannon and now this excellent legislation on SFADCo.  People who have reservations about SFADCo and whether it should continue playing the tremendous role it is playing not only in the region but for the benefit of the nation as a whole, should spell out what they mean when they express them.  SFADCo is a success story and must be recognised as such.</P>
      <P>I should like to put on record my thanks and good wishes to Paul Quigley who has retired.  He was a little different from other people who held posts similar to his and, indeed, from people who held posts of lesser importance than his.  Paul Quigley had time and respect for politicians of all parties, which is a little unusual in people who hold these posts.  He had the same kind of commitment as we, in all parties, have.  SFADCo does not belong to anyone; it belongs to the nation.  He did a tremendous job while he was there.</P>
      <P>I wish his successor, Mr. Dunne, the best of luck in his job which is now perhaps a little easier than it was in Paul Quigley's time which were the pioneering years.  This, however, does not lessen Mr. Dunne's task in continuing to maintain the success of SFADCo.</P>
      <P>Shannonside must also be recognised for its success story after 21 years and for the part it has played in the region.  I hope my information that Shannon is to have a larger fuel terminal is right.  I understand this is to cost a cool million.  This would ensure the continuation of Atlantic traffic through Shannon.  I ask for the support of the Government in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>I welcome the speech made by the Minister of State this morning.  I wondered why Deputy Noonan wanted the Department of Industry and Commerce. I congratulated him on his appointment. I had a fair idea that SFADCo would form part of his portfolio and I now see that I was right.  However, I am sure the Minister will be very broad-minded about it, as we were in other days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State stated that when the company undertook their role in the region in 1978 there were 3,000 people <Col N="1039" /> employed in the region in 350 small firms of which 20 were exporting.  There are now 5,300 people employed in 700 firms of which 100 are exporting.  There has been an increase in employment of 190 per cent in firms assisted by the company. That is fact and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Later in his speech the Minister of State referred to SFADCo in national terms.  SFADCo was never intended to be a development just confined to Limerick or Clare.  People who were involved in SFADCo from the beginning never saw it as a one-role venture.  I am glad that the Minister is in agreement with me when he speaks of SFADCo as being a national body and not just concerned with a few roles in the west.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the success of the small industries which SFADCo have taken up in recent years.  I should like to mention John Costelloe and Kevin Vaughan who are development officers and all their counterparts in other areas.  This was a new task which was given to them and already the results have been tremendous.</P>
    <P>With regard to the factory building programme we are told that the company completed a total of ten small industry factory units with a total area of 2,700m² in the region.  Will the Minister give a breakdown of those ten units and say where they were completed?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to something that was said by the Minister which is rather interesting after yesterday's debate on the Harbours Bill.  I would like some information on it because we are talking about the west Clare coastline.  The Shannon Development Annual Report, 1985 states:</P>
    <P>Mariculture is a sector showing considerable development potential, with the resources inherent in the long coastline of County Clare and the waters of the Shannon Estuary.  With the Mid-West Regional Development Organisation the Company initiated a &ldquo;Mariculture Research Group&rdquo; to identify potential mariculture sites on <Col N="1040" /> the regions seaboard.  Membership of the Committee is drawn from the company and other agencies, including the Mid-West Regional Development Organisation, Local Authorities, Limerick Harbour Commissioners, the Industrial Development Authority, An Foras Forbartha, Department of Fisheries and Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>During the year, the Committee completed evaluation of mariculture potential in 10 Shannon estuary sites. A set of proposals have been prepared based on that evaluation.  Similar studies of the West Clare coastline were under way at year end.</P>
    <P>This has a bearing on a Bill we discussed in the House yesterday.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that we now have SPS International Ltd., Lana Knit, Boart Hardmetals and de Beers Industrial Diamond Division Limited.  They all marked 25 years.  I congratulate them and put it on the record of the House that there are companies which have made it well.  I cannot resist saying this.  I did not play a major role but my husband, Derry, did, in the early days of these companies. It is like the story which goes something like this: you should remember the people you meet on the way up because you might need them on the way down or something to that effect.  They had celebrations recently commemorating the 25th anniversary of their being in Shannon.  They decided for some unknown reason &mdash; not that it worries me because my attitude to socials and functions is well-known &mdash; to ignore Senator Honan.  I do not mind.  We were there when they needed us.  We were there to start them.  The fact that they are an absolute success and providing employment is sufficient for me.  When I heard about it, there was amazement that I was not there.  There are new people on the political scene around now and they probably took my place at that function but they will not take my place in other areas.</P>
    <P>I should like also to make reference to the success of the company, Guinness <Col N="1041" /> Peat Aviation.  I cannot let this Bill go through this morning without paying a special tribute, from the top man down, to Guinness Peat Aviation.  I do not think the major role that company has played is sufficiently publicised and its success story in conjunction with Aer Rianta.  It is most important that I should not leave Aer Rianta out of this debate but I must put on record the marvellous success of Guinness Peat Aviation.</P>
    <P>Traffic through Shannon has been tremendous. The Minister stated this in his opening address.  Earlier this week I put on the record of the House the commitment of people, who give more time than they need to their jobs.  Again, I shall name Liam Skelly and Michael Guerin. I have done this already.  I feel strongly about the tremendous role Mr. Skelly has played in the upper part of Shannon, the traffic end of it.  We could do with more Liam Skellys in the Ireland of today.</P>
    <P>I should not like to let this Bill pass without making reference to Aeroflot and congratulating them for the contribution they are making to Shannon Airport and through traffic.  It would be good to put on record the marvellous year the shops and the catering services had last year.  It is a condition of all transatlantic schedule services that flights in both directions must stop at Shannon Airport. I can never let a Bill involving airports pass without putting on record the importance, no matter who might be in Government or no matter what some air companies or their senior personnel might think at times, of continuing to have the commitment to stop at Shannon coming in and going out.  I have said before and I will say it again if there were not this total commitment by all parties to Shannon, with rules laid down that traffic must stop at this transatlantic gateway, there might be a change in thinking.</P>
    <P>The position regarding transatlantic traffic through Shannon Airport is worthy of special mention.  Unlike Dublin and Cork, where Aer Rianta have major roles, at Shannon the task has, historically, been shared by Aer Rianta and SFADCo.  That has been a success.  I <Col N="1042" /> would hope that it would be in nobody's mind to change it.</P>
    <P>Again, I would make reference to the small industries package and the small industries which have been mooted and supported by Shannon development. This has been a tremendous success.  It has helped people who would not have gone into industry in other times because there was an impression here at one time that industry was only for very big units. Now we have a whole new way of thinking. I always felt strongly &mdash; as far back as 25 years ago &mdash; and I never had any doubts &mdash; Senator Ferris knows what I am talking about &mdash; that if we had encouraged our young entrepreneurs of 20 years ago and given them the finance and the backing we gave to other groups from other nations, we would have more successful big factories, Irish owned, Irish managed and they would have to take the rough times with the smooth.</P>
    <P>If past Governments made a mistake, it was that the IDA and all the bodies of that time were not prepared to listen to or to recognise that young Irishmen had it in them to be successful industrialists and that their commitment was total and absolute.  They did not have to have parent companies outside while the company here with big grants from the Irish Government was only a subsidiary of the parent company.  It is rather interesting that it is the other way around now.  The particular company I speak about are now the parent company to a company in Europe.  We made a mistake away back.  The one I am talking about had to be driven home and it took some convincing at that time.  It was a pity that there was not more encouragement for persons like that.  We would have more big Irish owned companies in this nation today with good salaries and rearing great families in other constituencies.  SFADCo was not in the area I am speaking about.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his continued support of Shannon and SFADCo and his recognition of it being a national body rather than a body belonging to three or four counties.  I wish success to the man who replaced Paul Quigley.  I am glad that Father Harry Bohan was put on the <Col N="1043" /> new board because, again, he was probably before his time and he has been proved successful in the role he has played.  That has been recognised by all of us.</P>
    <P>I must again pay tribute to Clare County Council and, again, to our former County Manager, Joe Boland, who like Paul Quigley, has retired.  The role of the County Council was a major one.  They are more or less out of it now as far as I know.  It would be important that I would put on record in this House my thanks to the county council for the tremendous role they played in the early days and right up to recently.  I thank the Minister for his financial support for Shannon and for SFADCo.  I thank the Cathaoirleach. I totally support the Bill.  I am in a new capacity today as acting leader and I understand the Minister would like all Stages of the Bill passed.  I am happy about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a help. The Committee Stage is non-contentious and simple and in view of the fact that we have reached the limit of finances under one of the sections, it would be desirable if we could get the Bill through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Honan on concluding the Bill and I can reassure the Minister that there will be little difficulty getting all Stages of this very welcome measure through this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years have passed since we discussed a similar measure in relation to Shannon.  On that occasion it was also a measure, indeed, the purpose of which was to extend the limit of the financial resources available to the development company in Shannon.  Basically, it is three years since we had an opportunity of reviewing the progress of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  It is not necessary to delay at any length in reviewing the events of the past three <Col N="1044" /> years where that development organisation are concerned.  This can be summarised by saying that in the past three years we have witnessed a continuation of the success and development that company have been noted for since their inception. It is in that sense that I join with my colleague Senator Honan in welcoming the Bill and welcoming it for what it contains.</P>
    <P>I also welcome it because it represents a continuation of Government belief and support for the development company for Shannon and the mid-west.  It is an endorsement of the achievements of SFADCo and a recognition of the vital role that development company have in the future of industrial development, not merely in Shannon and the mid-west, but also outside that area.  The previous speaker mentioned the capacity of SFADCo to initiate and develop new ideas and new projects which are capable of being transplanted or copied throughout the country.  In some cases even beyond our shores that is recognised. This Bill is an endorsement of the role of that company.  I welcome it for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill, as the Minister stated, is to increase the financial resources available to the development company, to raise the share holding the Minister for Finance may hold in the company by £10 million and to increase the aggregate amount of grants by a total of £45 million, from the present level of £60 million to £105 million.  The Minister pointed out that the grant-in-aid is used for the running costs of the development company.  There is almost a doubling of the £60 million limit.  Credit must be given to the company for containing their operating cost on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  This compares very favourably with some other operations in the country in this regard.  The fact that the Minister is prepared to come in this morning and virtually double the limits of the grant-in-aid, is, again, an indication of confidence, and rightly placed confidence, in the capacity of SFADCo to meet the ambitious targets they have set for themselves for the next few years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> I join with Senator Honan in paying a tribute to Paul Quigley who has retired from his position as Chief Executive of Shannon Development and to extend a very warm welcome to his successor, Mr. Tom Dunne.  The good work of Paul Quigley will be effectively continued by Tom Dunne, whose performance in the past number of years as the chief of the small industries development programme has been outstanding.  Mr. Dunne showed ample evidence of his capacity and suitability to continue the good work of his predecessor and, indeed, to develop even further the ambitious targets set by the company for the coming years.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer very briefly to the annual report of Shannon Development.  I am not totally sure of this but, so far as I am aware, this is the first annual report for 1985 of any State body, at least it is the first I have received.  I am open to contradiction but, to the best of my knowledge, that is so.  This is a welcome development.  It is something I hope other semi-State bodies, who seem to have difficulty in producing their annual reports within a reasonable period of the end of the financial year involved will copy.  It is just another indication of the efficiency of Shannon Development that we can have this document within a few months of the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>There are a few sentences of the chairman's report on page 2 that summarise what Shannon Development are all about.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The role of Shannon Development is to integrate its diverse responsibilities in air traffic, multinational manufacturing and service industry promotion, small industry promotion and development &mdash; into the major change agent for innovation, economic and employment growth.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>It is also our strategy to be vigorous in taking the appropriate risks, in setting up such activities as the Innovation <Col N="1046" /> Centre, the Food Centre, tourist promotion and amenities, as catalysts to get enterprise started.</P>
    <P>That is the sentence which has had a bearing on the success of Shannon and that is the willingness to take the calculated risk.  The most successful examples of projects that Shannon Development have initiated over the years I have been involved, carried a high risk factor in their early days.  It was indicative of the courage, and maybe to some degree the ability of the promoters of the development company, that the risk involved did not scare them off.</P>
    <P>It must be always recognised that the risk taking is something that is not looked on very favourably in too many quarters in the State.  Of course, risk taking is risk taking and there is always the chance that there will be failure.  If the number of failures can be minimised in relation to the number of successes, it is only by that type of risk taking that we can successfully overcome many of the problems that face our country, particularly the matter of creating the number of jobs and employment opportunities that we require.  I believe it is that capacity and that willingness on the part of the Shannon Development Company to take risks and, luckily, the great majority of their risks have proved successful.  If they had not been willing to take these risks over the years, there would be no need for the Minister to be here this morning increasing their limits.  They would be just floating away down there as the same self-contained little unit doing no more than perpetuating their own existence.</P>
    <P>They never were prepared to settle for that sort of role.  They always saw their position and their duty as achieving what they have achieved and, therefore, I compliment them on their willingness to take risks particularly the risks in which they have been so successful.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about Paul Quigley and his contribution.  We have welcomed Tom Dunne.  I should like to link in to the welcome to Tom Dunne the men who will be operating immediately under him on their promotion and on the extension <Col N="1047" /> of the duties they will be performing there.  I refer to Willie Moloney and to Tom Kelvin.  Also I have to acknowledge the contribution that John Costello, the local agent in my local town, has made to the success of the small industry programme in County Clare.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the people who lead the Shannon Development Company and wishing them well in the future there and every success one cannot overlook the fact that the originator of the Shannon Development Company, the great pioneer, the man who was responsible for so many successful ideas down there, and whose brainchild so many of them were, retired from the board since we spoke last in relation to Shannon.  That is Dr. Brendan O'Regan.  I do not have to tell the House the contribution his commitment, his intellect and his enterprise meant not alone to Shannon Development Company but to the region.  On behalf of all of us I want sincerely to thank him, to put on the record how grateful everybody is, to acknowledge the high esteem in which Brendan O'Regan is held &mdash; and I am sure will always be held in by the people of the mid-west region.  It is interesting to note that his withdrawal from his involvement in the Shannon area does not represent for him a retirement into private life as is the accepted thing.  No, capable of the commitment and the energy he has shown over the years, he is now devoting his time to the promotion of peace and understanding between both parts of this divided island.  I wish him even better success in his new role than he achieved in the mid-west during his active involvement there.  There are one or two other aspects of the report I want to comment on.  The report has been available since shortly after the completion of the financial year.  On page 3 of that report there is briefly set out progress, development and growth under virtually every single heading whether it is in relation to traffic development, projects, actual jobs created and the level of exports from the duty free zone in Shannon or on the other hand, in relation to small indigenous <Col N="1048" /> industry where more projects have got underway, more jobs have been approved, more jobs have been created and extra space completed, built and occupied.</P>
    <P>Targets are also set out for 1986 in relation to total traffic development and the arrival of Pan-Am and Delta Airlines, plus preinspection, will be decided advantages in helping to achieve these targets and even surpass them.  The report shows jobs created and job potential of the Shannon Free Zone and of small indigenous industry.  The programme target is 1,200 jobs for the coming year.  The target for jobs potential is almost 3,000.</P>
    <P>There are only one or two other short matters that I want to refer to in relation to what is contained in the report.  On page 8 there is a graph layout that illustrates the steady growth of employment in the small indigenous industry programme between December 1977 and December 1985.  On page 13 there is a most interesting graph which shows the continuous and steady growth in exports both in volume terms and in value terms from the industrial zone over the ten year period.</P>
    <P>There is also on page 16 a graph that illustrates very clearly and graphically the continuous growth in tourism attendances at the castle banquets and the centres in the area.</P>
    <P>Under all headings of its responsibility whether it is the Shannon Free Zone, whether it is in the town development of Shannon up until very recently, whether it is in tourism promotion or in traffic promotion through the airport, Shannon Development have more than fulfilled the role that has been given to them. As I say, it is an encouraging report.  I mentioned that air traffic increased during 1985.  I referred to the fact that Delta Airlines and Pan-America, plus preinspections are factors that will help in the development of the airport itself. The additional funds that the Minister is proposing to make available in this measure will enable the company to continue with certainty its ambitious programme of job creation and to <Col N="1049" /> succeed in the many fields over which it has responsibility.  I welcome the measure. I fully support it and reassure the Minister he can have all Stages before lunchtime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to welcome this Bill which is to provide for the financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited.  I spoke previously when we had a similar Bill.  It is not too long ago.  My comment on the increase from £120 million to £130 million in the aggregate amount which the Minister may subscribe in taking up shares in the company is that I am wondering if the increase is adequate.  The Bill offers the House an opportunity to comment on the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited and on activities in the mid-west region.</P>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, Senator Honan and Senator Howard, I would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing general manager, Paul Quigley, a man of ability and integrity who played a major role in the overall development of the mid-west region at a time of rapid change in industrial development internationally.  Within his term of office he brought about a dismantling of the protectionism which existed to almost total free trading in a time of crisis and recession.  The best tribute one can pay to him is evident in the now thriving development company and industry throughout the mid-west region.  Many of the difficulties experienced by other parts of the country during times of recession, depression, oil threats and so on have been minimised by the efforts of the development company in the mid-west region &mdash; the region embracing Clare, Limerick, North Tipperary and now parts of Offaly.  That is a tribute to the company, the dedication and commitment of their personnel, and especially to the man who has recently retired, Paul Quigley, the former general manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Honan and Senator Howard I would also like to congratulate Mr. Tom Dunne on his appointment as general manager of the company.  He has vast experience in the company; he is a <Col N="1050" /> man of ability.  He is a dynamic executive with wide experience in industrial development and has been involved in the company for quite a while.  He would be aware of difficulties in attracting industry to the region.  He fully understands the enormous problems of the region and also the opportunities obtaining there.  I have no doubt that under his leadership the company will go from strength to strength.  I wish him well and I am sure the House wish him well in his new post and wish all the personnel in the company well in their endeavours to keep the company going as successfully as has been the case up to now.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the company have experienced outstanding success in a number of areas.  I am doubtful if the provisions of the Bill will adequately meet the changing circumstances of industry at present.  As I mentioned at the outset, it is only two-and-a-half years since similar legislation was before this House.  It would be more appropriate for the Minister to introduce legislation covering a period of say, five years, in order to enable the company to develop in a planned and proper way.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are not adequate.  The amounts provided are not adequate to meet the challenges facing the region in future years.  I do not think it is desirable that we should have to come back to this House every consecutive year seeking authority to increase the amounts payable by the Exchequer to companies like this.  This is bad for the semi-State agencies and for the Houses of the Oireachtas. If we are to give them the necessary support to undertake the work needed to be done in the mid-west region they must be able to plan much further ahead than, say, one, two or three years. They should be in a position to plan at least five years ahead.</P>
    <P>The development company recognise the difficulties that exist in attracting industry to the remote rural areas where there is a lack of infrastructure, telecommunications and so on.  The telecommunications system in the part where I live which is part of the region of south west Limerick is completely inadequate. <Col N="1051" /> We are still not automatic.  I read a report from Limerick County Council four or five years ago, saying that that region would be automatic in 1983.  At the end of 1986 we are still not automatic and I know of businesses that were trying to get automatic telephones.  They were losing business because of the operator telephone system.  They found it very difficult to get automatic service although prepared to pay for it.</P>
    <P>This is a hindrance, and definitely an obstacle to attracting industries to the rural area which is one of the principles of the small indigenous industrial programme.  Definitely, we have to exploit our resources in all those areas. Now that Golden Vale have their rationalised programme, there are I think in every parish buildings suitable for small industries that could be set up and provide employment in rural parishes.  The local community is depopulated: people have had to go to built up areas and the SFADCo idea is to provide as much industry in small parishes as possible.</P>
    <P>We will have to exploit our other natural resources in coastal areas.  That is the only way in which jobs will be provided which in turn will mean extra revenue for the State and the immediate community. It would help to ensure that parish identity today will be maintained.  The fish industry will have to be developed.  It could definitely cut down the importation of fish and that is something we must do ourselves.  It is insane to allow the Norwegians, Dutch, Danes and Spanish to come in and do what we can do for ourselves.  I support the development company and the youth employment agency in their efforts to encourage local enterprise to become involved in the training of local people and to use local resources.  The new projects are mentioned in page 10 of the report.</P>
    <P>During the year the company launched an agri-business pilot programme to develop a series of integrated agri-business projects in the mid-west.  The successful ventures will be commercialised into independent enterprises.  To promote <Col N="1052" /> this programme, a mid-west resource committee have been established. The committee will include representatives of the following agencies: ACOT, the Council for the Development of Agriculture, An Foras Talúntais, the Department of Forestry, Macra na Feirme, Córas Tráchtála, Thomond College of Education.  Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers and the IFA.  These bodies are definitely making great contributions towards this programme and I am sure they will ensure its success.  The projects established as part of this programme include deer, geese and pheasant.  I know young farmers in my own immediate vicinity who have availed of this programme and have such projects in operation.  This is something I would like to congratulate SFADCo for initiating.  I am sure with the committee set up to monitor it, it will be a success.</P>
    <P>You have no hope of attracting any industrial project to this area without involving enormous costs to the State.  A number of projects could be organised along the Shannon Estuary and to date this has not been done.  That reminds me: I was looking at a map there that Senator Howard referred to, figure 1, the location of projects approved for 1985.  We will probably come to it later this morning. The Shannon Estuary has been debated on many occasions but it remains undeveloped. Yesterday we discussed the Harbours Bill which deals with the Shannon Estuary.  That Bill is totally inadequate and is not expected to be of much benefit as regards developing the Shannon Estuary.  That is why we must look to SFADCo to get involved in the promotion and development of suitable sites for all types of industries.  Potential definitely exists along the estuary.  I also note from the 1985 report &mdash; Senators Honan and Howard referred to it &mdash; that the company built ten small factory units in that year.  It is interesting to note that 86 per cent of the factory buildings that have been allocated are occupied.  A small number of units are available for occupation by new industrialists.  That is desirable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> I would like to urge the Government and the development company to continue to build advance factories.  It is generally recognised that the international recession is lifting and there are encouraging signs that an upturn is about to take place.  It is desirable that we should have sufficient factory space to avail of any upturn in the economy.  There is an urgent need to develop small industries to link up with bigger concerns.  In the 1985 report the development company indicated that more than £3 million worth of business was generated by import substitutions in 28 small concerns. These companies manufacture small components which are for local industries. When the GAC company based in Shannon closed more than 200 people were made redundant.  We saw the impact that the closure of a small company can have in an area.  It was very depressing and I am asking the Minister to make some effort to get that bus building plant re-opened.  We are all aware, as I am sure the Minister is, of the need for school, rural and city buses.  This year we will be importing about 25 buses which could have been built at Shannon if there had been any initiative by the Government. This inaction is tragic and I hope that at this late stage they will salvage something of the bus company.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the Burlington textile factory based near Limerick which closed down a number of years ago.  Hundreds of highly-skilled people were let go and there has been no effort to re-open the plant.  We know that because of its nature the textile industry has been receiving EC aid in Britain and Northern Ireland.  Why can we not get it for our industries here, such as Burlington, instead of allowing them to close down?  We have heard the story before that because of their policy on textiles the EC have not been grant-aiding companies in that business: we are told that there is over capacity in the industry. Why are we different from Britain?  I hope the Minister will tell us what effort is being made to get the Burlington plant in Clonlara near Limerick city re-opened. It is also interesting to look at the report <Col N="1054" /> for 1985 which became available recently and to see that the bulk of activities in expenditure of the company seem to relate to development of small indigenous industries.  In the last eight years &mdash; Senator Howard also referred to this &mdash; there seems to have been great progress made in that area.  The company have been very successful in what they have done.  They have benefited the mid-west region considerably and have been beneficial for the country as a whole because much of the development in respect of small industry that has taken place would not have occurred but for the steps taken in 1978.  At the time &mdash; and I remember speaking on this Bill &mdash; there were reservations as to whether this scheme would be successful.  Thank God that is past tense and the scheme is successful in benefiting the area, its youth and the industrialisation of the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the small indigenous programme and the locations of projects approved in 1985.  The locations are concentrated around Limerick city, east Clare and well scattered in north Tipperary and Offaly.  There is one area which seems to be rather blank.  That is my own area in south-west Limerick around Drumcollogher and Bruree, Ballingarry and Kilmallock, my own parish. As I mentioned already Golden Vale are closing down creameries in these parishes.  There are buildings there that would be very suitable for industrial factories. There is no employment in my parish whereas 20 years ago about 20 were employed in the local creamery; now there is nobody.  The rural areas should definitely get attention from the sector.  West Clare and places along the Shannon Estuary also need attention; I think there is great potential in that area.</P>
    <P>There is an excellent timber plant in Kilrush which was closed down recently because of Government inactivity in providing the necessary raw materials for wood processing.  A number of meetings were held.  I understand a representative of the Department visited the area and discussed it with local people but the workers are still redundant and they have <Col N="1055" /> joined the dole queue.  That was a successful small business and it was the duty of the Government to see that it was provided with the raw materials.  It was a factory run by Woodfab and I think Woodfab are getting into difficulties in other areas because of the lack of sufficient supply of raw materials.  This is something I spoke of recently in a Private Members Motion.  The Government will have to tackle the provision of raw materials for wood processing factories.</P>
    <P>Scarriff was in trouble some years ago but it is now open thanks to a Spanish firm of wood processors who came in to develop our timber resources which we could not do ourselves.  The Government seem to have allowed the Spanish to exploit our fisheries and now they are exploiting our timber resources &mdash; but to good effect; it is good that the industry is there and giving employment but it is something that we should be doing ourselves and we should recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the report and I will co-operate with the Minister in ensuring that the Bill will be passed today.  I would like to compliment the development company for the work they are doing.  I would also like to congratulate Father Harry Bohan on his appointment to the board.  He has proved most successful in his rural housing and other schemes.  To our disappointment a couple of weeks ago he trained the Clare team to beat Limerick.  How he will do with Senator Ferris's county I am not too sure.  He will be a great acquisition and will make a great contribution to the board.  The board should be encouraged to continue with the work and to press ahead with the development of our natural resources.  I welcome the attention they are giving to the agri-business and to food products and to the mariculture area generally. That must be encouraged if we are to succeed.  We must start with our own natural resources and every resource we have should be explored to ensure that the area will benefit and get employment. We wish to give every encouragement to the developing company to press ahead with the overall development of the mid-west <Col N="1056" /> region.  The mid-west region, as mentioned during the debate on the Harbours Bill yesterday, reminds me of something I mentioned on the previous occasion when the SFADCo area was being enlarged to include part of Offaly with Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary. Geographically there is room also for the inclusion of north Kerry.  North Kerry is included in the Harbours Bill which deals with the development of the port and the Shannon Estuary.  North Kerry is apart from Clare and in line with the west Limerick boundary and parts of the Shannon in Clare and geographcally I cannot see any problem in including north Kerry with the mid-west region and allowing it to avail of the grants that SFADCo are providing.  We need more expansion in tourism and in this respect it is encouraging to see in the report the increased number of tourists at the banquets and tourist amenities.</P>
    <P>There is need for more advance factories to be built so that there will be a progressive development of the region in the next few years under the development company.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will be a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As my colleagues in the mid-west are Munster people like myself I think that Senator Kiely will agree that they have done better than we have in Tipperary both in industry and in the GAA field.  I do not want to pre-empt the decision in next Sunday's match.  We might improve in that line.</P>
      <P>We do look upon SFADCo with a certain amount of envy particularly in west Tipperary where we are so closely associated with the development they have. The closest development to my area is Oola although that is not included in the figure 1, Location of Projects Approved for 1985, on page 7 of the Report.  Oola is literally two miles from my own county boundary and from the west Tipperary section of the constituency that I represent. Senator Kiely's area is very closely linked with us through SFADCo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an increasing desire expressed by industrial developers in my <Col N="1057" /> part of the county to be linked with SFADCo simply because they have looked upon the success of SFADCo in the past and the dynamic role the company have played in assimilating projects, in taking the risks but, more important, acting as catalysts for industrial entrepreneurs in development.  This is a technical Bill or a Bill that allows the Minister certain financial limits in accordance with the rules of the House.  It is only a piece of legislation that enables him to assist the company to continue to progress. Although that is the content of the Bill as such it does allow us an opportunity to pass favourable comment on the work of SFADCo and to identify some of the areas that have been involved in the hope that other areas, and indeed the IDA through their now regionalised projects, can take an example from the good work that is being carried out by SFADCo.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the aggregate amount of grant in aid can now be increased from £60 million to £105 million. This is a significant increase in the amount of leeway available to the company to grant-aid projects which are approved.  The increased latitude for the Minister for Finance in taking up subscriptions in shares of the company from £120 million to £130 million would deal with the point Senator Kiely has raised. It is a pity that dynamic companies like this have to come back to the Oireachtas all the time for approval.  It is fair to say that they have never been stopped by this Government from doing anything or coming up with any other projects by a restriction of capital investment or the will of this Government to invest with them.  The reason for this Bill is that they have achieved the original limit that was set.  It is appropriate that limits would be set; otherwise, a semi-State company, if they had an unlimited rein could break the country.  For example, Irish Shipping, made the most extraordinary arrangements about contracts to the extent that if action was not taken by the Government, we would be tied up in a situation in which Japanese people could eventually call the tune and the State would have to <Col N="1058" /> pick up the tabs.  There has to be some day of reckoning.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that SFADCo have always presented themselves in the most forthright manner.  They have their facts and figures available to indicate that they have been successful.  I will join with my mid-west colleagues in complimenting all of those who have been involved with SFADCo, from the days of their inception down to the present in which we look upon what they are doing in their area and doing so successfully.  There have been statutory bodies involved with SFADCo, the Limerick Harbour Board, the new harbour authorities that we hope will be set up in the Shannon Estuary and the county councils of Limerick, Clare and Tipperary North Riding.  I should pay a special compliment to the local authorities that have been directly linked with them in trying to ensure the infrastructure that was necessary in the development of Shannon as a town &mdash; the excellent road network that now services the airport and the surrounding hinterland. The two county councils involved, in spite of occasional criticisms from the media, particularly the radio commentators, and their comments about the Ennis Road, have achieved a network of roads servicing the airport that are a credit to them.  I wish all county councils were as progressive as those two.  We, in south Tipperary and in the west part of south Tipperary where I live can identify immediately with that region and airport.  It is 35 to 40 minutes from us because of the excellent road network.  It is because of that that we identify with that region and direct our thoughts towards it.  We look to Waterford for ports but we look to Shannon for our airport infrastructure. Many people from the town of Tipperary commute to Shannon for work and gainful employment.  That is why we can identify so closely with SFADCo.</P>
    <P>This Government in the past in giving recognition to the mushrooming town like Shannon stressed that it was appropriate that it should have the status of at least a town commission, a statutory body elected by the people of Shannon.  I <Col N="1059" /> would hope that it would evolve eventually into an urban council situation and have more powers available to its elected representatives to take an active part in the development of the town itself and its industrial complexes.  I have visited all the factories in that area from time to time with leaders from my party.  We have always been very impressed with the level of industrial development that has taken place in and around the town of Shannon.</P>
    <P>The number of owner-occupied dwellings has increased immensely.  There were over 2,500 dwellings there in 1985. Out of that emerges an extraordinary statistic which is shown on page 17 of the Report &mdash; 59 per cent of all those houses are owner occupiers.  That is an indication of the confidence that people have in the continuing development of their area. They want to acquire property there and own it.  Shannon has matched that confidence in its people.  There has also been an air in SFADCo that they do not want to confine themselves to industrial development as the IDA do.  Of course the IDA's specific role is to stimulate industrial development.  In the past they have tended to concentrate totally on multinationals or foreigners in the development of industry.</P>
    <P>As Senator Honan said, it was a tragedy that more preference was not given in those days to Irish entrepreneurs who, with assistance, could have made a major contribution to the industrial development of their own counties.  That has happened in particular, in County Tipperary.  I am glad the IDA now give the same, if not more, preference to Irish industrialists provided they have the ideas, expertise and the capital to start up industries, particularly those which have an export content.  This of course, is one of the ways in which we can improve our eternal earnings.  I am glad that the IDA nowadays tend to give at least the same recognition to Irish people who need assistance.  In the past they assisted a lot of multinationals and will continue to do so.  They make a major <Col N="1060" /> contribution in their own way, but it is nice to see Irish people capable of doing the same.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister, in his speech, identified a project in which I have an interest, coming as I do from one of the greatest agricultural producing areas in the country, the Golden Vale, which stretches from most of the south-east down to the mid-west region and includes Counties Limerick and Clare. This project involves the production of food.  In the past we have tended to depend totally on the Common Agricultural Policy and on the intervention system of setting prices for our agricultural production.  I am delighted that SFADCo has spearheaded a pilot project to address itself to the whole process of food and how it can be processed, packaged, sold and exported.  As we produce the best and purest food in the world we have a major plus for any sales team wanting to export our food and sell it within the Community or outside it.  A great deal has been done in this regard but I am glad to say that SFADCo has been briefed by the Department of Industry and Commerce, to identify new products and develop them.  We can do that as good as the Danes or any other member of the EC.</P>
    <P>The Spaniards are also colleagues of ours now in the Community and their entrepreneurial spirit will also have to be respected and regarded.  The fact that they want to set up an industry in Ireland must be welcomed.  Likewise, the facility is available to us to set up industries in Spain if we so wish.  Now that competition is tougher I hope Irish people who have benefited from ten years of membership of the Community will attack these markets which are there for them.  We are, and have proven to be, as good as if not better than most, provided we realise the market is there and is unlimited.  We might have to adjust the system we have adopted in regard to food, that is, it must always be available and fresh.  Our system might be acceptable on the home market but when exporting we must consider processing, packaging and a pleasant presentation of our excellent food so that <Col N="1061" /> customers abroad can identify it as being Irish and consume it without there being any problems about its freshness.  That can be achieved through the new processing pilot that SFADCo have identified.</P>
    <P>Shannon is a major development, of course, and something which we must have regard to in this House.  The Government should also have regard to it.  Whatever other airports might have started in the west of Ireland &mdash; we wish them every blessing and success in the future.  Any developments in the future in that part of the country will have to have regard to the existing facilities at Shannon.  Shannon Airport is an international airport servicing the North Atlantic route and indeed many other routes to the European Community.  In wishing all other airports good luck in the future and continued prosperity, the Government's first commitment must be to the continuing success of Shannon Airport. That is recognised in the legislation and it is recognised by international airlines which are using Shannon &mdash; Aer Lingus, Aeroflot of the Soviet Union, Pan Am and Delta from America, and Ryanair, which I hope will be using Shannon as a tourist boost in the future not alone coming into the mid-west region but into the south-east region.  They are running package programmes which will fly people into Shannon and include other facilities including race meetings in Tipperary and overnight accommodation. All these will be linked with Shannon.</P>
    <P>Planning approval has been granted for a major complex in Newcastle, County Tipperary.  I compliment Eamon McGrath for his entrepreneurial spirit in developing a new owner-sharing and time-sharing complex of over 70 houses there.  This complex will have every facility and will create a tremendous demand in the local area in the service industry. Shannon will be used as the location for Americans who own property in County Tipperary to fly to every month of the year in the future.  One of the airlines will enter into a contract to fly these Americans here on a regular basis.  The people of Shannon will benefit from the spin-off effects such as car hire and so <Col N="1062" /> on.  These Americans will not just be tourists; they will have an affinity to the area, owning property in south Tipperary. I welcome that type of development. It will benefit the SFADCo area and I know they will be able to match the challenge that a development such as that will bring with it.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have not confined themselves to industrial development.  They have spearheaded tourist development in their medieval banquets at Bunratty Castle and Knappogue Castle and other archaeological gems in the mid-west region.  They have stimulated a whole concept in travel, duty-free and rent-an-Irish-cottage developments throughout the region, including Puckane in north Tipperary.  It is a tremendous concept that a regional company &mdash; which is really a limited company &mdash; can pinpoint the developments which are best suited to their own region, whether it is industry, transport, infrastructure or tourism and all the other spin-offs from it.</P>
    <P>As a result of this experience the IDA have learned a lesson.  The IDA are a national organisation with an excellent sales team selling Ireland throughout the world, but they realise that within Ireland itself more can be achieved by regionalising the decision-making progress, that in that way start ups can be stimulated and grant approvals given without having to wait for the larger board of the IDA to sit down and consider them within the required process.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan mentioned Guinness Peat Aviation and it would be remiss of me if I did not join with her in congratulating the people involved in that venture. It is probably one of the greatest success stories of modern Irish industrial development. Some of the people involved in that are from Tipperary and are party colleagues of mine.  All the people involved in the GPA industry came through the semi-State sector.  Most of them worked in Aer Lingus and it was from working in that company that they got the ideas.  They had the spirit to go ahead with the idea, to sell it themselves in the first instance, and to generate capital. They are now one of the most successful <Col N="1063" /> companies in the world.  They have shareholders in Japan and elsewhere.  This is an example of what Irish people can do. They started in the semi-State and public sectors and have gone into the private sector with tremendous success.  I am glad to have had association with the people involved in that enterprise.  They are an example of what Irish people can do with a little assistance from the State and with the incentives that can be given by way of this type of legislation which in this case will stimulate further activity in the area of the development of the mid-western region and will have a spin-off effect in my own area.</P>
    <P>There has been always an interest in Tipperary town and in Cashel because we are between two stools there, as it were. We are between the major south east region which benefits from Cahir and Clonmel down to Waterford and across to Wexford and at the west end of south Tipperary we are caught between that activity and the activity of SFADCo.  We often want to be part of what is being done in the mid-west region.  I know that the boundaries were drawn for development purposes on the existing county development organisational areas which take in particular counties.  At times this is not the right way to do it.  The normal rivers or county boundaries should at times in this type of context be overlooked. People in my area would welcome any assistance from organisations like SFADCo.  I am sure it would not be too far out of their area if they moved four miles down the road and took an active interest in the development of Tipperary town and Cashel.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister is looking for our authority, so to speak, to raise the limits.  As other speakers have said, the Minister will have the full co-operation of this House.  We did not want to let the opportunity pass without commenting favourably on SFADCo and how the company have developed and increased the number of people they employ and the number of firms they are responsible for.  In economically difficult times they have shown an overall increase <Col N="1064" /> of 190 per cent in employment within companies that have been assisted by the overall development company.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill warmly.  I congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State and the Government for their positive initiative in ensuring that SFADCo move forward and are in no way restricted or inhibited in the future.  It is encouraging to see that the Government are increasing substantially the amount of grant-in-aid to SFADCo from £60 million to £105 million.  That indicates the confidence the Government have in SFADCo.  This confidence is shared by Members of this House and by many other people as well.  The increase in share involvement by the Minister from £120 million to £130 million is a further indication of the Government's confidence in SFADCo for the future.</P>
      <P>Another point which is very salient to this legislation is that the provision made for the level of remuneration, allowances and conditions of the officers and servants of the company shall be subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for the Public Service.  That is in common with a lot of new practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have demonstrated by their positive approach towards helping SFADCo that they recognise the performance of the company over a number of years.  As other speakers said, the company's achievements have been many, their ability to raise the confidence of the people of the area has been quite dramatic and they have instilled a great measure of hope and belief among people in the region. There was a review of the position three years ago and it is appropriate that we are looking at it again today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the involvement of SFADCo in the food processing and agri-business sector which is moving forward <Col N="1065" /> at present with the recently opened plant at Raheen in County Limerick. Nevertheless, there is a great need for SFADCo or an organisation of the competence of SFADCo &mdash; and I cannot think of any more suitable organisation to handle it &mdash; to get into that area in far greater depth.  Frankly, that area of diversification of food production, processing and marketing, encompassing as it does the whole area of added value has much distance to go before the potential which exists is exploited.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I urge the Minister and SFADCo to put a greater effort into this vital area.  As is recognised by everybody, the area with which SFADCo are concerned covers quite a fertile agricultural hinterland.  They operate in an area where many agricultural goods are produced, where there is beef processing and the manufacture of dairy products.  For that reason, an even greater amount of research and performance of the work needs to be carried out.  What is happening in the present pilot project is very good.  I fully support it but I do not think it is sufficient to meet the needs of the sector quickly enough.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk in both Houses in recent years about the question of import subsitution.  This is an area we have not done enough about.  We must increase, quite significantly, the efforts in this regard whether in the SFADCo area or in any other area.  I strongly urge the Minister and those concerned to pay more attention to this area because it has a very vital spin-off potential effect in the area of employment and in helping our balance of payments.  We know that import substitution in the food sector can reduce our balance of payments position by some hundreds of millions of pounds when we include animal feed and food for humans.</P>
    <P>This raises the vital question of market research and of endeavouring to find out precisely what the consumer wants.  We have not sufficiently investigated this question.  We have tended to produce something and then market it to the best of our ability, with good marketing expertise on many occasions, but we have not <Col N="1066" /> done enough investigation into what the customer needs.  We must produce for the market place and then market it in the best way possible.  There has been a greater realisation of this yet there is some distance to go before it is fully realised.  The whole area of food development should be looked at.  There could be merit in having more food centres in parts of the SFADCo area.  For example, County Clare has a high level of agricultural production, particularly milk and its by-products.  There could be some merit in an in-depth examination being undertaken with a view to establishing such a centre in that county.</P>
    <P>I should like to be associated with the tribute paid to Paul Quigley who has retired recently from SFADCo.  I compliment him on his magnificent contribution during the past 25 years in the Shannon area.  His input has been enormous.  He has inspired people and has instilled confidence and motivation.  He did everything that needed to be done during some difficult times.  At times it was less difficult but overall his performance has been magnificent.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Tom Dunne, the new chief executive, and I wish him well in his role.  From my knowledge of the man and his expertise and competence I am satisfied he will do an outstanding job in his new position.  I am sure that new ventures and new imaginitive processes will come under the ambit of his role and that he will take on board many ventures which have not yet been envisaged.  I wish him well for many years to come in this role in the SFADCo area.</P>
    <P>There are many other people one could refer to individually but suffice it to say that there is an excellent team of people working within the SFADCo organisation. They have done a great job to ensure that people are given every encouragement and every opportunity to promote worthwhile ideas.  SFADCo have helped many small businesses and small companies in getting off the ground.  This is an area which has good potential but it needs a lot of motivation because it is hard for people to realise that the creation of two or three jobs <Col N="1067" /> will make a significant difference.  The creation of jobs in small numbers can add up to quite a lot.</P>
    <P>Obviously, SFADCo's main concern is the Shannon free airport zone.  They are concentrating also, in conjunction with the IDA, on the whole area of the small business development.  That has added enormously to the employment situation in that region but there is a great deal more potential in that regard in the time ahead.  At present, employment in the free zone area is of the order of 4,500 persons while small industry employment accounts for 5,300 jobs, involving over 700 firms.  It is significant to note that there has been a change in the number of firms from 350 in 1978 to 700 at present. There has been a change in the number of person employed, from 3,000 to the figure I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which I have raised before and while it is outside the area of grant aid as such, it is worthy of consideration. The whole service area is not eligible for any great aid whatsoever.  There should be further investigations to see if some assistance can be given in that direction.  There are a number of small service businesses operating in the Limerick, Clare, north and south Tipperary areas with which I am familiar.  They do not qualify for any grant aid.  There is merit in their being properly screened and perhaps given some assistance.  I am fully aware &mdash; I am sure the Minister may have some comments to make on this &mdash; of the present ground rules whereby if a venture is a non-creative project or business it does not qualify for grant aid. Many of these service industries are fairly borderline and perhaps a wider interpretation might be possible to take them on board for the purposes of grant aid.  I am talking about relatively small money which would make a great deal of difference to people who are trying to get a business started.</P>
    <P>There has been, as has been stated by one of my colleagues, a good deal of risk-taking involved in the whole scene of SFADCo.  That is very welcome in that <Col N="1068" /> good commercial practice is the order of the day, whereas in any State or semi-State operations it does not seem to exist at all.</P>
    <P>Another very important point I would like to mention is that in their report SFADCo have clearly talked, as was stated by some speakers here this morning, about progress development and growth in the context of an assessment of what has been achieved in these areas and, more importantly, in the context of the potential for the future in these various areas.  I support the remarks made already by the various Senators in relation to the performance generally of SFADCo in the region.  It has been an inspiration, not alone there but throughout the whole country.  It has increased the number of top level entrepreneurs operating, in many cases small business. They are doing a very good job.  If they are not giving a great deal of employment in their businesses they are indirectly contributing substantially to the development of the whole area.</P>
    <P>The stimulation of new products which I talked about in the agricultural sector, is also very important right across the board.  These various programmes must be developed a great deal more.  In my view SFADCo have done a great deal, but there are two areas that they must get involved in even more deeply.  One area is the agricultural sector.  They must realise the potential that exists here for producing the right product for the market place.  They should also see if the interpretation of service industries might be stretched a little bit to include certain very worthwhile projects.  At present the Limerick, Clare and Tipperary regions do not qualify for any grant aid whatsoever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a representative just outside the periphery of the region, I can only look on with admiration and indeed envy at times at the achievements and performance of SFADCo in the mid-west region.  The north Kerry area has far more affinity to Limerick and has far more contact with Limerick over the years, traditionally and historically than it has with Cork.  For that reason we <Col N="1069" /> have lost out enormously in north Kerry through the Cork connection.  Arguments have been made in the past for the inclusion of north Kerry in west Limerick. A former Minister, Deputy Desmond O'Malley was very favourable towards the idea.  I hope some time in the future that SFADCo will be expanded to include north Kerry.</P>
      <P>North Kerry has been neglected by the IDA regarding the setting up of small industry and the encouragement of small industry in the area.  There may be a twofold reason for this.  It could be said that the ideas are not coming from north Kerry to the IDA officials.  As the Minister probably knows, the IDA have a permanent office now in Tralee with a permanent official there.  Nevertheless, due to the fact that he has to support Cork, any suggestion that comes from the north Kerry region means that we are being directed from Cork.  As a result of this people are not inclined to come forward with ideas to the same extent as they would if our region was involved with SFADCo.</P>
      <P>Senator Hourigan mentioned the whole agri and food processing business. In north Kerry we have North Kerry CoOperative, probably the biggest food producer and processor in the country.  There is far more scope in north Kerry for other types of food processing industries, especially small industries, if this could be encouraged.  The nature of the population structure of north Kerry would lend itself to this small type industry, because we are very much made up of parishes and villages within the parishes.  It is an ideal structure almost readymade for the encouragement and development of small industry in the area.  According to the 1985 report SFADCo set up 164 small industrial projects.  The number set up in north Kerry, for example, which covers a wide region is a very small percentage of that.  There must be some reason for that.  Traditionally, north Kerry people have been entrepreneurial in spirit and creative as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the Shannon Ports Authority is coming on stream there is an additional reason for the north Kerry region to be <Col N="1070" /> governed and directed by SFADCo.  If any development is to take place in the Kerry region of the estuary, advice, financial aid and so forth will be fragmented, because if development is to take place along the west bank and our bank, SFADCo will be looking after it on one side and grant aiding and developing it, whereas our side will be directed from Cork.  That will give rise to much unnecessary duplication.  There is even a greater argument now to have north Kerry included in the SFADCo region.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the town of Abbeyfeale, which is just on the borders of Kerry and Limerick, and to look at the achievements of SFADCo there in encouraging small cluster industries etc. I feel that really supports the arguments that I have been making about the performance of the IDA in north Kerry.  In the future, while I will be involved in politics, I will certainly be making the case for the inclusion of north Kerry in SFADCo because of the reasons I have mentioned.  I feel that the sooner it is included the better for the people of north Kerry and for the future of the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased at the number of Senators who took part in the debate and who, in a constructive manner, welcomed the introduction of the Bill.  I was very impressed with their commitment to their own regions.  It is obviously a reflection of the positive impact which SFADCo have made in the region.  Indeed the support that has been given to the Bill here today is also a reflection of the wish of the House to continue to encourage and support the activities of SFADCo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the continuing funding of the company's capital expenditure in the Shannon zone and in the mid-west, and west and south-west Offaly, and for their financial assistance to companies in the Shannon zone.  When this matter was being debated on Committee Stage in the Dáil doubts were expressed that the provisions being made would <Col N="1071" /> suffice until 1990 and, indeed, the reservation was expressed that three and a half years is too short a time between Bills.  I, therefore, share Senator Howard's satisfaction that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>In relation to the first of these I can assure the House that the sums provided have been carefully calculated in consultation with Shannon Development and on the basis of the most up to date estimates of likely developments up to 1990 and that they will suffice for that period.  I reject the view that the period is too short and does not allow for planning.  That is not the case, nor is it the intended case. We are trying to allow Deputies and Senators the opportunity to review the affairs of SFADCo at fairly frequent periods. That does not in any way controvert or interfere with the long term planning philosophy of SFADCo.  It is a positive aspect of democracy that the Government allow a debate such as this today at fairly regular intervals.  It reinforces democracy as I know it.  It is a mechanism that should be welcomed by Senators.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development have in any event submitted a detailed corporate plan for the period 1985-89 to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The rolling over of that plan will coincide very closely with the period which the current legislation is intended to cover.  In addition, of course, there is the fundamental principle that a State agency should be subject to regular and frequent review by their effective owners, the Oireachtas.  As I said earlier that is being done here today and will be done at fairly regular intervals.</P>
    <P>In my opening contribution I covered most of the significant developments relating to SFADCo in recent years.  One omission was urban renewal, an activity in which the Government had a successful track record, most prominently evidenced by their work on the Granary project in Limerick city.  More recently they have tended to be less active in this area as manpower resources were directed to more pressing areas.</P>
    <P>The announcement earlier this year of the package of incentives for inner city <Col N="1072" /> development in cities, including Limerick, alters this situation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has asked Shannon Development to work with Limerick Corporation with a view to ensuring that the new incentives are exploited to the maximum benefit of the redevelopment of the city.  I am quite sure that Shannon Development will be very interested in being fully involved in that activity.</P>
    <P>All Senators have justifiably paid tribute to Paul Quigley, who has retired as chief executive and have welcomed the appointment of Mr. Tom Dunne.  The Minister has already paid tribute to both these gentlemen in the Dáil.  I would like to take the opportunity to add my best wishes to both of them.</P>
    <P>In relation to points raised in the course of the debate, I would like to refer in the first instance to Senator Honan.  While I cannot detail where individual units were built in 1985, the Senator may like to have the details I have here regarding the geographical spread of allocated and non-allocated small industry units.  It is available and with the permission of the House I will have it given to Senator Honan.  In fact, pages 36 and 37 of the annual report provide broadly similar information in terms of the 1978-85 progress and units under construction.  Perhaps I could refer the Senator to that.</P>
    <P>The potential of mariculture to create employment, a question which Senator Honan raised, in the mid-west region has not been exploited fully.  The objective of the company has been to investigate the possibility of developing and processing fish products using the natural resources, which exist, particularly in the Shannon Estuary and off the coast of Clare.  The use of Shannon Airport as a means of flying to foreign markets has also been studied.  There are, however, difficulties in developing this sector not least being the licensing regulations and the timescale involved in establishing projects.  The company's strategy has been, as the Senator knows, to involve all relevant agencies in a joint planning exercise designed to clearly identify constraints and agree to a plan of action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> I can assure Senator Honan as regards SFADCo's role in the promotion of traffic at Shannon Airport that it is not the intention of the Minister, myself or the Department to in any way dilute the role of SFADCo in this regard.  The Minister made it perfectly clear in the Dáil and I want to repeat it here in this House.  Senators could support the Minister and myself in that regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Howard's contribution I regret that I cannot guarantee that SFADCo's is the first annual report of a State-sponsored body for 1985.  Certainly Shannon Development are a model for other agencies in this regard.  They have always been quite effective and efficient in the manner in which their reports are published.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely commented on the imbalance, as he alleges, in the distribution of new small industrial projects.  I can say that while Shannon Development are conscious of difficulties in peripheral regions they would emphasise that they cannot dictate the location of projects. The start up rate in any region depends on the availability of local entrepreneurs. There is a misconception regarding the IDA and SFADCo in this regard.  I have often heard time and again at Question Time or in the course of debates &ldquo;my region is being unfairly treated, neglected, done down by this Government&rdquo;. That is not a fair or justifiable comment.  The IDA and SFADCo are there to assist industrialists, entrepreneurs and promoters.  They are not there to dictate the location of industries. It is the promoters' right to dictate where they wish to place their industries.  Of course, we have different incentives available and, by and large, they are reflective of the location of the industry. It is the promoter who has the primary right to decide where he or she would locate the enterprise.</P>
    <P>Regarding what was said by Senator Ferris and Senator Deenihan on this point, it is not proposed to extend the remit of Shannon Development at this time in terms of their geographical responsibility.  I would merely say that the company's success has been responsible <Col N="1074" /> for the regionalisation of the IDA'S small industry programme.  A further expansion of the company's remit would significantly dilute their ability to pioneer new concepts which can subsequently be adapted nationally.  The challenges facing Shannon Development are great, worthwhile. They are innovative at the frontier of research and industrial development. They are welcome but it would not be possible for me to say in this House at this time that it would be in the best interests to widen their geographical remit.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise in any event that the IDA'S regionalisation of their small industries office has just been established. It is now in place.  There is no reason to suggest that the regional offices for small industries will be less effective in promoting small industry within their own region.  We must give them every opportunity to succeed.  My personal contact with them is that they have been successful.  The plans they have laid down, which I know of, are being closely met and they should be encouraged and receive the praise of the House and given time to be seen to be effective.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan referred to the food processing industry.  I can assure the Senator that this is something that the Minister and myself are equally convinced about and we are having discussions with the company as to how their efforts in this area can be intensified.  We are satisfied that this is a major area of priority as was outlined in the White Paper.  The problem with grant assisting service industries, referred to by Senator Howard, is that they are not internationally trading.  They are the new ones that might become established.  To grant aid them would confer an unfair advantage on new operators <i>vis-á-vis</i> existing businesses. It may be a bit difficult to see how effective this will be but we are at the frontier of this activity and we will have to take time to see how effective the policy is.</P>
    <P>Senator Deenihan took up the case of Kerry.  I can only repeat, as I said earlier, that the extension of the remit of Shannon <Col N="1075" /> Free Airport Development Company Limited is not envisaged but that I have every confidence in the effectiveness of the regionalisation of the small industries programme and in the establishment of regional offices.  I am quite sure that in time these will be seen to be most effective.  I am very grateful to the Members who contributed and I hope that we can conclude the Bill soon.</P>

      <P>As it will not come up on any section &mdash; I certainly would be the last one to delay the Minister &mdash; he did not make any reference to a six marker that I asked about the larger fuel terminal cost.  It is costing £1 million and a lot of the funding of this will be by way of other agencies.  I should like to know if the Government are giving a commitment to this fuel terminal for Shannon.  We are asking here that there would be keen priced aviation fuel to protect and strengthen all traffic to and through Shannon. I understand from experts &mdash; I am far from one &mdash; that that fuel terminal is needed in Shannon.  Because I cannot take it on a section and because the Minister did not make any reference to it at all in his reply I would like to say something about it now.  I do not want to embarrass the Minister in any way.  If he wants to talk to me again some time, although I do not believe in this talking in corridors, he can do so.

      <P>I want to refer to the inadequacy of the increase.  The Minister said legislation is important and he can come in on occasions to review the situation. Senator Ferris said that SFADCo were always looked after well by this Government. They were looked after well by the previous Government also.  Does the Minister consider for long term planning that the increase is adequate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The last discussion we had in the House on SFADCo was in 1983 on a similar Bill.  It has not caused management any problems in relation to planning.  They have submitted a plan for the year 1985-1989.  There is no dichotomy between the fact that we are putting an enabling Bill in regard to capital grants, a grant-in-aid, before the House. That is on ongoing process.  It happens quite regularly in relation to the IDA and CTT &mdash; I know that first hand in my own Department &mdash; and also in relation to Fóir Teoranta.  These are merely capital limits that must be authorised.  They must be established in law and when they are reaching the ceiling a Bill goes through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is merely a mechanism to allow the Members of the Oireachtas the <Col N="1077" /> opportunity to review now and again the activities of a State body.  That does not in any way interrupt, interfere with or hinder the planning process within a company and certainly not within SFADCo. They have already established a 1985-1989 planning programme.  In regard to section 2 we are increasing from £120 million to £130 million the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares in the company.  At present he has taken up 91.6 million.  I understand that the new limit will suffice up to and through 1990. That is four years ahead of us and in 1990 it will be possible to have a new Bill, to have a review of the company's affairs. That is all that is intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kiely just referred to something I said but he took it out of context.  I recognised that there has always been a commitment of all Governments to SFADCo.  I said that this is only an enabling Bill.  No semi-State company can have a blank cheque from any Government.  I said SFADCo were never precluded by this Government from doing anything they wanted to do.  If the limits they had already set on them were close to expiration last year we would have brought a Bill in last year. It is being brought in now because we are close to the limits which were previously set in consultation with SFADCo.  The consultations we have had with them now have set these limits for another period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could happen that in two year's time there will be a sudden economic boom in that area and that they need more money. I would hope that whatever Government are in office then will have the same facility available to them to come into this House to increase the, limits.  As Senator Howard said, if we look at their report, this company have been prepared to take risks which have proved to be successful and all credit is due to them.  They have also acted as catalysts.  Because of the risks they have taken and the fact that they are catalysts, they come to us when they need money.  We have always matched that challenge in this semi-State body and in any other.  That is no political <Col N="1078" /> reflection on anybody.  That was the only comment I made.</P>

The revised statutory limit on advances from the fund will be raised from £3,500 million to £4,500 million.  This is a purely technical measure but one which is essential if the Local Loans Fund is to continue to operate.  The fund provides loans to local authorities to finance capital programmes such as housing and water supply and sewerage schemes.  I anticipate that the increased limit should be sufficient to cover advances from the fund for the next three or four years.  In 1986 for instance the fund will advance £324 million to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By far the largest proportion of the loans advanced from the Local Loans Fund is for housing, both to finance the construction of local authority houses and to fund the local authority house purchase loan scheme, or SDA loans as they are usually called.  Over 5,000 SDA loans were paid in 1985.  As I am sure Senators are aware, my colleague the Minister for the Environment has recently announced significant increases in the income and <Col N="1079" /> loan limits for the SDA scheme.  The increased limits were announced in the context of the introduction of the new funding arrangements for the Housing Finance Agency which is not financed from the Local Loans Fund but raises its own funds on the market.  In future, the SDA and HFA schemes are to be more closely aligned with local authorities assuming more direct responsibility for the administration of the HFA scheme. The income limit for ordinary SDA loans has gone up from £8,000 to £10,000 &mdash; the same as already applies to Housing Finance Agency loans.  The maximum loan has been increased by £5,000 to £21,000 in the case of ordinary loans and to £25,000 in the case of special category loans; the latter are available to tenants and tenant purchasers of local authority houses and to certain persons on waiting lists who opt to purchase private housing. No income limit applies in the case of special category loans.  The interest rate charged to SDA borrowers is 9½ per cent. The increased limits greatly improve the options open to aspiring home owners and reinforce the Government's policy to encourage private housing as far as is practicable.</P>
    <P>The Government have also made considerable progress in the provision of public housing for those who are not in a position to house themselves.  The local authority housing programme is the largest single beneficiary from the Local Loans Fund accounting for 55 per cent of expenditure from the fund in 1985.  The total number housed increased from 7,900 in 1982 to 11,750 in 1985.  A key factor in the success of the public housing programme has been the introduction of the £5,000 grant for LA tenants vacating their houses to move into the private sector.  In 1985 some 2,200 houses became available for re-letting as a result of this scheme alone and this figure should be even higher in 1986.</P>
    <P>The other major service which is financed from the Local Loans Fund is the water supply and sewerage programme on which £77 million will be spent in 1986.  The much increased level <Col N="1080" /> of investment in the sanitary services programme since 1980 has ensured that the lack of these services will not act as a constraint on development in the foreseeable future.  The fund also provides loans for other services such as the construction of fire stations, harbours, libraries, swimming pools and courthouses. Loans from the fund are repayable by local authorities on an annuity basis usually over 25-30 years.  The interest rate charged on loans from the fund, which is set by the Minister for Finance, is 9 per cent &mdash; the current Exchequer lending rate.</P>
    <P>While all loans made by the LLF must be repaid, in practice the Exchequer meets a large proportion of the loan charges, both principal and interest, on advances from the fund.  For instance, the Exchequer meets the loan charges on local authority housing in full and about 50 per cent of all loan charges for sanitary services.  The annual cost of these subsidies is carried in the Vote for the Department of the Environment.  In 1986 the amount provided for local authority housing is £179 million and £46 million for sanitary services.</P>
    <P>I have already said this Bill is a technical measure.  Increasing the statutory limit on issues from the Local Loans Fund does not affect the level of funding for individual programmes financed from the fund.  The fund is simply a financial instrument to channel capital to local authorities within the allocations for programmes agreed annually by the Government.  The statutory limit on issues from the fund has to be increased every few years as demand dictates.  The last amending Act of this kind was passed in 1983.  This legislation then is simple and straightforward in scope but essential to enable the Local Loans Fund to continue to finance local authorities.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, the purpose of which is to raise the ceiling on the amount of loans which may be issued from the Local Loans Fund to local <Col N="1081" /> authorities.  Although this Bill is presented by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance many of the matters which Senators would wish to raise relate to the Department of the Environment. This is understandable because the Local Loans Fund is the source of loan capital for local authorities.  The resources for the fund come from the Exchequer but local authorities depend on the Local Loans Fund for the finance they require for housing construction, housing loans, sanitary services and other capital projects.</P>
      <P>The last time the ceiling was adjusted was in 1983.  As far as I recall, the ceiling at that time was raised from £2,500 million to £3,500 million.  It is now proposed in this Bill to raise the ceiling to £4,500 million.  The Minister did not tell the House if the ceiling of £3,500 million has been reached but he stated that the increase now being sought is expected to be adequate for a further three to four year period.  I wonder if that means that the £1,000 million extra which is the amount by which the Minister is seeking to raise the ceiling will be the total amount available to local authorities in the next three to four years to fund capital projects.  If that is the case the £1,000 million would appear to be an inadequate amount for the period in question.  The ceiling should have been raised to £5,000 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that there has been an increased level of investment in the sanitary services programme since 1980. That may have occurred in other counties but it certainly did not occur in my county.  Roscommon County Council, which is the local authority of which I am a member, has been receiving a decreased capital allocation for sanitary services in the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State also referred to SDA loans and the recent increase to £21,000 in the maximum SDA loan available.  The income ceiling has been increased to £10,000.  I welcome these increases.  I was at a meeting of our local authority the other day at which the increase in the maximum loan was welcomed. <Col N="1082" /> However, many members felt that the income ceiling should have been increased to a figure in excess of £10,000, possibly £11,000 or £12,000.  At present the net income of people who are earning under £12,000 per annum, as a result of very high taxation, could be in the region of £6,000 or less.  Members felt that the income limit for SDA loans and Housing Finance Agency loans &mdash; which are the only sources of finance available to that category of people &mdash; should be increased to a figure in the region of £12,000.  Many people are experiencing difficulty at present through no fault of their own with regard to loan repayments.  Some are experiencing difficulties as a result of unemployment and others are depending on social welfare payments.  Some scheme should be devised to assist people experiencing such difficulties to get back on an even keel and enable them to repay arrears.</P>
    <P>The repayments on an SDA loan are fixed over the period of the loan so that the amount of the repayment a person starts off with remains the same up to the end of the repayment period.  The Minister might consider having lower repayments over the first third of the loan term than over the second third of the repayment term with an increased fixed repayment for the final third of the repayment period.  This would be of considerable assistance to people with SDA loans because the early years are the most difficult for most borrowers.  I am not saying that this is the only way in which this could be dealt with.  There are many ways in which it would be made easier for people to meet their loan repayments. This would eliminate the difficulties being experienced by many people at present.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the delay by the Department in approving loans under the local loans fund scheme.  Usually local authorities are notified in the first half of the year of their capital allocation for capital projects during the year.  The local authority then seek approval for a loan for the carrying out of the works.  Very often, there is considerable delay before approval for a loan is issued, by which time it is quite late in the year.  If we are <Col N="1083" /> speaking in terms of getting value for money, particularly in the case of works which are carried out by direct labour, it is very important to get those works underway as early as possible in the year, certainly before the summer months in the period during which the best return in terms of output and production will be obtained.  In the case of capital projects, local authorities should be notified earlier in the year and the loan approval should be issued as expeditiously as possible. Local authorities would then be in a position to get such capital programmes underway in the early part of the year, before the end of May.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a technical measure.  I hope the Minister will answer the question I raised as to whether the £3,500 million ceiling has been reached at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill dealing with the amount of funding for the local loans fund.  Those of us who are members of local authorities will avail of this opportunity to comment on the advantages of this fund.  I am a member of two local authorities, Tipperary Urban District Council and Tipperary South Riding County Council.  These authorities benefit to a large extent from the facilities this fund gives them.  They are now given at a rate which local authorities can afford.  Recently there has been an easement in the level of repayment for borrowers who benefit from SDA loans provided from this fund.  The rate was reduced from 11½ per cent to 9½ per cent, which is a welcome alignment with commercial banking rates.  It ensures that money is available to people who have shown some initiative in providing their own homes.  The Government have been innovative in the area of loans, grants, interest rates, the level of income applicable to borrowers and the amount of loans which are available.  With changing times and with increased wages an income limit of £10,000 is still fairly tight. The increase in the income limit represents a significant improvement for the category we would like to assist.  Very <Col N="1084" /> few people earning under £7,000 per year would dare borrow £20,000 whereas people earning £10,000 or more would have the courage to borrow in order to build their own house.  We should give them every incentive to do so.  I welcome the improvement and hope that the Minister and the Minister for the Environment will keep the income limit continuously under review.</P>
      <P>The increase in the amount of money available is welcome.  The maximum has risen from £18,000 to £21,000 for SDA loans and from £20,000 to £25,000 for special category loans.  The level of loans for reconstruction has been increased to £2,000 for non-secured loans and £6,500 for secured loans.  This should be reflected in the building industry.  People have facilities available to them and financial incentives from the Government which, I hope, will create a new enthusiasm in the building industry.  I look forward to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome some of the restrictions which were included in the reconstruction grants.  I look forward to the day when we will devolve the power of the inspectorate in the Department of the Environment on to the local authorities, in order to speed up the process of approval for people who want to get on with the reconstruction work they have in mind.  The local loans fund can be used to assist them.  Local authorities cannot survive without this SDA low interest money from the local loans fund.  The fact that the limit is increased to £4,500 million is an indication of the kind of activity taking place.  I understood from the Minister of State's speech that he is satisfied that this increase will take account of the expected activity under this fund but I notice that he said that in 1986 the advance to local authorities from this fund would be £324 million.  That is a reduction in the amount of money which was allocated in 1985 which was £350 million.  I would have anticipated, with the improvements which have been announced recently, that there would be an escalation in demand under this heading.  Perhaps this refers only to funds for the house building and sanitary service programmes of local <Col N="1085" /> authorities.  There are different rates of repayment depending on the heading. Perhaps it does not indicate the amount which could be demanded for house building projects.  The Minister of State might indicate if that is the case.</P>
    <P>I notice that there were 5,000 beneficiaries from SDA loans in 1985 which means either new houses were built or houses were purchased by people through this process.  Any incentive we can give, whether it is the £5,000 environmental grant, the £2,000 new house grant, the mortgage subsidy scheme or anything else we can do to encourage people to house themselves is welcome but that does not remove the social responsibility on local authorities to house, through these funds, people who are unable to meet the challenge of providing their own home.  We have, in some areas, housing lists which have not yet been fully completed.  We have made massive inroads on the housing waiting lists, particularly in the major cities and towns.  Over the past four or five years there has been a boost in the number of local authority houses which were built and standards have improved.  I welcome that and I hope the house building programme will be accelerated in areas where there is proven need.  Major projects were submitted by the local authority in South Tipperary to the Department for approval under this fund. They will help to restore parts of Tipperary town to its original form.  There are many derelict sites at the entrance to the town from Cashel.  This area would benefit if approval was given by the Government for the projects we have submitted for rebuilding the original design of Father Matthew Street in Tipperary town.  These are the kind of projects I should like to see getting off the ground.  Not only would they meet a housing need but the centre of our town and approach roads to our town would be reconstructed so as to be as they were hundreds of years ago.  I welcome any move by the Government that will bring such plans to fruition.  This Local Loans Fund is one of the vehicles that local authorities depend on almost completely <Col N="1086" /> for the vast majority of their funding for major capital projects.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with Senators Mullooly and Ferris, I welcome this Bill also.  Having been a member of a local authority for many long years, this is, perhaps, the most welcome news we have got for a number of years.</P>
      <P>The increase in the SDA loans from £15,000 to £21,000 and the raising of the income limit from £8,000 to £10,000, was overdue.  SDA loans, are very popular at the moment with many people.  They prefer to go for that one rather than the HFA loan.  A loan of £21,000 is as much as some people can repay.  Having said that, it does not go the whole way in buying or building a house.  While sites may have fallen in price for a number of reasons in the past years, even when they were being sold at £5,000, £6,000 or £7,000, there was still a great short-fall for many people who were considering building their own house.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill for several reasons, one is that it will appeal to many people. It will appeal more today than would have been the case six or 12 months ago because the interest rate has fallen from 12.5 per cent to 9½ per cent.  That means we must spell this out to people to point out the attractiveness of the SDA loan. In fact, quite recently in Louth this matter was discussed with me.  The other person was saying that the repayment on an SDA loan six months ago was something in the region of £40 per week.  Now an SDA loan of £16,000 is £30 per week. Therefore, a £21,000 loan will not cost much more than a £16,000 loan would have been costing not so long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities in the past had quite a task in providing for all the applicants who were in need of housing.  As most members of local authorities would agree, the waiting time for a local authority house, though it may vary from county to county, can be in the region of from four to six years, depending on the size of the family making the application Most people who move into large housing estates will probably have spent the first <Col N="1087" /> half of their life trying to get into them and will then spend the second half trying to get out of them.  I do not mind saying that because some of the housing estates that have been built in the past number of years leave much to be desired.  They are often referred to as cement jungles. Some have other names for them.  These schemes may have seemed all right at the time but experience has proved otherwise. However, we should learn from our sad experience of the past.  Building large numbers of houses in certain areas, created many problems.  At the moment there are many people in some of the large housing estates, some in my own county, who are very anxious to avail of the very attractive grant available to those who hand back their houses to the local authority.  A total of £10,000 in grants towards the cost of a new home is a great start.  The Minister referred to the number of people who, in the past 12 months, have availed of these grants.  We are all very pleased to see that.  It has lightened the burden on the local authorities. There is no doubt in the world about that.  In my county there was a large number of applications on hand but I note a big increase in the number anxious to avail of these SDA loans and of the other loans in order to build their own homes.</P>
    <P>Even though the loan is being increased to £21,000 and that that may be as much and more than people can repay, it is still not enough for people to build their own home in 1986.  The Government of the day have to look a little further at the moment.  I am speaking from knowledge of my own local authority who, have not at this stage, much land to provide sites for these people. This is the great stumbling block for many people who are anxious to build their own home.  The great difficulty is that any sort of decent house may cost between £21,000 to £26,000 to build and when one includes the price of a site, the total is in the region of £30,000.  The increase is a step forward and I certainly welcome it.</P>
    <P>The Government must look at the position regarding certain local authorities <Col N="1088" /> whose land bank has run out.  I am speaking in particular about my own local authority where this is a great problem.</P>
    <P>We hope this increase will encourage more people to build houses in the country. Obviously, this would create quite a bit of employment.  This goes side by side, as Senator Ferris said, with the very attractive home improvement grants which were announced some months ago. They will certainly be a great stimulus to the housing industry.  From my experience so far of the house improvement grants, they are generating a great amount of interest throughout the country. It is important for the Government and for us as members of local authorities to encourage as many people as possible to avail of these very generous grants before houses deteriorate to the extent that the decision as to whether they are worth repairing or whether the only option would be to build a new house would have to rest with an engineer.</P>
    <P>Turning briefly to the money available under the scheme for both sewerage and water schemes, I want to mention group water schemes in which I have been involved down through the years.  While welcoming the grant increase in this respect announced in the past 12 months &mdash; from £300 to £500 &mdash; it falls far short of what is necessary to promote group water schemes today.  My personal experience of group water schemes in the past 20 odd years has been that it was easier 20 years ago to organise a group water scheme than it is today though some would say we are much better off now than we were 20 years ago.  I found it was much easier to organise group water schemes then because no matter what way one routed the water and no matter how anxious people were to get water, most had their own deep wells and their own electric pumps etc.  Therefore they are always reluctant to join in these schemes, and it used to be a matter of eight houses per mile.  It is hard to get the eight houses now per mile because, as I say, most of these people have provided their own water.  While it is necessary to point out to them that, in fact, all these electric pumps can only be short term and <Col N="1089" /> have to to be replaced in a short time, they are still reluctant because it costs £500 or £600 to be a member of the scheme.</P>
    <P>For that reason again I would ask the Government to look at this matter because local authorities, in the main, are not providing today these regional schemes as they were doing a few years ago.  I am speaking about my own.  We should welcome the fact that many people take it on themselves to organise group water schemes.  Every help that can be given to these organisers should be given by the Government.  I am not particularly happy with the progress of these schemes in the past.  I am not particularly happy with the help they have got either.  Again, from experience, I found it easier some years ago to organise these and found, in fact, more help and more co-operation from the authorities then than I am getting today.  However, it is something, perhaps, for the Minister to think about.  There are those few points I wanted to mention and, again, I want to welcome the increase in the SDA loans.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris mentioned the amount of money for 1986 as compared with 1985.  I would be very interested in the reply of the Minister on that one.  In the main, I can only say that I welcome the overall picture.  It is a great boost and that with all the other grants which have come over the past 12 months I can only say that the Government are certainly facing up to their responsibility and doing an excellent job on that front.  People either building their own or repairing their own, are getting every help and encouragement and I welcome this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is, of course, to be welcomed and the announcements recently made by the Minister for the Environment are more than welcome and awaited with bated breath and, perhaps in some instances with disappointment by people who are unable to procure sufficient funds to provide themselves with a home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one area where I find that people have great difficulty.  It is probably <Col N="1090" /> that the category is so small that nobody seems to bother too much about it, that is people who are endeavouring to build a house on their own site.  There is increasing difficulty and I suppose if I were to have the figures of the number provided in my area or in the entire County Dublin area for every year since I became a member of the local authority, I would say it has decreased many times because it is more difficult to obtain finance for it, to obtain planning permission or to get the local authority to build a house on the nominee's sites.  This may not be the direct responsibility of the Minister, but I think his Department should have an interest in it because there is a section of the community who are in need of housing and very often have the site but there is an enormous amount of red tape and form filling; there is an added problem, that the Dublin County Council have difficulty in finding contractors who will build a single house.  The whole system is geared towards taking people into the populated area.  Take my own district which contains the mountain area of Bohernabreena and Ballinascorney, that general mountain area.  The system is geared to taking the people off the mountain and putting them into the enlarged village of Saggart and the new town of Tallaght, which, I think, is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>It is only in dire frustration that many of these people move out of the rural environment into the ever-expanding urban areas.  It is completely against their will and I believe that a greater effort should be made to facilitate them.  In most cases they are prepared to provide far more money than the ordinary SDA applicant who is moving into a housing estate.  However, I heartily welcome the increase from £8,000 to £10,000 of the ordinary SDA loans and the increase to £21,000 and £25,000 for the special category loans.</P>
    <P>Generally, the news has been good in the housing areas plus the fact, of course, that the local authorities are now finding it much easier to facilitate people because in Dublin County people now have a choice of house.  Those on the housing <Col N="1091" /> list, who have been allocated a local authority house, have a choice of which area they will move into or which estate.  That is a new departure in housing.  For many years, when a person was allocated a house, no matter where it was, they were only too willing to accept the house and move into it, even though at great inconvenience for schools and, perhaps, for their place of work.  This element of choice has of course brought its difficulties. As I mentioned this in the House last week, Dublin Corporation are unable to fill houses which have already been occupied and vacated by people who availed of the £5,000 grant for handing back the local authority house, then the grant of £2,000 for the first time buyer and the subsidy grant on the repayments. That has created a difficulty, particularly in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is also another difficulty.  This is a point I had intended making on the Bill and it is that the moneys provided, under this heading, are restricted to the development of the housing stock in the country and the sewerage needed to provide the housing.  There is another area where there is an enormous amount of agitation and, in some instances, it is forcing people into availing or urging them to avail of the £5,000 grant to move out of certain areas in County Dublin. Because moneys provided under this heading cannot be used for the development of the area in which many thousands of city people have been accommodated. I am speaking of the Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Lucan and Clondalkin areas where Dublin Corporation bought large tracts of land and built thousands of houses to reduce the housing list in the city.  They provided the houses but nothing else.  People were put in an entirely new environment which was foreign to them and had to travel miles for the ordinary daily shopping.  They had to travel miles, in some instances, to schools though the schools were provided rather quickly.</P>
    <P>There are no recreation areas whatsoever. I appeal to the Minister to examine this and permit the expenditure of some <Col N="1092" /> of his money on the provision of recreation areas.  For instance, in Fettercairn, Tallaght, Jobstown, Brookfield there are thousands of Dublin Corporation houses as there are in Neilstown Rawlagh on the other side of Clondalkin.  We have reserved major areas of land for parks for recreation for the people who live there.  Some of these people have been living there seven years and none of that area has been developed for recreation. Not only have the people to travel in order to draw pension or children's allowance at the post office and for ordinary shopping, but they have to travel back to the city for open space recreation.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The only thing which is holding up the provision of these parks is that the Minister has refused to permit moneys under this heading to be used for that purpose.  In one area in Tallaght Kilinardin Park has been developed.  I cannot explain the great difference that has made to the standard of living in the area, to the environment and to the contentment of the people living there.  It has made a great difference.  No words of mind can express the difference between the situation that exists now compared with that prior to the development of Kilinardin Park.</P>
    <P>I may not be correct in this but my understanding is that Dublin Corporation paid the county council for the development of Kilinardin Park.  The expenditure was in the region of £130,000 to £150,000. My understanding is that, after pressure, Dublin Corporation paid the county council this money to develop the park because they saw the social need for all the reasons I have outlined in anticipation of permission coming from the Minister's Department that this money could come out of the moneys provided under the local loans fund for housing.  I do not think that permission has yet been given despite the fact that that park has been there for the last two years.  If that permission had been given I believe further moneys would have come from Dublin Corporation, who are the main, if not the total developers in the three areas I mentioned &mdash; Fettercairn, where we have <Col N="1093" /> a large area of land reserved for park development, Jobstown Brookfield where there is a further large area and the Neilstown Rawlagh.  I have not had time to check today but if the corporation had got the permission they had sought to take that £130,000 or £150,000 from the money provided for housing, I have no doubt they would have given Dublin County Council the go ahead on the other areas.  I believe it to be a legitimate cost on the housing programme and should be considered as such.  There should not be a strict rule that the money being provided here is solely to provide housing.  That was fine when we were providing smaller numbers of houses in scattered areas. Now that there is such a concentrated development in the one area, open space park development should be considered a legitimate cost of the housing programme.  I am asking the Minister to give serious consideration to that.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I would have to congratulate the Minister and his Department on providing adequate finances.  It is a new thing for us, as politicians, to say here.  We are normally looking for more.  I am not looking for more money now.  I am only asking the Minister to permit some of this money to be directed for the development of the open spaces.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about the smaller open spaces which normally local authorities can handle through other funds.  I am talking about major open space where there are over 1,000 houses.  In some of the areas that I am talking about 3,000 to 5,000 houses have been provided.  I think £150,000 for the development of an open space where there are from 1,000 to 4,000 houses is not much to ask for considering that the input into the area can be calculated in millions.  I am asking for only a small amount to make living in those areas much nearer what it should be.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Department for making adequate funds available to meet the housing need.  Money has been coming as fast as local authorities can spend it. The local authorities, generally, have been doing a good job.  We are now at <Col N="1094" /> the stage in the Dublin area where we are cutting back on the development of houses.  Heretofore when we allocated 100, 200 or 300 houses, there were always 400 or 500 left on the housing list.  Now, when we have an allocation, we are looking for other people to apply for houses so that we can give them the houses that have been built.  It is a healthy situation. Thank God, we have got to it.  There will, of course, be those who will not accept houses in certain areas.  It is not possible to satisfy everybody.  I want to thank the Minister and the Government for the healthy situation in regard to the provision of homes for those in need of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for their comments and for the welcome they extended to this Bill.  I want to deal with some of the major points raised by the House.  I should emphasise in relation to detailed aspects of environmental policy, that that falls more within the province of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment. My function in the Department of Finance is essentially to provide with this Bill the financial instrument under which funds will be made available for the implementation of policies.  As far as my comments relate to detailed Local Government matters, I should stress that they are a personal reaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will say, beginning with Senator Mullooly, that some very interesting points were raised in the course of this debate. I will be glad to convey to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, those points which fall as a matter of policy within his office.  Senator Mullooly raised the point as to whether we have reached the ceiling under the present legislation. We have not quite reached it but it is anticipated that we would reach it later this year.  That is why we are anxious to complete this legislation.  The Senator did raise a legitimate point when he asked why not provide for that over the next three or four years, why not increase it to a much higher figure now?  One has to go back to the democratic process and decide that it is a question of balance, <Col N="1095" /> making a reasonable provision at this stage while at the same time giving an opportunity through the democratic process in these Houses for a discussion of the situation at reasonably regular intervals. This whole system goes back to a different system established in 1897 and replaced by the local loans fund system in 1935.  Governments from time to time had come back at regular intervals to the Houses.  That is appropriate.</P>
    <P>The average expenditure from the fund would be about £330 million a year. On that basis, taking into account the fact that the existing provision would be sufficient until later this year.  I would estimate that in three or four years we will be back in this House seeking a further extension.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senator Mullooly will understand if I am not aware of the details of the sanitary services situation in County Roscommon.  I understand his interest in raising the issue.  I would make a general point arising from that that from this fund loans are provided for public water supply schemes and sewerage schemes. There has been quite an amount of expenditure in recent years under these headings because of the demands of housing and industry.  At this stage about 80 per cent of the population are connected to piped water supply systems and over 64 per cent to public sewerage systems. It is obvious that very many of the major deficiencies have been eliminated over the years.  The likely projection for the years ahead is that there will not be the same pressure for expenditure in this area.  Like Senator Mullooly, I come from a rural area.  In the more remote rural areas these developments are perhaps slower to reach the periphery than in more populous areas.  More work will need to be done if not at the same pace.</P>
    <P>On the question of the income limit for SDA loans, I do think that the announcement by my colleague.  Minister John Boland, of the increase in the limit from £8,000 to £10,000 has been generally welcomed. I do understand those who suggest that there might be a case for <Col N="1096" /> increasing it further.  There is always the question of balance here.  There is an element of subsidy cost to the taxpayer involved in relation to each such loan. There has to be a balance between the needs of the people who avail of the facility as opposed to the very heavy demands on the taxpayer.  At the moment the balance appears to the Government to be in favour of increasing the figure from £8,000 to £10,000 letting in people earning up to £200 a week.  That is a figure which will have to be reviewed in time to come but it is unlikely that it will be reviewed in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>In regard to difficulty about repayment of loans, the problem is that any such suggestion does involve cost.  When we mention cost we are talking about a further burden on the taxpayer.  While I appreciate the good intentions behind the proposal, at all stages in a situation where the Government are trying to contain and reduce the burden on the taxpayer, we will have to be cognisant of any additional public expenditure which would have the opposite effect, increasing the burden on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Delays between the Department of the Environment and the local authority would be more appropriate for the Minister for the Environment.  Occasionally delays do occur because the Minister must be satisfied that the State is getting best value for the taxpayers' money.  The Department of the Environment inspectorate have to examine the overall plan prepared by local authorities for housing and sanitary services and also the detailed costings.  My understanding is that when these very necessary formalities have been completed there is no delay and certainly there is no policy of delay in regard to the approval and payment of accounts.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris raised the point about comparing the level of advances in 1986 from the local loans fund as opposed to those in 1985.  There is a reduction from the figure in 1985.  It is important to record here why there is a reduction. Senators will recall that we established the Housing Finance Agency and the £5,000 grant for local authority tenants. <Col N="1097" /> There has been a major up-take under both schemes, neither of which was financed from the local loans fund and, as a consequence, the demand on the local loans fund for housing has dropped. That is the reason for that trend.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris also raised the question of devolving certain powers to local authorities, in particular powers of inspection for housing grants.  I have to say that my own reaction is positive to that kind of suggestion.  The Government have a policy of devolution.  We now have a devolving implementation group of which I am the chairman.  That is the kind of proposal which I will arrange to have discussed within the context of that group.</P>
    <P>Senator Lennon raised a number of points in relation to group water schemes. I understand why Senator Lennon would have an interest in encouraging these schemes. We have, as he is aware, increased the financial support.  That does not take from the fact that there can be many difficulties in relation to these schemes. Some of them are located in rural areas with scattered housing where sometimes it is difficult to organise the community to be involved in the scheme.  There are a number of factors to be taken into account.  There is the general factor of the cost to the taxpayer.  From my own experience I have found that the difficulties very often are not solely related to finance.</P>
    <P>Perhaps more backing by way of professional support or otherwise at all stages to the local group could be the answer and could help in resolving these problems.  In my own area the group water scheme engineer is very busy and active and the scheme has been quite successful but I am not sure whether additional expertise, as opposed to additional finance, is not the answer to some of the problems outlined by Senator Lennon. However, this is more specifically a matter for the Minister for the Environment and I will bring these and other matters to his attention.</P>
    <P>The same comments apply in relation to the points raised by Senator McMahon.  I fully understand his anxieties <Col N="1098" /> about the lack of recreational facilities in the Tallaght area and in the other areas he highlighted.  Perhaps the Senator will understand that on such a point of detail the best response I can give is that I will bring it to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points which have been raised in this interesting debate and I am very glad that the measure which I have introduced received such a warm welcome from the House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

    <Title>British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) (Amendment) Bill, 1986: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The enactment of this short Bill will enable the Minister for Finance to provide up to £38 million to the B &amp; I Company by way of additional equity capital.  The Bill also gives the Minister for Communications certain controls in relation to the superannuation of the staff of the company, which he may exercise with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the provision of additional equity is required to enable the company to implement the restructuring proposals from the B &amp; I board which the Government decided to support with Exchequer funds.  All but £100,000 of the existing authorised share capital has already been taken up by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period 1980 to 1984 the B &amp; I incurred losses of more than £43 million which necessitated equity advances of more than £30 million to enable the company's continued operation.  In these circumstances the Minister found it necessary to take action to ensure that <Col N="1099" /> this state of affairs would not continue. In May, 1985 he appointed a new chairman and managing director to the company with the mandate:</P>
    <P>to take whatever steps are necessary, with the agreement of the Board of the B &amp; I Company and subject to the approval of the Minister and taking account of the need to maintain Irish participation in cross-channel passenger and freight services, to restore the company to profitable operation by 31 December 1986.</P>
    <P>In December last, the board submitted to the Minister its proposals to restore the company to viability.  The board's proposals included:</P>
    <P>Development of the existing co-operation arrangements with Sealink through a new two-year agreement; the B &amp; I Rosslare-Pembroke service would cease and a new joint car ferry service would operate between Rosslare and Fishguard under a new brand name using a Sealink jumbo vessel.</P>
    <P>Upgrading of on-board services through a combination of capital investment in redesign of the sales areas, introducing new skills in catering, retailing and passenger care facilities, either by way of contracting arrangements or direct recruitment.</P>
    <P>Financial restructuring of the B &amp; I involving shareholder investment of £43 million.</P>
    <P>Substantial cost efficiencies to be achieved through reduced manning levels and changes in work practices in all areas of the company's business.</P>
    <P>The Government considered the board's proposals and decided that, subject to the enactment of the enabling legislation, it would allocate a total of £38 million in equity capital to the company over the period 1986 to 1989.  While this is somewhat less than what the board requested, it nonetheless in present financial circumstances represents a very substantial level of investment.</P>
    <P>The reduction of £5 million on the <Col N="1100" /> amount requested by the board took account, <i>inter alia</i>, of the exclusion of certain proposed capital expenditures and the expectation that the number of redundancies achieved would be less than originally estimated.  Twenty million of the equity will be advanced to the company during 1986.  This significant investment of Exchequer funds is contingent on a matching contribution by the board, management and workforce of the B &amp; I towards restoring the company to viability.</P>
    <P>Senators will agree that as an island nation our access transport services, particularly between Ireland and Britain, are vital to trade, commerce and tourism and to our national economy generally.  The Government's decision to provide continuing support for the B &amp; I is an indication of its commitment to a strong Irish presence in shipping services to this country. This was the main reason why the State acquired the company in 1965.  This major investment by the Government will ensure that a significant share of cross-channel traffic will stay in Irish hands.  This underlines the Government's view that, while it welcomes external involvement in services to and from Ireland, a significant level of Irish participation operating under equitable conditions is an essential ingredient in ensuring the quality and efficiency of cross-channel services.</P>
    <P>As I previously stated, £20 million of the £38 million will be advanced this year and the balance of £18 million will be phased over the three subsequent years 1987, 1988 and 1989.  The amount and timing of the further equity injections will be closely related to the overall performance of the company against very challenging profit targets which the Minister has set for it.  These are as follows: 1987 &mdash; £0.5 million; 1988 &mdash; £1 million; 1989 &mdash; £2 million.</P>
    <P>These targets may appear small at first sight but I would remind Senators that they must be judged against the B &amp; I's losses which between 1980 and 1984 amounted to more than £43 million. <Col N="1101" /> Furthermore, in the absence of Government support and other remedial measures, the B &amp; I would have been likely to incur losses of the order of £10 million per annum.  Against that background, the profit targets are difficult but achievable. Throughout the period, the Department of Communications will monitor in detail the company's performance.</P>
    <P>The current year will be a year of transition for the company as the various elements of the restructuring plan are implemented and the company will continue to be loss-making.</P>
    <P>The future of the B &amp; I can only be assured if there is sustained commitment on the part of the company's workforce to work with management towards the common goal of creating an efficient and commercially viable enterprise.  The workforce of the company must be commended for their realistic acceptance of the fact that change was necessary for the company's survival.  The package of proposals now approved will safeguard the 1,400 jobs which the B &amp; I will continue to provide.  The board and management of the company also deserve recognition for their resolute approach to very difficult problems.</P>
    <P>Of the £20 million being provided this year, £7 million is being spent by the B &amp; I on capital investment.  The remaining £13 million is being used to begin the process of restructuring the company's balance sheet by reducing the company's borrowings.  The equity injections to be provided in the years 1987 to 1989 will also be used to reduce the company's burden of debt to an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>Most of the £7 million capital investment is being spent on the refurbishment of the company's vessels and will result in substantial improvements in the overall standard of on-board facilities.  The sales areas of the car ferries have been redesigned and now offer much greater comfort and a wide range of passenger facilities. These include a greatly enlarged duty free area, shops, restaurants, bars, a cinema and various other attractions to make crossing the Irish Sea far more enjoyable than was the case in the past. In addition to the physical improvements <Col N="1102" /> to the vessels, a comprehensive programme of staff training is being undertaken to ensure that passengers receive the highest possible level of service and attention.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I's agreement with Sealink relates to 1986 and 1987 but can be renewed if considered desirable.  The new agreement will result in a more efficient utilisation of vessels while providing a better overall service to passengers.  In the past, intense competition on the Irish sea routes has led to both companies incurring losses which in the B &amp; I's case had to be met by the Irish taxpayer.  The battle for market share led to an undesirable lowering of standards and brought about a situation where fare reductions were the only means of attracting additional passengers, leading in turn to still greater losses.  Clearly this situation could not continue indefinitely.  Inevitably, fares had to increase to cover costs if the company was to be restored to viability.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints about the level of fare increases being imposed by the B &amp; I this year.  Let us look at what this year's increases represent.  The overall year-round fares increase is about 8 per cent; for 327 days of the year the increase is 10 per cent maximum.  For the remaining 38 days, a 15 per cent increase has been applied to certain peak season sailings.  For these higher fares, which as I have said are necessary if the company is to be restored to viability, users of B &amp; I services can look forward to much improved standards of service and facilities on the company's car ferries.  Moreover, fares on B &amp; I car ferries are not out of line with the rates per mile charged on a number of the most popular routes on the English Channel.</P>
    <P>We cannot impose double standards on the B &amp; I in this area.  One cannot on the one hand insist on the company operating to commercial standards and without reliance on the Exchequer beyond the support which the Government have already pledged and, on the other hand, expect the company not to raise its fares to a realistic level.</P>
    <P>Fears have also been expressed about the danger of lack of competition on the <Col N="1103" /> Irish Sea.  Let us not forget that Ireland has always operated an open ports policy and will continue to do so.  Any shipping company is free to provide services to and from our ports.  One should not overlook either the real competition which exists between the sea and air transport services for many types of passengers and commuters.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Communications would be concerned if B &amp; I and Sealink should combine to abuse their position on the Irish Sea, I do not see this as likely.  In any event the Minister will be monitoring the situation and he will have due regard to the interests of the users of the cross-channel services.  The EC Commission are examining the implications of the agreement with Sealink but I do not expect that there will be any problem about the agreement.</P>
    <P>On the southern corridor the B &amp; I and Sealink are operating a joint service under a new brand name, &ldquo;Southern Seaways&rdquo;.  Pending the acquisition by Sealink of a suitable jumbo size ferry, the service will use the Sealink's &ldquo;St. Brendan&rdquo; year-round and will be supplemented by a B &amp; I vessel during the May to September peak season.  This year the &ldquo;Innisfallen&rdquo; will be deployed for this purpose.  This will provide some short-term contract employment for many of the staff on the Rosslare route who are being made redundant.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the B &amp; I's restructuring plan about which some concern has been expressed is the use by the B &amp; I of overseas contractors on their vessels and about possible discrimination against Irish goods.  In fact, the catering concession on the company's car ferries is held by an Irish company, Campbell Catering of Swords, County Dublin.  A British firm, Allders, operate the duty free shops.  The B &amp; I consider that specialist contractors can perform these tasks more economically and efficiently, thus providing an improved service to the customer. This is a common procedure in shipping companies and indeed a somewhat similar arrangement was made by Aer Rianta <Col N="1104" /> at Dublin Airport where the catering concession is held by SAS.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the B &amp; I have assured the Minister that far from harming the sales of Irish goods on board B and I vessels, the new arrangements will, in fact, promote such sales to a much greater degree than formerly.  There is no question of any discrimination against Irish goods.  In fact, most goods on sale on board the B &amp; I vessels are Irish goods and the greatest demand is for these goods.  I understand that the B &amp; I have had discussions with the main Irish manufacturers about the duty free shops concessions with a view to securing the optimum involvement of Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like once again to stress the point that the company's future cannot be assured by Government support alone.  It is equally dependent on full co-operation by all concerned in the provision of a continuous, reliable and efficient service.  I feel sure that this co-operation will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Government's objective for the B &amp; I is to see an efficient and commercially viable enterprise which will provide a vastly improved service for its customers, ensure secure employment for its staff and contribute to the development of tourism and trade and general economic growth.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why this objective cannot be realised.  This Bill heralds a new era for the B &amp; I which will lead in a relatively short time to the emergence of a revitalised, self-sustaining enterprise worthy of comparison with the best carriers in this most competitive sector of transport.  The enactment of this Bill will give the company the opportunity to ensure its own long-term future.  I have every confidence that the company will grasp that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are not opposing the Bill there are a few comments I should like to make.  First, there is no doubt that a monopoly situation is being created on the Irish Sea between Sealink <Col N="1105" /> and B &amp; I.  This is a very serious matter and the Minister should keep a very close eye on it.  As soon as the monopoly situation came into being we had an immediate price hike.  My fear would be that Irish people wishing to travel to the Continent would first have to cross the Irish Sea, drive through England and perhaps use the other connections from Dover and other places in the south east of England. That would not make life easy.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would reassure the House that very tight surveillance from the point of view of cost and type of service would be maintained.</P>
      <P>There is a matter which I do not understand and I have often wondered why nothing was done about it.  We seem to be totally orientated towards going to France.  It is probably a shorter route but in these days when Spain seems to be a very popular resort, for winter holidays in particular, why is it that none of those companies has made any effort to run a ferry service from the west coast &mdash; perhaps Limerick &mdash; to Spain?  Spain is now a member of the EC.  It would serve many purposes, not only for the tourism trade but also with a view to the carriage of goods, heavy vehicles <i>et cetera.</i>  I cannot comprehend why those shipping companies would not provide a one or two-day a week service for this trade.  We import citrus fruit and other items from Spain.  I cannot see why this has not been investigated as a viable route.</P>
      <P>Two trips a week would be considered to be very viable.  Has the Minister any comments to make on that probability? We do not want to see the service operating from the east coast of Ireland making things even more miserable for those travelling by sea.  The direct route could be from Foynes in Limerick or some other area on the west coast.  A feasibility study could be done on this quite quickly.  If there is potential, the service could be developed, taking into account the extension of membership of the Community to include Spain and Portugal. I would like to hear the Minister comment on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we could get assurances that <Col N="1106" /> the cost element would be taken on board by the Minister.  Perhaps all price increases should be through the process of application to the Minister for Communications, so that those applications would be on hand.  If there is a reasonable argument in favour of the applications the Department could grant them but they should not come in a haphazard sort of way, that if business is big and peak performance is high, the price should be increased for the sake of profitability. There is more to it than profitability.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would consider that.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a new technique in dealing with superannuation and staff relations in section 2 of the Bill.  It is new to me to see it written into a Bill that everything is now in the tight fist of the Minister.  Have all external negotiations within the company fallen by the wayside or is it simply because of the attitudes and problems which have evolved in B &amp; I that the Minister has taken all control for payment of pensions <i>et cetera</i> out of the hands of the company and placed them in the hands of the Department? That is a new diversion and I would like the Minister to explain it better.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints that the south west service to the Continent seems to have gone by the wayside.  There is probably some logical explanation for it. Perhaps the amalgamation of Sealink and B &amp; I is responsible for it or the cost of the ferries is outside the demand.  From a tourist point of view, particularly during the peak summer months, something should be done.  I do not think the service should continue throughout the winter but certainly at peak period of the summer something should be done to try to keep that connection.  I used the ferry in September 1984 and on that occasion it was full with passengers.  When I came back in October it was still loaded with passengers and heavy truck traffic.  I do not see why we could not have a summer service.  I do not know what the service would be like during the winter but a six months service should be considered.</P>
    <P>I would like to have the points in relation <Col N="1107" /> to the Spanish connection clarified, perhaps the south east connection could be moved more towards the south of France or, alternatively, there could be a continuing service to the south of France, and Spain on a three point stoppage. There is a certain amount of business meat to be eaten on that route.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that.  It would be a reasonable request &mdash; taking into account the monopoly situation which has been created &mdash; that certain instructions be given to semi-State organisations.</P>
    <P>Semi-State organisations have a happy knack of not paying any heed to what the Houses of the Oireachtas tell them. Indeed sometimes they pay very little heed to what the Departments tell them. The only time we ever see them is when they are looking for money and when they get it they simply vanish until they run into trouble again.  It is all high powered press relationship jobs &mdash; get the cash and goodbye.  When one makes a reasonable request to some semi-State organisations they almost frown despite the fact that perhaps a few weeks previously one had voted them millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>It is a freelance situation.  Every Government should take on board the methodology we use to hand out cash in pound shares, making up millions and millions of pounds each year.  We witnessed it over the years.  The semi-State bodies should either stand on their own two feet or they should not be there.  It is as simple as that.  I have witnessed the attitude they adopt the minute they receive their cash and I have commented on this on several occasions.  I take offence by that attitude, as do many Senators and many Members of the other House.  Once they get their money they seem to be gone and we do not have any powers or control over them.</P>
    <P>I am wary that in this particular instance we are creating a monopoly.  It is deadly dangerous and we should have legislation to protect ourselves in that situation.  Whether or not we want to say in broad English terms that we are <Col N="1108" /> creating a monopoly the fact of the matter is that we are.  We have a link up here between two major ferry services which control for the most part most European routes.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with this but we need to keep a very tight administrative eye on it.  I would like the Minister to comment on my suggestion to put in a safety valve so that any price hikes sought by those two companies on any of the crossings should be restricted to the normal process of application to the Department of Communications. That should be followed by the basic facts proving the necessity for it.  I only ask that on the basis that it is a monopoly situation and it has to be watched.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are not opposing the Bill.  I hope the Minister will respond to those important questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from Senator Killilea's contribution that while he is not opposing it, he is interested in having the service developed with connections from the west of Ireland to Spain and so on.  This is a laudable aim and I am sure both Senator Killilea and myself will be interested to hear the Minister's response at a later stage.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable fear about the future of the B &amp; I Company over the last two or three years, with the appointment by the Minister of the new chairman and managing director, to take the steps necessary to maintain an Irish participation on the cross-Channel routes, and the importance to this country on the industrial and commercial front and, of course, in the interest of tourism, to have a presence with a shipping fleet of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package eventually presented to Government by the new chairman: to protect the shipping service between Ireland and the United Kingdom; to look after the much reduced but considerable <Col N="1109" /> staff of 1,400 who operate the service; to see to it that we are in a position over the next two years while this agreement lasts to come up with a restructuring of the company financially; and hopefully then to have it in a viable state is an important development.  This package should lead &mdash; certainly on the basis of what the Minister has said &mdash; to a healthy and more successful operation across the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>My welcome for the Bill and the financial package it contains is, of course, greatly increased when I look at the figures. Not alone are we talking of an investment of £20 million in 1986 into the B &amp; I Company but contained within that figure is the £7 million which is part of the package required to look after the whole question of capital investment in the shipping fleet.</P>
    <P>The emphasis given in the Minister's speech towards enlarged duty free facilities, shops, restaurants, bars and cinema and various other attractions, to make travelling across the Irish Sea a more enjoyable experience is something we could do much for.  I have the distinct impression that the operations by sea across the Irish Sea have become far less attractive in recent times in comparison with alternative means of travel to Britain. A great deal needs to be done to make a positive impact on the facilities that are on offer on board, even if they lead &mdash; and the Minister made it clear that they will &mdash; to increases in fares. There had been an enormously careless attitude by the staff operating these vessels up until the new programme was put into force.  The availability of Irish products on these vessels left much to be desired.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the Sealink jumbo vessel which it is to operate from Rosslare, I travelled on that boat on a couple of occasions last summer.  The absence of Irish products and Irish drinks was something that upset, not just the few people whom I was travelling with, but a much wider selection of people who were on other trips across the Irish Sea in the course of last summer.  It is very important <Col N="1110" /> to ensure that these vessels are seen as a flag ship for travellers coming into Ireland.  It is more important, of course to ensure they give the same kind of treatment to visitors as is given by Aer Lingus by the availability of a good range of Irish products and a good range of facilities on board.</P>
    <P>These are the kinds of things which would make this package successful.  I feel certain that with the investment of £7 million in refurbishment we are going in the right direction.  Although the new package from the chairman contained a reduction in staff numbers the fact that they have responded in a positive fashion seems to indicate that it is going to work. They are going to support it and this will ensure that it is a very successful operation.</P>
    <P>I would like every possible reassurance from the Minister &mdash; in the areas of customer relations, customer developments and, in particular, the provision of Irish products on these vessels &mdash; that the Department of Communications will go to all ends to ensure that a very different type of approach is taken in the future than has been taken in the recent past.</P>

      <P>He spoke about the monopoly situation.  I can assure him, as he requested, the dangers that could arise from a monopoly situation would be very closely monitored by the Minister and the Department.  It is right to point out that we have an open ports policy.  The Minister would actively encourage any viable organisation coming on the scene to take part in any of the routes and introduce competition in that way.  There is no prohibition <Col N="1111" /> as far as that is concerned.  There is always the question of viability for the company involved.  There is always the temptation for the people who enjoy what amounts to a monopoly situation, <i>de facto</i> if not in theory, to be a little lax and to rely on increases in fares to bring them into viability rather than on the keen kind of competition that might exist if there were other competitors on the route.  However, we found in the past that with the fierce competition which existed, the only element available was competition in fares.  The reduction in fares led to a loss-making situation and endangered all of the companies operating in this way.  That is the difficulty. What is the perfect answer?  We hope this Bill will produce it.  I can assure the Senator very much that there will be careful monitoring of what is taking place there.  The Minister, of course, would welcome at all times the arrival of competition if companies felt it would be a viable proposition for them.</P>
      <P>As regards car ferries to Spain, this is something I have always been interested in.  I often thought, with the volume of people who travel between the countries, there might be a viable proposition there for a shipping company.  There is also the added factor, mentioned by Senator Killilea, that Spain have now joined us in the EC.  With the obvious increase in trading that will take place between the two countries, we hope it will mean traffic in each direction, not particularly in imports but also as far as exports are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of such a service would be primarily a matter for the shipping companies themselves.  The Minister would welcome any viable commercial service that might come about in this area.  I understand that length of voyage has much to do with the viability or otherwise of such routes, especially because of the high capital costs of the vessels involved.  There is the added factor also that in the case of people going to Spain for holidays the demand is not as great in the car ferries area as it is in the air charters area.  That is for the type of <Col N="1112" /> holiday we have at present.  That does not mean there will not be a demand for a new type of holiday.  With the changes which are taking place people are to a certain extent bored of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Exactly.  They may like to move around.  It is the same for Spanish people coming in this direction.  There may be possibilities in that area.  There would be no inhibition on it if it takes place.  Any viable proposition would be welcomed.  We have an open ports policy in this respect.</P>
      <P>As far as the Cork-Wales situation is concerned there is regrettably an absence of a Cork-Wales ferry service at present. The Minister has always recognised the desirability of having a commercially viable cross-channel service operating from Cork.  As Senators are aware, repeated efforts in recent years to provide such a service have unfortunately been unsuccessful, despite State financial assistance being available.  In 1984-85 there was a subsidy of up to £500,000 from the Exchequer.  In 1986 a starting-up grant of £300,000 was made available despite the low service.  The Minister's view of the Cork-Wales service is that it remains a matter for local interests to pursue if they so wish.  This incentive is available but unfortunately a service has not yet been developed.  We have a service with Irish Continental Line and with Brittany Ferries in the summer as far as the connection with France is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald referred to the need for giving the best possible type of service in the crossing of the Irish Sea. This has been achieved.  The upgrading has been very successful and we have a far more luxurious crossing.  If a luxurious crossing was too expensive, it may not be used by every person crossing the sea. Therefore, we need a good balance between the luxury available and the comfort available for visitors coming into the country.  The attractiveness of the cross-channel route across the Irish Sea is very important as far as attracting visitors is concerned but we also must keep <Col N="1113" /> in mind that it has to be at a reasonable price.  I guarantee the Senator we will keep a very close eye on what is happening. As far as the B &amp; I fares are concerned, they have to be referred to the Minister and he will monitor the situation very closely.</P>
    <P>Another point raised during the course of the debate dealt with the approval of the Minister for Communications being sought for alterations to the superannuation scheme currently in operation by B &amp; I or the introduction of any new scheme.  It is the only scheme as far as the Department of Communications are concerned, which does not have this provision. It is a provision that is in general operation at present.  The purpose of it, of course, is two-fold: to ensure that adequate provision is being made as far as the superannuation schemes are concerned and also that companies would not be endangering their own future through the various provisions in this area.  Taking into account the people who will be recipients of the benefits of the superannuation scheme and the future of the company, it is a very wise provision.  We have had some experience with this in the past.</P>

    <Title>Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, 1985, gives effect to the commitment by this party prior to the last general election that, if elected or given the opportunity to participate in government, we would introduce an independent complaints procedure in relation to complaints against members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The purpose of that commitment and the purpose of this Bill is to protect first, the public who may have complaints of a valid nature as against individual members of the Garda and, secondly, to protect the gardaí themselves.  The Bill as drafted gets the balance right in achieving both of those objectives.  In considering this Bill or any mechanism which provides a complaints procedure against the police force of any State, one must bear in mind the fact that no arm of the Government, no arm which runs our society or no arm of the State upon which we are dependent should in any way be in a position whereby they might be perceived as being above the law or being beyond the law.  While we accept that gardaí in the exercise of their duties are subject to the law, we have to ensure that public perception is that the Gardaí are subject to reasonable procedure, this Bill achieves that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individual members of the Garda have <Col N="1115" /> substantial powers and, in the exercise of those powers, they also have substantial responsibility.  These responsibilities, while they should and must be exercised in a free and unsettled fashion, must, be exercised, first, in a manner which ensures that individual gardaí are aware of their obligations to the law of the land and, secondly in a fashion which gives the public confidence that they will be exercised in that way.  We have to get the balance right between individual freedoms on the one hand and the overall protection of society on the other.  This Bill has given rise to much debate within the Garda Síochána and within the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I believe, in achieving the twin objectives I have mentioned, the Bill gets the balance right.  If the balance between the right of the citizen on the one hand and the protection of society on the other is upset then the individual citizen must have redress.  That redress must be one which provides not merely for independent adjudication on any complaint but must be one which allows for a system whereby independent adjudication of a complaint is seen.  One of the drawbacks and one of the problems of the existing procedure &mdash;the procedure which operates by virtue of the Garda Síochána Disciplinary Regulations of 1971 &mdash; is that the independence of that system, in so far as it is independent, is not seen by the public. One of the advantages of the new system envisaged by the Bill is that independence will be seen to be there.</P>
    <P>At present individual members of the Garda are subject to the civil law of the land.  In recent years we have seen many cases against individual gardaí, some successful, some unsuccessful in respect of alleged breaches by them of the civil court in the exercise of their duty.  Individual members of the Garda are also subject to the criminal law.  Also, in recent years we have seen an increasing trend whereby members of the Garda are charged and brought before the criminal courts.  That is a good and a bad thing.  It is a good thing if a member of the Garda <Col N="1116" /> Síochána commits a crime that he should be made amenable to the law of the land. It is a bad thing if members of the Garda Síochána are too frequently brought before the criminal courts.  If that trend increases and if there is an increase in the number of prosecutions brought against members of the Garda in the exercise of their powers and duties that would be a cause for concern.  I am glad to say that there is no substantial increase in that respect.  Individual gardaí are subject to the Garda Síochána Disciplinary Regulations of 1971.</P>
    <P>One matter of concern to me is the role which the 1971 regulations will have if this Bill is enacted.  Perhaps the Minister might spell out to us clearly whether the 1971 regulations are to be completely superseded or whether they will continue to exist in relation to internal complaints by gardaí as against other gardaí.  There is now the Bill, the fourth arm, the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, 1985, which, if enacted, will provide a fourth system to which the gardaí may become amenable.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind &mdash; I have used the word &ldquo;balance&rdquo; already &mdash; that this Bill is part of a very delicate balance which the Government have achieved in giving the gardaí increased powers on the one hand but, on the other hand, introducing procedures whereby the gardaí will be seen to be increasingly subject to the rigours of the law.  One of the commitments given by the former Minister for Justice, which was given statutory effect following an amendment put forward in this House during the Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill was that the Oireachtas should give the gardaí more powers, that a complaints Bill would be produced and regulations would be introduced by the Minister to provide guidelines for the treatment of persons in Garda custody.  I welcome those regulations.  They are reasonably good.  I welcome that we have a motion on the Order Paper which will give this House the opportunity of discussing those regulations in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the statutory machinery whereby a person who witnesses an improper act committed by a garda may <Col N="1117" /> alty to be imposed on the member.  It is report that act to another garda, to a garda above the rank of superintendent or direct to the complaints board.  I believe this has been welcomed across the board.  Reservations have, however, been expressed in relation to two aspects of this Bill.  First, the presence of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or his representative on the complaints baord and, secondly, the involvement of the Garda in carrying out investigations into complaints against their members.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with these two objections which have been raised in relation to the Bill.  I believe it is right that the commissioner should be represented on the complaints board.  The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána is the head of a disciplined police force.  In this country he is the head of a unified police force.  Perhaps we are one of the very few jurisdictions in western Europe which have one total unified police force, a unity that was achieved following the enactment of the 1925 Amalgamation Act. Therefore, by virtue of the nature and structure of the force and by virtue of the history of the force it is important that the commissioner or his representative be involved within the complaints machinery.  The involvement is minimal. On the complaints board there is simply one Garda representative.</P>
    <P>It is important that the commissioner should be represented to achieve maximum co-operation between the commissioner and the Garda and the complaints board.  If the commissioner were not represented then the type of co-operation which is necessary to ensure the speedy and proper examination of complaints, would not exist.  If one examines the system in relation to examination of allegations against members of the RUC, which took place in the recent past, where allegations were examined by members of an outside police force, and there has not been co-operation from within the RUC in relation to the examination of those complaints, one can see that the point I am making is a valid one. I would not like to see creeping into our <Col N="1118" /> complaints machinery that type of non-co-operation or any grounds for non-cooperation.</P>
    <P>Another point is whether complaints should be investigated by gardaí.  I believe they should.  The reason for that is quite simple.  Complaints in many instances will give rise to the need for investigation from the point of view of breaches of the criminal law.  That is a matter for a police force.  It requires careful examination and ultimately will require the submission of a report to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. That is one reason why I believe the gardaí should be involved at the investigative level.</P>
    <P>I believe the Garda training enables them, in an expeditious and proper manner, to investigate a breach of discipline or a breach of the criminal law. That is the second valid reason why they should be involved in the investigative process.  The third point is that the Garda should be encouraged to increase the level of co-operation which they have with members of the public.  In recent years we have seen a drop off in that perception, which may be due to a number of factors.  It may be due to the fact, first that gardaí do not live in the areas of their operation.  Secondly, it may be due to the fact that gardaí are not involved in what is happening in their areas.  If gardaí are involved, and if they are known within their areas they achieve an acceptance by the public which makes them suitable people to investigate complaints against other members of the force.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to make is in relation to the question of complaints generally.  I believe it is necessary to have a complaints machinery but I also believe that the gardaí should be protected against the frivolous, foolish or unjustified complaint.  The point has been made that this Bill should include provision for a criminal offence against a person who makes a malicious complaint against the gardaí.  That suggestion has been answered by some people who say that such is not necessary because the board have the opportunity to judge as <Col N="1119" /> to whether a complaint is frivolous and there are the provisions of the Defamation Act, 1961, which could leave a person open to an action for defamation if a foolish complaint were made.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the provision there goes far enough.  While there are many incidences where one can be critical of the gardaí in their operations, I believe they deserve protection against malicious complaints.  I am disappointed that the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, 1985 does not include a section which creates a criminal offence in respect of a person who makes a malicious complaint.  The point has been made that the inclusion of such a provision would act as a disincentive to people to make valid complaints. I do not accept that.  There should be a criminal offence in respect of making a malicious complaint.  I hope the Minister will consider that between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I want to return to the question of the Garda Síochána Disciplinary Regulations of 1971 and to raise the question of how these regulations will operate once the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, 1985 becomes law.  It seems that the regulations of 1971 provide the existing procedure in respect of which all complaints by the public or, indeed, internal complaints, will be adjudicated.  Those regulations provide for the establishment of an appointing officer who will appoint an investigating officer who will investigate the alleged breach of discipline.</P>
    <P>Under the 1971 regulations it is the duty of the investigating officer to report to the appointing officer.  It is a matter for the appointing officer to decide whether the matter should be proceeded with.  If the appointing officer believes the matter should be proceeded with he then reports the matter to the Commissioner of the Garda who causes an inquiry to be held.  That inquiry is presided over by a chief superintendent sitting alone or by a chief superintendent sitting with two superintendents.</P>
    <P>One of the defects of that procedure is, of course, the lack of the independent element.  Members of the public who <Col N="1120" /> make complaints against the Garda and see how this procedure operates in giving evidence before such a tribunal feel very much like a witness appearing at a court in hell with the devil being the judge. That is the kind of public perception that exists in so far as the 1971 regulations operate.  In so far as we change from the 1971 regulations with a substantial Garda involvement, to the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, 1985, with a substantial lay person involvement, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Before commenting on the Bill, I want to express disappointment at certain views which have been expressed by members of the Garda or their associations in relation to this Bill.  I refer, in particular, to the views of the AGSI president, Dan Ryan, in addressing an open meeting of Limerick members on 21 June 1985 as reported in the <i>Garda News</i> of June 1985 when he said:</P>
    <P>In particular that section which requires members to answer questions and produce documents in certain circumstances is one, not only that I did not envisage, but one which I could never accept.</P>
    <P>Later in the course of the same address he said:</P>
    <P>No one, least of all, I, deny the need for the gardaí to be accountable for their actions.  But I contend that at present they are amply accountable for those actions &mdash; as recent events have proven beyond doubt.  We have a most stringent Disciplinary Code which enables the Commissioner to do practically anything he wants to a member.</P>
    <P>Indeed we have in one sense, arguably, a difficult and stringent disciplinary code. One reason why I welcome the departure from the disciplinary code is the peculiar role of the Commissioner within the 1971 regulations.  We have regulations which, on the one hand, establish the procedure by which an appointing officer appoints an investigating officer who, sets up a tribunal and who adjudicates as to whether a member is guilty or not.  It is not that tribunal who decide on the penmy <Col N="1121" /> understanding that the question of penalty is a matter for the Commissioner. That is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I resent the public disappointment that has been expressed by some of the Garda representative bodies.  I want to quote further from a statement made by Michael Murray, General Secretary of the AGSI in the same issue of the <i>Garda News</i> when he was addressing Donegal members on 24 June, 1985 when he said:</P>
    <P>There is now a subtle campaign to exclude Garda representatives from having a say in important matters affecting the welfare of their members. The Minister launched it when he excluded us from the Review of Garda Training.  Some of his backbenchers recently supported it &mdash; for example, on June 6 last, Mr. Maurice Manning, TD, told the Minister in the Dáil that he should not become &ldquo;the tool of any Garda organisation or pressure group&rdquo;.  &ldquo;The general public&rdquo;, he said &ldquo;would have greater respect for the Garda organisations, and they would have greater credibility with the public, if they spoke a little less often and moderated the tone in which they couch many of their demands and many of their attacks.&rdquo;  Apart from the insulting condescension of this attack and the fact that the same could be said for most politicians neither he, Mr. Noonan or this Government can hope to silence the justifiable and intense anger felt by my members at the terms of this Bill and the overall manner in which the leaders of this community are treating their police force.  This is one occasion when not only will the Garda organisations not remain silent but it would be their eternal disgrace if they did.</P>
    <P>I resent that kind the language coming from a member of the Garda.  Here we have the secretary of the AGSI making what can be called nothing other than a clear political attack upon the Minister and the Government of the day because he disagrees with the initial contents of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill. <Col N="1122" /> Comments of that nature by a member of a responsible association do nothing to create public regard for, or indeed public confidence in, the Garda or the association Mr. Murray mentions.</P>
    <P>The Bill of 1985 includes in the Fourth Schedule matters in respect of which complaints may be made under section 4 (3) of the Bill.  It is rather interesting &mdash; I do not know whether this is due to the influence of the AGSI within the Department of Justice &mdash; that when one examines the schedule to the 1971 regulations one finds the matters which are deemed to be breaches of discipline.  One of the matters which is a breach of discipline specified in article 15 of the schedule to the 1971 regulations is as follows:</P>
    <P>Prohibited spare time activities, that is to say &mdash; (a) identifying actively or publicly with a political party; (b) behaving, in relation to political matters, in such a manner and in such circumstances to give rise to reasonable apprehension among members of the public in relation to impartiality in the discharge of duties; (c) engaging in any activity which, though not mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) or (b), is prohibited by the commissioner as being likely to interfere with proper discharge of duties, as likely to give rise to reasonable apprehension among members of the public in relation to impartiality in the discharge of duties or as being, for good and stated reasons, inappropriate for members of the Garda Síochána to engage in.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, the Fourth Schedule of the Bill we are now discussing contains many of the things specified in the schedule to the 1971 regulations but does not contain this particular prohibition.  I will be putting down an amendment at Committee Stage to see that article 15 of the schedule to the 1971 regulations is included in the Fourth Schedule to the 1985 Bill.</P>
    <P>The Fourth Schedule makes no mention of gardaí dis-involving themselves in political activity.  I make this point, in view of what I can only regard as the gauntlet thrown down by Mr. Michael Murray to the former Minister and to this <Col N="1123" /> Government, a Government who have provided the Garda with the mechanism within the Criminal Justice Bill.  I want to throw down the gauntlet to Mr. Murray and ask him if his association would be happy with the inclusion in the Fourth Schedule of the Bill to the prohibition of that type of spare time activity. I believe the comments made by Mr. Murray on 24 June, 1985 are comments which, for a member of the Garda Síochána, are tantamount to meddling in political matters.  An attack by the leader of a Garda association on the Minister for Justice of the day and, indeed, on the Government of the day, must be regarded as meddling in political affairs. I sincerely hope that we will see less of that type of activity from individual gardaí but, above all, from members of Garda representative associations.</P>
    <P>My comments in relation to the Bill will be brief because I believe this is essentially a Committee Stage Bill. Section 3 establishes the board.  The first Schedule to the Bill will have effect in relation to the board.  The Government have got it right as far as the constitution of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board is concerned.  A board of nine members the chairman of which will be either a solicitor or barrister of ten year's standing gives to the new board the type of leadership which is essential.  The person who will be chairman of this board is somebody who will have to have the same qualifications as a member of the Judiciary would have to have under existing law.  I welcome the inclusion in this board of three solicitors or barristers of ten year's standing.  This board have extremely important functions to carry out and it is very important that the tribunals, which may be constituted by the board have people with sufficient legal expertise and experience.  I welcome the presence of a representative of the Garda Commissioner on the board for the reasons that there should be co-operation between the complaints board and the Garda Síochána.  One only has to examine the comment on the John Stalker situation to realise that if that kind of <Col N="1124" /> co-operation does not exist all kinds of problems can arise.  I welcome the provision of article 2 (4) (c) of the regulations that no other member of the Garda Síochána should be on the board.  The commissioner's presence or his representative is sufficient.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provisions of article 4.7 and article 4.8 of the First Schedule which deal with the remuneration of members of the board and the power to remove them.  This is a point that I believe has not been stressed sufficiently.  With regard to remuneration I would like to ask the Minister if there is a suggestion that members of the board should be full time members or whether they should be part time members.  This is something I am not altogether sure about.  I am not sure whether this board will operate like An Bord Pleanála.  Will it be a full time board?  Will its members be fully involved on a full time basis or will they operate on a part time basis only?  It is my hope that the members of this board will be full time operatives within this board. The work which the complaints board and the complaints tribunal will have to carry out will be such as to require full time involvement.  I would like the Minister to confirm if such will be the case.</P>
    <P>I welcome, in particular, article 2.8 of the First Schedule which states:</P>
    <P>The Government may remove from office any member of the board who, in the opinion of the Government, has become incapable through ill health of effectively performing his functions or has committed stated misbehaviour.</P>
    <P>This limits the circumstances within which members of the board may be removed.  One of the unfortunate developments in recent times has been the fact that we have seen the unfortunate removal from office of one Garda Commissioner for no apparent reason.  I refer to Garda Commissioner Garvey who performed excellent work.  More recently we have seen the removal of another Garda Commissioner for reasons which were stated at the time and upon which I will not comment now.  There is certainly a public perception that Governments can <Col N="1125" /> remove Garda commissioners.  I would hate to see the perception by the public that the Government of the day can remove members of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that the Garda Complaints Tribunal be seen to operate in an impartial manner.  By the First Schedule to this Bill the tribunal have been given all the powers, functions and privileges of the High Court.  In so far as the removal of their members is concerned they have been given somewhat similar protection as members of the Judiciary.  The public perception should be such and not that members of the board may be removed by a foolish Government for foolish reasons.  In the past, though not in the life of this Government, we have seen far too much interference by Ministers of the day in relation to Garda matters, the kind of interference which has never been properly answered and the kind of interference which I hope in the future will be properly answered.  In that regard there are many unanswered questions which have not merely affected Ministers or Governments of the day but which, unfortunately, have had effect on the whole operation of Anglo-Irish relations on other matters which stem beyond the normal day to day operation of Government. I would hope that so far as complaints against members of the Garda are concerned, those complaints will be dealt with by a board which is protected, seen to be impartial and which will discharge its duties properly.  I welcome the First Schedule of this Bill in providing that type of board.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill deals with the situation in relation to members of the appeal board who are nominated to this House, who are Members of the Dáil or the European Parliament.  I am not happy if the section is drafted in accordance with recent drafting practice in the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to this situation. This House have had to put down amendments in relation to the Dentists Act, the Nurses Act and more recently in relation to the Combat Poverty Act to deal with this matter but it seems that the <Col N="1126" /> parliamentary draftsmen have not learned by a number of mistakes they have made on other occasions.  I refer this section to the Minister as I do not believe that it complies with the situation that has been legislated for in the legislation I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the making of complaints to the board.  This section of the Bill is somewhat cumbersome and lengthy.  If I may depart from the Bill for a moment, that may reflect our attitude as a people.  It is interesting to read nineteenth century judgments of members of the old Irish High Court and the old Irish Court of Appeal.  There one can find short, succint and easily readable judgments.  If one reads judgments of the High Court and the Supreme Court one will find that they are very lengthy and difficult to grasp.  The situation with regard to legislation is similar.</P>
    <P>Our predecessors in the early days of this State and, indeed, in the Imperial Parliament, particularly at the end of the nineteenth century, were able to produce legislation which set out in a very simple form what they wanted to do.  One could understand it, it was implementable and, by and large, stood the test of time.  Now we seem to be moving to the era in which legislation has become complex. Nowhere is it more complex or nowhere, to my mind, is there so much unneccessary verbiage as in section 4 of the Bill. We can try to amend it.  It seems a pity that two full pages are taken up simply to deal with the question of the making of complaints to the board.  I do not know why slightly different procedures are prescribed for making complaints to the board, on the one hand or for making complaints to a member of the Garda Síochána on the other hand or for making complaints perculiarly, to a member of the Garda Síochána above the rank of chief superintendent at a place other than the Garda barracks.  I do not know if that is meant to encompass a situation where somebody might meet the Assistant Commissioner of the Garda at Fairyhouse races or Ballinrobe races, or indeed while out fishing on Lough Mask <Col N="1127" /> where one might meet a deputy commissioner who was in another boat and, in the silence of the lake, make a complaint about a particular garda.  I cannot see why a similar procedure, in simple language, is not prescribed for the making of all of these complaints.  Perhaps the Minister of State might comment on that when he is summing up.  Perhaps the mandarins in the Department of Justice have their own reasons which we will never hear of.  Perhaps the Minister has his own better reasons which we might learn something about.</P>
    <P>I regard Section 4 (3) as being a little restrictive.  That is the section which deals with the admissibility of complaints.  It may be no harm to read into the record what is an admissible complaint.  It is a complaint which complies with the following conditions: first, that the complainant was a member of the public.  I presume, therefore, that a complaint by a member who is not of the public, that is, a member of the Garda Síochána, is a complaint to which the 1971 regulations, in so far as they exist, apply and to which this Bill, if enacted, will not apply. Secondly, the complainant must be directly affected by or witness to the conduct alleged in the complaint.  That is reasonable but it could be fleshed out a little more.  What does &ldquo;witnessed conduct&rdquo; mean?  It means one must visually see conduct.  Therefore, it would mean that a blind person would have difficulty in making a complaint under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the said conduct would constitute an offence or be conduct specified in the Fourth Schedule to this Act.  I referred to that earlier in relation to political involvement by members of the Garda Síochána.  That is excluded.  We have the peculiar situation that if a member of the Garda Síochána believes that a fellow member of the Garda Síochána is attending a Fine Gael meeting, or a Fianna Fáil meeting, he may make a complaint and that member may be disciplined under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1971.  But if I, as a mere member of the public, wish to make a complaint that a member of the Garda <Col N="1128" /> is attending a Fine Gael meeting or a Fianna Fáil meeting or any other kind of political meeting, it would appear that I am not entitled to do so because it is not envisaged in the Fourth Schedule of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Of course, it may be argued that for a member of the Garda Síochána to attend a political meeting is an abuse of authority, or is corrupt or improper practice. I do not think that argument would stand up, particularly when one compares that Schedule with what is included in the schedule to the 1971 regulations.  I make this point for the reasons I have already stated in relation to senior members of the force but I make it more specifically in relation to members of all ranks, because this is one area where we are increasingly seeing a departure from accepted practice. Without putting a tooth in it, we are increasingly seeing involvement by members of the Garda in all political parties.  It is absolutely unacceptable to find members of the Garda Síochána canvassing in elections in ordinary clothes. That is happening in relation to all political parties.  It is not happening on a wide scale but I know members of the Garda Síochána who have canvassed for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and other politicans who operate in the Twenty-six Counties. There should be a specific inclusion in the Fourth Schedule of the Bill to deal with that.  If the Minister is not prepared to do that he might indicate why.</P>
    <P>The fourth matter I want to refer to dealing with the admissibility of complaints is the date on which the said conduct is alleged to have occurred &mdash; on or after the establishment day and within six months before the date on which the complaint was made.  In other words, somebody has six months within which to make a complaint.  That is both reasonable and unreasonable.  It is a little like the provisions of the summary jurisdiction Act or the Petty Sessions Act which provide that a summons in relation to summary matters should be issued within six months.  We can say that is reasonable. Interestingly, the State, in creating statutory offences which can be tried on a summary basis, tend to extend that now <Col N="1129" /> to a year or to two years.  There are instances where it may be reasonable to make a complaint after six months.  The board should have the power, if they think fit, to extend that time or if the board should not have that power, then perhaps the Circuit Court or High Court or some competent body should have the power to extend the six months period in reasonable cases.</P>
    <P>The six month rule <i>prima facie</i> is reasonable.  I do not like extending these rules.  On the other hand, there can be exceptional circumstances.  Situations can arise where an injustice can be done. Indeed we had a case within the past year when we had no Garda complaints machinery in operation.  That was the Kerry Babies Case.  The Seanad and Dáil set up a public tribunal of inquiry.  Would it have been possible within six months to make a complaint in relation to some of the things which allegedly happened at that time?  It would not.  So unless we give an indication of where the six month rule can be extended, we may have many more inquiries of that nature.  That is something which I, as a member of the public and as a legislator, do not want to see happening.  Section 4 (3) (a) (iv) needs to be looked at and the six month period should be extended in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Subsection 3(a)(v) states that: &ldquo;the application of this Act to the said conduct did not, by virtue of section 14 of this Act, stand excluded on the date on which the complaint was made&rdquo;.  That is a reasonable provision.  If the complaint is frivolous or vexatious, it is right that the board should have power to exclude such a complaint from consideration.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill is an important section.  It gives statutory power to deal informally with complaints.  It is unfortunate that many people within the Garda who have power to deal with other members on a disciplinary basis are fearful of dealing with these matters on an informal basis.  Article 7 of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1971 provides:</P>
    <P>Nothing in these regulations shall <Col N="1130" /> affect the right of the Commissioner or any other member of the Force whose duties include the supervision of another member to deal informally (whether by advice, admonition or warning as the circumstances may require) with a breach of discipline of a minor nature.</P>
    <P>My experience, as somebody who has defended many members of the Garda Síochána before tribunals set up under these regulations, is that members who have a function in relation to discipline over other members too infrequently make use of Article 7 of the regulations. That failure on the part of members of the Garda may arise because of worry on their part, or because of insecurity or for any number of reasons.  It reflects a failure to use Article 7 and a lack of confidence in certain Garda officers. Article 7 and section 5 of the Bill should be used on a much more frequent basis.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that matters which should be dealt with formally should be dealt with informally.  If something is suitable for being dealt with informally then it should be so dealt with.  Many matters which could be dealt with in that way are not.  Much of the time of Garda officers and State money are used in the holding of inquiries into matters of a very minor nature.  One of the most appalling experiences I had was attending an inquiry where the issue was the amount of turf burned in a Garda station.  A member was charged with breach of regulations in relation to burning too much turf.  The suggestion may have been that the turf was being burned very quickly but it was not a matter which should have been the case of a full sworn inquiry.  I welcome the enactment, in statutory form, of the provisions of section 5.  I hope it is a provision which will be used frequently.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the investigation of complaints.  It is the section which has caused a certain amount of opposition namely the right of a commissioner to appoint an investigating officer.  It is reasonable that the investigative process envisaged by this Bill should be carried <Col N="1131" /> out by members of the Garda.  That relates to the manner of their training and commitment and by and large, to their experience in such matters.  Above all, it relates to the fact that members may be investigating or dealing with matters which touch upon breaches of the criminal law.  It would be inappropriate for such matters to be investigated by lay people.  In regard to the appointment of an investigating officer he should not have a direct professional relationship with the member who is to be investigated. My experience of the 1971 regulations would lead me to believe that, by and large, the investigating officer appointed under those regulations is somebody who had a direct professional relationship with the member concerned. It was usually an inspector in the same division or in the same district.</P>
    <P>One of the defects in the 1971 regulations was that the presenting officer usually was the member's own superintendent. That is one of the unsatisfactory aspects of the operation of the 1971 regulations. A member could be charged with a breach of discipline and find that it was being investigated by a member he knew. Frequently he could find the case against him being presented by his own superintendent. The word is &ldquo;presented&rdquo;, not prosecuted, and rightly so.  Even in a criminal matter, where the duty of the prosecutor is to present the facts, the defendant always feels that he is being persecuted. That applies in relation to gardaí where facts which relate to alleged breaches of discipline by them are presented by their own commanding officer.  That certainly does nothing for the morale of the force. That is the practice as I have experienced it and is one which should be departed from.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with the concept of investigation by members of the Garda of other members but I hope that the investigation, in so far as it takes place by virtue of the operation of section 6, will be carried out by somebody who does not have a professional relationship with the member concerned.  What we are talking about here is a Garda force who <Col N="1132" /> are acceptable to our society.  We are talking about getting the balance right between protecting the Garda on the one hand and protecting the public on the other.  We are talking about maintaining a level of morale within our Garda force which will achieve all of these things. That will not be achieved if a member against whom allegations of breaches of discipline are made is investigated by somebody who is his supervising officer.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill deals with the function of the board on the completion of its investigation.  This is a cumbersome section.  It is an all-encompassing section in that it does what it sets out to do but it does so in a manner that is lengthy and cumbersome.  The board, as the section states, may refer a matter to the DPP where there is a breach of the criminal law.  One of the initial objections made to this Bill by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors was &mdash; I will read from the editorial in the <i>Garda News</i> of June 1985 which says:</P>
    <P>For a number of reasons the National Executive felt it had no option but to seek major changes in the Bill, but preferably its total withdrawal.  The Association had favoured some independent element in Garda complaints procedures, but only if certain basic conditions were met.  The Bill does not meet the most important of those conditions namely, free legal aid and the removal of the risk of double jeopardy.</P>
    <P>It is double jeopardy we are talking about and section 7 would appear to eliminate that risk.  A member cannot be charged on both a breach of discipline and a breach of the criminal law.  In so far as there is a removal of that it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of section 7 which has caused some concern is subsection (9) which deals with the onus which is placed on a member in respect of supplying certain information.  Initially objections were raised in relation to this section on the basis that the normal right of silence which an accused person had would be removed.  We are not talking about investigation of a criminal matter.  We are <Col N="1133" /> talking about investigation of a breach of discipline and investigation of a complaint by a member of the public.  We are specifically talking about matters other than criminal matters and section 7 spells that out clearly.  In other words, we are talking about matters which are germane to the operation of a member of the Garda as such.  Therefore, it is right that the member should have imposed upon him the impositions which are contained in section 7 (9) which states:</P>
    <P>Where a direction under this subsection for an investigation is given, the investigating officer concerned may, for the purposes of the investigation, require a member other than a member who is the spouse of the member concerned to answer a question, furnish information, or produce a document or thing relevant to the further investigation of the complaint concerned.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of the subsection reads:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the member to comply with a requirement of an investigating officer under paragraph (c) of this subsection, but the answer given, the information furnished, or the document or thing produced, in pursuance of the requirement shall not be admissible in evidence against the member or his spouse in any proceedings whatsoever other than proceedings against the member for or in relation to a breach of discipline.</P>
    <P>That gets the balance right in ensuring that there is an obligation on the member, on the one hand, to be open in relation to the allegation which is made under the Complaints Bill and, on the other, to protect the member in relation to any charge which may be brought against him under the criminal law.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill deals with the establishment of the tribunal, and that is more particularly dealt with in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  Section 9 of the Bill deals with the procedure consequent upon the referral of a matter to the tribunal. I welcome the section in so far as it departs from the 1971 regulations.  My understanding of these regulations is that <Col N="1134" /> upon the holding of an inquiry and upon the determination by that inquiry of a breach of discipline or otherwise, a report is submitted to the commissioner who in turn determines the penalty.  That is unsatisfactory.  Under the Bill the entire matter is left to the tribunal.  That is welcome. Imposing a penalty for a breach of discipline is best done by the person who has heard the evidence.  The Bill sets out in subsection (4) the disciplinary actions which may be taken.  These are dismissal from the Garda Síochána; a requirement to retire or resign as an alternative to dismissal; a reduction to such other rank in the Garda Síochána as the tribunal may determine; a reduction in pay of such amount and for such period as the tribunal may determine; a reprimand and, lastly, a caution.  It is right that this is a matter which should be determined by the tribunal and not by the commissioner.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 10 of the Bill and the Third Schedule which deals with the establishment of the Garda Síochána Complaints Appeal Board.  I welcome the Bill.  It brings to fruition the commitment given to us and to the Labour Party prior to the last general election in relation to the establishment of an independent complaints procedure.  The Bill gets the balance right between protecting the public and giving them an assurance that the gardaí will act in a manner which is within the law and that, if they do not, the public have a reasonable hope of independent redress.  It also protects the gardaí against the double jeopardy of frivolous and unrealistic complaints and unfounded allegations.  Overall, this Bill gets the balance right.  It is a technical and detailed Bill and as such I hope the House will be given ample time in which to discuss Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Durcan, for doing on Second Stage, something which might well have been done on Committee Stage.  He made a very fine speech and I congratulate him on his knowledge of the police complaints machinery as laid down in the Bill.  I say that as the former chairman of the police <Col N="1135" /> complaints machinery in Northern Ireland which I set up with my colleagues there.  I will talk to him later privately about his conception of double jeopardy because I think he is still a little confused.</P>
      <P>We should pay attention to the public perception of this matter.  As communicators we should endeavour to educate the people we represent, the public at large, as to how a complaints procedure developed, and where the idea came from.  Were the police misbehaving? Were they guilty of corruption?  What were they guilty of which made this machinery necessary?  It was not for any of these reasons that the complaints machinery in Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand or Canada was set up.</P>
      <P>The fundamental basis of complaints against the apparatus of the State &mdash; the police form part of that &mdash; springs from the aftermath of World War II.  The traumatic experiences suffered by the people in Europe under the Nazi and Fascist tyranny, made people think about human rights, civil liberties and the perception that the State is the master of the people.  In Western democracies and in civilised countries the state is the servant of the people.  That is where the concept arose.  Any part of the apparatus of the state is properly understood only if it is ready to be challenged from time to time. That is where the police complaints machinery concept fits into the arena of human rights.  It is the same with the Ombudsman machinery.  The police complaints machinery is a more refined version of machinery but the Ombudsman principle is there.</P>
      <P>The people must understand that. They must not think that the Garda were misbehaving and that as a result, this machinery had to be set up.  Public perception is a sensitive thing.  If people are not properly educated about this they will have misgivings about it in much the same way as they have about the police investigating their own complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our law enforcement officers are entrusted with enforcing the laws which the people have made.  The lawmakers have the police force to enforce the law <Col N="1136" /> to the best of their ability.  It must be remembered, however, that they are human beings who can make mistakes.</P>
    <P>What are we talking about?  There are two areas where people can misbehave as members of a police force &mdash; they can breach the criminal law and breach the disciplinary code laid down by the police force.  Independent inquiries are carried out in both areas.  The DPP carries out investigations into breaches of the criminal area and breaches of the disciplinary code are investigated by members of the force.</P>
    <P>This Bill is overburdened with legal professionals.  The board may find a breach of discipline and then the tribunal sits.  The board cannot find a person guilty.  It only &ldquo;may&rdquo; find a person guilty. The tribunal finds a person guilty.  If one looks at the number of barristers who sit on the board and then at the tribunal one will see that my point is valid.  There is no breach of law involved in cases of breach of discipline.  Any layman can see a breach of a disciplinary code because all he has to do is read the code, determine the facts and make a decision.</P>
    <P>In the Northern legislation, there is no overburdening of the legal profession as we have here.  I am not going to offer any amendment.  I am going to say: &ldquo;Yes, let us go on and try it.  Let us see how it works&rdquo;.  I believe that that is the first criticism I should make with the experience I have.  I welcome and commend the Bill.  It is necessary.  It is not so much a Bill to balance the Criminal Justice Act, some parts of which do not go into operation until this Bill goes through.  If there never had been a Criminal Justice Act, a complaints' machinery was necessary in any civilised democratic country for the reason I have given, the fundamental human right protection envisaged in the western non-totalitarian countries.  It is not a question of balancing some other Act of Parliament.  That would be a very silly and superficial reason and not a good one.  The reason I have given is more deep rooted, fundamental, right and proper.</P>
    <P>Our law enforcement officers carry out the law to the best of their ability but if <Col N="1137" /> some of their colleagues deviate from the norms of conduct an investigation is mounted.  People in the civil liberties areas have been calling for years that in such cases there be independent investigation, not investigation where there is overlooking, scrutinising and seeing the files after the police have carried out the investigation.  No, they want independent investigations.  That cannot be completely met.  In my experience as chairman of the complaint's machinery against the RUC in Northern Ireland I came finally to the conclusion that part of the way we could go by way of introducing an independent element is by way of what is in this Bill.  The chief executive officer of the board is the independent element.  As in the North and Britain, he will investigate the more serious complaints against the police force, after, of course, having excluded, through the board machinery, the frivolous, the vexatious, the anonymous and all the rest.  That is where the independent element comes in because I very firmly came to the conclusion that an independent lay investigation just was not on for reasons I will probably have to give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for affording me the opportunity of raising this harrowing question in the House.  This harrowing question will not be widely known of in Ireland.  Indeed, it may not be widely known to Members of the House but it is a question which is not unlike what was called the &ldquo;Irish question&rdquo; during the 19th century and the earlier part of the 20th century.  It is the question of decolonisation. That to me, as a sometime student of recent decolonisations in the world, is a moral question.  It can be called a question of colonialism but it could be more correctly called the question of neo-colonisalism.  An example of classical colonialism, as we have known it, would be the European powers holding territories on the continents of Africa and Asia particularly and in America too &mdash; particularly the Spaniards &mdash; and the phenomenon of the 20th century of he European powers withdrawing in favour of local administrations and local indigeous populations taking over the right to determine their own future.</P>
      <P>I am calling in the motion on the Department of Foreign Affairs to endeavour to have this question on the agenda for the next European Council of Heads of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The genesis of the problem lies in the Spanish occupation of the territory in question in the 19th and the 20th centuries. In common with the winds of change which blew right across Africa &mdash; to use Harold McMillan's famous phrase &mdash; Spain, under Franco, decided to leave the Spanish Sahara in about 1975.  It is interesting that, while Franco suppressed the independence movement in this territory with great ruthlessness in the forties and fifties he commenced direct negotiations with the Popular Front, commonly called Polisario for the liberation of that area, in 1975.  Early in 1975 direct negotiations, on the direction of Franco, who, of course, was ailing very much at this time, were conducted <Col N="1139" /> between the Polisario and Cortino Mori who was the Spanish Foreign Minister at the time.  But because Franco was ailing, a junta within the Falange &mdash; the ruling party in Spain which was declining with Franco's own declining health; in a few years it would be completely out of power in Spain &mdash; entered into secret negotiations, it appears, with the adjoining powers of Mauretania and particularly Morocco.  Those negotiations were not based on any principle whatever.  It was these people getting into these negotiations with Morocco who had designs on this area.  Morocco had no historical claim to it nor had Mauretania but they, Morocco particularly, were turning their greedy eyes on the rich natural resources which existed within the territory.</P>
    <P>A very rich natural resource which exists there is phosphate.  In fact, North Africa, as most people involved with agriculture will know, holds the world's richest resources in phosphate and all the major world agricultural powers, such as the United States, Austrialia, the Soviet Union and so on, imported the vast majority of their phosphates from that region.  Of course, a country which would have a major resource in phosphates should be a very wealthy country because of a very and particularly ready market. In the sixties, phosphate, like oil a little later, doubled, trebled and quadrupled in price so that the value of exports of phosphates would be very great.  For that reason only did Morocco lay claim to that territory which was south of its own borders, western Sahara.  This claim of mine is well backed up because in 1975, prior to the Spanish withdrawal, a United Nations delegation visited the western Sahara.  I will quote the findings of that delegation and I go not further than the Minister's own speech the other night in the other House.  The UN visiting mission concluded that measures should be taken to enable all Saharans originating in the territory to decide on their own future in complete freedom and in an atmosphere of peace and security.  To back up my arguments, we had a ruling of the International Court of Justice in the Hague in <Col N="1140" /> October 1975 which concluded that there were no links of sovereignty between Morocco and Mauretania and the western Sahara.  It clearly stated that neither Morocco nor Mauretania had any sovereign right to or ethnic claim upon the territory.  Nevertheless, because the people led by Arius Nevara in the Falange Government in Spain got their way, they concluded the agreement between Morocco, Mauretania and Spain itself which was called the Madrid Agreement by which Spain withdrew in 1976 and turned over the territory to Morocco and Mauretania, completely forgetting the legitimate claim of the indigenous population to self-determination.</P>
    <P>That right of self-determination had been laid down in the conclusion of the UN visiting mission a year prior to that and in a court ruling by the International Court of Justice in the Hague a year earlier, in 1975 also.  That, of course, led to a war in the territory in which the Popular Front for the liberation of the territory, Polisario, continued a guerilla war.  In Ireland we might not like guerilla tactics but our own independence owes a great deal to guerilla war and, indeed, to a hero of the very party I belong to, Micheal Collins.</P>
    <P>We might also have a history of the diplomatic efforts that were made to solve the problem in the intervening years.  I might state at this stage that, on the Spanish withdrawal, the Popular Front, Polisario, declared the independence of the Western Sahara, Sadar, which is the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic, on 26 February, 1976.  That coincided with the departure of the last Spanish soldier and the last Spanish administrative official.</P>
    <P>An impasse existed with guerilla warfare going on in the country from that period until 1979 when Mauretania decided very correctly, to withdraw from the territory.  It had after all, no sovereign rights over or ethnic links with the territory. There was considerable diplomatic pressure on Morocco to do likewise but it has failed to do so.  Morocco has, if you like, dug in in the territory ever since. One of the ways in which it has dug itself <Col N="1141" /> in is by building a large wall 1,500 miles long to cordon off the land which it has grabbed in the territory.</P>
    <P>The Organisation of African Unity got involved in the dispute from the very early stages.  In the early stages the position of Morocco was not condemned by the OAU.  In fact, it would appear that Morocco had many friends among the African community of nations in the early stages, that is the late 1970's and the early 1980's.  In 1980 the situation was reached in the Organisation of African Unity when 26 states out of the 50 members then in the OAU decided to recognise Sadar as the legitimate Government of the territory.  When you have more than half the members, according to one of the articles of the Charter of the OAU, I believe you are then automatically entitled to membership of the OAU.  However, this was a very divisive issue within the Organisation of African Unity and, to the great credit of Sadar, they stood back from this problem within the international politics of Africa, if we may call it that, and did not take the seat they were entitled to because of the objections of Morocco, Zaire and, perhaps, another 20 countries who apparently were neutral on this issue or were not at least supporting the admission of Sadar.</P>
    <P>In 1981 at the OAU conference in Nairobi an agreement was reached on the holding of a referendum in the area, a referendum by which the indigenous population of the territory would be allowed, in freedom and without interference, to vote on the future of the territory. Nevertheless, the agreement also called on the parties to the dispute to sit down together and resolve it.  It appeared that Morocco accepted the principle of the referendum and also accepted the wording that the parties should sit down and negotiate.  But when King Hassan went home from Nairobi he said that they accepted the referendum and the fact that the parties should sit down together but that the parties were not &ldquo;Polisario and us&rdquo; but outside forces, presumably, &ldquo;Algeria and us&rdquo;.  This was a neat little trick with words by which he felt he could get himself off the hook.  This, of course, <Col N="1142" /> led to a tremendous diplomatic impasse within the OAU.  In 1983 at the Organisation of African Unity's meeting of heads of State in Adis Ababba they adopted an unambiguous resolution on the issue.  The resolution stated:</P>
    <P>...parties to the conflict, the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front, to undertake direct negotiations with a view to bringing about a ceasefire to create the necessary condition for a peaceful and fair referendum for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, a referendum without any administrative or military constraints, under the auspices of the OAU and the UN and calls on the implementation of the ceasefire,</P>
    <P>Subsequently, we had a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly of 1984, Resolution 40/50.  This reaffirms that the question of Western Sahara is a question of decolonisation which remains to be completed on the basis of the exercise by the people of the Western Sahara of their inalienable right to self determination and to independence.  In paragraph 3 the Resolution requests:</P>
    <P>...to that end, the two parties to the conflict, the Kingdom of Morocco and the Frente Popular para Liberacion de Saguia el Hamra y Rio de Oro to undertake direct negotiations, in the shortest possible time, with a view to bringing about a ceasefire to create the necessary conditions for a peaceful and fair referendum for the selfdetermination of the people of Western Sahara, a referendum without any administrative or military constraints, under the auspices of the Organisation of African Unity and the United Nations.</P>
    <P>That is a general history of what took place.  I want to deal with Ireland's position, which I consider to be far from satisfactory.  That is the reason I raised this question here this evening.  Ireland, of all European countries, has tried to distance itself from this question.  We have tried to see it in terms of a question to be resolved between Morocco and Algeria.  Clearly, that is not the question. The United Nations General Assembly <Col N="1143" /> Resolution fully recognises that the parties to the conflict are the Western Saharan people and Morocco.  Resolution 104 of the Organisation of African Unity clearly recognises that the conflict is between the Western Saharan people and Morocco.  But Ireland at the United Nations, when these matters came up, preferred to say that it was a matter between Algeria and Morocco.  We will wash our hands like Pontius Pilate and say that we will have nothing to do with it.</P>
    <P>Clearly, that is moral cowardice of the first order.  It is moral cowardice that Ireland, as an ex-colonial nation with a nightmare colonial past, should not engage in.  We should and must take a moral initiative in this area.  Let us not forget that we in the nineteenth century tried to take our case for the concept of an independent Irish nation to the then international fora.  At that time the nations of the world were, by and large, colonial nations.  We tried it again in the early twentieth century.  We are mindful that we tried to have our delegation heard at Versailles in 1918 when we felt that the Great Powers were dividing the spoils after World War I and because Britain had gone to war, or so they said, for the protection of the rights of small nations like Belgium that we tried to have our delegation heard at Versailles in 1918. We felt in 1918 that that would be the guiding principle of the Versailles Treaty. But our case was not heard.  We went away very disappointed.  The people from the Western Sahara are in the same position today.  They are seeking internation opinion on Versailles.  They have the total recognition of all African states except two, South Africa and Morocco, the other party to the dispute.  They have many other nations backing their status &mdash; India, Brazil, Mexico, just to mention a few.  The nations which are not recognising them are those in that western brotherhood of nations who come under the influence, I would have to say, of the United States of America because the United States of America has a very special relationship with Morocco.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> It is not lost on the House or lost on many that Morocco provides special facilities for the United States of America or, should I say, the Reagan administration in America for their famous &mdash; maybe infamous &mdash; rapid deployment force which is to be used if some problem arises in the Middle East.  They went around many countries looking for some location which would be near to that very sensitive part of the world by which they could send their famous anti-terrorist force. Morocco provided them with the service. Many of the very high technology sensory devices and radar devices which are on that infamous wall are provided by the United States and France.  Not only just the United States are immoral on this issue.</P>
    <P>There is the European position which is a kind of immoral neutrality led by France which has a very special relationship with Morocco.  I say again to the Minister that we cannot be a part of this issue.  That is not part of our tradition. We are an ex-colonial nation.  We do not have to engage ourselves in big power politics.  We are not a member of NATO. By our taking a moral stand on this, by raising this in the international forum, by speaking for it at the United Nations, by raising it at the Council of the European Heads of State, we are doing something that is very much in the tradition of what Ireland should be about.  I submit to this House, to the Minister, that this Government take a more active stance because we are in a good position to do so.  We have nothing to lose.  In terms of prestige, and above all, morality we have everything to gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senator Connor for tabling the motion and by doing so giving this House an opportunity to consider this very unhappy situation.  I know it is a situation that has been causing concern to Members of both Houses.  There was, for example, an Adjournment debate on this in the past 48 hours in the Dáil.  A number of individual Senators, particularly Senator Catherine Bulbulia and, in <Col N="1145" /> the other House, Deputy Nora Owen, have spoken to me with great passion and feeling on this subject.  I am aware of the fact that this is a subject on which the conscience of both Houses has been moved.</P>
      <P>I think it is appropriate that we have an opportunity to debate the situation.  I hope that that debate will prove a useful one.  I hope it is a debate that can proceed without people taking the opportunity to toss barbs in the direction of the United States which I regret to say is an all too frequent occurrence whenever matters of foreign policy are discussed in Irish public opinion.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor began his contribution with an historical overview.  That was a useful exercise.  If I may I will go over something of the same ground.  Where we find ourselves in complete agreement I will rush ahead.  Where there are things I want to add or other aspects I want to highlight for the sake of completeness, I will try to dwell on them a little and then come to the substantial question which is, of course, where Ireland stands on this?</P>
      <P>At this stage few Members of either House can be in any doubt but that the Western Sahara was a former colonial possession of Spain.  In 1967 a resolution was passed at the UN General Assembly urging Spain to hold a referendum in the territory that was then known as Spanish Sahara.  The object of the exercise was to allow the population there to determine their own future.  At that stage Spain accepted the principle of self-determination and went on from there to prepare plans to hold a referendum in the Sahara under UN supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now comes the first complication. Morocco and Mauretania both saw themselves as having traditional ties with the territory.  Both of them contested Spanish plans.  At the suggestion of Morocco, the matter was then referred to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Simultaneously with that, the United Nations special committee of decolonisation was instructed to send a mission to <Col N="1146" /> the area.  In October, 1975 the UN investigative commission concluded that measures should be taken in order to enable all Saharans originating in the territory to decide on their own future in complete freedom and in an atmosphere of peace and security.  At the same time, the World Court ruled in favour of self determination.  In November, 1975, however, following Morocco's famous &ldquo;green march&rdquo; into the territory, Spain, Morocco and Mauretania signed a tripartite agreement in Madrid known as the Madrid Agreement by which Spain agreed to withdraw from the Sahara and transfer its autonomy to a temporary administration consisting of a Spanish Governor General and two deputy governors, one nominated by Morocco and the other nominated by Mauretania.</P>
    <P>Spain, therefore, formally terminated its presence in the territory at the beginning of 1976.  It is since then that all of this debate has been concerned.  Since then Polisario, the resistance movement in the Western Sahara have sustained a military campaign against Morocco and in the early period against Mauretania until the latter abandoned its claim to the Sahara in 1979.  In those efforts Polisario had the support in their attempts to oust Morocco from the territory of the Western Sahara of Algeria.</P>
    <P>From the beginning, Algeria, for its part, has rejected claims by any State to the territory.  Instead it advocated the founding of an independent Saharan State.  Algeria has worked closely with Polisario in order to effect the establishment of an independent State to be known as the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic.  That is one side of the coin.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is that Morocco has maintained its presence and has refused to recognise either the Saharan Democratic Republic or Polisario. From there successive attempts have been made to promote a solution to this problem with the objective of allowing the people of Western Sahara to exercise freely and fully their right to self-determination. The OAU, in particular have played a leading role in the deliberations of this issue.  In 1981 in a significant <Col N="1147" /> development the 18 summoned of OAU leaders in Nairobi agreed that a referendum should be held in order to enable the people of Western Sahara to decide their future.</P>
    <P>I am looking at the clock and I do not think I have time to go into the details of this but since then there have been a series of international efforts involving the OAU and the United Nations and involving in particular the OAU, working in collaboration with the General Secretary of the UN towards a resolution.  We applaud those efforts and hope very much that they secure a satisfactory outcome. For our part, our approach has been &mdash; I say this not in any sense to reject the validity of the case being argued by Senator Connor but on a factual basis &mdash; to say to the two sovereign States involved, Morocco and Algeria with both of which we enjoy friendly and diplomatic relations &mdash; that we hope to see this matter peacefully resolved on the principles of self determination.</P>
    <P>When the matter has come to international fora, we have encouraged any process that involves a consensus approach.  Where that has not been possible but where, instead, competing resolutions have been put before us, we have said, &ldquo;no, we are not in a position to chose between those competing resolutions and so it is proper for us to abstain.  Instead it is appropriate for us to say to you, strive for a consensus based on the principles of self-determination.  That is very proper.&rdquo; We in Ireland are deeply concerned about the well-being of the Saharan people more particularly because many of them have had no choice but to live in refugee camps in parts of Algeria.  It is specifically for that reason that our efforts have been and will be directed towards the achievement of a peaceful settlement of the conflict and, by extension, that requires that the settlement has the agreement of the parties concerned.  So we have strongly and consistently supported the implementation of the principle of self determination.  To support that principle does not deserve to be dismissed <Col N="1148" /> as an exercise in Pontius Pilate style washing of the hands.  Not purporting to dictate to others how their affairs should be ordered is very different, indeed, from the situation which Senator Connor has sought to dismiss.  Instead we have supported those international efforts seeking a consensus.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect that I want to mention and that is the question of the humanitarian considerations that arise.  I accept, of course, that the primary thrust of the question that has been raised here related to political questions.  Given our traditional role in foreign policy, questions of humanitarian considerations can never be far from our mind.</P>
    <P>In the past we have contributed small sums of money to this area.  In the very recent past I had an opportunity, as a number of Senators are aware, to meet with some people who recently visited the area and who have suggested that it would be appropriate for us to demonstrate our practical concern for the people of the area, the individuals who are suffering in that area because they are obliged by reason of the unsettled conditions, to live in unsatisfactory conditions, to live in refuge camps.  That is a very sensible suggestion.</P>
    <P>I have met with those groups.  Since then I have been turning my mind to the question of how we can respond.  I have, however, been more than turning my mind to the question of how we can respond and I would like Senators to know there are some avenues open to us which would allow us do something practical to show our sympathy, our rapport and our support.  I have been travelling up some of those avenues even in the space of the past few days.  I hope that it will be possible, as a result of those approaches, to indicate our support and our sympathy with the people who are suffering.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.35 p.m. until 12 noon on Tuesday, 24 June 1986.</P>
