      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The widescale practice of requiring members of the travelling community to &ldquo;sign on&rdquo; at labour exchanges for social assistance at a fixed time.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jim Higgins of the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to indicate his intentions in relation to the opening and staffing of the Aras Attracta Mentally Handicapped Unit at Swinford, Co. Mayo.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The delay by the Minister for Agriculture in implementing the Control of Bulls for Breeding Act, 1985, which was passed in July of last year.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael D. Higgins of the following matter:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The undue delay by the Department of Education in acceding to the request <Col N="648" /> of the Sligo School Project who are seeking to establish a multi-denominational school in Sligo.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Jack Fitzsimons of the following matter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to have the proposed extension to Longwood Vocational School, County Meath, completed as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Brendan Ryan, Jim Higgins, Kiely, Michael D. Higgins and Fitzsimons as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>I have selected Senator Brendan Ryan's matter for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
    <P>Senators Jim Higgins, Kiely, Michael D. Higgins and Fitzsimons may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>In regard to the matter on the Adjournment of which I gave notice last Thursday, I have since received a letter from the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture which reads:</P>
      <P>Dear Rory</P>
      <P>You will be interested to learn that 1 November has been set as the date on which the Controll of Bulls for Breeding Act, 1985, comes into operation.</P>
      <P>The Act, as you know, limits the use of bulls for breeding purposes to those entered in or eligible for entry in the Herd Book of an officially recognised Breed Society. Regulations have also been made prescribing the circumstances in which persons will be issued with permits to keep unregistered bulls&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The effect of the regulations is that from 1 November it will be unlawful for any person to have in his possession an unregistered bull unless such possession is authorised by permit.</P>

      <P>On a point of order or information, as regards the notice of motion submitted by Senator Higgins, my advice to him, as the former Chairman of the Western Health Board, is that he should ask the Minister for Health and the Government to make the money available and not waste the time of the Seanad. The Taoiseach was giving out money all over the country a few weeks ago but he could not give a few bob to the Western Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Item No. 1 is purely formal, a replacement of a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights. Item No. 2 is the Committee Stage of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission (No. 2) Bill. Item No. 3 is the Control of Dogs Bill. It is not known how long Nos. 2 and 3 will take. I suggest that the question of whether we suspend the sitting from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. be considered at 5.30 p.m. in the light of such business as is done. We will then, in any case, be taking from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. Item No. 6 which will be the completion of the Labour Party motion on Arts in Education. I would suggest, in view of the large amount of business we have on the Order Paper, that if the Second Stage of No. 3 is not concluded by 6.30 p.m. we should resume it at 8 p.m. and continue to debate it until the conclusion of Second <Col N="650" /> Stage or until 10 p.m., whichever is the earlier.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I would like to say that the present arrangements do make the access of the Minister to his chair a somewhat more leisurely process than it has been in the past. Perhaps we could allow him to take his seat.</P>

      <P>In connection with the boundary, the section states that if the boundary goes beyond the Schedule, an order under this section shall be laid before this House. I would ask the Minister to tell the House what this means. He has listed a schedule of the various streets and boundaries. But if it goes beyond that schedule, I understand it has to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I ask the Minister to elaborate on this point.</P>

      <P>The Senator is right. If it is seen to be necessary or prudent to alter the <Col N="651" /> boundaries as set out at present which is the boundary of the area administered by the commission, an order will be made by me and if either of the Houses sought successfully to annual that order within the following seven sitting days of the House, the order would be set aside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that the Minister had to leave at Second Stage and that he had not an opportunity to listen to the Second Stage debate. One of the more sensitive sections of the Bill is the appointment of the commission. Could the Minister tell me what qualifications the chairman of this commission will have? From what trade or profession will the chairman be drawn? Will that chairman be a member of Dublin Corporation or an executive of Dublin Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to pursue this section as well. There was some mention in the public press shortly after the publication of the Bill last June or thereabouts that one of the members of the commission would be the Dublin city manager. I do not know whether that is the case. The Minister will obviously in due time be announcing the members of the commission. I wonder to what extent the Minister has considered the role Dublin Corporation may have in relation to the effectiveness of this commission. I gathered from earlier contributions by the Minister, if I took him up correctly, that a fair deal of the work being done by the commission will, in fact, be done by the corporation who will be asked to take it on on the commission's behalf and, to that extent, the appointment of the Dublin city manager would make a great deal of sense. I wonder whether, in view of the division of functions between the manager and the actual city council, he has considered the question of the <Col N="652" /> appointment of a member who might represent the Dublin city council. There has been in the recent past a tremendous amount of involvement by the members of the Dublin city council in bodies we are supporting in one form or another from the Olympia Theatre to the Santry Stadium. I wonder to what extent he has considered that area. Obviously I would see the method of appointment being solely the prerogative of the Minister. I am not suggesting it should be done otherwise, but it might help liaison not just the management of the corporation but with the elected members as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am concerned about the members of the commission. Should the Minister consider somebody who is already involved in the workings of public authorities for this commission? We are talking about £10 million. If people are already involved they will be very much aware of the position as it prevails rather than as we would like it to prevail. I would see a little bit of bother there. Perhaps we might be better off not to look at anybody who is already concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked about the qualifications which one would expect of a chairman and the members of the proposed commission. The basic qualification would be sound common sense. But also one would expect and hope that the members of the commission would have a sense of style and a realisation of what is needed in the area, an appreciation of its architectural merits and, above all else, a sense of and a love of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of membership of the commission is not normally discussed in the course of debates of this nature. The members to be appointed to any body are not normally announced in advance of a debate in the House. Senators will appreciate that there is a long standing tradition on that. If the membership were to be announced in advance it would have two effects. First, it would appear to preempt the right of the House to decide <Col N="653" /> whether the measure should be proceeded with. Secondly, it might be more inclined to lead the discussion into the qualifications of individual members rather than having the discussion on the broad principle of the measure proposed. However, when the Bill was first published, I said I felt that the Dublin city manager was an obvious person to be a member of a commission such as this and I would intend to invite him to serve on the commission. I did that to indicate that I felt there would need to be the closest co-operation between the corporation and the commission in the carrying out of the commission's functions.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the commission will need to draw on the knowledge and the expertise of the corporation in a number of areas. There has been general agreement on the point that the presence of the chief executive of the corporation on the commission is a sensible and worthwhile proposal in that he will be able to act as a conduit between the commission and the corporation and also because, after the three years' work of the commission, the corporation will take over their functions and be responsible for the maintenance of the area on a continuing basis as set out in a subsequent section as an area with a special status enshrined in law. It is important then that the city manager should be fully conversant with the thinking behind any of the moves and improvements initiated by the commission so that when the administration of the area reverts to the corporation he will have a knowledge and an undertaking of the reasons particular proposals have been adopted and implemented.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Senator Cregan. His suggestion was that there was an opportunity to seek the participation of people from other walks of life in the activities of the commission to bring with them their range of experience in other matters. Obviously I would like to give thought and attention to the bodies who have expressed an interest in the city centre area over the years whether from a business, an architectural, or an environmental point of view. It would, perhaps, be reasonable to suggest that it <Col N="654" /> would be from those sort of areas that the membership of any commission like this would be most likely be drawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that the chairman of a commission like this must have common sense, I think he would also require architectural qualifications if the face of the inner city is to be changed. I am not asking that the Minister should name a person. What I am asking is will he be a planner, an architect, an engineer, a consultant, an ordinary layman? Will he be a city manager or what type of person will the chairperson of this commission be? I thought we might be able to get that much information.</P>
      <P>Having a love for Dublin is one thing, but if you have a love for Dublin and no knowledge of planning or no knowledge of development or no architectural qualifications then it might not be enough. Perhaps it should be the city manager. I am not worried about that but I am worried as to the type of person who will be appointed to the commission. That is very important because you are taking away the power from the elected members of the corporation and it would be unwise to hand that power over to people without full qualifications and knowledge of planning and development. You are also taking away power for the construction of roads and maintenance, making bylaws, removal of taxi ranks, bus stops and pedestrian crossings. It is a wide scope of power to give to a commission of six men when we do not know from what walks of life they will come or what qualifications they will have. I believe they require some qualifications relative to environmental development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will they be full time or will they be part time? Will people be seconded from the Department of the Environment and put on this commission for a three year period? If so, will they be full time and will they have an office and a base known as the Dublin city commission buildings or whatever, or where will this commission operate from? It is important to know that, even though it is only on a three year basis. There are no staffing <Col N="655" /> implications for the Department, I read in the memorandum, and also that this commission will rely mainly on statutory bodies and the engagement of consultants. The setting up of the commission is important because if you get the selection of the commission right at the outset, the end product will be right. Section 3 is the section that requires the greatest thought. Every individual must be screened to ensure that he has the necessary qualifications for the job he is given to do. I would like to know if they will be full time; will they be seconded; part time or whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I absolutely agree with Senator O'Toole that the membership of the commission may well make or break this whole plan and it is essential that they should be the best people available. While I accept the need for expertise, qualifications and so on, I think the Minister could fall too deeply into this situation where one is looking for people who are already so expert in the field that one is appointing what is now the planning establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I accept that Dublin Corporation have done some good things, as a citizen of Dublin I would have to say that there has been a dreadful failure in the proper development of the centre of Dublin city. This is why the Minister is bringing the Bill before us and this is why I welcome the Bill. I suggest that while the Minister must look to people's qualifications, he should beware of the Charybdis on the other side of appointing people who are already part of the establishment which has so singularly failed in the development of Dublin city. While I appreciate that the city manager should be a member of the commission, I feel the Minister should look for people with breadth of imagination and understanding of how the city should be developed as apart from people who have technical expertise. After all, technical expertise can always be got by the commission by appointing consultants, by appointing staff or by looking for particular kinds of technical expertise. What <Col N="656" /> we look for now to try to recover from the terrible situation in the centre of Dublin as it is now with the gap-toothed quays and O'Connell Street a sort of honky-tonk of hamburger joints is somebody with a breadth of imagination that the original wide streets commission had. I would suggest that is the kind of person the Minister should be looking for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways Senator McGuinness has answered the questions Senator O'Toole posed. Perhaps I may stretch out the suggestion a little. It may help the House to understand better how I would envisage the commission working. I am not envisaging that the membership of the commission would be composed of people who would be serving in a remunerated capacity. There is through the normal provisions of other Acts power to pay them reasonable expenses or a stipend, but I would be intending to invite seven people to serve on this commission who will be basically giving a lot of their time and expertise voluntarily on the basis of being members of the commission. In turn, the commission will have a chief executive and I would envisage a very small full time staff. As Senator McGuinness suggested, they would draw on consultants or on the staff and expertise available to them from the corporation to provide the advice and prepare the detailed and technical plans which are necessary. Those would be coordinated through the chief executive and the staff of the commission who would act as a policy making body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole envisaged that the members of the commission might be acting on a day to day basis in an executive as well as policy making role. My purpose in setting up the commission in this way was to establish the commission as being the overall policy makers with a degree of imagination and style as they approach the question of what needed to be done and that the expertise whether architectural or engineering or from whatever other discipline, would be provided either on a bought in basis through consultancies or from the various statutory bodies including the corporation. It <Col N="657" /> is important that it should be done in this way and that the commission should have a relatively small staff, bearing in mind the duration of the life of the commission of three years. It would not be right to build up a large staff which would then have to be either absorbed into the corporation or in some way dispensed with.</P>
    <P>Perhaps my thinking in that regard was influenced to some extent by my former occupation in another Department. When bodies are being set up with a limited lifetime, one should recognise that in the approach to the staffing arrangements. That is why I envisage that most of the administrative and executive work would be carried out on the basis of bought in expertise and that the members of the commission would act in a policy making role. Basically we are talking about inviting seven people who would have to give, of their own time to a great extent, and who will do it because of their commitment to and their love of the city rather than on the basis of monetary reward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask one question. A question was put as regards a member of the commission being the city manager. While the Minister is agreeing with that, I would question it. I presume the chief executive will be the chairman; could that be clarified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Knowing the Minister, he would reply in that way. If there is to be a chief executive and if there is to be a chairman I do not see why we must consider&mdash;the impression might be there &mdash; that the manager of Dublin Corporation might be the chairman. I would not like that. We are talking about a great deal of money being spent in four or five streets and a lot of restructuring is required. Because of their mistakes at planning level, people would be prepared to spend somebody else's money because they knew they did the wrong thing in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="658" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would not like the discussion or these remarks to be interpreted as being in any way a slight on any person. May I point out to the House that immediately this gives an example of the difficulty which arises when a person is mooted for membership of a body before the body is discussed in the House? We are now beginning to talk about the particular role of the one person I did suggest. I do not want to appear to be critical of the Dublin City Manager. I have known him personally for a number of years and his contribution to the life of the city has been considerable. For that reason I felt it was appropriate that he should serve on the body.</P>
      <P>I do not intend it and I do not think the city manager would expect to be chairman of the streets commission. It is appropriate that he should be a member of it so as to provide the link I referred to earlier. From the chairman one will have to ask and expect an additional contribution in terms of time and personal commitment. I do not think the demands of the job of chairman of this commission would be such that the city manager would be able to afford that amount of time, given his other responsibilities. Knowing him I am sure he will feel the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also point out to the House, as a practical example, that I have already announced we intend that a very eminent architect who has a particular interest in and expertise on the question of streetscapes and urban landscapes and a sensitive approach to the question of urban renewal and restoration will be appointed as consultant architect to the commission. The choice involves a husband and wife team who have already made a significant contribution to the improvement of streetscapes and urban facades in many parts of Ireland. They acted as consultants very successfully to the city of Kilkenny which I am sure the House will agree has steadily and spectacularly improved recently in its appearance. They have also acted as consultants to Waterford Corporation. They have been involved in the publication of a book on <Col N="659" /> the appearance of Irish towns and have also acted in an advisory capacity in the judging of the Bord Fáilte Tidy Towns competition. Their personal commitment to the entire concept of urban renewal is very deep. Because of the slight hiatus in the arrangements for the establishment of this commission which unfortunately delayed its coming into being for some months, I have actually commissioned that firm to look at the area and consider what might be done in the hope that when the commission are established they will be able to sit down immediately with the commission and give them some of the background knowledge and detail they have managed to assemble over recent months.</P>
    <P>The same architectural practice was commissioned by the traders and business people in Henry St. in Dublin some months ago to carry out a study on that area. That study was tremendously successful and was acclaimed by many people and widely welcomed by the traders. I hope it will have its own effect on the improvement of the streetscape and the appearance of Henry St. It is a similar though much wider and much more important and extensive job that I would hope those consultant architects would be able to do in working with the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the husband and wife team but I will not pursue names on this occasion. We are particularly fortunate that, apart from the experience they have had in the various towns mentioned and spectacularly in Kilkenny and other parts of the country and their role in the Bord Fáilte Tidy Towns competition and so on, they have also been acting in an advisory capacity to the Dublin Corporation Planning Department in relation to streetscapes in connection with the review of the city development plan. They are very much abreast of the problems of dealing with the centre of the city. As the Minister has indicated, they have been doing a particular study in the last number of months and it is good to know they have <Col N="660" /> advanced to that stage so that the work of the commission can take off very quickly when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister I have got some further details of my conception of what this commission will be doing. I understand a voluntary body will be set up and there will be a specifically decision-making commission. My understanding is that the physical work involved will become the responsibility of Dublin Corporation and that after the decisions and planning have taken place the corporation or their staff will undertake the carrying out of the adjustments within the inner city. I would like the Minister to tell me if that will be the position. Is it envisaged that any elected members of Dublin Corporation will be members of this commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I envisage that the physical carrying out of the improvement work will be done in a variety of ways by different bodies including Dublin Corporation depending, as appropriate, on the particular task which is being addressed.</P>
      <P>Senator McGuinness referred to the wide streets commissioners when she spoke earlier on this section. Quite frankly, the best thumbnail description of the members of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission is that they will be the modern day equivalent of the wide streets commissioners. If they are as successful &mdash; as I hope they will be &mdash; they will in turn have as profound an effect on the city centre and life in the city centre as the wide streets commissioners had. I hesitate to remind the House &mdash; but perhaps it is appropriate that I should &mdash; that, when they were established and during part of the time of their operation, the wide streets commissioners did not always receive unanimous support or acclaim for their efforts. Like so many things that happen in this country it was only after their demise that the merit of their work really began to receive the acclaim and praise which it was entitled to expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to whether there would be elected members on the commission or not, I think it might be better if we did not <Col N="661" /> pursue this discussion at this time because what I fear &mdash; and what I feared at the outset and I said so &mdash; is that we would begin to discuss the individual members or the merits of particular people for participation in the commission. I fear that, as the discussion on the section is going on, I am being drawn more and more into the area in which at the outset I thought it was inappropriate that the Minister should become involved. It is probably because of the beguiling nature of Senator O'Toole's western approach that he is managing to coax me bit by bit down a road which I did not intend to set out on in the first place.

      <P>Because of a short period for any development to take place &mdash; I believe three years is a very short period for the completion of any work &mdash; the work will only be put in train at the time of the dissolution of this commission. Most of the unfinished works will have to be carried out by Dublin Corporation at that time. They will be accepting responsibility for that and they will also be accepting responsibilities for any legal problems that are in train at the time of the dissolution. I was anxious that Dublin Corporation would have membership of the board at the outset under section 3 involving planning matters. As far as I can gather if a planning matter comes up during the commission's period of three years, a decision will be taken on that planning matter by the commission and not the planning authority of Dublin Corporation. I would like to hear <Col N="662" /> from the Minister if the unfinished work will be taken over by the corporation, if the legal problems that are in train at that time will be taken over by the corporation. Will the planning authority of Dublin Corporation cease to exist during the period of three years for the new planning proposals that will be coming up during the three year period? If I am a resident in that particular scheduled area, do I apply to the corporation for planning, or do I apply to this commission? It seems a bit vague. I would like the Minister to clarify the position in connection with the unfinished work, the legal aspects and the planning.</P>

      <P>The first point was raised by the Acting Chairman in relation to subsection (2). That subsection provides that a dissolution order &ldquo;shall contain such provisions as the Minister considers necesary&rdquo; and it goes on to say &ldquo;... and, in particular, may make provision for...&rdquo; The section is allowing the Minister to make the necessary arrangements for the appropriate transfer of the various rights and liabilities of the commission at the time of dissolution to the appropriate bodies. The question Senator Cregan was addressing was the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. That is simply a matter of drafting and it was considered by the parliamentary draftsman that phrasing was the most appropriate. It is, of course, the intention that whatever property, rights or liabilities the commission would retain at the time of dissolution would all have to be transferred to the appropriate bodies so as to allow for the proper winding up of the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised a very interesting point as to whether a three year time span is the appropriate one. When we came to consider the setting up of the commission, various time scales were considered, including a longer time scale than the one now envisaged. As I said during the Second Stage debate on this Bill in this House, I am a firm believer that when establishing a body it should be given a target and a completion date for its work because I have a great fear <Col N="663" />&mdash; perhaps it is due to the experience of almost 20 years in public life &mdash; that when an organisation is established that does not have a definite period established for it at that time, it can sometimes be very slow in the initial period in setting about its work, feeling that it can have time to consider and ponder and get about to making decisions and implementing those decisions at some time in the future. Usually, those are the bodies that have been least successful and that have not received the gratitude of the public or perhaps those who established them by the time they eventually meandered to the conclusion of their activities.</P>
    <P>In general when a single-function body is set up such as this it should be given a reasonable target time to carry out its work and a reasonable budget to do its work. In all the circumstances this target time is the most appropriate. I was also influenced by the fact, which was adverted to by the Senator and some of his colleagues during the Second Stage debate, that the functions of the commission are functions which can be carried out and then assigned back to the corporation. I wanted the commission to have completed their work during the lifetime of the present corporation so that they would have returned to them the completed work of the commission.</P>
    <P>The Senator will recall that some of his colleagues were, perhaps, a little upset at the fact that the area to be covered by the commission was being removed from the jurisdiction of Dublin Corporation. One of the points which weighed with me in deciding on the lifetime of the commission was that it should be a lifetime less than the lifetime of the current corporation so that their work is returned to the current corporation during their lifetime for their administration. The time scale involved means that from the outset the membership of the commission will have to realise that they must make decisions and they must set about implementing those decisions so that they can have their work completed on the basis of the targets which they set for themselves.</P>
    <P>I would, of course, be very concerned <Col N="664" /> if, at the time the commission were being dissolved, there were heavy outstanding liabilities which would have to be assigned to the corporation. That is certainly not the intention. Indeed, I would have to say it would be very unfair to the corporation if they were to have returned to them improvement works with a heavy outstanding amount of liability for one reason or another. It is not at all the intention that that should happen. I refer the House to the powers which I have under section 10(8) and 12(4) to give certain directions to the commission during their lifetime. I envisage that those powers will be used, for instance, particularly in the last of the three years, to ensure that the commission did not take on potential liabilities which would have to pass on to the corporation, as I say, unfairly.</P>
    <P>I would also have to say I think it would be very remiss of the commission and not at all in the spirit of the reasons for their establishment if they were to embark on such an &mdash; one would almost have to say &mdash; irresponsible course of action in the last year as to build up an enormous amount of bills which would have to be passed to Dublin Corporation. Although I am very hesitant to reopen the conversation, if I can remind the House, the presence of the Dublin city manager as a member of the commission would have its own steadying effect in that regard. I would envisage that the controlling influence of the Minister's directions under sections 10 (8) and 12 (4) should be used to ensure that did not arise.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also asked about the arrangements regarding the making of planning applications by individuals or businesses living in or operating within the area to be covered by the commission. That is specifically dealt with in section 6 and if we wait until we reach that section it might be more appropriate.</P>

      <P>The section says that the commission will secure by every practical means an improvement of the area. On this side of the House, we welcome any improvement in the scheduled area mentioned in the Bill. Let it not be construed in any other way: it was the method by which you were to go about that development that we were opposing. I personally oppose the non-involvement of the elected members. That was the main thrust of our opposition to this Bill. We are all interested in the further development of the inner portion of the city to make it more beautiful and encourage people to revert to the old time custom of coming into the centre of Dublin city from the outer part of the city to admire its beauty and architectural merit. We hoped that we would go back to those good old days mentioned by the Minister and others in the Second Stage speeches.</P>
      <P>I want to clarify that point on section 5. We would much prefer the whole geographically integrated area of Dublin city included in the plan and we would also welcome an application from this Government to Brussels for grant-aid for the development of the whole integrated area of Dublin city. With the financial constraints which we have, an application should be made by this Government to Brussels to get a sizeable amount of money &mdash; it will take a sizeable amount of money &mdash; for the development of the whole city. I feel we should be making such an approach to develop Dublin as a whole rather than the sectional centre that is envisaged under this Bill.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question on this section? The commission are asked to secure by every practical means an improvement in environmental conditions. Is the Minister saying we should say to people that for a general improvement in the environment and in their buildings and streets, they are allowed to give grants? Or are the commission allowed to say to people within the area that they are prepared to give grants? I see this area as being very important because the commission could be seen <Col N="666" /> to be doing everything themselves. By giving example and a little bit of help we find &mdash; I certainly see it &mdash; that people are prepared to do a lot more themselves. Have the commission the right to give the grants or create a situation where a certain amount of money is given to people within the specific area for general improvement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the last point first, grant-aid is not specifically provided for in the Bill, because whilst £10 million may be considered a very generous amount of money at the same time it could very quickly become dissipated if there were to be a specific management provided for in the Statute. I also worry that it might turn the minds of the members of the commission more towards the idea of a large scale development rather than that they can spend the money on the physical improvement of the street lighting, furniture and the street design.</P>
      <P>We have already got a clear indication that a number of property owners would be more than anxious and ready to respond in spending quite large sums of money on their own property and on the restoration and renovation particularly of those properties and that improvement of the whole area will generally come about. This is not to say, however, that in the actual disbursement of the £10 million loan for three years the commission might not from time to time for some particular reason feel that an unusually expensive work should be undertaken and they would have discretionary power to do that. I want to emphasise that it is not intended that a large part of the funds of the commission should be sent on grant-aiding private property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators seem to have reservations in relation to this proposal. While I find the reservation understandable, I find it difficult to comprehend that the Senator's party have this difficulty. Some legislation passed through this House and the Dáil six or seven months ago giving to the corporation the right to have certain areas designated. Under the provisions of the Finance Acts, certain provisions were <Col N="667" /> made in regard to tax incentives. During the course of that urban renewal programme the opposition Party in the Dáil tabled an amendment to the Bill which would have given me, as Minister, power to set up a series of special authorities for development purposes for whatever reason I chose, at whatever time I wanted, or in whatever part of the country I wanted for whatever purpose. The Minister of State handled the Bill in the House and, had I known what was going to happen a month later, I would have urged him strenuously to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>If the amendment had been accepted, this Bill would not have been necessary because I could have established this authority under the amendment proposed by Deputy R. Burke in the other House. I could have given them wider powers or had them operate in a wider area. I was interested to read some of the things the Deputy said advocating his proposal. He said he did not find the Urban Renewal Bill itself to be antidemocratic but that it supported the democratic procedure and gave extra powers. I do not understand why there has been now or, indeed, within a month of that proposal a change of heart on the part of the Opposition. They moved from suggesting giving discretionary powers to the Minister for the Environment to establish authorities for development purposes. In pursuit of that suggestion the Deputy actually made the point that very often the officials of the local authorities involved were so busy with their day to day activities that they were not able to concentrate their resources on spotlighting areas in need of redevelopment and regeneration.</P>
    <P>That is precisely what this Bill recognises and why we have gone about the task in this way. We did not accept the amendment at the time because we felt it was more appropriate, if the Government believed there was a need for special function authorities, that they should seek to have them set up by way of a Bill being introduced, debated and then accepted by the Houses of the <Col N="668" /> Oireachtas. That is the course of action we have taken in relation to this Bill. Had we accepted that proposal at that time, this Bill would not be necessary and the Senator and his colleagues would not have had the opportunity to express their reservations. Those reservations would have been set aside through that Fianna Fáil amendment.</P>
    <P>Senators will know that, on a number of occasions in recent months, I have expressed my frustration at trying to establish the reason for the opposition to this Bill. Perhaps now that I have explained the background, Senators will understand why I felt that frustration. I should like to take this opportunity to say that, in general, the contributions made by the House last week in the Second Stage debate were reasonable. I appreciate in particular Senator O'Toole's support for the general concept outlined in section 5 as to what the commission might do.</P>

      <P>Section 6 (7) refers to the consent of the commission. There is also the planning authority. I would like to know from the Minister do we make the applications in the three year period to the commission or to the planning authority. Who will decide on the planning applications over the three year period? In the event of an appeal, will the same machinery obtain which obtains now under Dublin Corporation? I see that all development which is consistent with the scheme prepared will be regarded as exempted development. I understand from that that, if the commission decide on a particular plan and it is consistent with their proposed development plan or scheme, it will not require any planning permission. The Minister has had a change of heart. The Minister is giving the commission the right to be planners while reference is made on the one hand to the consent of <Col N="669" /> the commission and also to the planning authority. If the Minister's proposed schemes are excluded as exempted development, that will mean they will not require planning permission. On the one hand it is stated that the consent of both the planning authority and the commission will be needed while, on the other hand, it is said that if a scheme is designed and proposed by the commission it is exempted development. I would like the Minister to clarify what the position will be with regard to new applications coming onstream during the period of the commission.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that generally the impression is that the Bill provides for improvements to the environment? Is the Minister saying we are not pushing to get people back into the centre of Dublin? Is the Minister saying the commission have no right to say that people should be encouraged to come back into the centre? Have the commission the right to create a situation where people will be recompensed for coming back into the city centre? Are we to say we cannot talk to Dublin Corporation or to the Department of the Environment about giving people encouragement to go elsewhere at this time with certain grants? Are we to give them the same opportunity to come back into Dublin centre? Have the commission the right to say that? Can the Commission asked somebody else to say: &ldquo;If we provide accommodation for these people, will they get the same grants for moving out of the city?</P>
      <P>I see a golden opportunity here for the commission to get people back into the centre. People are needed in them all the time. Lights are needed upstairs. Have the commission the right to say that they may be thinking this way? It is important to the whole area that there should be lights on when everybody else has gone home from offices and shops. Do we encourage them to go back in there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Senator O'Toole, basically the commission will prepare an improvement <Col N="670" /> scheme for the general area. Having prepared that scheme, they will then consult with Dublin Corporation and Dublin Transport Authority. Afterwards, the scheme will be submitted to the Minister for approval and a copy of it sent to the corporation, as the Senator will see in section 6 (3). The Minister can the consider any objections made by the corporation and can order appropriate modifications. This provides for two situations. If a proposal is then made for a development which is in accordance with the improvement scheme prepared by the commission after consultation with the corporation and the transport authority and if it is approved by the Minister a person then applying to carry out a development that is totally in conformity with that scheme would be in a position to do so without seeking planning permission. If, on the other hand, there was not an improvement scheme, or if the application was to do something which was not in conformity with the improvements scheme, the person would then apply in the normal way to Dublin Corporation for planning permission. The section then imposes an obligation on the corporation to take cognisance of the scheme in deciding on the application.</P>
      <P>Perhaps if I gave an example it might help the House to understand what is envisaged. A section of an improvements scheme envisaged the large scale restoration of a streetscape such as a facade or perhaps six or ten shopfronts with the storeys overhead. If one of the property owners then proposed to remove some of the additions to the frontage that had been put on over the years in order to restore the entire frontage and facade to its original architectural concept and to bring it into line with the proposal in the improvements scheme outlined for that block of property by the commission, that property owners would be in a position to go ahead without applying for planning permission. Essentially, the planning of the project would have been done by the commission in the course of preparing the improvements scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the commission had prepared an improvements scheme <Col N="671" /> of that nature, suggesting a particular architectural treatment of the block of six or ten properties, the property owner wanted to carry out a redevelopment that was very much at variance with that concept, such person, of course, would have to apply for permission to Dublin Corporation. The corporation, in deciding on the application, would be obliged to take into account the improvements scheme that had been prepared by the commission. The intention of that would be to ensure that the development would be compatible with the overall objective for the improvement of that area as outlined by the commission. Such a person would not easily get permission from the corporation. I hope, through the example I have given, that I have helped to give the House a picture of how it is envisaged that this dual function would operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I wish to make in relation to this section. First, I wish to speak on the general preparation of a plan by the commission and the role which the commission will be taking in relation to individual applications for reconstruction and restoration within the defined area of the commission's responsibility. The Minister will readily agree that one of the great problems in O'Connell Street recently has been the fact that, instead of a street made up largely of small units, there has been a development into very large department stores on a very wide street, thus losing the intimacy between shops and, indeed, between both sides of the street. The scale of the likely type of architectural standards the commission might have in mind is important. We should try to bring the scale down to a size which is appropriate to that street. Obviously the expert architectural advisers are better equipped to comment on that than I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest problems that has faced the city in the period in which I have been a member of Dublin Corporation&mdash; which goes back some 12 years&mdash;is the fact that, while very often the right <Col N="672" /> decision is taken on the particular application, looking at the merits of the application both in terms of design and the detail of what is proposed, sometimes the planners seem to forget about the effect of the proposal on the street in question. In other words buildings are being put into a part of a street which are totally out of character with the street itself. Obviously, that goes back to the original point I was making. We have to get the architectural concept right. I bow to the expertise of the architectural consultant who will advise on this.</P>
    <P>The other point I wanted to make relates to what Senator Cregan was saying a moment ago about the theme of the living city. I said in my Second Stage speech&mdash;the Minister was not fortunate enough, or otherwise, to be here for it&mdash; that very few people reside in this area. The area we are talking about is largely a place of commercial use.</P>
    <P>There is something that should be looked at by the Minister in the context of a much wider problem affecting retail streets in towns and cities throughout this country. It follows on the legacy of rent control. I speak with some experience in this area. Many shopowners have ignored using the upstairs portion of their buildings. They could get an income from upstairs and that might keep the building in better shape. No building is better able to survive than the building that is occupied. Some owners have ignored taking that option of using the building because of the fear of rent control. Rent control should no longer concern them. There is an immense amount of potential residential accommodation available over shops, in streets, in trading areas and in retail areas throughout the country. It is not being used because of this fear of rent control, which could be put to rest by the Minister or his Department getting involved in a public relations exercise which would explain the up-to-date position to people who were always in and out looking for advice from their solicitors in relation to this matter. If the Minister takes the trouble &mdash; as I am sure he has because I know he is concerned for the <Col N="673" /> environment&mdash;to look at the upper storeys of houses in trading areas in other cities outside this country, he will see a marked difference in the use of upper storeys of buildings in trading streets. I remember about ten years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not, perhaps, deal sufficiently with the point made by Senator Cregan regarding the need to encourage the highest possible amount of residential usage of inner city areas. I am not sure whether the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission are the most appropriate vehicle to achieve that quite admirable objective. A number of good inner city infill housing schemes have been carried out by Dublin Corporation in recent years. Between Gardiner Street and O'Connell Street there is a very fine estate of Dublin Corporation new housing, which Members of the House may be aware of. It is within 100 years of O'Connell Street. The activities of the commission in the area I have mentioned, if they are successful, will help to encourage the entire concept of inner city living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to consider the objectives of this Bill in conjunction with the designated areas for urban renewal which I mentioned in connection with another section and which, in the case of Dublin, are immediately contiguous to the areas being covered by the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission. As the House will remember, there are very attractive incentives contained both in the Urban Renewal Act and in the Finance Act to encourage residential living in those areas which are known as the designed areas for Dublin and the other cities. It could be argued that the areas covered in the designated areas are the more appropriate ones to encourage <Col N="674" /> residential infill development than the particular streets covered by the commission.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty regarding the upper storeys of accommodation generally in urban areas and in relation to the premises in the metropolitan streets area. It is a much wider one than specifically just the remit of this commission.  I agree with Senator FitzGerald that it is something that merits particular attention. The situation may have evolved in Ireland for a variety of factors. Originally, it may have evolved for security reasons and nowadays the cost of insurance may be a factor. There are conflicting reasons, some of which ought not to be in conflict. One would have thought it might have been easier to secure insurance and security by having people living overhead. Sometimes it is considered to be quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>One of the areas for urban renewal that will have to be looked at, and not just in the context of inner city Dublin but in relation to urban areas generally, is the question of how to encourage people back into living inside towns and urban centres in general. It may be that there is a specific role for local authorities in this regard. It may be that, apart from trying to identify suitable sites for the building of and the provision of infill local authority housing, perhaps the local authority should be looking at the possibility of either acquiring or renting upper floor accommodation in inner cities which could be refurbished, so providing very attractive flat or apartment accommodation for people who have a desire to live in those areas.</P>
    <P>The most important thing is that, through what we are endeavouring to do by the work of this commission and what we hope will be achieved through the incentives set out in the urban renewal scheme, the entire centre of Dublin will become regenerated and alive again. It will become an area where people go to visit, not because they have to but because they want to. Then automatically and naturally a certain number of people will move into and identify suitable <Col N="675" /> accommodation and refurbish it themselves. Part of what we are doing today &mdash; although it is not a specific objective set out for the commission&mdash;will bring about a greater usage on a residential basis of our inner cities and towns.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out by Senators, it is a much wider question than is provided for in this section or in this Bill. It is a question which is very interesting. We should be considering now how to make our urban areas living units on a 24 hour basis rather than just during business hours as, unfortunately, so many urban areas have become.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be disappointed to think we have set up a commission with a very good imagination and at the same time have to say we are not prepared to consider the idea. I am not saying the Minister said they are not prepared to consider it. I do not want to give the impression that we are talking about infill housing. There is a vast difference between infill accommodation and infill housing. At the same time, there is an opportunity here. The commission can show example if they are prepared to say some infill accommodation can be provided. Given the opportunity and the good will of the Minister and the Government a situation can be created in which people will recognise the opportunities being afforded to them. I am sure there are many people who are prepared to go back into city living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read no later than one month ago that in London people are paying a lot of money to live in the city centre. People who were living on the outskirts have now gone back into the city and are paying a lot of money to be accommodated there. However, the commission should stress that they want people back in centre city areas because people are needed there. People must be seen to have their little paths and windows there. That is important. There should be an opportunity for two brothers, or a husband and wife, or two sisters or a sister and two brothers, and so on, to live in the inner city. I see <Col N="676" /> no reason why the commission should not show the example. It would be a pity if they did otherwise.</P>

      <P>This transfers the functions of Dublin Corporation in relation to the construction, maintenance and improvement of public roads and any other functions incidental thereto under the Local Government Acts, 1925 to 1985, the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1984 and under any other enactment to the Commission in so far as they apply to the metropolitan central area.</P>
      <P>I could see that, when a plan was drafted by the commission for the improvement of roads within the metropolitan city area, it would be necessary to consult with the corporation and say to the corporation: &ldquo;This is the scheme we want you to carry out:&rdquo; I can see the engineers in the local saying to themselves: &ldquo;Now that the commission have been set up we have no more responsibility for three years for the inner roads of the Dublin central area.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Suppose there is a breakdown in the surface of a section of road within the corporation area, or the scheduled area, will the commission be saying from day to day to Dublin Corporation: &ldquo;There is a portion of road at the top of O'Connell Street broken up and buses have refused to go on that route. Will you get your staff in there immediately and get it repaired?&rdquo; Will there by this type of confusion between the corporation engineering and maintenance staff and the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would not arise at all until such time as the scheme from the commission was drafted and then they would say to Dublin Corporation: &ldquo;We want you to carry out resurfacing of all O'Connell Street from the Garden of Remembrance to O'Connell Bridge and we want it resurfaced on the other side as well.&rdquo; All this <Col N="677" /> work will have to be carried out by the corporation. The Bill states: &ldquo;shall stand transferred to the Commission&rdquo;. It refers to all the functions of Dublin Corporation in relation to transfer of road functions and so on. That is the bit I think is not necessary. You will still have to have the corporation and their staff to carry out the works on any given route within the area and they will have to be responsible and be there at all times.</P>
    <P>I fear that the corporation might say that they no longer have any responsibility for that area and that they will not take part in it until the commission come back to them and say they require this that or the other. It may be necessary for other reasons to stipulate that the functions of Dublin Corporation will cease but I think the ordinary day to day running and maintenance of routes within the Dublin central area will still have to be carried out by the staff of the corporation and they will have to be on hand at all times to ensure that heavy traffic areas will be given continuing maintenance supervision and they will have to be responsible.</P>
    <P>The Bill is providing that the corporation will cease to be responsible from now on. It does not state whether they will be responsible or not. I would like to ask the Minister will their activities cease and will the engineers say they will not do anything until they get information or a direction from the commission. I want that clarified.</P>

      <P>I direct the attention of the House, and particularly Senator O'Toole, to section 16(2) which enables the Minister to bring the Act or part of the Act into being on a particular day or days and to make an order or orders as to when particular parts of it will come into effect. Obviously, when the commission are established on day one it would not be the intention, for instance, to implement the provisions of section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may, perhaps, try to illustrate the reason for this section by way of an example. The House will probably remember that I spoke last week about <Col N="678" /> the central mall in O'Connell Street and said I regarded it as being vital to the success of the entire improvement scheme for the O'Connell Street area. The street itself in its entirety is 148 to 150 feet wide, and when the wide streets commissioners originally laid it out they envisaged that the central mall would be 148 or 150 feet in width throughout the entire length of the street. As the House will know, that area now varies extraordinarily in size and has been encroached on for various reasons.</P>
    <P>I will be disappointed if the commission do not decide to pay particular attention to that central mall and carry out a scheme to have it widened to some agreed width on a uniform basis for its entire length and then carry out intensive development of the central mall by the planting of flowers, shrubs, the provision of street furniture, possibly the provision of some type of cafes or restaurants and shopping kiosks.</P>
    <P>In relation to the pavements in O'Connell Street, for instance, kiosks might be provided for the sale of newspapers and periodicals rather than the present arrangements. The footpaths themselves should get particular attention and treatment so that they would be attractively reinstated by way of paving slabs. It would almost certainly be a conclusion of the commission that particular parts of the area to be covered might well be pedestrianised.</P>
    <P>What we have not given any attention to so far in our discussions is the fact that, apart from the central spine, as it were, to be covered from the top of Grafton Street to the bottom of O'Connell Street, we are also including some of the streets abutting that area for some 50 or 80 years in length. It may be decided that some of the streets abutting Grafton Street might be more permanently pedestrianised than they are at present. I am giving those as examples. I am not suggesting that any of those things will specifically happen, but for the commission to make these decisions and set about that work they need the power contained in section 7. When they would need to take on that power can be regulated by section 16 <Col N="679" /> (2). Until that comes about the road and footpath surfaces would, of course, continue to be maintained by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Toole suggested, it is also quite likely that, if the commission decided to carry out some rebuilding or altering of the physical condition of some of the roads or footpaths, it might very well be that, although the power would by then have been assigned to them by section 7, they would use the corporation on an agency basis to actually carry out the work on their behalf.</P>

      <P>A problem arises here in relation to taxi ranks, bus stops, pedestrian crossings and the removal of signs. If the commission feel that the removal of a sign or a number of signs is unauthorised development or that a sign was not in keeping with the commission's proposal, have they the right to declare that sign unauthorised development? Does the Minister envisage that major distortions of taxi ranks, bus stops and pedestrian crossings are put in as part of the Bill so that, in the event of the commission deciding on the alteration of the location of bus stops, pedestrian crossings and taxi ranks, if they are in a particular part of the scheduled area they will be in opposition to further development and will be removed only on that basis rather than on the basis of a general complete overhauling of the taxi ranks, bus stops and pedestrian crossings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that were the case there would be a big distortion. There would be great confusion and they would be back to the corporation for their physical removal and replacement. It would alter the statistical documentation in connection with the commission's programming for an area. I would like the Minister to say if he envisages any major changes in connection with taxi ranks, bus stops and <Col N="680" /> pedestrian crossings, and if the removal of a sign is one that the commission deem to be unauthorised. I will leave it until we come to the appropriate section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt there are likely to be major changes in relation to traffic management generally in the area to be administered by the commission. One of the primary objectives of setting up the commission is to encourage far greater pedestrian usage of the main streets to be covered by the commission. For example, Grafton Street has been regarded as a pedestrian street for 19 years and yet it is still used for traffic purposes, ostensibly on a one-way basis, though I gather from complaints on a two-way basis from a certain hour each evening. I do not think that is satisfactory. I do not think one can try to secure on overall pedestrianised scheme for a street like Grafton Street if every few years, because of other road improvement works being carried out somewhere else, the street is converted back into a traffic street; or if one decides to operate the street as a pedestrianised street for part of the day and then convert it again in the evening.</P>
      <P>I am endeavouring to pre-guess what conclusions the commission may come to having studied the matter. If decisions are made regarding pedestrianisation they will almost certainly be decisions which will require pedestrianisation of a permanent nature. If Senators reflect on cities in other countries which they may have visited with large scale and successful pedestrianised areas, they will appreciate it is because those areas are built and equipped in a way which takes on board the concept of permanent pedestrianisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fundamental objective in relation to O'Connell Street must be that a much heavier volume of pedestrian use the street and use it not just because they have to, or because they go there to carry out business or official functions: they use the street much more for enjoyment. Part of what I envisaged for the improvement <Col N="681" /> of O'Connell Street is that, in conjunction with the development of the central mall, there would be such things as additional sculptures, fountains, some band or orchestral recitals, open air theatre, outdoor events organised for evening time designed to encourage more people to use the street for enjoyment, enjoying the street and the ambience of the street. To do that will definitely require major re-organisation of the traffic flow and traffic management.</P>
    <P>I have said publicly that I see no justification for heavy goods vehicles using the principal street of our principal city. One of the first things the commission would have to look at would be a prohibition on heavy goods vehicles using the street. If the ultimate objective of what I have been trying to outline to the House is arrived at, almost certainly you may have to move to a regime in which delivery vehicles would be required to make their deliveries before a certain hour in the morning or perhaps after a certain hour in the evening. Many of us will have come across this practice in other cities which are much more pleasant to move around in. Plans such as we are now discussing have been considered in those cities and have been implemented.</P>
    <P>If the central mall is to become an integral part of the use and enjoyment of O'Connell Street, that will have implications for some of the taxi vehicles but, on the other hand, it is necessary to ensure that taxi ranks are provided as conveniently as possible for the taxi operators and the public because, if more people use the street, there will be a far greater need for taxis. The commission will need to identify how taxi ranks can not only be improved but additional taxis accommodated to provide for the additional business which we hope would be generated through the success of the commission's efforts.</P>
    <P>In all of that it has to be decided how the public transport system best fits in. One of the things about using a street like this is that one will have to consider the noise level and the scale of traffic using <Col N="682" /> the street. Pedestrians are prepared to tolerate only a certain level of traffic noise and certain volumes of traffic before they feel the traffic is the primary presence in the street and that their function there is to do their business and get away from it as quickly as possible. The commission will have to take those things into account in conjunction with the Commissioner of the Garda and the Dublin Transport Authority who will be taking over some of the functions we have traditionally associated with either the Commissioner or Dublin Corporation. They would have been transferred this month to the new Dublin Transport Authority but instead they are being temporarily transferred in relation to the metropolitan Dublin area to the Metropolitan Streets Commission.</P>
    <P>I will refer to something I intended to mention earlier which may help senators to get a better picture of the concept. There are many different disciplines and areas of expertise which the commission will need to draw on to get advice as to how to do particular things. Somebody who has great talent in the architectural sphere would have no particular advice to offer on traffic management. The commission will have to draw on a wide range of areas in order to get the expertise necessary to make the right decisions. I hope that as well as the commission being established there will be established an advisory committee who could be much larger in size than the seven person commission being envisaged, and the advisory committee could have people from the various disciplines who would be able to help by giving advice. For instance, on the advisory committee there might be representatives of CIE and the Garda and businesses using the city centre area.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Garda fundamental to the success of the scheme is the question of security. That has been emphasised by everybody with whom I have spoken about the proposal. One of the things we have looked at which will get the attention of the commission is the concept of there being built in Grafton Street, Westmoreland Street and O'Connell Street kiosks which would be, in <Col N="683" /> effect, Garda sub-stations, small Garda offices from which these streets would be patrolled and policed. Then there would be a visible, permanent Garda presence in these streets. It is vital to the success of the scheme provided for in the Bill that there would be a clearly visible level of security so that people will feel secure.</P>

      <P>The same would apply in regard to the removal of refuse. It is mainly in central areas that we envisage that the Litter Act, 1982, would be in full force to improve the cleanliness and the general appearance of the centre of Dublin. Some delivery vehicles can create a very unsightly look. This is one Act that will have to be put into effect immediately. We would like to see that Act put into effect in regard to local authorities in general but, because of finances and staff problems in counties such as Mayo and other large counties, there is not full implementation of the 1982 Litter Act. I suggest that in this small portion of Dublin city at least the 1982 Litter Act should be put fully into effect. It is very important if we are to have the centre as a showpiece for the rest of the city and country.</P>
      <P>Anything the commission can do through transferring responsibility and giving a trial spin of how they would plan the prevention and control of litter within that area should be done. The physical removal of litter from the city will have to be the responsibility of the corporation and their staff. I ask the Minister for a comment in connection with the removal of litter. As the Minister said he could see the commission as a voluntary organisation with a very small staff, the removal of litter would have to be carried out by the corporation.</P>

      <P>I do not envy the commission their task in trying to bring <Col N="684" /> a new standard of cleanliness to the streets in the centre of the city, or elsewhere should their remit be extended. The problem is not entirely the fault of the large staff of 700 odd men involved in the cleansing staff of Dublin Corporation. They are working against the unhygienic attitude of so many Irish people in the way they behave in relation to litter: they drop almost anything they like in the streets and public parks.</P>
      <P>Two aspects strike me here. First of all, I do not know whether the Minister has been in Fleet Street recently which is not too far from the area which will be the remit of the commission. Over a period of years, CIE buses have developed an inch deep of oil and this has embedded itself in the surface of the street. The commission will have to deal with Córas Iompair Éirann and the way they behave in relation to the maintenance of their bus fleet and the generally stickly condition of many of the pavements in retail areas, outside shops and so on. We have not used water sufficiently to spray down pavements in areas which get a lot of pedestrian use. When we have a superfluity of water generally, except in the last six weeks or so, we should use water much more frequently to spray down pavements and road surfaces. We have equipment which goes along the gullies and does a limited job there, but there could be much more extensive use of water in the cleaning of our streets and pavements. It is available to us. It is a resource we do not seem to use but it is used elsewhere: the brilliance of pavements in other cities compared to here is something I know other Members of this House and the Minister will accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points made by the Senators. There has been a very uneven application of the 1982 Litter Act by the local authorities throughout the country. Only a minority of local authorities have made by-laws under the 1982 Act. When Senator O'Toole suggests that the provisions of that Act should be applied in full in this area, he is asking for something which certainly will be done by the commission. I can only take this <Col N="685" /> opportunity to appeal that it should be done by the local authorities throughout the country. I do not want to get involved in contention in this matter. One of the local authorities who have not adopted by-laws under the 1982 Litter Act are Dublin Corporation. Without pursuing it any further, perhaps that is one of the examples of why I was led to the conclusion. The last anti-litter by-laws adopted by Dublin Corporation were adopted on 11 February 1938. While there is provision for the commission to take over the corporation's powers under the Public Health Act, 1878, the last by-laws made by Dublin Corporation referred to the cleansing of footways and pavements, the removal of snow, dust, ashes, rubbish, silt and house refuse, the cleansing of earth closets, privies, ashpits, cesspools and dustbins. They were made by the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and burgesses of Dublin and adopted by them on 5 June 1899.</P>
      <P>Though it is correct to say the general public are not as tidy a people as we might hope, very often I am not sure that we as public authorities have really pursued the question as we should. On the other hand, no authority have more problems than Dublin Corporation in this regard because of the sheer size of the area they have to cover in population terms and because many people come from outside the area to use the city centre as it is our capital city. I agree with Senator FitzGerald. It is not enough that the area should merely be swept free of litter. The streets must be washed. Equipment is now available to public authorities which washes and cleans the pavements and the streets. When the commission go into operation, I hope that not only will the streets be free of rubbish, but that the footpaths will be cleansed of the grime which has build up and is layered upon them on a 24 hours basis. When anybody goes into the area covered by the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, they should see activity carried out to keep the street area to the highest possible standard and the best possible appearance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> I invite Members of the House, the next time they walk down Grafton Street, Westmoreland Street and O'Connell Street, to look at the footpaths, not at the litter on them but the condition of them, the way they are stained, the way paving slabs are broken and cracked, and to notice that where for some reason underground work was done in recent years in a set of attractive paving slabs, the paving slabs were removed and replaced by tarmacadam crudely put back in, and to notice that generally kerbstones have broken down. I am not talking about an area in a small town in rural Ireland; I am talking about the area covered by the commission. People moving past in cars or other vehicles do not notice this, but people who walk in the area do.</P>
    <P>I invite Members of the House, the next time they walk through that area, to look at the physical condition of the street and the footpath. Senator FitzGerald has given a very practical example, where because of the constant usage by CIE buses, Fleet Street and other places that have been used as termini for buses in the city centre have now become like an oil skating rink over the years. Incidentally, I might remind the House, that Fleet Street between Westmoreland Street and D'Olier Street and Fleet Street for a distance as it runs in a westerly direction will be covered by the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried about this section. I ask the Minister to clarify it. The Commission may serve a notice for the removal of a structure. Will there be consultation with the residents of an area in connection with the change of use of a business, or where a line of business <Col N="687" /> is traditionally carried out and the commission decide it is no longer suitable for the area and deem it an unauthorised structure? Well-established traditional businesses along the route may be told by the commission that it is no longer appropriate to carry out that business there, and the commission can move in and ask for its removal. Will there be full consultation with the people and the owners of properties and businesses prior to their being deemed unauthorised? If a business or property is deemed unauthorised and if the property owners or the business people fail to cease operating they may be fined up to a maximum of £1,000.</P>
      <P>How can one transfer the expertise built up in an area to another type of operation? These people would not have expertise in another field, but if the commission decide that it is an unauthorised business they are liable to cease the operation of that business, and failure to do so will result in a fine of £1,000. It is possible that the powers of the commission will be pursued in an unfair manner. A consultation process would give people time to think and time to alter their premises to meet the requirements of the commission's proposals. If a business must be altered, will the owner be given enough time to readjust and will he be given help from the commission by way of consultation? Businesses along the route should not be terminated by a ruling of this commission without full consultation with the people. It is not easy to change one's occupation, to adapt from being a florist to being an undertaker for instance. That is the area where I see people's rights being encroached on. There will have to be some shrewd consultation with the property owners before a business can be deemed to be unauthorised. I would like the Minister to elaborate on that in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole is right in saying that the commission in drawing up their plan should allow for as <Col N="688" /> much consultation as possible, particularly at the stage where they are implementing the plan, and they come across areas of removal of either uses or structures that are inappropriate to the area which the Bill encompasses. Although it is important to have consultation the overall interests of the city, indeed of the country, are involved in the central trading streets of Dublin. At some early stage in the commission's formation it is important that they have the authority to get on with their plan design that will signal a new era for the centre of the city.</P>
      <P>The aspect of giving the commission the wherewithal in terms of cash to get on with the job is more important than this section. This section does not deal only with the control of unauthorised uses which the planning authorities are in a position to deal with, through the courts provided they move fast enough. It allows the commission to enter into the business of dealing with structures or uses which have concerned and bedevilled the city planning department and the corporation for a number of years and which have been causing untold damage to the appearance of streets. A cause of real concern has been the gaudy advertising hoardings and features of these streets which really damage the total environment. These new powers which the Minister is giving to the commission under this Bill, are powers he will be asked to give in a planning Bill which will amend the existing Act.</P>
      <P>I hope that, in the very near future, the Minister will consider giving similar powers to the planning authority to deal with the defacement of streets and residential areas by other structures and uses not just in O'Connell Street, Grafton Street, and so on, but in Rathmines and many other parts of this city. These defacements are uncontrollable because a number of years ago they were not dealt with fast enough by the planning department. There was much less appreciation then of the need to tidy up these trading streets than exists at the moment. There is more awareness of the problem now and a desire to get on with it. I welcome the powers in this section.</P>

      <P>The planning authorities have these powers at present in section 36 of the 1963 Planning Act. They have been used very rarely. The cost implications in relation to potential compensation are presumably the reason they have been resorted to only occasionally. This section is largely modelled on sections of the Planning Act and the powers the planning authorities have. A number of the powers in the 1963 Act are utilised very rarely in this case because of the cost implications.</P>
      <P>In relation to the reservations expressed by Senator O'Toole, I suggest section 11 should be read in conjunction with the Second Schedule. The obligation is being placed upon the commission. When they prepare an improvement scheme, if they envisage the discontinuance of the use or the removal of a structure for any reason, the proposal to do that has to be outlined in the improvement scheme. As the house will remember, we discussed earlier the fact that in preparing the improvement scheme there would have to be consultation with Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Transport Authority. The improvement scheme has to have regard to the Dublin development plan then in force. It then has to be sent to the Minister, after consultation with the corporation, for his adoption or modification.</P>
      <P>The schedule also makes arrangements for the commission to consider submissions by interested parties in relation to a scheme. There is quite a wide consultation power envisaged in relation to the preparation of an improvement scheme. When an improvement scheme is being prepared, any proposal for the alteration of usage or the removal of a structure would be included. That power of consultation exists when one reads section 11 in conjunction with the Second Schedule. Paragraph 3 (d) of the Second Schedule refers to the making of submissions by interested persons. In addition to that, the Minister has power under section 19 (8) to give directions of a general nature to the commission on policy in the performance of any of the functions assigned to them under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> If it were found that adequate consultation was not taking place, the Minister would use his powers under section 10 (8). However, when Members of the House read section 11 in conjunction with the Second Schedule they will realise that wider consultative obligations are placed upon the commission than might be immediately apparent when section 11 is read in isolation.</P>

      <P>I am aware of section 36 of the 1963 Act. I led a campaign to ensure that a large porch encompassing the entire frontage of a house at Grosvenor Square was removed. It is the only structure to be removed since 1963 by Dublin Corporation using these powers. The difficulty under that section is that the procedures involved in moving to extinguish a use or deal with a structure that is unsuitable are lengthy. That is one of the reasons the corporation have not been involved in doing enough of this work where structures clearly conflict with the general aesthetic experience of streets or residential areas. I hope the more specific powers contained here can be widened for use by the planning authority generally at a future time.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to be more specific on the apportionment of funds as between Dublin Corporation and the commission. This is another statutory commitment for the corporation. All county councils throughout the country are trying to get rid of statutory commitments. In any given year I can envisage the corporation having to provide a certain sum in their estimates. The provision of this sum will have to be in a vacuum because there will be no identification of the particular levy. I do not know what apportionment will take place over the three year period by the city manager will have to provide a certain figure in his estimates. If that figure is not agreed on by the commission, the Minister has the right and the power to decide what that figure might be for the corporation. The Minister comes into play at a time when there is disagreement. I should like to know the amount of money the manager will be providing in his estimates for this commission. It is stated in the memorandum that it is in lieu of the moneys now being spent by the corporation. I should like the Minister to inform the House the apportionment between the commission and the corporation in this regard. This is very important. As I said at the outset, the corporation will not welcome any further statutory commitment. I should like some elaboration on that apportionment by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The section envisages that the corporation would estimate the amount of money which they would normally spend on items such as road maintenance, public lighting, refuse disposal <Col N="692" /> and litter control. The corporation would be asked by the commission to assess the amount of money which they think they would normally spend on those functions which are temporarily being transferred from them in the area to be covered by the commission. If the commission agree that figure, then that is the amount which would be assigned to the commission for spending by them on similar functions. In the event of any disagreement, as Senator O'Toole has mentioned, the question of the appropriate amount would be established by me, as Minister.</P>
      <P>In this regard I should like to take the opportunity to emphasise this: the commission are being established because I see merit in having a single function, single-purpose type authority to do this work for a designated period, but with the full intention of having the functions then transferred back to the corporation. If the corporation and the commission are unable to agree on the amount of money which the corporation might have spent on carrying out the normal up-keep of the Dublin metropolitan area, any reasonable Minister&mdash; and I hope the House would accept that I would be reasonable in this regard&mdash; would adjudicate fairly as between the conflicting claims of the two bodies in that regard.</P>

In the normal way, as I hope the Senator will appreciate, I would be only too willing to attend in the House at whatever time the House felt was most convenient to it in the ordering of its business but, as things stand at present, I have a commitment to speak in another place tomorrow morning.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any measure to improve the centre of Dublin city. All of us agree that it is a tatty place, with derelict sites, gaudy signs and fast food outlets. There can be a huge improvement in this whole area given the splendour of old Dublin and the vandalism that has taken place by so-called developers and speculators down through the years.</P>
      <P>Whilst improvements are necessary, it is a matter of great sadness and regret for me that the Minister has decided to remove the improvement of the centre of Dublin from the democratically elected corporation who have had responsibility for all such matters down through the years. The Minister in his defence, of course, will say that it is precisely because of the failure of existing authorities to do the work that he is now implementing the Bill. I should like to point out to him that this is not the case. It is due rather to the policies being pursued by the Minister and the Government whereby Dublin Corporation, and all other local authorities, have been starved of the necessary financial resources to carry out and to encourage the type of development which it is hoped will take place.</P>
      <P>Why cannot the Minister make available to Dublin Corporation the resources he proposes to make available to the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission? Why is he afraid to vest in the elected representatives the power to carry out this work and to decide what is best for Dublin city? Is he afraid that because his party have not control in the city council others might have imaginative ideas which would do the job equally as well as this new commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years this administration paid election lip service to the concept of local democracy. They continue to bleat about the need for local government reform and the need to give adequate and proper powers to the local authorities while, at the same time, their efforts through the years belie what they say. For example, they refuse to give power to elected representatives to determine charges. In 1984, they postponed the local elections on the pretext of reformed local government <Col N="695" /> and in 1985 when the elections could not be postponed any further, they brought out a document saying what they proposed to do. Indeed, we are still waiting for the implementation of those proposals.</P>
    <P>The Minister has great panache and I am not saying he should not have it because of the publicity associated with ideas like the one before us in the House today and, indeed, others. Over the past month, we had the &ldquo;Clean up Ireland&rdquo; idea and others. These are very good ideas but the Minister should learn to bring local authority members along with him. He might have a much better chance of getting better results by vesting more powers in elected public representatives. It is still not too late for the Minister to see the error of his ways and to provide Dublin Corporation with the resources to bring the centre of Dublin back to what we all want to see.</P>
    <P>Dublin is after all my capital city just as much as it is the Minister's or anybody's who lives in Dublin. I am very proud of my capital city. I am somewhat sad that the people who have been elected by the people of Dublin have not had an opportunity to become involved in the very core of their own city, the heart of their city, and have a say in the future of that city. I regret this and I regard it as being the sad element and the sad aspect of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with these points in the course of my reply to the Second Stage debate and to some extent during the discussions on various sections earlier today. I refute and do not accept the suggestion that it is anti-democratic or in some way a negation of the normal process to establish single-function, single-purpose authorities to carry out a specific task. It can well be argued that it is difficult to ask a body such as Dublin Corporation, charged as they are, with operating on a multitude of fronts and having a multi-faceted administration, to concentrate their minds exclusively on one particular area and carry out activity <Col N="696" /> in it for an agreed purpose and over a controlled time to achieve an objective. Almost certainly the people involved will have other tasks and responsibilities and they will not be able to give all their time and expertise or concentrate all of their attention in the way that would be required and expected of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.</P>
      <P>This is not a new concept. I mentioned in the House earlier today that the Dublin wide streets commissioners established by Grattan's Parliament had in their day criticism levied at them regarding their activities. It was only after their dissolution that the merits of their work became evident and they were praised. Many of us benefit from that today. In their own way, I believe if the members of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission strive to achieve the objectives I have outlined in the House and which are enshrined in the Bill, they will merit the same gratitude from future generations &mdash; not just of Dubliners but of Irish people &mdash; as do now the wide streets commissioners.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply to the Second Stage debate, the centre of Dublin is the centre of our capital city and Dubliners would regard it as belonging to them in a special way, or have a special affection for it. It means something special and has a definite place in the hearts of most of the people of the country, as Senator Fallon said. Since I published details of this proposal I have been heartened by the level of support which has come from all quarters, including many people who live outside the capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the suggestion that it would be better that these moneys should be assigned to Dublin Corporation or that the corporation are starved of cash, let me say that Dublin Corporation are grant-aided on a variety of fronts on a multi-million pound basis by the Government annually and that the present corporation under existing legislation have been in operation now for almost 100 years. They have been controlled by various groupings at different times. Unfortunately &mdash; and there is no gainsaying the fact and there was no objection to the <Col N="697" /> assertion&mdash; the centre of Dublin city has steadily declined in significance, in appearance, in usage over the past 20 to 30 years. This is not something that is unique. It is a difficulty which has been experienced by many capitals and other large cities throughout the world. Our colleagues in other countries have taken steps in many instances to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>What I am doing now is asking the House to agree to a proposal which will allow us to address the problem in Dublin. It is not something that has been conceived within the past year, which is the period during which members of Senator Fallon's party happened to control the balance of power in the local authority involved. I reminded the House in my opening speech on Second Stage that the genesis for this proposal appeared in embryonic form in a policy document issued by my own party in 1981. I quoted from sections of that document. I do not mind admitting to the House that I was the author of that document at that time. As the House will know, I have been Minister for the Environment since February of this year only. As soon as I was appointed to this position I set about the task of endeavouring to implement the ideas outlined in that policy document and expanding upon those ideas in the way I thought most practicable.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is in any way a negation of democracy and, as I said in relation to the discussion on the Urban Renewal Bill when it was passing through the other House, only in May of this year an amendment was moved by the spokesman for Senator Fallons' party which, had it been accepted, would have given to me the power to establish authorities such as this for whatever purpose I felt fit, for whatever area I felt appropriate and for whatever period of time I deemed to be best without any reference to the Houses of the Oireachtas. As it happened, I told the Minister of State who was handling the Bill at the time that he should not accept that wide ranging power, although in pursuit of advocating that amendment the Opposition spokesman <Col N="698" /> made remarks which are not dissimilar to mine in relation to the benefits of single-function authorities. I thought it would be better that, when specific proposals were being evolved for the establishment of authorities to carry out to task felt to be a little too difficult perhaps for existing bodies with a myriad of powers, those proposals should come specifically by way of legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas and be debated by them.</P>
    <P>Had I agreed to accept the Opposition amendment to the Urban Renewal Bill in May last this discussion would not be taking place today, because under the authority I would have been given by that amendment proposed by the Opposition I could have established the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission in June. I had hoped it would be established in July, but following publication of this Bill it received wholehearted and widespread support and welcome from bodies such as the Dublin City Centre Business Association, An Taisce, Bord Fáilte and various other business groups. There was only one group in the country who opposed the publication of this Bill or its concept and that, I have to say, was the main Opposition party. For that reason the Bill was not allowed passage through the other House at the end of the last session. The result has been that the establishment of the commission has been delayed totally unnecessarily for reasons which I have been yet unable to establish for five or six months.</P>
    <P>I said to the House when I was replying to Second Stage that I regarded it &mdash; and I again regard it &mdash; as an insult to my approach to my responsibilities as Minister for the Environment that it should be suggested that I would devise and conceive the establishment of a Dublin metropolitan streets commission to carry out this task because some other political grouping happened to hold the balance of power in Dublin Corporation. That is not true and it is not the way in which I would believe it appropriate for me to approach my task as Minister for the Environment or in relation to any other portfolio. I already reminded the House <Col N="699" /> that there are coincidentally a number of other local authority bodies of which the Senator's party have control. In particular I reminded the House of the fact that in the case of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, the General Council of County Councils his party happen to have more than the balance of power on those two bodies&mdash; I have had a number of useful and fruitful discussions with them regarding the closer co-operation that might evolve between them and also towards enhancing the status of those two which I regard as the representative groups, on the one hand the urban and on the other hand the urban cum-rural local authorities of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would be disappointed if those associations felt there was anything other than the closest of co-operation and good working relations between us. It is totally wrong, and I find it hurtful, that it should be suggested that I would introduce the concept of this commission to carry out this fundamentally important task simply because some other political grouping happened to have the balance of power in the local authority involved. Nothing could be further from the truth and had my party 90 per cent of the representation on Dublin Corporation I would still be advocating this Bill today.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that something of this nature had not been done previously. What we are doing is to appoint seven people with the sole exclusive task of taking the area from the top of Grafton Street to the bottom of O'Connell Street &mdash;the core of the capital city of the nation &mdash; with a mandate that says: &ldquo;Fit this area out to the highest possible standards, the best design of public lighting, public seating, public street furniture generally; identify how the public can be encouraged to come back in and to use it, to enjoy it, and to revel in the ambience within it; encourage people to support the businesses within it; recognise the high standards, the architectural quality of many of the buildings within it; restore them to their original grandeur; identify how open areas in the street can best be <Col N="700" /> used for the enjoyment of the general public; recognise the usage which can be made of flowers and of shrubbery in a way in which we have often been lacking in Ireland; recognise that one of the things of which we do not have a shortage is water; consider the use of water in fountains and other public designs for the public enjoyment; consider the greater utilisation of pedestrianisation for the development of the reputation and image of our capital city and the enjoyment of the people who use the area; consider how best traffic can be diverted out of this area without major disruption to the remainder of the capital city in pursuit of the enjoyment of pedestrians and the encouragement of business and the reputation and status of the capital city; and do that with a budget of £10 million assigned to you from central funds as a recognition that the centre of the city belongs to more than Dubliners; that it does have a special and significant part in the minds and the hearts of all of the people of the nation and, as such, that it should be supported by Exchequer funding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Give those seven people that authority and mandate them to do that task within three years and to have the finished product handed back into the care and maintenance of the local authority but with continuing to have a special status enshrined in legislation so that the local authority will be obliged to maintain the area, its street furniture and its setting to that special and high level. I have already explained to the House that I set the three years to ensure that the area would be returned to the present corporation during their lifetime and before there is another local election. I have done everything in my power to ensure that no member or official of the corporation involved should fear that it is in any way intended to be a slight on or a denigration of their efforts. They have many other important tasks to perform but it is not always possible for such a large body catering for the myriad of services for one million population and the many others who come to use the city every day, to concentrate all of their attention and resources in the way that I hope and <Col N="701" /> expect and will demand of the commission members to do.</P>
    <P>What I have outlined for the commissions and the way they approach their task is the best possible way of making the centre of Dublin city the best place of which all of us can be proud in a special way. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill arises from the widely acknowledged deficiencies that exist in the controls exercised over the dog population. These deficiencies have led to a situation where there are dogs roaming our countryside and the streets of our towns and cities doing considerable damage to sheep flocks, causing health and environmental problems and attacking adults and children. The existing control measures, some of which date back to 1847, are not working and it is believed that part of the problem is that responsibility for enforcement of these measures is dispersed over several Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to criticism emanating from political, farming and animal welfare circles for action to tackle the problem, an Inter-Departmental Committee on Dog Control was set up in September, 1983, at the behest of the Minister for Agriculture. The committee comprised <Col N="702" /> representatives from the Departments of Agriculture, Health, Justice, Environment and Finance. After consultation with various interests involved it produced a comprehensive report and made detailed recommendations which the Government have adopted as the basis for a new system of dog control. The Bill will repeal all the existing legislation in the matter and consolidate in one stature all matters pertaining to dog control.</P>
    <P>It is estimated by some people that there is one dog to every five persons in the State. That would leave a dog population of 700,000. There are no official statistics to corroborate this figure, but information compiled by the Economic and Social Research Institute in the course of surveys indicate that 51 per cent of households keep at least one dog, giving a minimum figure of 500,000 dogs. The real figure probably lies somewhere between the two. The number of dog licences taken out fell from 205,000 in 1975 to 80,000 in 1985 and that reduction is in itself a further reason why the control of dogs needs to be tightened up considerably.</P>
    <P>The problems associated with dogs do not arise entirely from numbers but also from irresponsible ownership. This can lead to attacks on sheep which, in economic terms, result in substantial losses to sheep farmers and to the national economy. Other results of such irresponsibility can be attacks on persons and especially on children, environmental pollution through dogs fouling paths, parks and beaches, traffic accidents attributable to uncontrolled dogs and public health hazards such as transmission of disease. A serious health risk, especially, for children playing with infected pets or coming in contact with dog excrement, is toxocara canis, which in some cases may cause eye damage or even epilepsy. Salmonellosis and ringworm may be picked up from dogs.</P>
    <P>The most serious health risk comes, however, from rabies. Fortunately this country is free of the disease and there are strict precautions on the importation of dogs and cats as a protective measure against the disease. The westward movement <Col N="703" /> of the disease in Europe increases the danger that infected animals could appear in Ireland and in turn infect uncontrolled dogs.</P>
    <P>At present primary responsibility for enforcement of dogs legislation rests with the Garda Síochána. Because of the many pressures on the force in relation to serious crime and the maintenance of the security of the State and the fact that it is inappropriate to use highly trained Garda personnel to do work which could be done equally well by other trained personnel, it is proposed to place the task of enforcement of the dog control measures in this Bill with dog wardens to be appointed for the purpose.</P>
    <P>A further obstacle to effective enforcement of the existing control measures is the diffusion of responsibility between various Departments. The Bill, therefore, will entrust overall responsibility in the matter to the Minister for the Environment because of his involvement with local government, at which level the problems will be tackled on the ground. The major local authorities, i.e., the 27 county councils and five county borough corporations will administer the Act in their respective areas. This will involve licensing dogs, appointing dog wardens and providing dog shelters. The licence revenue which will accure to the local authorities concerned in respect of dogs licensed in their respective areas is expected to be sufficient to cover the expenses incurred. It is envisaged that local authority areas with small dog populations and consequently low revenue will make appropriate arrangements with adjoining authorities for the operation of joint schemes. The intention is that the dog control measure will operate on a self-financing basis.</P>
    <P>I think all genuine dog lovers will have no compunction about paying the licence fee, when they will have tangible evidence that the money is being utilised for a proper system of dog control. For some years now the Department of the Environment have been encouraging local authorities to get involved in dog control and have been grant-aiding those <Col N="704" /> who did get involved to the extent of 50 per cent of their costs. For this year, a sum of £125,000 has been provided in the Department of the Environment Estimates for the purpose and it is estimated that sums of £175,000 in 1987 and £200,000 in 1988 will also be required.</P>
    <P>At present 12 local authorities are actively involved in dog control, and the powers which this Bill will give them will be of considerable help. Most of these local authorities engage the services of the ISPCA, which operates on an agency basis for the authorities concerned. It is proposed in the Bill to permit such arrangements to continue so that each local authority can decide to operate the scheme directly, or operate a joint scheme with another local authority or have the scheme operated on their behalf by the ISPCA or other body concerned with animal welfare.</P>
    <P>While there are many owners who exercise proper care and control of their dogs and due consideration for their neighbours, there are, unfortunately, some who let their dogs run wild. This is the real problem and is the cause of sheep worrying, attacks on people, traffic accidents and so on. Until we get the loose dogs off our lands and streets we will not solve the problem and, accordingly, the Bill proposes that a loose dog which is not accompanied by any person and is outside the confines of the land or premises where it is kept will be regarded as a stray dog and will be seized by a dog warden. This is the core of the Bill and will give real teeth to those operating it. While the aim of the dog wardens will be to encourage and advise on responsible dog ownership, I recognise that there are those who will ignore such advice and these people must be dealt with in a different way.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains the definitions of the terms used in the Bill. The Government decided that, while the Minister for Agriculture would sponsor the Bill, the Minister for the Environment would be responsible for its implementation. Consequently the Minister has been defined in the section as the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> Section 2 makes it unlawful for a person to keep a dog without a licence. In order to restrain impulsive buying of dogs, particularly as presents for children at Christmas and on other special occasions, I am also providing in this section that a licence must be obtained in advance of the purchase of a dog. The section will, accordingly, make it unlawful to purchase or sell a dog which is not covered by a licence. Under existing law all dogs aged one month or upward must be licensed. This section will provide that all dogs must be licensed, and this is necessary to tie in with the requirement to purchase a licence in advance. However, I am providing in section 5 that pups under four months, still kept with the bitch, will be exempt from licensing. I feel that this will accord more closely with the practical situation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the issue of dog licences by the local authority. As at present, there are two types of licences provided for &mdash; a dog licence which will apply to a single dog and which will be issued by the local authority for the area in which the dog is kept or is intended to be kept, and a general dog licence which will also be issued by a local authority and will apply to all dogs kept by a person within the functional area of that local authority. At present a general licence applies to all dogs kept by a person in the State, but because of the devolution of the licensing function to the local authorities, practical considerations make it desirable to confine the validity of the general dog licence to the area of the local authority which issued it. This section also provides that a local authority may, with the consent of the Minister for the Environment, enter into arrangements with another body for the issue of the licences on its behalf. That function is, of course, currently exercised by An Post.</P>
    <P>Section 4 prevents the issue of a licence to a person under 16 years of age or to a person who is disqualified by a court from keeping a dog because of a conviction for cruelty. Section 5 sets out the categories of persons who will be exempt from holding <Col N="706" /> a licence. These comprise the local authorities, the ISPCA and any other animal welfare bodies involved in the operation of the Act, the Garda Síochána, blind persons using guide dogs, persons keeping pups under four months with the dam or foster-mother, officials who round up dogs under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, for example, in the event of a rabies outbreak, and such other class of peson as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that a licence will be transferable with a dog, except when there is a change of ownership. Under Section 7 the licence will be valid for 12 months from the date of issue, unlike the present situation where we have a fixed licensing date &mdash; 1 January &mdash; which prompts some people to avoid licensing dogs acquired late in the year. Section 8 specifies the licence fees which are unchanged at £5 for a dog licence and £100 for a general dog licence. The Minister will have power to alter these rates by way of regulations or to specify different rates in respect of different classes of dogs. While it is not intended to specify different rates in the immediate future, it is considered prudent to provide the necessary powers in case at some future date it is considered desirable to adjust licence fees to distinguish between different breeds or sizes of dogs or between sterilised and unsterilised dogs.</P>
    <P>Section 9 imposes an obligation on owners or other persons in charge of dogs to accompany them and keep them under effectual control, when they are outside the confines of the premises where they are kept. Therefore, persons who permit their dogs to wander around the streets or, in a rural area, to move off his land will commit an offence under the Act. The existing law, under the Dogs Order 1966, provides for control of dogs between sunset and sunrise only. The offence now being created is a new one, but it is essential that it be introduced if we are to have effective dog control. Wandering dogs, not under anybody's control, are a menace and are the cause of many serious incidents and their owners must be made accountable. Section 9 also repeats a provision in the Dogs  <Col N="707" /> (Protection of Livestock) Act, 1960, making it an offence where a dog worries livestock. Section 10 repeats the provisions in the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965, whereby greyhounds must be kept under leash in a public place and not more than four may be exercised together by one person.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is aimed at providing effective powers for ridding our towns and countryside of stray dogs. The existing law governing stray dogs is contained in the Dogs Act, 1906, and provides that a police officer, who believes that a dog found in a highway or place of public resort is a stray dog, may seize it. A further provision about stray dogs is in the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act, 1960, and enables a member of the Garda Síochána to seize a dog which has been worrying livestock or enables a person who finds a dog worrying livestock to seize it and deliver it to the Garda. As I have stated already, it is inappropriate that primary responsibility for enforcement of these provisions should rest with the Garda Síochána and the section accordingly provides that dog wardens shall take all reasonable steps to seize stray dogs. This will impose an obligation on the warden to seize stray dogs. Under this section the Garda will continue to be empowered to seize strays but it is envisaged that, with an effective dog warden service in operation, the services of the Garda will be rarely required.</P>
    <P>The section also repeats the provision in the Dogs Act, 1906, for the giving of notice to the owner that a seized dog will be disposed of &mdash; which is defined as sold or given away under section 1 &mdash; or destroyed after seven days unless the dog is claimed and related expenses paid. A person claiming such a dog will be required to make a declaration and satisfy the local authority or the Garda Síochána that he or she is the owner or is authorised to claim the dog. An interesting point in the Bill is that we have the practical advantage of seeing dog wardens in operation. In other words, we are not talking about an hypothetical situation in the future or about the situation in the North.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> Here at home near us in Wicklow and around the place we have a very effective operation in place.</P>
    <P>Under section 12 a local authority will be empowered to accept unwanted dogs and to dispose of such dogs or destroy them. This is a very important feature of dog control and is a service that has been rendered on a voluntary basis by the ISPCA for a long time in our major population centres. It provides a simple, inexpensive and humane way of limiting the dog population. Dogs disposed of under this section and the previous section may not be disposed of for the purposes of animal experimentation but may be sterilised before they are sold. Sections 11 and 12 also provide that a person receiving such a dog becomes the owner. On the question of disposal I might say that it will be the intention that, as is the case at present with animal welfare groups, dogs will be disposed of to persons who will be adjudged to be dog lovers and capable of caring for them and bitches will be spayed, unless they are valuable for breeding.</P>
    <P>Section 13 updates the provisions in the Dogs Act, 1906, and the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965, governing the situation where a person finds and takes possession of a stray dog. Such person will be required to return the dog to its owner, or deliver it to a dog warden, or detain the dog and give notice in writing to the Garda Síochána or a dog warden. If the dog is detained for 12 months and the dog has not been claimed by its owner, the finder will become the owner. This section also updates a provision in the Dogs (Protection) of Livestock) Act, 1960, whereby any person may seize a stray dog suspected of worrying livestock and deliver it to a dog warden. This is the only situation where a person other than a dog warden or a garda may seize a stray dog. Section 14 provides for the keeping of a register of dogs seized.</P>
    <P>Section 15 imposes on each local authority the duty to employ at least one dog warden and to establish and maintain dog shelters. A local authority will, however, be empowered to delegate the entire dog <Col N="709" /> control function to the ISPCA or, with the consent of the Minister, to a body connected with animal welfare such as the Irish Kennel Club or anybody else. A local authority may also, again with the consent of the Minister, delegate to any person the function of providing and running dog shelters and of dealing with the dogs therein. This section also takes on board a provision in the Planning Acts enabling local authorities to grant-aid bodies providing shelters for stray or unwanted dogs.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, some 12 local authorities, with the active encouragement and financial assistance of the Minister for the Environment, and indeed, with the co-operation of the farming organisations have initiated dog control services of one kind or another. For the most part the work is carried out on an agency basis by the ISPCA. Those county councils which have got limited services under way should be in a position, immediately it is enacted, to avail of the statutory powers to be conferred in this Bill and to provide a comprehensive service and to serve as a model for the particular counties that up to now have not got experience in this area. Section 16 details certain powers of the dog warden and gives power of arrest without warrant to a garda where a person obstructs a warden or fails to give a correct name and address. This section usually is a bit sensitive in all types of legislation but it is a standard section.</P>
    <P>Section 17 authorises local authorities to make by-laws relating to the control of dogs within their functional areas. Depending on the situation locally, each authority will have their own priorities and may or may not wish to impose controls, additional to these in the Bill, within their own area or within particular locations. The section lists specific controls, which an authority may introduce, requiring a person to remove the faeces where a dog has fouled a public place &mdash; that applies both in the North of Ireland and the UK where you have to go along with a bag and shovel &mdash; specifying areas where dogs must be kept on a leash or where dogs, other than guide dogs, would <Col N="710" /> be prohibited altogether. The environmental and public health aspects of dog faeces in urban areas are of increasing public concern.</P>
    <P>Some public authorities in other countries have taken action to tackle this problem. I consider it desirable, therefore, to provide this enabling power should any of our local authorities wish to take similar action. On the morning radio programme we heard some time go, about the volume of faeces and the actual tonnage in Dublin is absolutely extraordinary and the cost of this to the ratepayer and the overburdened taxpayer must be astronomical.</P>
    <P>Section 18 restates a provision in the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965, whereby a person convicted of cruelty to a dog can be disqualified by a court from keeping a dog for such period as the court thinks fit. Section 19 provides that the Minister may introduce regulations for the control of premises where more than five adult dogs are kept. These will include breeding, boarding and guard dog kennels and it is desirable that the dog wardens should be empowered to control dog welfare in these establishments, where such control is deemed to be necessary. It goes without saying that if a number of dogs are kept by somebody for breeding, greyhounds, fox-hunting or whatever, these should be properly looked after and properly supervised.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be empowered also to regulate, if necessary, the use of guard dogs in the course of business. The use of guard dogs as a security measure is now a common feature of business life and it is considered prudent that the Minister should be able to exercise control in this area, if necessary.</P>
    <P>Another precautionary power proposed for the Minister is the muzzling of dogs and the keeping of dogs under control. While it is not expected that the Minister will have need to exercise this power in the near future, the possibility of an outbreak of disease which could be spread by dogs must be guarded against. Rabies would be one of the diseases. The Minister will also regulate the identification <Col N="711" /> of dogs by way of collar or harness, which is a requirement at present under the Dogs Order, 1966, and may in the future specify other means of identification, such as tattooing, and prescribe a means of licence identification.</P>
    <P>Opportunity is being taken in the Bill to increase the maximum fine for a conviction under the Protection of Animals Acts from £50 to £500 and this is provided for in section 20. It is provided also that fines may be increased in future by way of regulations; such regulations would require the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 21 restates section 3 of the Animals Act, 1985, concerning civil liability for damage done by a dog. The section was extensively debated in the House last year and is included here because the Bill is a consolidating measure concerning dogs. Section 22 authorises a court to deal with dangerous dogs and to order that such dogs be kept under control or destroyed. This provision has its origins in the Dogs Act, 1871.</P>
    <P>From an agricultural point of view, section 23 is important. Under the law as it stands &mdash; Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act, 1960 &mdash; it is a good defence for shooting a dog if the defendent proves that the dog was shot when worrying livestock on agricultural land. I now propose that this provision be widened to permit the shooting of dogs worrying or about to worry livestock no matter where they are and of stray dogs which had not left the vicinity where livestock had been injured or killed and which could not be seized or identified. Section 24 restates a provision in the Dogs Act, 1906, which requires that carcases should not be left unburied in places to which dogs could gain access, but excludes parts of carcases used as poisoned bait.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides a court remedy for persons aggrieved by excessive barking of a dog. The court may order abatement of the nuisance or limit the number of dogs on a particular premises or direct that the dog be delivered to a dog warden and dealt with as an unwanted dog. That particular part of the legislation will not <Col N="712" /> be implemented by the dog warden. That will be a private matter between two neighbours. The provision is in the Bill that a neighbour will have to take his neighbour to court and get him to cease the noise if there is too much noise at night.</P>
    <P>Section 26 specifies the offences and penalties arising under the Bill. Section 27 introduces on-the-spot fines for minor offences which carry a maximum fine of £100 and for failure to keep a dog or greyhound under effectual control. While lack of effectual control could have serious consequences in some circumstances, there will undoubtedly be occassions when the offence would lead to no great harm and could be dealt with on the spot by the dog warden.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides that the local authority may prosecute offences under the Bill and places the onus on the defendant of providing any relevant facts, for example, age of dog, existence of licence or importation of dog. The concessions about age of dog or importation into the State are being made to facilitate dog breeders and persons bringing dogs in from the United Kingdom for shows, etc. That happens regularly. It was one of the representations that was made to us with regard to show dogs in particular. It is reasonable that such parties should have to prove the facts in cases of suspected abuse.</P>
    <P>Section 32 will enable the Minister to make grants to local authorities and to bodies concerned with the provisions of dog shelters or with the welfare of dogs. Under section 15 a local authority are similarly enabled to aid such bodies. Section 34 enables the Minister to extend the provisions of the Act relating to acceptance of unwanted dogs, the provision of shelters and the grant-aiding of bodies providing shelters to other pet animals. The limited service operating in some local authorities at present for dog control is providing a very useful service by taking in large numbers of unwanted cats as well as dogs. It is considered desirable, therefore, that the Bill should provide a statutory basis for that activity. I <Col N="713" /> wish to emphasise that there is no question of wardens being involved in the seizure of cats. This provision is designed to facilitate the disposal of unwanted cats.</P>
    <P>These are the salient features of the Bill which I commend to the House and in so doing I would like to thank all those who have contributed in some way to the preparation of this Bill, particularly the National Action Committee on Dog Control, the members of the Inter-Departmental Committee, the ISPCA, the Irish Kennel Club and the Advisory Council on Animal Health and, indeed, the farming bodies as well.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to make the point that we are now coming to another lambing season. Farmers all over the country are in fear and trepidation of what could happen. We see gruesome pictures in the papers. It is appropriate that we should deal seriously with this Bill, have it properly discussed, and hopefully passed. Thank you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is very welcome, particularly if it comes to grips with the problem of stray dogs. It will amend and extend the law relating to the control of dogs. I hope when the Bill is finally passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas that it will be enforced rigidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the law as it stands at present is adequate even if it was enforced, but unfortunately it is not. We have legislation on the Statute Book dating back to 1871. There are many other statutes such as those in 1906, 1925, 1926, 1963 and so on, dealing with this problem in one way or another. In fact, we had legislation a few years ago making it obligatory for dog owners to ensure that their dogs wear collars with the dog owners' names on them. How many dogs are wearing such collars nowadays or, indeed, how many prosecutions have taken place in the intervening years? I doubt that very many have. My point is that unless the law is enforced, it is a waste of the time of this House putting through legislation. I ask the Minister at the start of the debate on this very important measure to make sure as far <Col N="714" /> as he can that when this legislation has passed through the House it will be enforced.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the revenue received in 1985 from dog licences, namely, £0.4 million, that the law requiring dog owners to have dog licences is not being enforced. The potential revenue from dog licences at current rates is £2.5 million. The Government are allowing that valuable source of revenue to be whittled away by neglecting to enforce the law. Indeed, in bygone days when the gardaí had only bicycles to get around their districts, they did the rounds regularly to check on defaulters, in rural areas anyway. Of course, they did not have to call on every house because once they made an appearance the bush telegraphs began to operate and usually the defaulters made a beeline to the local post office to renew their dog licences. The gardaí do not have time to enforce this law now, which is still on our Statute Book, and so we lose over £2 million in revenue. Not alone that, but we know the damage straying and wandering dogs cause to individuals and, indeed, to the countryside.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill local authorities will be given the responsibility for collecting the dog licence fees. It is expected that eventually the scheme will be self-financing. That, of course, will be great if it happens, but unless there is a determined effort to enforce this new law all we are doing here is passing the buck from one body to another.</P>
    <P>How can we expect local authorities to collect licence fees when the Department of Justice, who are at present operating the scheme, cannot collect them. Exchequer and to local authorities for dog control in 1986, it is estimated, will be of the order of £125,000. This would be less than £4,000 for each of the 32 local authorities involved. I consider this to be completely inadequate if we are to be serious about the control of dogs. Neither is one dog warden employed by each local authority sufficient to enforce the law. Indeed, going on local authorities records of collecting water and refuse service charges, there is no way they will be able <Col N="715" /> to collect dog licences. For that reason I recommended that the Department of the Environment should continue to subvent local authorities for this scheme. Otherwise we will be wasting our time.</P>
    <P>Section 15 details the method of appointment of dog wardens by local authorities and states that every person so employed shall be furnished with a certificate of his appointment. I submit that before a person is issued with such a certificate he or she should undergo a training course on how to handle a dog. You cannot issue a certificate to a person without the necessary training. I understand the ISPCA are quite capable of providing such a course. Their services should be availed of by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A date should be set for the appointment of these wardens. Otherwise local authorities will delay their appointments. This is very important. We all know how local authorities operate. If this regulation is foisted on them without specifying the date on which those wardens should be appointed, then their appointments will be put on the long finger. For that reason I ask the Minister to set a date for their appointment.</P>
    <P>Every spring we read terrible reports of sheep being worried and slaughtered by stray dogs. Indeed, it is unbelievable the damage that can be caused by a few stray dogs when they chase a flock of sheep of lambing time. Usually the unfortunate farmer who is the victim of such an attack has to live with the loss of his animals unless the marauding dogs can be tracked down and the owners made to pay.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that where a dog worried livestock the owner or person in charge of the dogs shall be guilty of an offence. The owner should also be made responsible for compensation to the aggrieved farmer. This should be written into the Bill. We all know of the worry of farmers who have land adjoining cities and large towns. They seem to suffer more than anybody else, particularly at spring time and during the lambing season. Indeed, the Minister referred to this in the course of his speech. The lack <Col N="716" /> of control over those animals is unbelievable. Every year committees of agriculture and other concerned bodies throughout the country pass resolutions asking people to tie up their dogs, particularly during the lambing season, but in many cases those pleas go unheeded. I cannot put a finger on the amount of damage caused to the sheep flock. I am sure it runs into many hundreds of thousands of pounds. It is tragic that people are so irresponsible as to allow their dogs to wander and cause such damage. Where a farmer finds dogs worrying his livestock he should be entitled to shoot those dogs.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note in section 23 of the Bill that farmers will be empowered to do this. The Minister said he now proposed that this provision should be widened to permit the shooting of dogs who are worrying or who are about to worry livestock no matter where they are and of stray dogs who had not left the vicinity where livestock had been injured or killed and which could not be seized or identified. It is proper that farmers would have power to deal with those straying dogs.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the control of greyhounds. It should be specified that a person leading up to four greyhounds should be over 16 years of age to ensure the effective control of the animals.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with stray dogs and sets out the duties of dog wardens and the gardaí regarding the seizure and detention of these animals. It should also specify that stray dogs, known to be dangerous, cannot be released. Subsection (7) sets out the length of time local authorities or the gardaí may detain a dog before disposing of it or arranging for its destruction. The time is set at seven days following the making of an entry in the register. I believe this could be reduced to four or five days because this part of the Bill is a legacy from the 1906 Dogs Act. There is now better communication. It is more easy to contact dog owners than it was in 1906. For that reason the time allowed could be reduced to four or five days. It would also save <Col N="717" /> money because dogs would not have to be fed for up to seven days.</P>
    <P>A number of points could be made relating to this Bill. I know other speakers would like to get in. Perhaps with a few changes this Bill could be made a little better. I am sure the recommendations I have made can be included in the Bill. If that can be done and the legislation passed I hope it will contribute towards eliminating this menace once and for all. It is a menace in towns and in the countryside. The Minister outlined some of the problems caused by the destruction wandering dogs cause to parks and to footpaths as well as the destruction that can be caused to sheep flocks at lambing time. I hope this legislation will help in some small way to eliminate such destruction.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, unless the legislation is enforced we will not solve the problem. Many other Acts have been put on the Statute Book and, while their intentions were good, as the years passed we found they were not able to tackle the problem of straying dogs which are such a menace to society. I welcome the Bill. On Committee Stage I will be making a few recommendations which could help to improve the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has been privileged to serve on a sub-committee of the Animal Health Advisory Council in consultation with the Inter-Departmental Committee of the Department of the Environment, I want to say I am pleased that the Bill has now reached the legislative stage and is before the Houses of the Oireachtas for full and frank discussion. I deliberately left behind me all the notes I had compiled over the past 12 months on this subject because today I were the at of a legislator and not a sub-committee member who had an input into the framing of the legislation. Since the Bill has been published there has been widespread debate about it among people associated with dogs, the care of dogs, guide dogs, dogs involved in the canine clubs, the ISPCA whose work all of us would highly commend in this House, and owners of livestock which have been <Col N="718" /> devastated as a result of uncontrolled dogs wandering our streets and our countryside day and night without proper care and attention from their owners.</P>
      <P>There are provisions in this legislation which will need both clarification and identification for all the interests concerned. In the course of my short contribution I will outline some of the difficulties of people directly involved with dogs on a daily basis, the concern they have about the legislation and what they contend will be restrictions on their activities as dog owners.</P>
      <P>Nobody holds any brief whatsoever for the unwanted dog or for the owner who obviously does not take care of his dog: that dog in its uncontrolled state is a menace and has been the cause of widespread livestock losses particularly in hill counties and in sheep farming in general. Over a number of years we have witnessed the devastation of young lambs at lambing periods. Everybody with any sense of responsibility in this area must commend the Minister for his initiative in trying to do something effective to control unwanted dogs. I am satisfied that the efforts for the collection of dog licence fees which rested with the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice have been a failure because of difficulty in collecting licence fees from dog owners who do not accept responsibility for stray dogs.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Reports on the Arts in Education: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann in view of the partial access through private provision for the Arts that is available to children, calls on the Minister for Education and the Government to commit themselves to speedy implementation during the term of the present Government of the Benson Report on the Arts <Col N="719" /> in Education so as to enable the children of this country to have access to the Arts as part of their normal development through the curriculum of the school system with the inevitable result of there being a much more widespread enjoyment and appreciation of the Arts in Ireland and above all so much more opportunity for the increased development of the personality and that it further notes the Brinson Report &mdash;<i>The Dancer and the Dance</i>&mdash; and the Herron Report &mdash;<i>Deaf Ears</i>&mdash; which develop the proposals of the Benson Report in the respective areas of theatre, dance and music.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator M. Higgins.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to conclude. I covered most of the points the last evening when I was making a contribution. As I said then, I welcome the report and it is to be encouraged by all sections of this House. We only have to look back to 1983 to see that 39 per cent of our students who took the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations included arts, including music, among their subjects. It is a very low percentage and it shows us all the enormous amount of work that has to be done, but I have no doubt that unless finance is provided for the purchase of instruments in primary schools in particular we will not make very much progress. There are light wind instruments that can be purchased very reasonably, perhaps for less than the price of a substantial meal for the parent of that student, definitely for around £10, through which a student can get very basic knowledge and learn how to read music and everything that goes with music. It is one thing to have it all in theory but to have it in practice cannot be beaten. From experience I know this to be true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to the Minister that it would be a great day's work for the country, for future generations, to have pupils taught music under supervision, because when you are taught music at a very young age the chances are you will learn it for the <Col N="720" /> love of it and the knowledge and skill will increase as the years go by. All of us who have been associated with music for most of our lives know that it becomes part of your life if you are on the stage, in the theatre or in school learning and practising. You are not out in the street; you are not open to all the various different temptations and dangers that exist; and you are giving yourself a great opportunity and pleasure you will never forget.</P>
    <P>I was probably one of the luckier students in my area. I decided under enormous hardship that I would try to go to music classes and pay my way as I went along. There was no television at that time. Now, with television the temptation is far greater to sit at home, watch television to entertain yourself. The Government and all of us in the Oireachtas have a big part to play to ensure that finances are made available for instruments. In those impressionable years in the primary school and the early years of secondary school, if encouragement is given and if a person sees that his fellow student or teammate is learning music, playing music and getting on quite well at it and, maybe, gets an airing on the local radio station, or whatever, a great example is given to others. They get the drive and the goal, and how much better that is for our society compared with &mdash; I have nothing against public houses or anything like that &mdash; having them in premises where gaming machines are and where there is every temptation in the world. That is one of the great advantages in this report. It is creating a platform, giving a forum to young people.</P>
    <P>The country has no greater ambassador than its music and song. There is no greater way to make friends than with music and song. Bing Crosby retired having been on top for many years. He decided to come back after two years; he knew no other occupation. The more popular you become the more money you make and <i>vice versa.</i> He found out in other businesses that the more money you made the more enemies you created. I do not know any other profession that carries so much goodwill and such a good humoured atmosphere as music when <Col N="721" /> people are out socialising and enjoying themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members of the House in recommending this motion and I should like to pay a very special tribute to Senator Michael D. Higgins for his very fine opening address on the motion and the very fine evaluation he gave of the merits and qualities of the arts and the absolute obligation, necessity and compulsion on us to do more for the whole area of artistic endeavour, particularly at school level. I concur entirely with him that there is a need to formulate and firm up our art policy at school level. I go right down the road with the Senator in his evaluation of the various scales and sensitivities, of the humanising factors that have become very much part of the human being who has been exposed at school level to art in its many forms.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Senator Mullooly in placing some of the blame on the current system for entry into third level education, that is, the points system, which demotes arts and artistic endeavour in the schools to a secondary role. When the pressure comes on, areas of academic achievement which are the ones rewarded by virtue of entry into third level education have to take precedence and will take precedence until such time as we elevate and raise the whole status of art in all its various forms. I compliment Senator Howlin on his very fine speech when seconding the motion.</P>
      <P>The House owes a debt of gratitude to the people who have re-focused our attention on this very fine report which had largely lain dormant since its production and publication. Though it was published in 1979, the report is very current, topical and contemporary. The points contained therein are ones to which we have an obligation to address ourselves today, just as much as we needed to address ourselves to them back in 1979, because unfortunately the situation has not improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opening chapter of the report gets the tone and the context of the debate very much in focus. The opening sentence <Col N="722" /> says &mdash; and I think we would agree unanimously that it is an understatement &mdash; that art has been neglected in Irish education. We have, unfortunately, in Ireland an historical apathy towards the arts. When one looks at the areas of high achievement of the general public at amateur and professional levels outside the schools, one marvels at the high degree of skill and professionalism, the standards that have been achieved in drama, dance and music and in all the other areas of art. One wonders how this has happened without the necessary seed being sown at primary school level.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that there is an historical apathy among the Irish people. That is very unfortunate. If we go back to 1949, Professor Bodkin, in his report in Irish schools on the subject of art in Irish schools stated that in Irish schools the subject of art in either the historical or practical sense is neglected. In 1961 the story had not improved. In a report called: <i>Design in Ireland</i> by a group of Swedes, the indictment was that the Irish school child is visually and artistically among the under educated in Europe. In 1965 we find the report of the Council of Design giving the judgment that art as a whole had been gravely undervalued.</P>
    <P>In 1976, Professor Jane Richards stated that the provision of arts for boys and the neglect of music for boys is an affront to educational standards.</P>
    <P>Those are four very salutary statements. They are very valid in their general indictment of all of us collectively for the state of the arts in this country. There has been an abject neglect of art for its own sake and from a utilitarian point of view, instead of developing an economy of art, developing the talents, aptitudes, skills and creative ability that lie dormant in many of our young people, they do not get the chance to unearth those talents or to give them the necessary exposure.</P>
    <P>The report is a very fine one. It is the first report of its kind that has set out to provide a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the state of art at school level. It is the first report to gather together all the various pieces of evidence on the many facets of art and to form this evaluation. <Col N="723" /> It goes through the various sectors, with particular emphasis on the primary school sector. I should like to focus attention on the situation in the primary schools because it is here that the seed is sown which germinates into the love or otherwise of art and where it is nurtured and cultivated. It is here that the child spends the longest sustained period of his educational career, a total of eight years.</P>
    <P>If we are honest, we who came through the system pre-1971 all know that the only exposure we got to any type of artistic endeavour or achievement was in singing. It is only recently that art has been given any serious curricular place. There are, of course, difficulties. There are financial and physical difficulties. There are difficulties as regards rooms, resources, teachers with specialised training, who have the necessary skill, love and aptitude for the teaching of arts. It is something which cannot be switched on overnight. It is something we have got to apply and address ourselves to with greater vigour, commitment and determination.</P>
    <P>We note with considerable satisfaction that in 1971 the new curriculum introduced for the first time arts, crafts, music, pottery, etc. in the primary schools. There has been a regular monitoring and analysis of the relative success or otherwise of this introduction to the curriculum. It is fairly and honestly acknowledged by the teachers themselves, and by the INTO who had been part and parcel of this evaluation, that many teachers openly admit they feel they lack the skills, knowledge and the resources to teach in this area. Many of them are untrained and do not have the aptitudes because such aptitudes were not called for, were not expected and were not in the system when these people were called to training.</P>
    <P>The Association of Primary Teaching Sisters give a very honest assessment of the situation. I quote:</P>
    <P>Teachers in general recognise the value of such crafts as cookery, needlework, knitting, crochet, embroidery, <Col N="724" /> and these are usually well taught, but the less useful and more unuseful crafts, such as pottery, clay modelling, basketry, puppetry, weaving, textile decoration, block and screen printing etc., do not recommend themselves to the general run of teachers other than a few enthusiasts.</P>
    <P>That is a very honest assessment of the situation. It is an acknowledgment that most people do not feel they have the necessary competence, training or skill to deal with the area.</P>
    <P>If we are to address the problem in a forthright, successful fashion we are talking about the need to train people coming out at present in this area, to be conscious in recruiting people to the teaching profession that their aptitudes and skills in this area will have to be evaluated and taken into consideration and will have to be a considerable component in deeming a person suitable for the teaching profession. Above all, we will have to address the problem that there are many people, such as the sisters referred to, in this appraisal of their efforts and many people who feel that they need in-service training on a fairly sustained and concentrated basis. Painting, picture making, etc., are more in evidence but are not given the priority they deserve.</P>
    <P>What happens is that when the pressure comes on timetabling in terms of resources, the &ldquo;three Rs&rdquo; always get and always have to precedence. The same thing happens with music, creative dance, movement and drama, etc. There is a need to build up an infrastructure of well trained teachers who will be able to apply themselves to these areas. There is also a need on the part of the authorities to give sympathetic timetabling to a place for art. The report states that:</P>
    <P>Looking at the general time table structure in the average school one sees in fact that art when timetabled is usually timetabled on a Friday afternoon which is not the time when a student has the necessary enthusiasm or the ability or the likelihood of applying himself with full vigour to the subject.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> The sad fact is highlighted in the report that we do not have the inspectorate structure. Inspectors are people to whom teachers look for guidance and advice. If there is not an inspectorate specifically trained for the area of art, it is not going to succeed. We have a very fine post-primary and third level inspectorate, but one cannot expect an inspector going around to the primary schools to be a jack-of-all trades in terms of confidence, particularly to advise people in relation to art and how art should be taught.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to try to recruit additional inspectors in this area and to give the teachers who have this inferiority complex in relation to their ability to teach art the necessary advice, encouragement and assistance in relation to their endeavours.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level the story is no better. This is an area where many exciting things have happened over the past number of years. Post-primary education is an area that has shown itself to have a unique capacity to adapt. We have seen vocational schools take on academic subjects; we have seen secondary schools take on technical subjects; we have seen the intermediate and leaving certificates move into the area of vocational education; we have seen the development of the comprehensive school idea and the emergence of community schools with all their education philosophies which are designed to achieve the maximum level of interplay and interaction between the community and the school. Yet, for all these developments, which are considerable, page seven of the supplementary document attached to the report gives frightening statistics which I must admit I was not aware of. They are statistics which, in themselves, are an indictment of our level of commitment.</P>
    <P>In 1983, 0.73 per cent of boys sat leaving certificate music; 3.68 per cent of girls sat leaving certificate music. In 1985, rather than improving, the situation had deteriorated: 2.9 per cent of students out of the total number who sat the leaving certificate took music as a subject therein.</P>
    <P>I have to go along with Senator Cassidy <Col N="726" /> on the point that if we are to nurture and cultivate a love of music in the schools, one way of doing this is by giving people the necessary instrumentation with which they can achieve musical skills and practice. In this day and age we are talking about the sum of £75 as a Government subsidy towards the setting up of a band, which is generally acknowledged to be in the region of £1,795 by way of total investment. The total amount of the grant given is little more than derisory.</P>
    <P>In third level education much has been achieved and a lot of modification has taken place. I welcome in particular the restructuring of the National College of Art and Design. I know that one cannot switch overnight from a position of apathy to a position of achievement. I am aware that the Minister has the necessary interest in the arts to undertake the necesary input in this area to ensure that many of the prejudices will be broken down, that much of the apathy will be dissipated, and to ensure that the people will get the necessary encouragement. This is very easy to do nowadays as the technology is available, simple technology, videos, projects, slides. Even a newspaper is a work of art and it has many artistic evaluations.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the points raised by Senator Michael D. Higgins in relation to art, such as the development of communicative skills, interpretative skills and so on, the fact that every attempt to deal with the history of man reverts back to art, the fact that art can enrich and individualise and that, while a person might be alone, he need never be lonely as long as he can have recourse to the Arts; the fact that the artist in a community can be a reflective mirror and can enhance the image and self-esteem of it. It is time we moved art to the centre of the stage rather than having it peripheral, as it has been thus far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Manger Mr. Manger">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manger</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the Minister here, instead of a deputy. Deputy Cooney is a very courteous and interested man. If the Minister detects in my contribution any shade of special pleading, it is because I am an active member of the Cork VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> I am delighted with the opportunity to comment on the Benson report: &ldquo;A Place for Art in Irish Education&rdquo;. The report is an extremely comprehensive one as Senator Higgins has just stated. I commend most sincerely the Arts Council for their initiative in commissioning and publishing the report to coincide with the International Year of the Child. I regret, of course, that the International Year of the Child was in 1979. We are now seven years later debating the implementation of the recommendations in the report. This is not to say that nothing has happened in the intervening period. Positive action has been taken in relation to a limited number of the recommendations and some progress has been recorded.</P>
    <P>Regrettably in some respects we have also regressed. This is because sufficient action has not been taken to date to ensure that the place of the arts in the education of all our children is a central or mainstream place as opposed to being a peripheral one. The whole concept of the arts &mdash; in music, drama, and so on &mdash; has almost been the exclusive preserve of middle and upper class people. I am not saying by design, but unfortunately ordinary working class people have lost out in one of life's better experiences. They are, if you like, culled out from the system in one way or another. One would hope that, with the implementation of this report, they would be brought into it so that the appreciation and enjoyment which many people get from the arts would be shared by all of our people. I should like to see it in the mainstream as opposed, as it is at present, to being a peripheral one. Consequently, when the various education authorities have been faced with finding means of coping with the revised teacher allocations in recent years, the areas dealing with the various arts disciplines have always been <i>numero uno</i> as regards a target.</P>
    <P>I referred in my opening remarks to the education of all of our children because the reaction of the school authorities to the more difficult resource situation, understandable and unavoidable <Col N="728" /> as it may seem to those same authorities, has been especially unfortunate in the case of less advantaged children, as the parents of such children have been less able to seek and make alternative arrangements to compensate for the reductions in the programmes available as part of the normal education of the children. This is very true as piano lessons, music lessons and singing lessons in the private sector are denied to people who do not have the money to send their children for these lessons.</P>
    <P>In the above context I should like to note the efforts of the interim Curriculum and Examinations Board which, in their discussion papers on the curriculum generally and on the arts and education, appear to have taken a clear view that the arts must have a place in the centre of things in the education system. The follow-through to this would be to provide clear guidelines as to the content in the various syllabi as well as to the entrenchment of the arts in the mainstream curriculum.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the establishment of the statutory Curriculum and Examinations Board and to their putting in place, with the support of the Minister, the concepts developed by the interim board. In many respects these concepts go even further in charting a new role for the arts in the Irish education system than the Benson report dared to go.</P>
    <P>The Benson report is an extremely comprehensive document. It contains a total of 119 recommendations. The Minister will be happy to know I have no intention of commenting on all 119 recommendations. However, I should like to touch on one or two of them. Recommendations 8 and 20 call for the establishment of a new grade within the Department of Education structure of specialist subject advisers and for the employment by the Department and VECs of such advisers who would work under the appropriate inspector and have responsibility for developing the subject within the schools in a designated area.</P>
    <P>I have long been of the view that the teaching work in schools generally would be significantly enhanced by the putting <Col N="729" /> in place of local advisory services which would be staffed by the best of our existing practising teachers recruited for this role on a variety basis: for example, either by being released for part of a week from normal teaching duties in a single school to carry out this advisory role in a wider area, or by being released for a fixed term to do the work in a whole time capacity and then to return to the original duty and be replaced in a similar way by other teachers. This would ensure that these specialist teachers would never be too far removed from actual day to day classroom work and contact with pupils and so on.</P>
    <P>When I suggest this I do not want to be construed as advocating any further restrictions on teacher pupil rations. I often think we concentrate too much on the quantity of education, whereas the quality is also important and would be much improved by the establishment of local advisory services such as I have outlined. As this is not likely to take place on a general basis, at least at an early date, and given the Irish record for pilot schemes, the arts would seem to be an obvious place for such pilot development in view of the evident vulnerability of arts programmes in the educational system. Also, as we do not have broadly based local education authorities embracing schools of all types and levels, and as an advisory service must be local if it is to be effective, I heartily endorse the suggestion in the report that these services should be located in the vocational education committees, as these are the only organisations in existence which are local and democratic. It is very important when we are trying to deliver services at local level that they should be local and democratic.</P>
    <P>The second set of recommendations which I wish to dwell on for a short time are those dealing with theatre in education. I refer to recommendations 31 and 106. Theatre in education is depicted by the Curriculum and Examinations Board in section 4.2.11 where they say:</P>
    <P>Theatre-in-education (TIE is <Col N="730" /> presented by actor-teachers who do not have the same continuing relationship with the students as their own teacher has, but who have access to a range of signs outside the scope of most teachers. They write and present programmes, often in consultation with teachers, which explore issues and attitudes and situations appropriate to the personal and social development of the students visited. Theatre-in-education work is highly specialised and programmes are developed for about eight different age-bands from four to eighteen years old. Very often there is an accompanying workshop, and almost always a resource pack is provided to facilitate preparation and follow-up work by teachers.</P>
    <P>TEAM, Ireland's only permanent and professional TIE company, has been working in Irish schools since 1975 and presently serves the school community in ten counties. There is a need for additional TIE companies in Ireland to provide an adequate service to schools, teacher centres and teacher-training institutions.</P>
    <P>I find that interesting for a number of reasons. TEAM is a professional theatre-in-education company which has been in operation since 1975 and which has been in receipt of substantial grant-in-aid from the Arts Council. I do not begrudge TEAM that support, although TEAM's activities take place in the extended Pale area and do not impact on the lives of citizens in Munster. Recommendation 106 of the Benson report states that the Arts Council should continue its financial support of theatre-in-education groups such as TEAM. This rings hollow because, as a member of the Cork VEC, I have been witness for the past few years to the fact that both the Arts Council and the Department of Education have signally failed to ensure that the Munster based theatre in education company, Graffiti, had access to financial support to enable them to provide for young people in the southern part of the country. I urge the Minister for Education and the Minister of State with responsibility <Col N="731" /> for the Arts to ensure that his Department and the Arts Council get their respective acts together while there is still time and ensure that the group, Graffiti, get sufficient financial support from his Department, the Arts Council and the Cork VEC, so that they can continue to provide the very valuable service they have given for the past number of years. That is in line with the recommendations. Funding is the problem, and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the Munster based group get sufficient funds to carry on the excellent work they have been doing over the past number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion put down by the Labour group in the Seanad. There is no doubt that the arts have been neglected in Ireland and that we are uneducated in the arts. Unfortunately, many people look at the arts as they are portrayed in ballet in high class music, and in classical paintings. Art takes many forms and sometimes there is a dichotomy between the various groupings involved in artistic endeavours. I ran into trouble some years ago when I sent out a circular giving details of arts week in Kilkenny, which was being held at the same time as the fleadh because of the order in which I put certain things. Certain people decided that I was running down Irish music because Irish music happened to be the third part of the listing I gave and a classical concert happened to be the first part of the listing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too many people are very selective in their appreciation of certain forms of art and they do not want to know what anybody else is doing. We have Irish art forms which do not cost the State a lot. Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Eireann do a fantastic job in the arts but, unfortunately, the Arts Council seem to consider themselves to be above the endeavours of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí and anything that is Irish, and do not see fit to give to the Irish cultural pursuits the emphasis they should give. We are culturally starved because we are out on the periphery of Europe. We do not have access to the major art galleries, orchestras and to the <Col N="732" /> major dance forms. If anybody had considered that ballet was an art form which the Irish people were not really interested in, the lie would have been given to that by the interest shown recently in the visit of the Bolshoi Ballet when each show was totally booked out. If that ballet company had stayed in Ireland for another week, or perhaps ten days, all their shows would have been booked out. A number of people in Ireland have tried to protect that art form and the Irish Ballet Company, amongst others, have had their troubles in getting funding and in keeping that art form going. Our education system has done nothing in terms of giving young people a love of dance whether it be ballet dancing, ballroom dancing or Irish dancing. There is no place in the school curriculum for the promotion of dance as an art form. There is no funding at all in the education system for it.</P>
    <P>Because of the lack of interest in the Department of Education and because we have not enough art galleries we have a problem in getting our young people interested in the visual arts. Some attempt is made in schools to teach music. Unfortunately, the teaching of music is likely to die out in the next number of years because we will not have the dedicated priest, brother and nun who devoted themselves to giving a cultural aspect to education. They spent a lot of their spare time developing an appreciation of music in their pupils. I do not criticise teachers for not doing things outside school hours, but the time spent by religious teachers will be lost. Because of the fewer numbers of religious teachers in our schools, even music will die out as an art in our educational system.</P>
    <P>The educational system needs to be changed so that people can have the opportunity to develop the arts, so that they can become more rounded people, rather than people heading towards an examination result which will give them access to third level education, or to a vocational position. The neglect of the arts in Ireland is obvious in that we do not produce great artists except on a very <Col N="733" /> minor scale. Our artists are produced not by the system but despite the system.</P>
    <P>It is suggested in the report that the only access in Ireland to art forms is through paid private tuition. That is true. I have seen in Kilkenny how an arts week can create an interest in the arts far beyond the interest shown in the various programmes put on during the week. The school of music in Kilkenny has grown over the past five years because of the arts week. Sculptors and painters have worked with children during that week and an interest was generated because people were exposed to good artists. We have seen the formation of local art groups, the development of the school of music, of literary groups and short story programmes because of exposure to the arts in art week. There are many art forms in Dublin, very good libraries, art galleries and a very good National Concert Hall but in general we lack education in the arts.</P>
    <P>If anything is done as a result of the Benson or the Brinson reports, or as a result of the Minister for Education listening to the Senators who are appealing for more help, a good job will have been done. The Minister can only be helped by this debate. There has been a reluctance in the Department of Education, through the years, to put anything into the educational system that will not be of direct benefit to pupils in their examinations. However, a population can only be well educated if they have a proper grounding not alone in the basic elements but also in the arts. Anyone interested in music should not differentiate between classical music, pop music, jazz, jive or celtic music. People should be taught to appreciate good music and good paintings. People should be taught how to daub pieces of paper with colours and produce images that give them satisfaction, even if other people do not consider them of any great value.</P>
    <P>Enormous pressure is put on children in the educational system today. As the father of six children who have gone through all levels of education, I know that. The schools to which my children went were geared towards passing exams <Col N="734" /> which would give pupils the opportunity to get into third level education, but I would have been more satisfied if a little more time had been spent in giving the pupils an appreciation of the arts. In acquiring an appreciation of art forms, people would get a certain relaxation as well as knowledge which would be of benefit to them in their pursuit of more academic programmes needed to get them into third level education.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to see if a comprehensive scheme of education in the arts can be initiated in the educational system, not just as a sop, but as a very real way of giving people an appreciation of the arts and a certain relaxation when they are studying extremely hard. To sit down with a good book or to listen to a good record can be extremely relaxing. People should be taught how to appreciate different styles of writing, classical art forms, modern art forms and so on for enjoyment and to develop a mental attitude, not just because somebody says they are good, but to get an appreciation of the arts. If the schools could give an education which would give people an appreciation of the arts we would have a better education system. I hope the Minister and his officials will take note of the motion put forward by the Labour group in the Seanad. It has the full support of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a useful and interesting debate. Those contributions I did not hear, I have had the benefit of reading in the Official Report. It is commoncase that we would all like to see the status of arts and the position of the arts in the educational system generally enhanced to the greatest possible degree. One could get the impression from listening to the debate that nothing has happened in so far as the Benson report, and other reports and their recommendations are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports in question are valuable. The broad thrust of these reports is valid and entirely acceptable, and entitled to serious consideration and implementation. <Col N="735" /> There are conclusions throughout the report on specific aspects with which one could quibble, occasional faults in statistics, but these minor points do not take from the general validity of the theme of the reports. The reports are acceptable and they form a basis for improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>The subject of the arts for people of my generation probably presents a different picture to younger citizens. We were inclined to regard the arts and things artistic, not quite as things foreign, but very often as things strange. The language of the arts is not always everyday language and the proponents of the arts are not always everyday people. Consequently, that fact tended to cause a divide in attitudes. There were vigorous advocates of the arts on one side and the plain people of Ireland on the other side, a little apprehensive and a little offput by what they sometimes saw as an elitist approach using precious language. That may be relevant to our generation, but it does not impinge on the consciousness of the younger people for the very good reason that the arts now take a much more important place in our education system than at the time we went through that system and there is not a strangeness about it.</P>
    <P>Talking about the system I take issue with Senator M. Higgins when he mentioned that there was a contrast between reason and imagination in the school system and he described this as a deadly cancer so present in the Irish education for so long. That is a travesty. That is not the position. There is ample room in our modern day curriculum for imagination and for initiative. The old fashioned emphasis on constant learning by rote has changed. The curriculum is designed to provoke initiative and imagination on the part of the pupils.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the reasons why the arts have not had the high place in the national consciousness that they should have had in recent and past times has been the strangeness with which that subject has appeared to garb itself in the eyes of so many Irish people. A telling phrase <Col N="736" /> used by Senator Higgins when he commented on the subject of creativity and how it is not something singular to certain gifted individuals but is something in everybody to be fostered, nurtured and brought out, was that artists always knew that but &ldquo;reflected in the lay phrase.&rdquo;. That phrase makes my point about strangeness. We have to be careful when we are trying to raise a consciousness of the arts that we do not turn off the audience to whom we are speaking.</P>
    <P>Much has been happening, not with a very high profile and perhaps not as fast or as comprehensively as people would like. We see that in the school system. One of the recommendations of the Benson report was for increased attention to in-service education, so that practising teachers could have the opportunity through in-service courses to become qualified to pass on artistic knowledge. Those courses take place and have been in place for some time. The variety, depth, length and scope of in-service courses is a matter of continuing debate rather than contention between me and the various teacher unions and the educational interests. We would like to provide more, and they would like more to be available. It is our ambition to move towards an ever greater supply of in-service courses. As we progress along that road, steadily but slowly, attention will be given to ensure that these courses provide training for primary teachers in arts and crafts, music and physical education which will include dance and drama.</P>
    <P>That aspect of the Benson report is not being neglected, though perhaps it is not being implemented with the vigour and scope one would like to see, because in-service courses are very expensive. Teachers have to be paid for attending in-service courses, and mounting these courses is very expensive. It makes heavy demand on resources. At the root of all of this, one question underlying this debate is resources. If we had unlimited resources we could do wonders to transform the Irish educational system in many ways, including the amount of attention given to the arts. I would not <Col N="737" /> like anyone to get the idea when I speak of resources and the educational system, that I am in any way implying that our educational system is defective. We have a very good educational system. Our graduates can stand comparison with their peers in any part of the world, that is, in so far as general technical education is concerned. I do not know how they compare in regard to their artistic education.</P>
    <P>A controversial recommendation in the Benson report is that we should provide specialist advisers. Senator Manager touched on this. The inspectors are the specialist advisers. We have an integrated inspectorate and we do not have a system of specialist specialists. Our inspectors have the capacity to perform as specialists in a number of areas. There is quite a resource among them in the artistic area also. We use their expertise in planning and conducting the in-service courses and arranging for specialists in various forms of the arts to conduct these courses whenever they are run.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is relevant to the teaching of art subjects is the question of physical facilities. This certainly points up the problem of resources, because to provide physical facilities is most expensive but in all the modern schools which are being provided there is a general purposes room included in the schedule of accommodation. These rooms, which are generally large in relation to the other accommodation, have the capacity to be used for a variety of purposes including any teaching in the arts whether it be painting, music, drama or dancing. They provide a proper physical environment for enhanced teaching of the arts. So, as the school building programme continues these facilities will continue to be provided. If Senators only knew the number of representatives and letters I receive, not just daily but many times each day, for new schools and extensions to schools, they would be aware of the tremendous demand for resources on something as basic as improved accommodation.</P>
    <P>The colleges of education which, of course, have a critical role to play <Col N="738" /> because they turn out the teachers who will have the responsibility for the development of our young people, have been reviewing the content of the courses in art subjects in the training of primary teachers. This matter was referred to specifically in the Programme for Action in Education 1984/87 which we are in the course of implementing and one of the objectives of that programme was to review the content and structure of the courses in the colleges of education with regard to art subjects. That review is presently under way.</P>
    <P>In regard to the entry qualification to colleges there is an allowance made for applicants who have a capacity in music. In the interviews for admission to the colleges one of the matters that is opened in the interview is to try to assess the candidates interest in art and cultural ideas generally. When we are recruiting the trainees to the colleges of education the arts get attention at the interview stage so that the pupils coming in are, if you like, attuned to the idea that they are not strangers to the concept of artistic development.</P>
    <P>In second level there has been movement also and while the number taking music, for example, is still not as high as we would like it to be, there has been a significant increase in recent years. The number of art teachers available in the post-primary level, both in the secondary schools as such and in the vocational schools, is increasing all the time because there is an ever growing demand on the part of parents for art to be a subject. This is eminently desirable and something obviously that we will encourage and would like to see continue.</P>
    <P>In my short time as Minister for Education I have had the opportunity to visit a reasonable number of schools at primary and secondary level and I have been struck by the fact that in every one of them there have been examples of pupils' art work on display. It is something that you nearly take for granted when you go into a school. There has been a fair amount of movement in that regard. Movement in the dance area is more difficult <Col N="739" /> because classical dancing, as opposed to folk dancing, is very specialised and, indeed, folk dancing can be quite specialised too.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan indicated that there is a latent desire on a wide scale among the Irish people for ballet and his evidence was the huge attendances to see the Bolshoi company. I wonder if a company as technically competent as the Bolshoi came to Dublin, but had not the label &ldquo;Bolshoi,&rdquo; would the attendances have been as high. It is a debatable point. There is no doubt that ballet is still seen as a very esoteric thing generally. There is a lot of ground to be made up in that regard. When I talk of folk dancing, I would have to take issue with Senator Lanigan on his criticism &mdash; it is going outside the scope of the debate I admit &mdash; of the Arts Council for their funding policy in relation to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí. This is a complex and controversial area which has been widely debated. The Arts Council have indicated their policy very clearly, and I think with a lot of justification, on how they administer what I think we would all say is a smaller budget than we would like them to have. As far as my knowledge of the Arts Council goes &mdash; not terribly deep but it has been acquired in recent times &mdash; I have never perceived any sign of an anti-Irish culture bias in the Arts Council. In fairness to the Arts Council I should put that on record.</P>
    <P>The third level is another area where one would like to see further progress, because at third level you are educating the potential teachers of the profession and professional artists. The regional technical colleges, without exception, provide courses in art leading to certificates and diplomas at various levels which, in turn, entitle the pupils to go further to obtain professional qualification as teachers, or can be the <i>entrée</i> into the world of design. They again have enhanced the public consciousness of that form of art. Thomond College, I understand, recently devised a degree course in drama and the teachers who take that degree course will be qualified to teach <Col N="740" /> drama and will raise the appreciation and knowledge of drama as an art form in the schools to which they are eventually allotted. This is not something that will happen nationally overnight. It is taking place little by little all the time. It is not dramatic; it does not have a high profile.</P>
    <P>Because of those two considerations one might get the impression that not much is happening, but there is a lot happening. More will happen as public consciousness of the importance of the arts in everyday life is heightened and debates such as this, for example, can do that. Extra-curricular activities by teachers are also extremely important. Yesterday evening I had the pleasure of presenting prizes for an art competition, the first such competition, run by the Teachers' Union of Ireland for pupils in their schools and for teachers in their schools. They were very pleased with the response they got. It is an indication of how interest in the arts can be fostered. Competitions tend to improve standards, and thereby standards can be improved without the application of scarce resources.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned the good teachers up and down the country who have given time voluntarily, outside school hours, to provide music lessons and drama lessons for their pupils. I would like to echo his tribute to them, both lay and religious, for the work they have done.</P>
    <P>Another thing that struck me is the number of schools that have school bands or school orchestras. That is growing. I do not want to sound complacent about the place of the arts in our educational system. What I want to do is to strike a balance, to reassure the House that things are happening in relation to these reports, to assure the House that, so far as I am concerned and the Department of Education are concerned, there is a willingness to ensure that this movement is continued and, within the resources available to us, to enhance it and extend it. I cannot say to the House that I will be able to make extra resources available in this coming financial year for this area. I will be put to the pin of my collar to <Col N="741" /> maintain the resources which I had last year to keep the show on the road, if I may put it like that, without making any pun. Nevertheless, there are things relating to organisation and matters of mood and encouragement which can be implemented without the application of financial resources.</P>
    <P>Senator Howlin mentioned the possibility of a special unit to deal with the provision of education in the arts. That is something I will have examined so that all that is taking place in the educational scene can be co-ordinated and that pioneers, perhaps in some artistically barren educational outpost, trying to bring enlightenment to those areas and a heightened perception and consciousness of the arts generally and their benefit, will have encouragement and will not be left alone. Quite a lot is happening. We want to make sure that that momentum is continued, is increased, and that we will achieve what is the common case among us all: an enhanced place in our educational system for the arts.</P>
    <P>I know, my Department know and we all know that it can only be for the benefit of those who go through our educational system that they should have exposure to the arts to the greatest degree possible. That is our ambition and I am grateful to Senators for highlighting the need for that in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief as usual. May I use ten seconds of my time to thank you for having the door fixed. It was the quickest piece of work done by the Office of Public Works since I came into the Seanad and I hope you, a Chathaoirleach, will thank them for doing such quick work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a serving teacher at primary level I would not like the idea to go abroad that things are rather bad or slow in the arts section. I know ballet is difficult in the country. It is easier in the cities where visitors come and display things. At primary level at the moment there is a tremendous advance in art, whether it is music or painting. The Minister mentioned <Col N="742" /> an exhibition of paintings. Competitions are being held regularly, to depict road safety and so on.</P>
    <P>When I was trained more than five years ago, we had a completely different line altogether. When a new curriculum came in we all thought it was a bit up in the air. The younger teachers are coming out with a much more liberal training. The older teachers might feel they should start getting down to the nitty-gritty but, in fact, they have a very broad range of skills coming out of training. In many schools we have our traditional Irish music and our Irish dancing being taught and, in the long run, that is very important. In some schools where they are lucky enough to have skilled musicians, music is being taught and some of the teachers spend a lot of their time at night helping as well.</P>
    <P>Drama is very much part of primary education at this stage and in most schools is being used &mdash; sometimes in Irish conversation lessons &mdash; where children act out the parts, or in school concerts which are quite common. Much work is going into this and school concerts have done a tremendous amount too, especially in rural areas, to give children confidence to get up on stage, whether they are acting, singing, dancing or whatever they are doing. It has certainly brought them on a long way, and has given them equal opportunity. The integration of all these art subjects has done a tremendous amount to give the children the opportunity to do something that, a few years ago, one could say they did not readily have the opportunity to do. Long ago many of the buildings were not suitable.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned GP rooms. I teach in a rural school and it is always a source of amazement to visitors that we got a GP room when we got an extension. It has been a tremendous asset to the school whether it is for GP, a concert, or whatever you wish to use it for. While they are costly, I would certainly encourage the Department to continue putting a GP room into any school of a reasonable size. It cannot be built on to every two teacher school, I suppose, but it is something <Col N="743" /> that has given a great fillip. It would be unfair to many teachers throughout the country, to give the impression that art is almost dead. I have to accept that, when it comes to ballet and so on, it is reasonably dead, but it is difficult to cope with as the Minister has said. Go raibh maith agat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the mover of the motion, my colleague Senator Michael D. Higgins, and the other members of the Labour Party, with his permission I want an opportunity to respond to the motion as it appears on the Order Paper. It is a very easy task for me to do so because the response of Senators was so positive. The facts as outlined by Senator M. Higgins in introducing the motion speak for themselves. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the progress that has been made, but all the contributions from all sides of the House, from Senator Howlin, who seconded the motion, from Senators Mullooly, Burke, McGonagle, Cassidy, Higgins, Magner, Lanigan, Browne, who is a teacher, must be a reassurance to the Minister that there is widespread support in this House for the concept enshrined in this motion which calls upon the Minister to further his awareness of the need for a structure to stimulate arts in education.</P>
      <P>From the Minister's response I know that, within the restrictions upon him, he is doing what is possible to try, in his own words, to keep the show on the road, and that he is aware of the special interest all of us have in the formalisation of a structure within the educational system that would identify arts as an important facet of the development of the human and something that would be to the benefit of mankind as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator M. Higgins has given sufficient proof that if we take account of the requirements of people in the development of their whole way of thinking in a changing society, society itself will be the better for that. People will adjust more readily to the massive changes, technological and otherwise, that are taking place in society which allow them so <Col N="744" /> much spare time. We are dogged with the spectre of unemployment. If people have access to art as part of their education, they may be able to appreciate the better things in life.</P>
    <P>The Minister wondered, in response to Senator Lanigan's comment about the Bolshoi Ballet, whether, if the Bolshoi name was not attached to the ballet, it would be as successful. Most of us would condemn the political system in the country in which the Bolshoi Ballet originates. We would all prefer our own form of democracy and the freedom of the individual. That is a State whose system of democracy we would question, because it is closer to a dictatorship. Because they have a firm structure and a commitment by the State to the development of arts in any form, and in particular the ballet, they have produced technical expertise which has given tremendous entertainment to people throughout the world. That, in itself, is an indictment of our own system.</P>
    <P>We seem to regard art as being non critical in times of restriction and widespread unemployment. In the race for money something as important as the arts could be neglected. This would be a tragedy for ourselves and for our children's future. I am sure the Minister realises that there would be widespread support in this House for any additional allocation towards the promotion of arts in education. The Minister said he is satisfied things are moving. He admits they are moving quietly and that they are not making any headlines or are not the subject of widespread favourable comment because only those specifically involved in them are aware that there are changes in the curricula. In spite of our past neglect we have been fortunate in that we have produced so many world famous artists in all forms &mdash; music, song, dance, drama and so on. We have a place among nations with a reputation of having produced tremendous artists. We are all very proud of them.</P>
    <P>Years ago there was very little available to people in their own homes apart from the master tutor, the parent of the <Col N="745" /> family, who was able to hand on some of the culture we are now so proud of.</P>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, who have been the subject of widespread comment and discussion, have done work in the area of our national music and dance which we must all commend. Any time we can be of assistance to them &mdash; and the Government have been of assistance to them &mdash; we should do so without any reluctance because the end result speaks for itself and throughout the world, has been a reflection of what our society was and what we would all wish it to be. However, I will not go into that because the area of adult education in the arts is probably outside this motion. We are more anxious that structures should be set up in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted some comments from Senator M. Higgins and took issue with some of Senator Higgins' phraseology. Most of us admire the commitment of Senator Higgins in this area. There are other quotations from his speech which the Minister should take on board as reflecting the exact situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries in Europe. As reported at column 493 of the Official Report of 15 October, quoting from the Herron report Senator Higgins said:</P>
    <P>The number of inhabitants in Norway is 3.8 million. The number of official schools of music is 193. The number of inhabitants per music school is 19,900. In Denmark there are 4.9 million people; there are 207 schools of music; and the number of inhabitants per music school is 23,700. In Finland there are 4.7 million people; there are 82 music schools, and the number of inhabitants per music school is 57,300.</P>
    <P>He went on to state:</P>
    <P>In Ireland the number of inhabitants is 3.4 million; there are four schools of music; and there are 850,000 inhabitants per music school.</P>
    <P>Senator M. Higgins says that tells a story. That is a suitable statement to quote from. We might not agree with his <Col N="746" /> phraseology. But these are facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a long way to go in trying to achieve some of the dedication towards a structure in the schools and in the school curriculum which would accent the importance of arts in education. I should like to quote finally from Senator Higgins because, in fairness to him in his absence, he would accept some of the things the Minister said. He said:</P>
      <P>Finally, there is the question about curriculum reform. There should be provision within the school system, within the new curriculum at all levels, for the arts.</P>
      <P>He said:</P>
      <P>I know and welcome every single innovation that has been made.</P>
      <P>He is accepting what the Minister said, that innovations have been made and he welcomes them. He said:</P>
      <P>However, let me draw a distinction about innovations that have been introduced by individual teachers.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Lanigan and the Minister I wish to commend the individual teachers who have shown a flair in this area. We are looking for something a little bit more structured than the flair of individual teachers. We commend them for that flair. We believe that if you just take individuals who have a special interest in particular forms of art their pupils will benefit but if you have other teachers who do not have the same interest, then their pupils, through no fault of their own, could be losing out in the whole area of developing their talents in arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Higgins also drew a distinction <Col N="747" /> between that kind of individual teacher aptitude and private collections in schools to fund little orchestras. I join with Senator Magner in his favourable comments about vocational education committees who have been to the forefront in stimulating grants and assistance for various enterprises within the schools structure to assisting in the formation of orchestras and all sorts of drama groups, musical societies and everything else, all of which we are very proud of.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party believe &mdash; and I think this has been supported by all sides of the House &mdash; that something else needs to be done by way of a more formal structure to take into account some of the reports we have quoted in this motion. I believe from the Minister's response that he is not unmindful of our concern in this area. We know improvements have taken place. They are slow. We are all impatient. Money is not always as available to the Minister as he would wish. We are impatient in this area. We had unanimous agreement in our group on how we should word the motion because we felt that it was worthy of debate and support by all Senators. The interest shown has proved that this was a worthy subject for discussion.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for coming in to respond to us as a Minister with Cabinet responsibility who can influence the actual provision of additional funding for this whole area. I do not want to join Senator Magner in his pleas for individuals because I could be very parochial also, having come from the stage into politics. It is an area where we have a great interest. We feel it would benefit the people, the children and our future residents to have a formal structure and not to be dependent on individuals who have a particular flair. Much as we admire them &mdash; and they are absolutely vital to what is happening at the moment &mdash; we would like a formalised structure to ensure that arts will not be forgotten in the whole educational process.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Control of Dogs Bill, 1986: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>When one comes from artistic business straight on to the control of dogs it can create some problems in one's thinking. However, this legislation is important and earlier I was trying to outline how I felt the previous scheme of licensing dogs and collection of dog licences had been a failure simply because it gave the Garda Síochána responsibility for collecting dog licences and the owners of dogs never saw any value whatsoever in a licensing procedure which had no provision for stray dogs and dogs that caused damage to people's property, livestock and children. Humans have also suffered from stray dogs which were out of control. That is why the previous scheme was a failure. Some people &mdash; even people on the Animal Health Council &mdash; felt there should be no licences for dogs, that there should be no licences for cats, dogs, or any pet animals. To have a scheme which would effectively control stray dogs some system of funding would have to be available. The appropriate ministry to handle this would be the Department of the Environment. Local authorities are aware of the existing voluntary arrangements under the aegis of the ISPCA.</P>
      <P>I come from a county which has made its own contribution to this problem. We allocated a capital sum of £40,000 to £50,000 to build a dog shelter. We provided the site for it and we handed over to the ISPCA the running, management and leasing of that premises. We also grant-aided them each year to try to carry out a limited form of dog control and control by wardens. That structure is there. I am glad this Bill is capable of complementing that structure and using it. If county councils feel they are unable to take responsibility for a dog warden system, it can be done in conjunction with the recognised agencies in the area already effectively producing a system of dog control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> There are various items, sections in the Bill with which I want to deal briefly because submissions were made to me by various interested parties. I want to deal with those items rather than quote some of the statistics that I have from working with the Animal Health Council. I want to compliment the Minister's inter-departmental team on their expertise and knowledge in this area and their receptiveness to suggestions from many quarters including the Animal Health Council, the ISPCA and all the people involved in the whole area of dog management, ownership and control.</P>
    <P>I come from a family directly involved in the industry. They have reservations that some sections in this Bill could be so interpreted or implemented to the letter of the law, so to speak, as to make the continuing ownership of dogs &mdash; and I mean responsible ownership of dogs &mdash; extremely difficult in rural areas in particular and, indeed, also in urban areas, when we consider sections that control the level of barking, whereby it is possible for one neighbour to take another neighbour to court about the level of noise or barking. I heard a complaint and I requested the planning officer to investigate it. He had to put a recording machine in the kennel to decide if there was a level of barking which justified the complaint. In regard to new regulations for the housing of dogs I want some clarification from the Minister in his reply and I will be dealing with this subject on the various sections. I want to ensure that no area of doubt will be left in the minds of people involved in this industry as to what we are about. No member of the public involved in the dog business &mdash; breeding, racing, canine clubs, the ISPCA or any other such responsible body &mdash; had any word to say against the concept of controlling unwanted dogs which create widespread havoc throughout the country, nobody objected to that concept. The Minister referred to the farming organisations. They have been in the forefront in the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture, for years in trying to make the various Departments get their act together at last and grapple with <Col N="750" /> this problem of uncontrolled dogs.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with the problems that might arise with the local authority who will be the employer of the warden and will also be the statutory, planning office which will require the warden to inspect premises. At the moment there are many kennel premises of a very high standard. Generally people in that ownership bracket want to ensure that some of these dogs which are extremely valuable would be kept in the most hygienic and satisfactory housing possible with the funds available to them. A planning authority should take into account the differences in dog sizes, dog weights and dog breeds. Here the Bill talks about numbers. It talks about a number over five dogs. Anyone with six or seven dogs will be required by law to have a certain standard of accommodation for them. If we have five Irish wolfhounds and we have six chihuahuas or Pekingese, where do the numbers come into play then? The accommodation needed for labradors or greyhounds or Irish wolfhounds would be so much greater than for small pet dogs which are now very popular such as York-shire terriers and other such breeds. They represent a big export industry, one we must ensure is not interfered with in any way. The number of dogs might mean nothing to a planning authority. I think it will be imperative for the Minister when he is making regulations bringing some of these sections into force to have regard for the differences involved in dog sizes and pedigree. I also join with Senator Hussey in his very important point that when local authorities employ dog wardens they will have to be confident and trained to understand dogs, know how to handle dogs and take care of dogs. One of the submissions that has come through to us from the ISPCA is that there should never be a Bill initiated in the House that would be anti-dog. Nobody wants any level of cruelty to follow the detention of dogs or the seizing of dogs by wardens. Dogs must be handled with due care. Just because some owners have abandoned and ignored and left them to their own devices as regards feeding and so on, just because dogs are <Col N="751" /> strays, they need to be treated as humanely as possible. It is imperative that wardens have the competence and expertise to do that.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that local authorities be requested and directed by the Minister to initiate a training programme for people who will be employed. I can think of nobody better to be involved in that training than the ISPCA. The ISPCA, to their eternal credit, have been involved in this whole area of care of dogs, injured dogs and unwanted dogs, down through the years with no recompense from anybody with the exception of some local authorities, such as my own local authority, who have given them small grants to do the very important work they have been doing.</P>
    <P>Training of the wardens will be vital. Reservations have been expressed to me by people who are involved with canine clubs about the right of a warden to enter on to property and seize a dog which, in his opinion, is a stray dog. Concern is being expressed by canine club members who hold and own the most expensive dogs. They do not want wardens who would not have a proper knowledge to go in and take dogs from them just because it might not be possible at that moment to produce a licence or if there was any doubt about a licence. They do not want a warden to go in, take away a very important pure-bred animal and lock it away in a dog warden's shelter for five or six days and have it mix with animals that may have all sorts of infection when infection is so important in the case of pure-bred dogs and the showing of dogs. It is important that there be a level of competence in dog wardens. I hope they would have regard for private property and would use this power of entry on to private property with caution.</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts that the Garda Síochána with a search warrant have certain rights to enter into property in the interests of the public good but one would question the total power of a dog warden to enter on to property, particularly if in his opinion a dog was a stray dog, when it might have been that a child had <Col N="752" /> opened the gate and allowed the dog on to the road accidentally. They must have some balance in their attitude towards what is a genuine stray dog, one that should be taken off the road, and dogs which are pedigree and quite valuable.</P>
    <P>There are some other sections in the Bill which have created concern in the minds of people who are experts in this field. Although I have relatives who are considered experts I certainly am not an expert. I would like to try to make sure the legislation is operable and will take account of the comments we will make on the various sections. People of a certain age are here precluded from owning dogs. It would not be possible for anybody under the age of 16 under section 4 to have a dog licence. In the area of pedigree show dogs there are sections involving junior handling competitions in which ten year olds and upwards have competed not alone in Ireland but internationally and successfully. One of the delights of these young people is the fact that they own the dog. I presume that by ownership a licence is required and that in certain categories one should have regard to people younger than the age of majority, the age of 16, and that it would be possible for the Minister to exempt certain categories which might include&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The parents' licence would cover that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the ownership is of paramount importance to the young person, that ownership is one of the ways of recognising that the dog is theirs, that they look after it, that they showed it and that they won, that it was their dog and not their father's. It is important that licence and ownership be distinct and separate if possible, particularly for that category that I am interested in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a worry about the number of dogs and the fact that having over five dogs means certain requirements have to be met. I have outlined the requirements for planning and otherwise. I take it that the licence fee of £5 is for individual dogs <Col N="753" /> and that it is only when the number goes over 20 that one is required to take out a general dog licence of £100. Fears were expressed when the number five was used, that when there were more than five dogs it would cost £100. I tried to reassure the people that that was not the case.</P>
    <P>The Irish Kennel Club which is a very important organisation already have certain standards laid down for ownership, registration, pedigrees and so on that they require their members to attain before they can show dogs. They deserve to be a category the Minister might consider under section 5 (h). The Minister might consider exempting that particular category of club, because of their expertise in this area and the work they have done already. There is another category which was mentioned by the sub-committee of the Animal Health Council as being worthy of consideration, namely, old age blind pensioners and so on. In the area of blind pensioners I am sure that they will be covered by the Irish Guide Dogs Association clause. These dogs even though they are with blind people are still in the ownership of this association. It is unthinkable that we should insist that the Irish Guide Dogs Association would have to licence each one of their animals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an exemption for the blind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope it will be implemented. Some amendments to various sections have also been suggested. At this stage I will put them on the record so that before Committee Stage of the Bill there will be an opportunity to look at these submissions. They suggest that all dogs owned by the Irish Guide Dogs Association and any dogs trained by that association kept and wholly or mainly used for the purpose of guidance of a blind person or persons whose eyesight is so defective that he is unable to find his way about without guidance should be included. It is felt that that section should be in to ensure that this category is covered. They believe it is imperative <Col N="754" /> that this section be included to take cognisance of the fact that stray, loose and uncontrolled dogs can endanger and inhibit the safety and mobility of blind persons using a guide dog. The appropriate fine should be imposed on people who are found guilty of having stray dogs which could interfere with guide dogs. They also suggest that section 17 (2) (c) should be amended by the following:</P>
      <P>That all dogs, the property of the Irish Guide Dogs Association shall have full right of access to all public buildings and places nationally, except in zoos or wildlife parks and such places where the common good of other animals could be interfered with.</P>
      <P>This is not an unreasonable suggestion from them, that dogs should have access to public buildings. I would hate to feel this category of dogs which are for a very specific purpose were not exempted under the Bill, and would not have access to places such as this. Cognisance should be taken of the fact that they are a special case and special problems could arise if for some reason the Bill precluded them from entry into premises where they might cause a nuisance.</P>
      <P>Old age pensioners need dogs, especially nowadays with the amount of infringement there is on their privacy, with the attacks on their privacy by vandals, and so on and for their own safety. Dogs are a reassurance to them. A dog is almost more important to them than an insurance policy. Paragraph (h) of section 5, which allows the Minister to specify other classes such as old age pensioners and other welfare recipients, should provide for a waiver of the licence fee. I am in favour of licensing every dog but there are categories in respect of which a waiver scheme should be brought in. I hope the Minister will consider this when he is replying to the various points made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other areas covered in the Bill on which reservations have been expressed. Pedigree dog owners have said it is impossible to have a collar on a dog at all times when the dog is under control. In other words, when the dog is <Col N="755" /> in its kennel it would be unreasonable to expect him to wear a collar. Apart from the discomfort to the dog, it creates damage to his coat and neckline. A certain amount of commonsense should be used by wardens, particularly if they walk in to inspect a number of dogs in any premises. I hope the Minister will take on board my comment about the level of accommodation required for specific sizes of dogs.</P>
    <P>Section 19 (2) deals with owners of premises who have more than five dogs and provides that &ldquo;such premises may not be used for such purposes as may be specified in the regulations unless such premises are registered with the relevant local authority.&rdquo; I am hoping all existing premises will not be examined together with the result that half of them will be closed down. This would create widespread disruption in the dog industry. I would like new regulations to be brought in. The regulations should be reasonable ones which can be implemented. For all new applicants I would accept that, in order to comply with a planning regulation, certain specifications must be met in line with the breed of dog to be kept in them. The association are worried that if you suddenly apply for permission to have six dogs in a kennel in your private premises, either for sporting reasons or for showing as a hobby, the local authority might consider that particular private residence as a business premises for the purpose of rating. I do not think anyone would envisage that people who keep dogs for pastime or for purposes such as pleasure for their children, should be penalised by the rating authority saying they have not got a private residence and will be rated accordingly. I want to ensure that this kind of anomaly will not arise in the implementation of the various orders the Minister may make.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the principle of the Bill has been accepted by all of us and by the industry in particular. They are worried about the rigid implementation of some of the regulations as they read them. For a layman the Parliamentary Draftsman's wording can <Col N="756" /> always be inhibiting and you have to explain to him how you would perceive it as a legislator. I have told people that the Minister, in rationalising much of the previous legislation in this area, had regard to the existing legislation and the new legislation we felt was necessary. The reality is that some of the previous legislation was never enforced by anybody and could not be enforced.</P>
    <P>I hope that the kind of funding the Minister is talking about for the various local authorities will be generously used by them. If a local authority like my own make an effort to improve the service they already have and employ more than one dog warden &mdash; which I believe is totally ineffective in any county &mdash; that should be recognised. The Minister's speech referred to county councils and boroughs; there can be more and I think there should be more. The incentive should be there for more wardens.</P>
    <P>If the legislation is implemented, as Senator Hussey stated, according to the letter of the law revenue can accrue which would allow for control over unwanted dogs and would give protection for livestock and so on. It would also provide a home for dogs over that period in which an effort could be made to trace the owners, and would mean that access would be available to people who want to report a dog that they have genuinely lost. If we implement the scheme in the spirit of the law, funds should be available to us and this would be an incentive to employ a sufficient number of competently trained people. I mention local authorities at county level; I take it that urban councils and other such small bodies will not necessarily be required to operate the scheme, that it will be confined to 27 county councils and city boroughs and that the Minister will not expect smaller town commissioners, urban councils or small corporations to implement this. Many of the problems are within urban areas but operation and administration at county level would be more efficient.</P>
    <P>I hope that with the commitment the Department have given to this and with <Col N="757" /> the co-operation of all the various Ministers who have been involved in this so far &mdash; there have been so many that we would not get any one Minister to take responsibility for it &mdash; the Bill will be successful. I am glad the Minister has chosen the Department of the Environment. As a member of a local authority I feel that the mechanism is there to do it and I hope that when dogs are collected by trained wardens and have to be destroyed that will be carried out either under veterinary supervision or under the jurisdiction of a veterinary surgeon. We will be bringing in other legislation involving slaughterhouses which will require local authorities to employ a veterinary surgeon. I want to be satisfied that any destruction of dogs that takes place will be done in a humanitarian way and that it will be proper euthanasia, that there will be a commitment on humanitarian grounds to doing it properly. It does not always have to be a vet who does the job but I hope that if the wardens are doing it, it will be done under the direction of a veterinary surgeon, one that they will be taught how to give the injections, where they are intravenous or peritoneal. If done correctly the dog will not suffer.</P>
    <P>Reservations have also been expressed about the actual spaying or castration of dogs if they are going to be given back to other people. It is imperative that that operation be done by a veterinary surgeon. I do not think anybody else would be competent to do it correctly. We should make that essential if we are going to give a dog back to somebody who assures us that he will be kind and give a good home to a stray dog and will deal with it properly so that it will not reproduce unwanted dogs and add to the growing problem of dogs wandering around our streets and our sheep farms causing great loss to livestock and to farmers generally.</P>
    <P>The Bill will address some of the problems. It will need commitment from local authority members from all sides of the House to ensure that we grapple with this new challenge and employ competent people to do the job. I hope that the <Col N="758" /> genuine concern and interests of people involved in the professional dog industry will be taken into account and that they will not feel that this legislation penalises them. Up to now they have been the responsible people in the area of dog ownership. This legislation is directed at the people who have neglected their responsibilities. Responsible bodies may feel that they are going to be penalised with many new requirements. They may feel it is being unfair to them. We need to do a certain amount of PR work on this legislation. I hope that by the time the Bill passes through this House with the various amendments that have been suggested by various interests that it will have met the challenge that has been thrown down by various sections in society.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to thank the Minister and his staff for the courteous way they have always listened to the problems we have had in this area. It is good to see the legislation before us for discussion at long last. I hope it will not be too long before it becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief on this Bill. I would like to congratulate the Minister for sponsoring it. Obviously, it is a Bill that can be improved as a result of discussion in this House and when it has been discussed in the other House we may have a much stronger Bill at the end of the day. That is the intention of all legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15, probably as far as the local authorities are concerned, is the principal provision. It requires every local authority to employ one or more dog wardens for the purpose of the Act and to establish and maintain dog shelters. This section also authorises local authorities, with the consent of the Minister, to make arrangements with any person for the provision and maintenance of these shelters and to carry out the functions of detaining, disposing of and destroying stray and unwanted dogs. It also authorises the local authorities to delegate all or any of their functions under the Act, except the making of by-laws and the prosecution of offenders, to other local authorities or to <Col N="759" /> the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals or with the consent of the Minister to a person connected with animal welfare.</P>
    <P>It indicates in the legislation that local authorities can build shelters and receive a grant of 50 per cent of the capital cost. A figure of £40,000 is mentioned as being the kind of figure that would build a suitable shelter. I am not able to comment on whether that is correct, but it seems quite a low figure for a fairly large city or a large town. I should imagine that something more substantial would be required. The biggest problem I see is that while the Minister for Agriculture is sponsoring it, the actual implementation will be by the county councils, that is, the 27 local authorities and, I think, five borough councils. There is no mention, for example, of large urban district councils. I am wondering if they should be brought into it. If we take a town like Athlone, which is the largest town in County Westmeath and is 28 miles from the administrative seat in Mullingar, even one country warden would not be sufficient. In Mullingar there is a large dog population. In my own town of Athlone I have no hesitation in saying that it would be virtually impossible for a dog warden to control the number of stray dogs in the large housing estates. Perhaps urban councils might also be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I support the view that this Bill is necessary. There is no doubt that stray dogs have caused much damage to sheep flocks and to the health of our population. They are causing car and pedal cycle accidents, not to mention attacking adults and children. With a dog population of 700,000 there is a need to tackle the problem and I support the view that something is being done about it. Having made that point, I again go back to the fact that it is going to be difficult for the local authorities to get involved and to provide funds.</P>
    <P>I know there is an awareness that this might be in some way self-financing. If we examine the various Bills that have come before this House and the other House, for example, the Bills dealing <Col N="760" /> with litter, with casual trading and air pollution, we will see they were given to the local authorities to implement without one penny of cash being allocated for their implementation. The same will apply here. Even though there is provision for a self-financing scheme, as Senator Ferris said, it is going to require a very real commitment from the local authorities and from all connected with them such as elected members and staff, to have this Bill really effective. I praise the Minister wholeheartedly for endeavouring to bring it forward and hope it will be implemented. If it can be implemented, it would certainly solve many of the problems we have in regard to the dog population of this country.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the Bill I would like to comment on briefly. The role of the warden will be vital. Obviously he is going to be the key man in the same way as a traffic warden is in relation to traffic regulations. In my opinion he must be well trained, have an interest in dogs and know what he is about. He has to know how to handle dogs, be a man with a flair for dogs, one who probably has had dogs all his life and would, therefore, have some feel for the dog scene. His role will be important. How he is going to manage, I do not know because certainly the number of dogs in the large estates has increased out of all proportion over the past number of years. The number of licences on the other hand reduced to 85,000 and is a staggering low figure. There is room for improvement there.</P>
    <P>The question of cruelty to greyhounds is something that deserves to be monitored. There is cruelty to greyhounds and to all breeds of dogs generally. Many people do not feed their dogs properly. Dogs sleep in gardens in hail, rain or snow. That kind of situation is not fair. Dogs are allowed to roam and get their food from the litter bins of the nation. That situation cannot be tolerated. If the Bill does nothing but stop that element of cruelty it will be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the ownership of dogs. I can understand the thinking on it. A parents' licence will suffice in the case of the under 16s. As Senator Ferris <Col N="761" /> said, children love to have dogs. I keep a few greyhounds. My own sons loved to have their own greyhounds in their own names. They were only 12, 14 or 15 years old but they took an interest in them. They would walk them and train them. It is a pity this cannot be done. Remember that this year a greyhound owned by a 15 year old boy from Limerick won an important race. It is something to consider. For the greyhound and the dogs that are shown there might be some other form of licence introduced separately and distinctly from the parents' licence. It would be a nice gesture. It is nice to have children interested in dogs. If they have a love for dogs at an early age it will stay with them for the rest of their lives. We are a nation of dog lovers. Everybody likes to own a dog. Every farmer in Ireland has a terrier, a Jack Russell or a sheep dog. He may not want them for his cattle or his sheep.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey referred to greyhounds. Farmers have an interest in greyhounds. It is a sideline for them and for many of them it is lucrative. There is nothing wrong with it and I think it is a beautiful pastime. Section 10 prohibits greyhounds in any public place unless they are being held by means of an efficient lead, a strong chain or leash. A person cannot be allowed to lead more than four greyhounds at any time in a public place. I agree with the figure of four or five or maybe even three. Dog owners generally would welcome it. My experience is that if a cat or a terrier meets one with four greyhounds it will be very hard to hold on to the four greyhounds.</P>
    <P>I would also welcome regulations regarding a leash and a muzzle. Greyhound owners keep their dogs in kennels travelling to a race meeting. They will keep a muzzle on their dogs. The dog has to race with muzzle. Rather than lick himself during the day it is preferable that he should have a muzzle. There are many reasons why muzzles are kept on greyhounds. If a person is on the road with four greyhounds and if a cat or a terrier passes quickly, the nature of the greyhound is such that they are likely to <Col N="762" /> fight. Many of them are fiery and if they are not fiery one should be asking questions. Some of them are so fiery they will fight among themselves even though they are kennel mates or may be brothers and sisters. I should like the Minister to consider that point on Committee Stage. Not alone should they have leads on them but they might also have muzzles. I would recommend that for the dog's sake and for the person who is leading the dog. There is also the question of young schoolboys walking dogs. Many of them would not be able to control four greyhounds. I am wondering if the Minister should introduce an upper age limit or a lower age limit to take care of that section. It is something for consideration.</P>
    <P>There are one or two sections that might not be workable. Section 11 says that members of the Garda can seize stray dogs. If we are going to have trained dog wardens it should be left to those people rather than to the gardaí. They have other important work. I cannot see the gardaí running out at night collecting dogs. That is not workable and I would like the Minister to consider that. The gardaí would not want that kind of work because over the years they have not been engaged in it. Up to now it was the responsibility of the Department of Justice to collect licences. The fact that we have had a reduction in ten years to 85,000 licences indicates that this scheme has not been successful. Hopefully, if the commitment is there it will be successful with the local authorities but it is going to be a very difficult task. I hope that the local authorities enter into the spirit of this legislation as the Minister would like them to do. As a local authority member I will encourage the employment of dog wardens and the building of shelters in many towns.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister in bringing forward this Bill although there are elements with which we might disagree. Senator Ferris referred to a waiver scheme for old people who are keeping their dogs at home. They see it as a protection and as an alarm system within their own homes. If a waiver scheme could be introduced to allow old people <Col N="763" /> to be exempt from having a licence it would be welcome. The Bill is welcome. I hope the commitment the Minister would like everybody to have towards the Bill will be there. Hopefully, it will be a success in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for his initiative in bringing this legislation to the House today. It has been long awaited. It is good to see it this far. Hopefully it will pass through this House and the other House quickly and be put into effect in good time before the coming season of sheep lambing. I appreciate that the Bill has wider and broader connotations than the protection of sheep. Nevertheless, it has a very big bearing in that area. When one mentions sheep it is no harm to remind ourselves that the estimated losses as a result of dog attacks and dog marauding on a per annum basis is something like £3 million per year taking into account the direct losses to sheep owners and the consequential loss in the thriving of the sheep and their progeny. We are talking about a loss of £3 million per annum. That is a very substantial figure in one sector of our agricultural economy in relation to the total sheep scene, which is worth something of the order of £54 million on an annual basis. Our sheep exports are to the value of £27 million mainly to France and the rest to Belgium, Italy and Germany. The other £27 million is in respect of the home market. We are talking about something very substantial in the sheep market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has broader and wider connotations. It is to do with the protection of dogs. It has a major role in the matter of health and hygiene as it relates to humans. Anything that impinges on human health in any direct or indirect way or form is something we must be very careful about. We have accidents in the case of humans and the protection of other animals. A wide range of matter is covered in this Bill. The dog population need the protection of a Bill. Various <Col N="764" /> bodies have been discussing and proposing matters that have led to the situation today where the Minister has introduced this Bill. This happened as a result of very strong proposals and criticism from political parties, the farming organisations and the various persons involved in the animal welfare situation. It is relevant to note that in 1983 a very important inter-departmental committee was established under the chairmanship of the Department of Agriculture. The Departments of Justice, of the Environment, of Finance and of Health took part. That committee formed a basis for the various proposals in today's Bill. The Minister has had numerous consultations with that inter-departmental committee. That committee has had consultations with various bodies right through their time of operation.</P>
    <P>Another body that is worthy of mention is the National Dog Control Committee which was chaired since 1979 by Mr. Larry Lenihan, former chairman of the IFA National Sheep Committee and a renowned chairman of COPA Sheep Committee, which is a farming organisation grouping within the EC. That dog control committee included farming organisation representatives, representation from Dublin Corporation, the Dublin Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Irish Veterinary Union and a number of other interested parties. That committee have worked hard and consistently since 1979 and have had made various submissions to various quarters. It is a fine achievement for that group, with others, to see the culmination of their work emanating in the form of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some persons will quibble and find some fault with certain aspects of the Bill. The only reservations I have heard expressed are from some persons in the greyhound industry. I believe that any reasonable assurances that are required by the greyhound industry <i>vis-à-vis</i> the housing of greyhounds or planning ought to be given. Appropriate amendments should be made on Committee Stage to accommodate any reservations that might come forward. The greyhound <Col N="765" /> industry is a multimillion pound industry. We must make certain that we do not set that industry back in any way.</P>
    <P>The Bill embraces all existing legislation and consolidates into one statute all matters pertaining to dog control. This Bill will supersede and combine all legislation pertaining to dogs that exists over the past number of years. It will implement controls to eliminate the problems of dogs roaming the countryside and the streets of towns and cities. That is a major dimension of the whole situation.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind the whole question of attacks on human beings by dogs, particularly children. Unfortunately, there are all too many instances where children have been very severely attacked by dogs and mutilated in many instances. We have the whole question of environmental pollution of sidewalks, parks, beaches and other public places. Excrement from dogs has led to a very serious problem in many places.</P>
    <P>Traffic accidents can be attributed directly in many cases to uncontrolled dogs. There is also the danger of transmission of disease, for example, rabies. Thankfully we do not have that disease in Ireland. With the various advances and the nearness of European countries there is always a risk that rabies could come to Ireland. It is something of which we must be mindful. Apart from rabies, we have other diseases which are a very serious health risk to children. There are other illnesses that lead to blindness. With the excrement from dogs on the streets and with children's normal habit of playing in the streets, there is a very high risk factor of salmonella and many other forms of infection with which young people can be contaminated. This would also extend to the adult population. All this is in the environment. One does not have to come in direct contact with the product itself.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the number of dogs in this State. The general broad figure is that there is one dog to each five persons, which gives a rough estimate of approximately 700,000 dogs. <Col N="766" /> That is a substantial figure. While there is no official statistics available to confirm that this is the figure with regard to dog population, information has been compiled by various reputable bodies, including the Economic and Social Research Institute. The surveys indicate that 51 per cent of householders keep at least one dog, giving a minimum figure of half a million dogs. The real figure of dog population is somewhere between that number and 700,000. This highlights the importance of our doing something about the matter. It is an indication of the high dog population in Ireland. The number of the dogs licensed is something in excess of 80,000 which means that control is disappearing. Not long ago we had a couple of hundred thousand dogs licensed on a per annum basis. Now we are down to something like 80,000 dogs so there is need for control in that direction. At present any control of dogs is through the Gardaí. They are responsible for enforcing legislation. However, with the various other activities the gardaí are involved in such as the unfortunate escalation of crime, they have less time to engage in dog control activities. Therefore, I personally believe it is a very progressive step to have this area handled and operated by the Department of the Environment with suitably qualified persons of a nature and of a temperament to understand the management of dogs, who will apply good common-sense and not take every piece of legislation as it is written precisely as it is. There has to be a certain amount of latitude in this and a bit of commonsense must obtain. The Department of the Environment are a very appropriate body to have control of this legislation and of its implementation.</P>
    <P>I make reference to the inter-Departmental committee set up in 1983, which included five major Departments. That committee, which took many of their proposals from the National Dog Control Committee, are to be complimented for their very concrete and positive approach to this Bill. They have set out much valuable information that is as relevant today as the day it was written. The main <Col N="767" /> recommendations of that committee are worth recalling.</P>
    <P>The committee's report stated specifically that statutory responsibility for dog control should be transferred to the main local authority bodies, county councils and county borough councils, who should be given the option of administering a scheme for dog control, in co-operation with other bodies, for example, the ISPCA. Dog control officers should be appointed who would take over the duties of the Garda as laid down in existing legislation, but the Garda should retain their present powers of seizure etc. That is one point on which I would agree with the last speaker, Senator Fallon. Once there is a scheme in operation it must be operated by one Department and one set of people. If you have joint responsibility it does not help because there can often be duplication and things do not get attended to.</P>
    <P>The Departmental committee also made reference to the revenue from dog licences and suggested it should be made available to the local authorities for the administration of the scheme. The power to determine the fee should rest with the Department sponsoring the legislation, which is the Department of the Environment in this case. Responsibilities of dog owners should be clearly stated and extended in legislation, and penalties for serious offences, such as permitting dogs to attack people, should be made more realistic. We have that clearly and specifically included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Reference is made to existing provisions covering the shooting by farmers of dogs worrying livestock. The committee suggested that this should be amplified and strengthened. Here there may be problems of definition about dogs that are attacking livestock, whether they ares sheep, cattle, horses or whatever. While it is very easy to identify those and to have them destroyed, the provision in the Bill on dogs that are about to attack livestock is a hard one to define. I appreciate that a dog that is about to attack is already outside the law because it has strayed away from its home <Col N="768" /> environment, but I would question the part of the Bill that defines the dog that is about to attack livestock. It is very difficult to decide.</P>
    <P>Though I disagree with various points in the Bill about dog control, I agree with one, the identification of offending dogs. I believe that every dog must be identified. I do not think that high class dogs, if you like, could be accommodated under the scheme: If a collar does some irresparable damage to their physical characteristics, as Senator Ferris has said, there is no reason why such dogs should not be allowed to have their collars off for certain times of the day because they would be in strict quarantine; they would not be roaming around. That apart, dogs should wear collars, and owners should make certain they wear them. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that dogs can be traced.</P>
    <P>Another requirement is that a dog will be in its home patch at all times. It is very difficult for people in the countryside to make sure that the dog will go on the public road. That is very difficult, because if one takes any homestead in the country a dog would be in the habit of going out the gate harmlessly&mdash;not to be encouraged, I hastly add. The provision in the Bill to implement this might be difficult to enforce.</P>
    <P>The Act would be easier to implement if all dog owners would help the enforcing officers of the Department. We have a vast increase in dog numbers and they are likely to increase further because of the vast number of stray dogs, dogs that have not been spayed or operated upon in any shape or form. We are going to have a massive explosion, and have had a massive explosion in my estimation in numbers of dogs. For that reason there must be a very vigorous campaign to tackle not just privately owned dogs, pet dogs or sheep dogs in farms, or greyhounds or whatever, but all dogs roaming around.</P>
    <P>As anybody with experience of livestock will be aware, it is when dogs congregate in numbers that they do harm. Single or perhaps two dogs might do little or no harm, but when dogs collect in <Col N="769" /> numbers it is unbelievable what they will do, not alone to flocks of sheep. They will attack herds of cattle and cows and horses as well. That is something we must be very mindful of. We could have a very real problem developing along these lines.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of the high losses we are suffering in sheep. We are also suffering losses in cattle. Figures are not available for them. There are various instances of abortions in bovines being caused&mdash; premature births I should say more than abortions <i>per se</i>&mdash; by chasing dogs. The inter-departmental committee referred to the problem I have just talked about, the numbers of dogs and the fact that more and more dogs are likely to appear on the horizon in the not-too-distant future. We have legislation which deals with dog control but we have not seen that applied or implemented, and I would like to see it implemented. I have made reference to the two bodies I would regard as being, if you like, the main instigators in bringing this legislation forward, They enjoyed the full co-operation of the Minister for State, Deputy Hegarty, in crystalising their various proposals and thoughts. It has been a very forward step and, indeed, knowing that this committee sat in 1979 and this is in 1986, it is quite a long time ago.</P>
    <P>This Bill has, as its main purpose the consolidation, amending and extending the law relating to the control of dogs. Much of that is there, but we have to put the various pieces together in one Act. It is proposed quite clearly in the Bill that to achieve these purposes the effort will be mainly by devolving responsibility for the control of dogs to the major local authorities, requiring those authorities to employ dog wardens, empowering dog wardens to seize stray dogs, and providing that dogs at all times be kept under control. The local authorities will be authorised to delegate their dog control functions to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals or to other bodies connected with animal welfare.</P>
    <P>With regard to finance, under the Bill dog licences will be collected by the local authorities for the purpose of providing <Col N="770" /> revenue to meet the costs of implementing the controls. In the first instance, some funding from the Exchequer will, of course, be required but it is estimated that when revenue is realised the service should be self-financing is most local authority areas. The potential is rockoned to be somewhere of the order of £2.5 million. The actual dog licence revenue for 1985, was £0.4 million. That reflects very clearly the failure of a large number of people to license their dogs. The Exchequer aids for the local authorities for dog control, it is estimated, will be of the order of £125,000 in 1986.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that will be the case: it will depend on how quickly this legislation gets through.</P>
    <P>However, that would seem to be the starting off figures&mdash;the Ministers may have some comment on that. It is likely that further charges on the Exchequer will arise in 1987 and 1988. That is very understandable because the figure of £2.5 million is not going to be reached in the first or second years. There will be at least one dog warden employed by most of the 32 local authorities involved, but it is expected that as revenue increases additional numbers could be employed.</P>
    <P>There are detailed provisions in the various sections of the Bill. I do not propose to go though these sections because other Senators want to speak and I will not deny them that opportunity. The Bill as it is is something I wholeheartedly support, but I would say to the Minister there are certain matters that may not yet have been brought to his notice fully, particularly by greyhound owners. Having regard to the importance of that industry to our economy, their reservations should be accommodated.</P>
    <P>Apart from what, I would see no major problem with the Bill, though there are some provisions that may be very difficult to interpret. The various parties that have contributed to bringing this Bill before the House are indeed worthy of congratulations and thanks for their initiative. I pay tribute to the Minister and congratulate the people who worked diligently and hard with him in bringing this legislation before the House. I expect it <Col N="771" /> will have a speedy passage in this House and the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelQuealy" hpid="Mr. Quealy Mr. Quealy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quealy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators I welcome the Bill. I am delighted with it because it is not before its time. Every county council and committee of agriculture in the country have sent resolutions to Ministers for Agriculture requesting a Bill like this. In County Waterford we sent several motions from the committee of agriculture over the years but the replies we usually got were that it was the responsibility of some other Department. We were told it might be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice or someone else and we were fobbed off.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing in the Bill. It is a fairly comprehensive way of dealing with the problems we have, especially in County Waterford. There are 450 sheep farmers in the county with about 50,000 sheep. I received figures recently that 87 flocks were attacked last year by dogs. Almost one fifth of the flocks in the county. Not alone was visible damage done by the savaging on the animals but damage was inflicted that was not seen at the time. It was estimated that up to 30 per cent of lambs may be lost in the flocks that were mauled and savaged by the dogs. The cost factor involved for farmers to protect their flocks against dogs can be exorbitant. The only sensible way for them is to erect electric fences, which cost from £30 to £100 an acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when this Bill is passed the wardens will be vigilant. I know it will not do away with the problem altogether, but I hope it will reduce the numbers of attacks on sheep flocks and give more confidence to farmers to buy sheep. Sheep are now being looked on as an alternative enterprise in view of the milk super-levy, but farmers who see the damage that can be done by dogs will be very reluctant to but sheep, especially within five or six miles of towns. Dogs come out in packs from towns and cause a lot of damage. I am pleased with section 25 which provides for the shooting of dogs where they are seen to be moving <Col N="772" /> in on sheep and about to attack them. Previously a farmer could be prosecuted for shooting a dog that had done thousands of pounds worth of damage.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities have already provided shelters and dog wardens. This Bill will give them more effect. Previously a dog warden had not much confidence in the powers he had: he was only driving around hoping to be handed over unwanted dogs. Now he will have power to impose on-the-spot fines and be able to pick up dogs. This is a definite step in the right direction. I welcome the Bill and hope it will pass through as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been awaited by many people thoughout the country for many years. I was interested to hear some previous speakers complimenting people for bringing it forward. Many of us who have been interested in seeing some control of dogs would feel like uttering other words today. We have lagged behind other European countries with regard to the control of dogs. It is not that attention has not been drawn to it. Perhaps the lobbying of the various Departments was not done as effectively as other pressure groups who lobby to get effective legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became a public representative one of the first motions I put down at the county council urged the Minister responsible, as we thought at the time, to bring forward legislation with regard to the control of dogs. At that time, in 1965, I was appointed to the county committee of agriculture, where I raised the matter on numerous occasions in that and subsequent years. It was pressure, with all due respects to my county colleagues, from the Dublin County Council that brought about the regulation whereby it was required that a dog should wear a label on its collar and that each dog should wear a collar. That regulation was welcomed by those who were suffering as a result of dog numbers, not only in farming circles but in many built-up areas in my constituency where there was a major problem, and not from marauding dogs only. We had many instances of, to <Col N="773" /> put it mildly, dogs being a great nuisance in built-up areas.</P>
    <P>In 1965 and 1966 many motions were passed by Dublin County Council and Dublin Committee of Agriculture. We believe it was as a result of that pressure that the regulation was brought in. It proved to be effective for a very brief period and reduction in dog numbers was noticeable for a time. It was found that the collar makers make a fortune in the manufacture of dog collars and metal labels but from speaking to those in the trade I know that they scarcely ever get a request for a dog collar now. When I was looking for a dog collar last year I was told that the production of dog collars had almost been eliminated because people do not put collars on their dogs any more. The regulation was never put into effect by the authorities.</P>
    <P>Those people who went to the trouble of labelling their dogs believed they were the fools because many of their neighbours never went to the trouble either of licensing or collaring their dogs and they were never prosecuted. It was a regulation that was shortlived as far as the prosecution of dogs owners was concerned. After a year or two we saw resolutions coming not only from County Dublin but from many other counties and, in particular, from County committees of agriculture. Many committees were set up in an effort to bring forward legislation for the control of dogs and I served on one of those committees. When we were received at county council and departmental level, I was surprised to discover that nobody seemed to be prepared to take responsibility for the enforcement of the licensing of dogs or for up-dating the legislation. At one stage we were sent from one Department to another&mdash;as far as I can remember, we were sent to four different Departments. It became a bit of a laugh when one got involved in any discussion with regard to the control of dogs or the nuisance they caused. At local committees I felt like a fool on many occasions. I got varying explanations from Departments but none seemed to be in a position to take responsibility for proposing legislation or <Col N="774" /> for bringing any suggestion to Government to control dogs.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about marauding dogs which cause huge losses to farmers, particularly those in close proximity to towns and cities. The extension of Dublin city suburbs with the consequent increase in the dog population gave problems to farmers. Senator Quealy a few months ago suggested sheep as an alternative for farmers. It has long ceased to be an alternative for farmers in the area of County Dublin because, despite the economics a Dublin farmer who contemplated changing from one kind of farming to another could never consider sheep production because of the danger from dogs.</P>
    <P>On reading the Bill and the explanatory memorandum I am not clear if this legislation will be as effective as the Minister of State indicated in his introduction of the Bill. It is unclear where the ultimate responsibility will lie and I ask the Minister to consider this carefully.</P>
    <P>We have waited a long time for this Bill and it should receive the widest possible debate and consideration by all Senators, and by the Dáil. It should not be rushed through the Oireachtas on the basis that the country is screaming for such measures to be taken. I was one of those who was loud in voice, over the years to have this legislation brought before us.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that at least one dog warden will be employed in most of the 32 local authorities involved. If that means that some local authorities will not appoint, or are not obliged under the Bill to appoint, at least one dog warden then the Bill does not go far enough. Having waited so long for such a measure, the Bill should apply uniformly throught the country. I could claim there is a greater need for it in County Dublin, and I am sure a case could be made on those lines. However, the same regulations and controls should apply in County Leitrim, Galway or Donegal as in Dublin, Cork or Limerick. My reading of the Bill is that local authorities will not be obliged to appoint dog wardens.</P>
    <P>My local authority, after a lot of pressure <Col N="775" /> and a lot of clarification from Government Departments, appointed a dog warden. Recently we appointed a second one and we are now in the process of investigating the possible appointment of a third dog warden. We, and indeed all local authorities, had the power to do that. Taking into consideration the number of representations made at all levels to have dog wardens appointed, it is rather surprising that local authorities have been so slow in the matter.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the explanatory memorandum because I have seen over the years the reluctance of some local authorities to take what measures they could to reduce the dog population or to control the activities of dogs. If we had that reluctance over those years despite the many protests and the strong representations made, it is reasonable to assume that local authorities in the future will not appoint dog wardens if there is a way out of it. To say that at least one dog warden will be employed in most of the 32 local authorities involved is extremely weak. Every local authority should be obliged to appoint at least one, and indeed all the dog wardens necessary to enforce this legislation.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other sections on which I will question the Minister on Committee Stage. One section provides for the licensing of dogs in one local authority and requires that the owner of a dog must licence his dog also in another local authority if he has homes in the areas in question. The Minister assures me that that is not the case. I will read the section again and perhaps we can tease it out on Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the legislation coming forward, even if it is ineffective in some areas, if it is effective in the major areas we will have made a contribution to a better standard of life not only for farmers but for many other people. There have been many instances in my area where parents refused to send their children to school or to the local shop, simply because of the nuisance and the danger from dogs roaming the streets. One evening in September, as I was coming home <Col N="776" /> at about 9.30 p.m. I counted 13 dogs in a pack of dogs adjacent to my home town. I do not have to elaborate on the danger. Dogs that are uncontrolled and out in packs at night can do enormous damage to farming stocks.</P>
    <P>On several occasions I approached the local Garda with a view to having stray dogs taken into captivity. The gardaí were unwilling and in many instances unable to collect the stray dogs. I did not blame them. Nobody seemed very interested in enforcing the legislation. In my area less than quarter of the dog population is licensed. It is a legal requirement that every dog should be licensed, yet people do not bother to license a dog and they are not prosecuted. How can we expect the Gardaí to capture stray dogs. I would not blame the garda for doing little or nothing about it. When one considers the agitation and the delay with regard to bringing in a proper Control of Dogs Bill one could not blame the Garda or any other authority for not being terribly interested.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the cost of the dog licence is not being increased. Many of those who have been quite active in seeking this legislation, were advocating that to increase the dog licence could be the answer to the problem. I never saw that as the answer to the problem, because only those who license their dogs would be penalised. Those who do not license their dogs would not be at a disadvantage because of any increase in the cost of the dog license.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how the financial aspect of the Bill is going to operate. The Bill states that some State finance will be available to the local authorities to put the measures in the Bill into operation. This will be short lived as it is expected that it should be self financing. If these regulations are put into operation, there will be a great reduction in the dog population which naturally will result in a great reduction in the number of licences required. Although effective licensing laws will increase the income, the income will not increase sufficiently to give adequate finance to local authorities prepared to carry out the measures in the <Col N="777" /> Bill in the manner in which it is intended, so that they would be effective in the control of the dog population. The Minister should give greater confidence to the local authorities by ensuring that sufficient finance will be available to adequately control dogs even if the income from the licensing of the dogs is inadequate. There will be a fair amount of expense involved here. In some counties where they have made little or no preparation for the control of dogs, it will entail the setting up of dog quarters of pounds. That is a very expensive business today. There is also the expense of dog wardens and the supply of the necessary transport and equipment for the capture and control of dogs. It will cost more in some counties than in other counties. The Minister should assure us that there will not be a shortage of money for this purpose, so that no area will find itself with unlicensed, uncontrolled dogs simply because the money was not provided by those who are licensing their dogs. If we have a continuation of the unlicensing of dogs in some areas, it will further reduce the money available to carry out the measures in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will have more to say on this on Committee Stage when I have had a further opportunity to study the Bill. My first reading of the Bill indicates that most of the measures proposed in it, are to be welcomed, but there are a few passages in the Bill which need further consideration, so as to ensure that we do not at this stage take measures that would unnecessarily penalise dog lovers or those who have in the past always controlled their dogs, and who have licensed them. These people should not be penalised unnecessarily simply because we have very many people who are not prepared to follow suit, but who have a dog for their children, to get them used to having an animal, or for the sake of letting their neighbours see that they have a dog or for protection. While we are out to control dogs, we should have due consideration for those who have at all times controlled the dogs in their charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers <Col N="778" /> I welcome this long awaited Bill. Previous legislation on dog control is outdated. That every dog was entitled to a first bite was very unfair to the unfortunate victim. The fact that this legislation removes that is most welcome. It also brings our legislation on dog control into line with that in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an attempt to consolidate all matters relating to dog control, and I hope it will eliminate the problem of dogs roaming the countryside and the streets of towns and cities and beaches. Roaming dogs have been responsible for much damage to persons and to livestock. Attacks on children and old people by uncontrolled roaming dogs are rather widespread nowadays. Their owners do not have to take responsibility for their actions. Apart from that, the aspect of dogs polluting the pavements, parks and beaches, is detrimental to the concept of cleanliness and to tourism. Also numberous traffic accidents have been attributed to uncontrolled dogs. I am sure all of us have had this experience over the years.</P>
      <P>An even greater risk is the health risk. Dogs are well known to be transmitters of diseases. Quite recently, a friends of mine was on holidays in Greece and was bitten by a dog. He is still under observation because of the fear of rabies. His right hand was paralysed after the bite from the dog. These are considerations to be taken into account when considering this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now the responsibility for the enforcement of dog control was with the Garda. In fairness to the Garda Síochána, they have more pressing responsibilities at the moment, when we take into account the increase in crime and other forms of lawlessness. It was hard to expect them to seek out unlicensed dogs and pursue them vigorously. For that reason it is a good move to give responsibility to the local authorities and to appoint wardens. The employment aspect of it alone must be welcomed. It is also welcome that power is given to the local authorities. It is a further step in the devolution of powers on the local authorities by our Government. I am also glad that the Irish Society for the Prevention <Col N="779" /> of Cruelty to Animals are involved and are being recognised because dog control legislation could not go ahead without their full co-operation. I compliment them on the great work they have done as regards wandering animals up to now. Indeed, they seem to be the only people who would take in wandering animals or injured animals. They must be complimented for this.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that it is the intention to provide the local authorities with the necessary funding in order to get the whole process off the ground. It seems a very good idea, on paper, to appoint local wardens. Nevertheless, unless the local authorities have the necessary funds available to them I doubt if the legislation could be properly implemented. I am glad that it is the intention of the Department of the Environment to make up any shortfall that may arise in the local authorities as a result of the implementation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon referred to the fact that at least one warden would be appointed for each local authority. If we are going to depend on just one dog warden in each local authority to implement this legislation, it will take a very long time to become effective. For each of the areas within the local authorities, a case could be made for the appointment of a warden. If we are promotion the idea of licensing every dog and this legislation is not properly implemented so that some people are avoiding responsibility then those who accept and abide by the legislation will be very disappointed.</P>
    <P>Section 8 proposes that the present rate of £5 for a dog licence be retained. Perhaps the licence fee could be increased but include an insurance premium to cover any victim of a roaming dog. In the USA, they have an insurance premium on the dog with the licence and they have a ceiling of £50,000 on the amount that can be claimed. A case could be made for having such a provision included in our licence.</P>
    <P>Section 10 specifically mentions greyhounds in public places. In North Kerry, <Col N="780" /> where greyhounds are very common, greyhound owners are very concerned that they were singled out and are quite worried about the implications. Some of their representatives have voiced concern about the implications of this section for the greyhound industry as a whole. I cannot see any danger to greyhound owners, but it is an argument that has been put forward at national and at local level regarding this Bill. I should like if the Minister would clarify further the fact that greyhounds were singled out, if he could give some assurances to the greyhound owners that it is not the intention to prohibit the training of greyhounds in public parks within towns or cities where greyhounds owners have no other place to exercise their dogs. Will they be allowed to run them in the parks? It is stipulated in the Bill that greyhounds will have to be on lead all the time. Does that mean that the owners cannot gallop them out in the parks? I would like if the Minister could clarify that point.</P>
    <P>Another fear that has been raised is that the powers of dog wardens are rather vast and people are afraid of invasions of privacy. I would like the Minister to comment on that point. This is a very good Bill. It will serve to control the dog population in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The good news is that I will make my ten minutes into five minutes if that makes everybody happy. I would like to welcome the Bill because despite any difficulties there may be in the implementation of it and some of the regulations for the vast majority of people who come from the country and who have to look at sheep and lambs being mauled and killed, this Bill has to be welcomed and it will do an immense amount of good. I am sure that has been mentioned by several speakers already today but it is something that has to be repeated because nothing is as horrible as to see the carnage of sheep. I welcome the provision that a person is entitled to shoot a dog who is harrying sheep or cattle. You cannot go around saying to a dog. &ldquo;Excuse me, what is your name and where do you come from?&rdquo; If, in the meantime, he is going to kill three or four lambs. It is time the owners of animals were allowed to protect their animals and dogs should not be straying on to farmland where there are lambs. It is criminal for dog owners to have them rambling around the place in the middle of the lambing season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Deenihan mentioned greyhounds. Having slightly more than strong connections with the greyhound industry, I would like to make a plea for greyhound owners. I do not know what the definition of a public place is but I know the seaside is often a very suitable place in hard weather. Greyhound owners can go to the seaside and gallop dogs on the wet sand where they are very safe. If people are there are they automatically in a public place and, if so, will that practice be banned? It will mean a lot when the coursing season comes after Christmas. In the middle of a dry summer when the <Col N="782" /> ground is very hard for racing dogs the seaside is used a lot because they are not in danger of damaging their toes.</P>
    <P>The other point is the question of an owner being able to lead only four greyhounds. I can accept the logic of that in normal circumstances but often people go to tracks with dogs and, for some reason, they may have to go some place else to get cards. How rigid a regulation is this? I can see that four dogs is enough for any one person leading them but there are situations where if the regulations are enforced in a very strict way it will be very unfair to greyhound owners.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of getting dog licences in advance. We have heard so often down the years about dogs being given as Christmas presents and they finish up as monsters because they are let loose. It is sad to see a stray dog hungry and worn out. The idea of making people get a licence in advance is a very good one although I am sure it will be abused if there is not strict enforcement. If the Bill is not enforced we are only bringing the law into disrepute. The Bill says that licences need not be got for pups up to four months. I do not know whether four months is old enough because often pups are kept for six months before they are transferred to somebody else. It could be tight enough as far as the age is concerned. Wardens are very important. In Carlow we already have a warden system set up with the help of the IFA and the council and it has played a very important role. The extent of their powers is something that has worried many people. They feel that wardens have more power than the Garda. Maybe it is a way of showing that we are serious about tackling the problem that they are being given the power to follow up any leads they want to follow or any suspicions they have. It is a question of how it is handled. If they abuse their power we will have a bad reaction and if they have commonsense and use it carefully we will not have any real difficulty. On paper it looks as if it could cause a problem.</P>
    <P>I will deal with two more aspects of the Bill. I am glad to see that the Minister has covered the problem of barking dogs. <Col N="783" /> It can be a nuisance for neighbours if somebody has a dog and he decides to become musical once the dark sets in and howls all night. This creates a problem: people do not want to fall out with neighbours but there are provisions in the Bill in this regard. I wonder about the keeping of Alsations by people who have no real need for them. These animals are so vicious. I hope we will have some control over them because while they are guard dogs in their own place they often ramble on to roadways. They often follow children cycling. It is very dangerous. There will be a lot of things to be said on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am delighted this Bill has been introduced because no matter what flaws it has, overall it is good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Members of the House who contributed. It is gratifying that the Bill has met with such a warm reception. There is a universal feeling throughout the State that the menace of loose dogs has to be tackled and that the Bill provides a practical commonsense approach to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essence of the Bill is the devolvement of responsibility for dog control to the major local authorities, who will be required to employ dog wardens and erect dog shelters; dogs will be required to be kept under effectual control and the dog wardens will be obliged to seize stray dogs. A somewhat similar scheme of control was introduced in Northern Ireland by The Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order, 1983 and is operating quite successfully at District Council level. In fact in the first year of operation, 1984, the number of dog licences issued was almost double the number of two years previously and at 86,000 was greater than the number issued here in 1985 (80,400). I am aware that there is widespread failure to take out licences. It will be in the interests of the local authorities to maximise revenue so as to meet the operational costs involved in dog control by ensuring that every dog within its area of <Col N="784" /> jurisdiction is licensed. I expect, therefore, to see a dramatic rise in the number of licences issued when the Bill is in operation.</P>
    <P>The welfare of the dogs concerned in these controls must not be overlooked and I think that the special position accorded to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals and other welfare agencies in the Bill will ensure that such will be the case. Out of the 12 dog control schemes already being operated in local authority areas, 10 are being operated by the ISPCA under local arrangement. It is the intention that particular care will be taken in the selection and training of dog wardens. Furthermore, veterinary inspectors are employed by each local authority and any veterinary expertise that will be required in regard to humane destruction, dealing with sick animals or welfare will be available.</P>
    <P>At this point it is appropriate to pay tribute to the wonderful work for animal welfare being carried out by the ISPCA and other welfare agencies. Undoubtedly the stray dog problem would be an awful lot worse were it not for the trojan work done by these bodies down the years.</P>
    <P>Valuable experience is being gained in the day to day operation of controls where schemes are already being operated. Generally the wardens are equipped with radio-controlled vans and respond to calls for assistance and visit fixed locations at regular intervals. In my own county of Cork, a service has recently been inaugurated and the warden visits the livestock marts throughout the county at regular intervals where he collects unwanted dogs. He is very much in demand. It has been found that in some cases the reasons for handing over dogs are financial. This is not surprising when one considers that large dogs may consume £7 worth of food in a week. In other cases, the dogs are creating a nuisance in their areas and the owners have been persuaded by neighbours to dispose of them.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey referred to the lack of enforcement of the existing law in regard to dogs, the low level of licensing and the <Col N="785" /> failure of people to put collars on their dogs. He asked how local authorities will be successful in collecting fees when the Department of Justice failed. My answer to that is that there will now be dog wardens fully occupied with dog control whose sole function will be the operation of the Bill, to collect licence fees and on the spot fines also. The Senator also made the point that one dog warden is not sufficient in any one area. A minimum of one per area will be provided. He said the Department of the Environment will continue to support local authorities after enactment. It will be a matter for the Government of the day to determine how long this should continue. I agree with Senator Hussey when he suggests that the training of wardens will be important. I would expect that the Minister for the Environment would take this in hand, particularly the suggestion that the ISPCA would provide such training. It would not be appropriate to legislate for this. It is something that can be done administratively. There is no need to set a date for recruitment of wardens. Fourteen local authorities have already got dog control schemes in operation and others are very advanced in doing the same thing. There will be a statutory obligation on local authorities to operate the legislation on commencement.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey also requested a provision for compensation of farmers suffering losses from attacks by dogs on their sheep flocks. Section 21 of the Bill provides a remedy for that situation in that dog owners will be liable for damages for these losses. On the question of greyhounds I am not convinced that we should set an age limit of 16 for persons walking greyhounds. It is not the actual age of the person that is important, it is the individual's ability to control dogs. Children differ considerably at that age in size and strength and I would not like to impose an arbitrary limit in that area. The Senator also thought that seven days was too long for keeping a seized dog before being disposed of or given to somebody else. I am not rigid about this and will have another look at if before <Col N="786" /> the Committee Stages.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to Senator Ferris and his colleagues on the Animal Health Council for their input into the formulation of this legislation. I am glad to hear his account of the operation already employed in South Tipperary for the control of dogs. The Senator asked for clarification of the measures about housing of dogs. It is provided for in section 19 which provides for regulations to be made governing the keeping of dogs for particular purposes. There will be no question of seizing a dog which is not licensed. The power of seizure relates to stray dogs only. Stray dogs must be dealt with as defined in the Bill. The wardens will act with tact and are acting, that is the important thing. It is not purely a hypothetical situation.  The wardens are already there and are acting with tact and commonsense and will not take every dog in sight.</P>
    <P>The Senator's points about the Irish Kennel Club, old age pensioners etc. have been noted. If a dog interferes with a guide dog it has to be presumed that the dog was not kept under effectual control and that an offence was committed.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon made the point that urban councils should be an entity in their own right from the point of view of administering the scheme. We decided to confine it to the five corporations and the counties. Urban councils might not be able to generate sufficient income to operate the service. The larger local authorities have been selected to do the work. There will be nothing to prevent the county councils from placing a warden in a large urban area such as Athlone.</P>
    <P>The muzzling of greyhounds is a matter best left to owners who would know which dogs to muzzle. Veterinary opinion in my Department is not in favour of making the muzzling of dogs compulsory unless absolutely necessary. Gardaí will retain the right to seize dogs because there may be occasions when such would be necessary, for instance, strikes by wardens, severe attacks by dogs, dogs being taken off fishing boats at ports and so on. We need that in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Ferris's question <Col N="787" /> about access to public buildings this is not a matter appropriate to the Bill. The wearing of collars by dogs is a requirement under the Dogs Order, 1966 and it is intended that new regulations will be made under the Bill to cover the same. Consultations with appropriate bodies will be possible and the question of the irritation and so on caused by collars can be looked at when this is being done. The question of the rating of premises is not a matter for the Bill. Nothing in this Bill changes the situation.</P>
    <P>The humane destruction and slaying of dogs are matters which will have to be carefully handled and the Senator's views are noted. Senator Ferris also made the point about the child being the proud owner of a dog. The child can still be the proud owner of a dog. The parent, however, will take out the licence.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Hourican's comments there need be no worries in the greyhound industry as to what is in the Bill. The greyhound industry is well regulated and does not give rise to problems of control. For instance, I would deem dogs taking a run and controlled by the handlers whether on a beach or in a field, as being under control by the owner. I know enough about it to know that they are under control. I would hope that the introduction of the new controls will be reflected very soon in an increase in the number of licences, a matter which was also worrying Senator Ferris. The phrase, &ldquo;about to attack&rdquo; was mentioned by a few Senators. That is included because at present a dog has to be actually worrying sheep or any other animal before it can be shot. It seems a pity to have to lose a sheep before you can shoot the dog.</P>
    <P>No farmer or landowner that I know will go out and shoot dogs arbitrarily. Obviously if a dog is hunting his sheep he is entitled to shoot the dog. That is the position at the moment. It was thought advisable to widen this to protect a farmer who shot a dog which was roaming around his sheep. Senator Quealy made the rather dramatic point about 87 flocks attacked last year in his own area. He made the point about the damage caused <Col N="788" /> to the flock of sheep that does not show up until lambing time. He said this Bill will restore some confidence to sheep farmers especially in the hinterland of the cities, the Dublin and Wicklow areas and the areas around the city which are traditional sheep areas.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon made a number of points about the effectiveness of the Bill. He said that at least one, but maybe more, county councils might opt out. The reason we put it in in that fashion is that, for instance, Waterford Corporation might join with part of the county to appoint one warden for a particular area. In practice, as it is emerging, one can be assured that there will be a good supply of wardens because without them it would not be effective.</P>
    <P>Finally Senator Deenihan referred to dog control in the north. That is an area where it has been 100 per cent successful. We studied it and it is working very well. It is self-financing. It is demanded by people in both town and country. Our cities are being fouled and this is causing quite a problem for our corporations. It is a serious worry to farmers. He paid some fulsome tributes to the ISPCA and made a very interesting point about insurance and tax. I do not know about that though.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne mentioned the wardens' powers. They will have ample powers to do their job. They will be chiefly concerned initially with picking up stray dogs. That will ease off after a while. Where they are operating they have developed a very good relationship with local authority people, with farmers, with farming organisations. They do a lot of night work, lectures etc. They do a lot of positive work as well in helping people to control their dogs. He also made a point about the greyhound industry. I would like some members or representatives of the greyhound industry to come along and talk to me. I would hope to be able to re-assure them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Cathaoirleach, through you, for allowing me to raise this matter. The matter that I wish to raise is the apparent widespread practice of requiring that all members of the travelling community are required to sign on at labour exchanges at the same time throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I would like to put on the record of the House that less than a year ago we discussed the charter of travellers' rights produced by the national council for travelling people. We had a very positive discussion on that matter. There were disagreements about issues but, by and large, it was a very positive discussion and the Minister of State with responsibility for these matters at the time was very positive and did indicate that the Government accepted the principles contained in the charter of travellers' rights. This House passed a motion recognising that charter and asking the Government to take the necessary legal and administrative steps to implement that charter. Article 12 of that charter reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> 1. Travellers are entitled to the full exercise of their rights and should not suffer any distinction, exclusion or restriction based on the fact that they are travellers which would have the effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on the equal footing of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.</P>
    <P>2. The State shall amend, rescind or nullify any law which has the effect of creating or perpetuating discrimination against travellers. The State shall prohibit and bring to an end by all appropriate means, including legislation as required by circumstances, discrimination against travellers by any person, group or organisation.</P>
    <P>3. Travellers' right of access to any place or service intended for use by the general public, such as transport, hotels, restaurants, cafes, bars, shops, theatres and parks shall be granted.</P>
    <P>That is a fine and noble principle and one I must re-emphasise endorsed by this House and accepted on behalf of the Government by the Minister of State at the time, Deputy Donnellan. I am, therefore, extremely distressed in the course of meeting people who work with travellers to have it drawn to my attention that there are practices at work which, on a very fundamental level, run counter to both the spirit and the letter of that charter and contrary to principles of equality enunciated by our Constitution.</P>
    <P>These practices have been reported to me as follows: I would like to quote from them because they are direct experiences of people working with travellers and whose good faith on this issue cannot be doubted.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the following situation persists&mdash;the information coming from the Dublin Travellers' Education and Development Group:</P>
    <P>I wish to draw your attention to the fact that it seems to be the accepted practice that all Travellers on social <Col N="791" /> welfare through the Republic must sign on at labour exchanges at the same time i.e. 11.30 a.m. on Thursdays. From our work with Travellers from all over the Dublin area this situation whereby Travellers are singled out in this regard is a well-known fact. Members of our group also have experience of this practice in other parts of the country eg. Navan, Cork, Mayo, Mullingar, Maynooth, Trim, Limerick and Galway which leads us to believe that it is an established national policy.</P>
    <P>We object to this practice because there is an inherent assumption that people on the dole, and Travellers in particular, are scroungers and dishonest and in need of special monitoring. Travellers, themselves find it very objectionable and have frequently complained about it on radio and television. They dislike being segretated from the rest of social welfare dependants in this way and see it as a manifestation of the prevailing discrimination which exists.</P>
    <P>They feel that the presence of a large group of Travellers on the streets outside labour exchanges all at the same time (because they are not allowed into the building until 11.30 a.m.) reinforces the existing negative sterotypes and prejudices which the settled people have towards Travellers.</P>
    <P>As you are aware there is a strong clan system within the Travelling community and when disputes occur they can erupt again when the opposing groups are forced together in the dole queues. Some travellers are intimidated by this system which leaves no opportunity for their avoiding such occasions. Other State departments take advantage of this system (e.g.) the policy when serving summonses) which makes Travellers more vulnerable than their counterparts in the settled community.</P>
    <P>The following information has also been supplied to me by a responsible person from the West of Ireland:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> the practice is widespread in many parts of the country whereby travellers are required to sign on at Labour Exchanges at specific times, quite often at 11.30 a.m. with the requirement being once, twice, or daily each week. Apart from the practice of confining travellers to a specific time for signing on there are other practices which are even more reprehensible. In some labour exchanges travellers must step back to allow a newly arrived settled person to sign on even though they may have been already queueing for some time.</P>
    <P>That is the conviction I have that there is a deliberate, calculated practice of racist discrimination&mdash;and that is the only way to describe it&mdash;because they identify themselves as a separate community with a separate ethnic origin and a separate culture within the community which calls itself the Irish people. To identify a group and stereotype them in that manner is not a matter of administrative practice; it is a matter of fundamental cultural and racist discrimination.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister replies he will not produce one or two examples to disprove my contention. The issue is that there is a clear element of an overwhelming uniformity of practice on this issue. I know the matter has not been remedied generally because I have been reliably informed from Carrick-on-Shannon that a well-organised campaign by members of the travelling community prevented this practice from being continued.</P>
    <P>It is very clear to me that the members of the travelling community have been singled out in a most offensive way because of allegations apparently made about their abuse of the dole. I want to say that even if every allegation about dole abuse by members of the travelling community was true, it would still be unacceptable to deal with the problem in this way. It is wrong to identify a group, to stereotype a group; it is particularly wrong to identify, stigmatise and stereotype a group who have already suffered far too much at the hands of stigmatisers <Col N="793" /> and the sort of glib political opportunist who uses prejudice for his own benefit at the expense of the travelling community. Even if every allegation of abuse were true, the practice and procedure to be used to deal with abuse cannot be a form of cultural or racial discrimination which reinforces stereotyping.</P>
    <P>If they had been members of the Jewish community in this country or members of the minority religion who had been identified in this way, the outcry that would have been heard at the suggestion that they were all going to be told to line up at a particular time at labour exchanges in the city and all around the country would have been overpowering. It is extraordinary that a Government who fight bravely&mdash;in my view, fought a recent referendum on the question of minority rights&mdash;can now fight shy over the minority rights of the most vulnerable minority in this country. I appeal to the Minister not to give me a glib rationalisation, not to dismiss it because perhaps a detail here or there of the evidence is incorrect&mdash;because it is impossible obviously to check every labour exchange &mdash;but to accept that the practice is wide-scale, to accept that the practice is wrong, to accept that the practice humaliates people who are trying to make a decent life for themselves and that the only honest, fair and honourable way to deal with it is to eliminate the practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister may devise his own method for dealing with allegations of abuse. It seems that if you have evidence of abuse you must have a method of dealing with it. To use a stignatising practice of discrímination against an entire community is wrong and it is unworthy of this Government and of this Minister to perpetuate it. I appeal to the Minister to end what is a wrong practice and to allow travelling people, who have so little dignity in our community, at least the dignity of being treated like everybody else at a labour exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first of all to refer to the reason why <Col N="794" /> unemployed people have to sign on at all. It is provided in the social welfare legislation that to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance a person must be unemployed, capable of work, and available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>The signing of the live register is the main control measure operated by my Department to ensure that unemployed people continue to fulfil the conditions for entitlement to their payments. People declare that they are eligible for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance when they attend at their local office or signing centre and payment is made from the local exchange on the basis of these declarations.</P>
      <P>The frequency with which people are required to sign the register varies depending on how far they live from the local office. The frequency of signing on has had to be reduced in recent years due to the increase in the live register and the impracticality of dealing with the large numbers involved. At the majority of offices now the practice is for claimants to sign on only once a week when they are paid without further delay on the basis of the declaration they make at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The signing arrangements can in no sense be regarded as onerous and indeed their effectiveness as a means of control is open to question. However, they constitute a reasonably effective way of ensuring that claimants regularly declare their availability and in a non-computerised environment they facilitate weekly cash payments to those concerned. As a control mechanism, however, they need to be supplemented by additional arrangements applied on a more selective basis. It was for this reason that the Government recently approved the appointment of 13 additional clerical staff for the larger employment exchanges. These staff will be fully engaged on the task of reviewing whether claims are genuine. They will also liaise with the special investigation unit of my Department as well as with other State agencies, such as the National Manpower Service and AnCO. In addition, a new <Col N="795" /> headquarters team of six officers was set up recently to carry out similar work in the smaller exchanges and branch offices and to monitor and co-ordinate control work generally in the local offices.</P>
    <P>A particular form of abuse which has been a cause of increasing concern in recent years is that of personation by claimants in signing on and collecting payment in respect of a relative or friend who was in fact abroad, in prison or deceased.</P>
    <P>In 1981, following a review within my Department of the position, it became apparent that there was need for special signing arrangements for all claimants of no fixed abode, which, of course, includes members of the travelling community, in order to close off the possibility of such claimants signing on and receiving payments under different names at two or more local offices in the one week. There were ample indications that this kind of abuse of the system was a significant and growing problem and in these circumstances it was decided that the only effective control mechanism would be to introduce special arrangements for this category.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, new arrangements were brought into operation at that time which required that all persons of no fixed abode have to sign on once weekly at their local office between the fixed times of 11.30 and 12 noon on Thursday morning. I should add, also, that the very same arrangement is operated by the authorities in Northern Ireland who have experienced problems similar to our own. The arrangements, therefore, operates throughout the 32 counties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> This arrangement has been in operation for five years now and I have no doubt that it is a sensible and practical arrangement. In the first instance, the claimants concerned are obliged to sign once weekly only which, as I have already said in relation to the signing arrangements for claimants generally, cannot be regarded as onerous. Furthermore, I do not accept that there is any question of unfair discrimination involved in having all people of no fixed abode sign at the one time. The situation is that the fact of having no fixed abode gives rise to special problems of control which need to be addressed by special arrangements. My Department would be failing in their responsibilities if they did not ensure that appropriate measures were in operation to meet this special situation. In this connection, I would like to point out that settled members of the travelling community are subject to the signing arrangements which apply to claimants generally.</P>
    <P>In conclusions, I would like to reiterate my firm view that the signing arrangements which apply to people of no fixed abode, including members of the travelling community, are reasonable and necessary and do not unfairly discriminate against them in any way. I am confident that members of the Seanad will share my view.</P>
