      <P>I have notice from Senator John Ellis that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter.</P>
      <P>The delay by the Department of Health in the provision of an extension to the Manorhamilton Hospital.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Patrick Durcan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to indicate his plans for his introduction of a full and proper system of integrated nursing in the psychiatric nursing service.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Browne of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The proposed closure of St. Dympna's Hospital, Carlow.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ellis's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken from 4.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senator Durcan and Browne may give notice for another day of the matter they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Ryan, it is intended to order No. 10 next week, but there will be a preference for Government legislation, Nos. 5 and 6.  There is a certain element of urgency about No. 6.  This is in response to Senator Smith's point.  I understand that the Valuation Bill will be taken next week.  I had hoped to have completed the Second Stage of the NDC yesterday, but we did not achieve that.  That is a matter of urgency as well.  It will depend on the urgency of all of the matters.  They will be mentioned next week on the Order of Business &mdash; Nos. 5, 6 and 10.  We will not be taking Nos. 2 and 3, together because they are two separate and different matters.  They are in the same ministerial responsibility, but they are separate.  The House can decide if they wish to discuss both of them together.  They are two specifically different reports.  I would suggest that the House should deal with them separately, because they are separate reports, although the same Minister or Minister of State will be taking them.</P>

      <P>There are a total of 23 recommendations made in the report, all of which would be acceptable to the Members of this House.  Some of the recommendations would not entail much extra expenditure.  Those that might necessitate extra expenditure might have to wait until the financial position of the country improves.  That is not to say that they would not be very welcome at a time when we can afford them.  While everybody has it at heart that we should be generous on the social welfare side, especially to the classes of people whose cases are examined here, in the last analysis what we can do must depend on what <Col N="500" /> we can afford.  While we have big commitments with regard to discharging our obligations on the national debt and at the same time no desire whatever to increase taxation or to impose further borrowing, what we can set about doing immediately must, unfortunately, be on a limited scale.  Nevertheless, the recommendations made by the committee are worthy of examination.  It is to be hoped that with the improvement in our financial condition and with greater productivity we would be able to implement recommendations made in the report.</P>
      <P>At the outset the report deals with the question of women in the home.  This matter is under a great deal of consideration at present.  People are of the opinion that the woman in the home is entitled to some assistance as a recognition of her invaluable work.  The committee state on page 8, paragraph 2 (1):</P>
      <P>The position of the woman who has to remain at home, whether it be as a housewife and mother or as a single person living alone or caring for an aged relative, was referred to in many of the submissions made to the Joint Committee.  It is clear that many women in this category are in need of greater support from the social welfare system and their treatment belies the status conferred on them under Article 41 of the Constitution.  The Joint Committee would like to see the extension of dental and optical benefit to all women who choose to remain at home. The members are pleased to note that under the terms of the 1985 Budget these benefits will be extended to pregnant women on their husbands PRSI contributions and they trust that this is just the first step in their wider application to all women in the home.</P>
      <P>That hope, expressed by the committee, is one that would meet with general acceptance by the members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next important point made by the Joint Committee is on the question of the single woman's allowance, which is payable between the ages of 55 and 66 years.  That is, of course, until the woman <Col N="501" /> reaches the age for the old age pension. The committee recommend that this allowance should be paid at the age of 55 and that the examination of means of the applicant should not be so stringent.  I would have no doubt but that Senators would agree <i>in toto</i> with that recommendation.</P>
    <P>Another matter which causes a great deal of concern in the community is the question of the prescribed relative's allowance.  There are great difficulties involved in that, as Senators are well aware.  If there is an invalid in the house and more than one other member of the family residing there, no allowance is paid.  If one takes, for example, the case of a farm household where an old man or woman is confined to bed.  If there is a son working on the farm and a daughter living in the house it is impossible to get the prescribed relative's allowance.  That condition should be removed immediately. In that case the son must spend most of his time looking after the farm or out at work.  In most cases I come across the son is engaged practically fulltime on farm work but another member of the household, either a sister or another brother, will not be paid the prescribed relative's allowance.  That is something that should be cleared up immediately.</P>
    <P>The committee put a lot of thought into the question of the deserted wife's allowance.  I was very surprised to see that a wife must be deserted for a period of three months before she becomes eligible for financial assistance.  That is an undue hardship.  The committee notes, also, that the deserted wife must make what are described as &ldquo;reasonable efforts&rdquo; to trace her husband and to obtain support and maintenance from him.  Very often what happens is that the husband simply disappears.  The wife has no way whatever of being able to trace his whereabouts.  For example, in the case where the husband deserts his wife and goes to England, he could be located in London but then he could move on to Birmingham, Wolverhampton or some other city.  In practice it is impossible for the wife to be in contact with him.  Her <Col N="502" /> hopes of getting any money from him are nil.</P>
    <P>The regulations insist that this three months' period must pass before she gets assistance from the State.  That is a ridiculous situation and should be scrapped immediately.  Unfortunately, these cases of desertion are becoming much more common than they were some years ago. One can easily imagine the great trauma that the deserted wife goes through.  Her condition is aggravated to a very great degree by the fact that she is supposed to be making reasonable efforts to trace her husband and to obtain support and maintenance from him for herself and her children.  She is faced with an absolutely impossible task.  It is unreasonable to think that those who are deserted should be put in that position.</P>
    <P>Another paragraph to which the committee draws attention is paragraph 3.5. It states:</P>
    <P>Wives who succeed in obtaining maintenance from their husbands often find that after a time the payments can become erratic or cease altogether.</P>
    <P>Even when the wife has succeeded in obtaining payments for this period, if payment subsequently stops a further long period goes by before she is able to establish that she is getting no assistance. That is something that should be cleared up without delay.</P>
    <P>To show that their consideration was all-embracing, the committee devote some attention to the plight of deserted husbands.  It suggests that the phrase &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo; or &ldquo;deserted husband&rdquo; is not the most acceptable term.  It suggests a change in the title from &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo; or &ldquo;deserted husband&rdquo; to some more acceptable term such as &ldquo;an abandoned spouse&rdquo;.  In my opinion there is very little difference between the term &ldquo;deserted&rdquo; and &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo;.  I am of the opinion that &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; might be even a harsher term then &ldquo;deserted&rdquo;. That is something that could be looked into at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The children's allowance is another matter that has come up for examination <Col N="503" /> and recommendation by the committee. There has been an improvement in the recent budget under that heading.</P>
    <P>Another point in the report is a suggestion that I do not find myself agreeing with &mdash; the question of introducing paternity allowances.  I can understand liberal maternity allowances; but when it goes so far as to offer paternity allowances, I think that is something that could very well be left to one side and that matters of greater urgency should get attention beforehand.  One can very well visualise this paternity allowance being greatly abused and adding considerably to our already dismal record with regard to absenteeism from work.  The husbands would think up all sorts of excuses for why they should not be at work.  We might eventually find ourselves at a time when the husband would be thinking of anti-natal or post-natal attention for himself and for the psychological trauma that he thinks he is going through.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends the setting up of creches in all hospitals.  It is something I am sure all Senators would agree with.</P>
    <P>The plight of older women comes in for a good deal of attention in the report. I find myself in total agreement with what the joint committee recommend.  They say in the report on page 21:</P>
    <P>Strong recommendations were made to the Joint Committee regarding the plight of women living alone and trying to exist on meagre pensions.  Many women retire early, some at 60 years of age and earlier, and the interval between retirement and qualification for State pensons, normally 66 years of age, can be a time of severe hardship.</P>
    <P>That is something of which we all have a good deal of knowledge.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>...it is not surprising that so many people have to depend on the voluntary and charitable organisations to supplement their incomes.</P>
    <P>This refers to the period between retirement and reaching qualification age for <Col N="504" /> the old age pension.  That is an area that demands attention and an area about which we would like to see something practical being done.</P>
    <P>Another area where I would agree entirely with the recommendations of the committee is dealt with on page 24 of the report, where it refers to the living alone allowance.  It states:</P>
    <P>This allowance is paid to old age pensioners over 66 years of of age, and it amounts to £3.20 per week.  Some members of the Joint Committee were appalled when, in the course of their public duties, they learned that the allowance had been discontinued on some pensioners who had asked a relative or a friend to remain with them at night time only.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances in which we live, where we have old people's homes being attacked and old people themselves being beaten up for the sake of a few pounds because these marauders think there might be money in their possession, it is highly desirable that old people should be encouraged in every way to invite members of their family or neighbours to stay with them at night.  It was never intended when the regulations were drawn up that a person who would be in a state of fear should lose an allowance because he took the precaution of having somebody to stay with him.</P>
    <P>In the changing circumstances in which old people and others live, especially in remote parts of the country, people are subject to these attacks at night.  They live in constant fear of being attacked and beaten up.  Only last week we had a pair of criminals sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for the savage way in which they treated a pair of old men down in County Kerry.  Any regulation that debars or discourages old people living alone from having the comfort of a person coming in to stay with them during the night should be scrapped immediately. That was never intended.  These people should continue to get the allowance even if they take the trouble of getting some relative to spend the night with them.  I am sure that as soon as that point is <Col N="505" /> brought to the Minister's attention he will take effective steps to end that.</P>
    <P>There are other long sections on pages 30 and 31 dealing with delay in social welfare payments and the committee express understanding of these delays but I make an appeal for everything possible to be done to cut out these long delays.</P>
    <P>On page 37 the committee refer to the fact that six years after the adoption of the directive by the EC the Government in 1984 indicated that legislation would be introduced to provide equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  The Bill to give effect to the proposed changes was circulated in December 1984, but the legislation has not yet been enacted by the Oireachtas. The committee also express the hope that legislation will soon be enacted and with that, I want to say, I wholeheartedly agree.</P>
    <P>I should like to again compliment the committee on the report presented to the House and to express the hope that our improving financial conditions in the years immediately ahead will enable the Government of the day to implement as many as possible of these recommendations on a progressive basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate and, indeed, it was gratifying to hear the favourable comments of Senator O'Brien on the report because the members of the joint committee did put a lot of diligent work into its preparation.  The Joint Committee's first report dealt with education and the Joint Committee selected the area of social welfare for its second report because so many people in this country today are dependent on social welfare.  The vast majority of the people who are dependent on social welfare are women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today there is a very high number of people registered as unemployed and drawing unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  In addition to those two social welfare schemes, there <Col N="506" /> are approximately 30 other different schemes of payment.  It was the view of the Joint Committee that, during the next number of years even if there is a reduction in the unemployment figures, a very large number of people will still be dependent on social welfare and that a large percentage of the people who will be dependent on social welfare will continue to be women.  When the Joint Committee was examining the social welfare code, they heard evidence from representatives of various groups and they also received quite a number of written submissions both from groups and individuals throughout the country.  Many of the submissions received by the Joint Committee dealt with areas of the social welfare system where people experienced difficulties or, indeed, with areas where improvements are needed.</P>
    <P>Before I move on to deal with the various sections of the report, I want to refer to an article which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Friday, February 7 1986.  This article was concerned with &ldquo;The welfare fraud&rdquo;.  In this article it was suggested that more than £150 million a year is being lost through direct fraud of the social welfare system.  It was also alleged in the article that women were the prime offenders.  Examples were given of areas of the social welfare system where this fraud is alleged to be taking place.  I quote from the report:</P>
    <P>Duplicated children's allowance books and dishonesty in claiming unmarried mothers', deserted wives' or disability allowances and benefits as well as third level students signing on for the dole are amongst the most simple methods of swindling for women.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested in the report that there is an over-representation of married women among disability benefit claimants. It was alleged, too, that some couples go to the extreme of a wife taking out a court barring order against her husband so that she will qualify for a deserted wife's allowance, even though the couple continue to cohabitate.</P>
    <P>I want to say at this stage that the Joint <Col N="507" /> Committee did not in their examination of the social welfare system receive any evidence or find any evidence that the situation as outlined in that report exists. It was agreed that there is a perception that there is some fraud in relation to the social welfare system.  This report, even though it makes those serious allegations of fraud and particularly the very serious allegations against women, does not substantiate any of those allegations.  I believe that before allegations of that nature would be made in a newspaper article there should be hard evidence to substantiate the allegations; otherwise they should not be made.  The Department of Social Welfare employ a number of special investigation officers. The function of these investigation officers is to be vigilant in relation to abuses of the system and I believe that these investigation officers are as successful as it is possible for them to be in relation to the stamping out of abuses of social welfare and I do not accept that fraud to the extent alleged in this article exists in the social welfare system. Neither do I accept that there is any widespread fraud as far as women recipients of social welfare are concerned.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises that expenditure on social welfare has been increasing very rapidly in recent years.  The total expenditure on social welfare is now approximately £2½ billion a year.  This represents about 25 per cent of current Government spending.  In other words, £1 in every £4 spent by the State is spent on social welfare.  This is the equivalent of approximately 14 per cent of the gross national product.  It is in everybody's interest that this vast amount of money is well spent and that it goes to the people who rightfully need it.  There is a perception that some claimants of social welfare are not genuine and in order to deal with that perception and so that it will be seen by the general public that there is not widespread abuse of the social welfare system and so that it will be seen that the money is going to the people who are properly eligible for it, the Joint Committee agree that strict accountability and <Col N="508" /> control are necessary but the Joint Committee would not like to see too great an emphasis placed on control to the detriment of the service provided to the general public.</P>
    <P>As a result of the recession and the increase in unemployment in recent years, many families find great difficulty in meeting their commitments and many families who, a few years ago, knew nothing about social welfare or about the social welfare system, are now very much part of the system and they have to depend totally on social welfare for their most basic requirements.  The only money going into many households is provided by social welfare and, of course, this puts an extra burden on married women who have to try to make ends meet in a situation where they have no income other than what they receive through social welfare.</P>
    <P>Social welfare also involves stress for recipients.  Already they have the stress brought about by unemployment or by the difficult situation in which they find themselves, but there is the further stress of having to deal with social welfare officials some of whom &mdash; a minority I would say &mdash; can be insensitive at times to the situation in which those social welfare applicants find themselves.  There is also the difficulty of understanding and coping with official forms and official communications. Very often those official forms and official communications are very complicated and it is beyond the capacity of ordinary individuals to deal with those forms, and the Joint Committee feel that all communications and correspondence to the general public in relation to social welfare should be written in a language that is simple and easy to understand.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem that many people do not know what their entitlements are under the social welfare code. The joint committee agreed that there should be a booklet written in simple language, which the committee described in the report as a social welfare passport, which would outline particulars of the various schemes available and the conditions of eligibility for those schemes.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing number of <Col N="509" /> people who have to rely on charitable and voluntary organisations to supplement the payments they receive from social welfare because the general level of social welfare payments is inadequate. In the case of most payments, the level of payment is hardly sufficient to meet the basic needs of the individual or the family, and because of this fact unemployed women and mothers who are depending on social welfare are finding it increasingly difficult to cope.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem that unemployed women are finding it increasingly difficult, too, to re-enter the workforce because there is a tendency on the part of many employers to give a preference to men when jobs become available and this leads to a situation where, in the case of women, they must exist in many cases for longer periods on social welfare payments than men.</P>
    <P>There is another area with which the Joint Committee dealt and an area which causes quite a number of problems.  That is the area of means testing.  Many of the social welfare payments are means tested payments.  The Joint Committee agreed that means testing today is not carried out in a uniform manner.  Different criteria are laid down for different payments and the means testing is carried out by different officers.  Neither is there any uniformity between the means testing and the method used by the health boards in assessing eligibility for medical cards or for the different schemes which are operated by the health boards and the means tests which are carried out by the Department of Social Welfare.  The members of the Joint Committee felt that there should be a uniform system of means testing for all the various schemes so that when a person's means have been assessed for a particular scheme that he or she should be furnished with particulars of their means as assessed and that this should be sufficient for the various schemes irrespective of whether the individual is applying for a payment operated by the Department of Health or by the health boards or a payment operated by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> Another area which the Joint Committee examined in detail was that of living alone allowances.  Senator O'Brien has already referred to the section of the report which deals with this.  As Senators know, certain categories of social welfare recipients qualify for a living alone allowances and, if they are eligible for these allowances, they also qualify for other benefits, such as the free telephone rental allowance.  It was the view of the committee that at the moment there is too rigid an interpretation of the term &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; or of the living alone condition. The committee agreed that somebody such as a relative, who does not reside permanently with the social welfare recipient but who might stay with that social welfare recipient at night, should not debar that social welfare recipient from receiving the living alone allowance and for qualifying for the other benefits which depend on a social welfare recipient being alone.  We had evidence of cases where social welfare recipients lost their living alone allowance because of the fact that somebody such as a very young person &mdash; a grandchild, in one particular case &mdash; went to stay with that social welfare recipient at night.  The person involved was an old age pensioner and that old age pensioner's living alone allowance was withdrawn as were the other benefits which that pensioner had been receiving up to then.  The committee feels &mdash; and there was unanimity on this &mdash; that there should be a more flexible interpretation of the living alone condition.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Brien said, the committee went into considerable detail in the section which deals with women in the home.  There are many women who have spent all their lives in the home either as housewives and mothers or as single persons caring for aged relatives. These people were referred to in many of the submissions received by the Joint Committee.  It was the view of the committee that women in this category need greater support from the social welfare system than they are getting at present. It was also the unanimous view of the <Col N="511" /> committee that dental and optical benefit should be extended to all such women.</P>
    <P>The committee also felt that the single women's allowance, which is paid to single women between the ages of 58 and 66, is totally inadequate.  There is also a very severe means test applied to applicants for this allowance with the result that many such women do not qualify for the maximum allowance.  In fact it is only a minority of women who qualify for the maximum allowance.  The committee felt that the single woman's allowance should be at least the same as the non-contributory pension for a widow without child dependants and that it should be paid at 55 years.</P>
    <P>The prescribed relative allowance was also looked at.  The condition which lays down that there should be no other adult in the household makes it very difficult for many pensioners to qualify for this allowance, because it is also laid down in the conditions that the prescribed relative must not be a married person.  I would agree with everything Senator O'Brien said in relation to the prescribed relative allowance.</P>
    <P>There is the situation where an incapacitated pensioner is being looked after and cared for by a daughter-in-law who has no blood relationship with the pensioner and yet that daughter-in-law is excluded from the prescribed relative allowance scheme and the pensioner cannot qualify for a prescribed relative allowance in respect of that daughter-in-law. The committee felt that this condition in relation to the prescribed relative allowance should be re-examined and relaxed because, were it not for the care and attention which is being given by persons who are described as prescribed relatives and were it not for the care and attention that elderly and incapacitated pensioners are receiving from such persons, then many of those elderly pensioners would require institutional care. This would be much more costly on the State.</P>
    <P>We also dealt with the situation of older women.  There was much evidence before the committee that many women, <Col N="512" /> particularly women between the ages 60 to 66, the age at which women normally qualify for old age contributory or non-contributory pensions, have to depend on voluntary and charitable organisations to supplement their incomes.  The Joint Committee would like to see the low levels of existing old age contributory and non-contributory pensions raised.  They would like to see the qualifying age reduced progressively to 60 years.</P>
    <P>Widows find difficulty in coping, particularly in the early years of widowhood. We gave particular consideration to those widows whose late husbands, because they were over 66 years and in receipt of old age pension, were also in receipt of allowance such as the free electricity allowance.  Then on the death of the husbands their wives were not of pension age and consequently those allowances were taken from them.  The members of the committee were unanimous in recommending that widows in this situation, under 66 years whose late husbands had been in receipt of free electricity allowance, should be allowed to continue to receive the free electricity allowance for a minimum period of at least two years. The members also agreed that women who had spent their lives in the home and who had given a lifetime of service in the home should be entitled to receive a non-contributory pension in their own right and should not be regarded as dependants of their spouses.  At the moment they are regarded as dependants of their spouses.  When their eligibility for old age pension is being assessed whatever income or pension their spouses might have is taken into account and such women in many cases do not qualify for old age pension in their own right.  It was the view of the committee that such women should be entitled to receive an old age non-contributory pension and should not have the means of their spouses taken into account when being assessed.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien also referred to the section of the report which deals with social welfare payments and the delay in processing claims for social welfare payment.  The committee noted that the <Col N="513" /> first annual report of the Ombudsman referred to the fact that almost half the complaints against Government Departments related to social welfare.  The report also referred to the hardships which people suffered because of delays by the Department of Social Welfare in paying people.  The committee were very unhappy about these long delays.  While we understood that because of Government restrictions on the recruitment of staff certain sections in the Department are shortstaffed at present and that this is contributing to delays in processing of claims, we felt that the Government should make every effort to improve the overall staffing position in the Department either by relaxing the embargo on recruitment in the Department itself or by transferring officials from other Departments to the Department of Social Welfare.  Only when this happens will there be a more speedy and efficient service available to social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>It would also help if decision-making powers were extended to local social welfare officers.  At present the situation is that the majority of claims have to be referred to Dublin for a final decision. This leads to long delays.  If decision-making powers were given to local social welfare officers the processing and payment could be speeded up considerably.</P>
    <P>The committee also considered the inadequacy of the facilities available at many social welfare offices.  Many social welfare offices are located in old buildings with no facilities for women who wish to bring their children with them when they have to attend these offices.  The committee feel that the provision of such facilities in these offices is urgently required.  They urge that priority be given to the provision of such facilities.  The committee feel that there should be a better standard of accommodation in all employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>On page 39 of the report the recommendations of the committee are set out. A total of 23 recommendations were put forward.  I agree with Senator O'Brien that some of the recommendations have <Col N="514" /> cost implications which in some cases are quite significant.  However, the Joint Committee felt that they would not be dealing adequately with their brief were they not to make these recommendations. Other recommendations made by the committee have no cost implications and could, in the view of the committee, be dealt with fairly easily.  If many of these recommendations were implemented they would give the social welfare system a more humane face particularly as far as women are concerned.</P>
    <P>The committee spent many hours considering the various oral and written submissions which were received.  They worked very hard on the preparation of this report and I was pleased to hear Senator O'Brien's favourable comments on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the committee members from this House &mdash; Senators Mullooly, Dooge, Fitzsimons, Higgins, Loughrey and Queally &mdash; together with their colleagues from the other House who have devoted so many hours to the problem of women's rights with particular regard to the social welfare code.  All of us with active political constituencies where we meet many people every week agree that 25 per cent to 30 per cent of all problems brought to us at that level are related to how women are affected by the social welfare code. This is an indication of how discriminatory the code has been towards women, their entitlements under its various headings and the difficulties they have experienced in establishing their various rights under different headings.  We welcome the fact that some changes have been made in this regard recently by way of legislation which will give women the same rights as men with regard to unemployment, the term in which they can be unemployed without being discriminated against and the level of payment made to them in their own right as adults and not just dependants of their spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that this legislation has been brought through both Houses of the Oireachtas and I look forward to early action by the Minister for Social Welfare in <Col N="515" /> bringing the necessary order before the House which will put the legislation into operation.  I understand that there have been difficulties in getting agreement from various interests but we all accept that the overall interest of the beneficiary &mdash; in this instance the woman &mdash; should be our prime concern.  I look forward to an early resolution of the problem which has precluded the Minister from signing the order bringing this legislation into effect.</P>
    <P>Many headings in the social welfare code dealing with women have been addressed by this Oireachtas Joint Committee. They vary from the supplementary welfare code, the single women's allowance, widow's pensions, unmarried mothers' allowance, unemployment assistance, children's allowance, wives of pensioners, maternity services and all other areas of the social welfare code involving women.  One of the problems pinpointed by the committee is that of means testing.  Those of us who represent people who are subjected to the odium of means testing realise that a rationalisation of this system is necessary.  A national contribution system of pensions for everybody, whether men or women, farmers or property owners, would be a way in which this problem could be overcome.  The area of means testing women can be discriminatory.  At present, whether or not they have access to their husband's assets or incomes, the law determines that they have 50 per cent of them.  Some may be fortunate to have that amount or even more, but some may be unfortunate enough not to have any as a result of the male partner reneging on his responsibilities.  Because of the system of means testing it is presumed that wives have access to 50 per cent of their husbands' income and are thereby discriminated against with regard to the Department of Social Welfare assistance schemes.  This problem must be addressed.  It can only be addressed if the Minister, who has given a commitment of intent to do so, brings in a national pay-related contributory pension scheme for everybody.  This would eliminate all <Col N="516" /> means testing because everybody would be a contributory pensioner.  It would also do away with the anomaly of people divesting themselves of all their assets at a certain stage in their lives thereby qualifying for full non-contributory pensions and their families benefiting from the transfer of property.  That is the way we have been implementing the scheme to date and that is what creates the problems then when it comes to means testing.</P>
    <P>The single women's allowance, which was innovative when it was brought in, was introduced for the specific reason that in this country many girls stayed at home and were unable to go to work simply because they were required at home to mind the house, to look after the rest of the family or to look after elderly parents or sick mothers or otherwise. They had always been discriminated against until that scheme was brought in.  I honestly feel that, on present trends and on the statistics available to us, that allowance should be paid at a much younger age than presently and should be paid at a level that would be equivalent to a pension or payment for unmarried mothers or widows or any other such category.</P>
    <P>That particular category of women have given tremendous service in the home to their families and have been precluded from the normal facilities of being able to go to work and make their own contributions and qualify for their retirement pensions and so on.  They have been forced through economic and humanitarian circumstances to remain in the home and have been penalised up to then.  I hope that, on the recommendation of the committee, the Department and the Minister will address themselves to that category of person and how they are means tested.  The single woman's allowance is paid to somebody who stands in the middle of the street without a roof over her head, with no income and no visible means of support.  Anything from a pound upwards is counted in a means-testing situation.  The Department have an extraordinary system of determining what is the benefit of living under a roof.  It depends on who owns the roof <Col N="517" /> at times, but certainly the interpretation of the value of being able to live in a house, whether it is yours or somebody else's, is extraordinary, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy, too, that nowadays we are confronted with the problem of so many broken marriages and so many deserted wives who have difficulty in establishing their rights.  There is much talk currently in the other House of the Oireachtas and in political groupings and in the country by way of opinion polls about how the Legislature should address this problem of marital breakdown.  We dealt with that at length in the report from that committee.  There is no doubt in my mind that the stresses and strains created on marriages by the State at times is sufficient to contribute to this problem. I have no doubt that the State has not addressed itself to its constitutional requirement to sustain the family unit where possible and to give it every help and assistance, guidance and succour.</P>
    <P>Because of our inability as a State to do that, demands have been made on marriages which have created problems and stresses which have lead to marital breakdown and deserted wives.  I am concerned about the trauma that these unfortunate women go through and I am more concerned about women who have been deserted than men who have been deserted.  The larger percentage are deserted wives and they are usually left with the responsibility of the children and sometimes the responsibilities of the home by the deserting husband.  The length of time it takes to convince the Department that a wife is deserted is, in my opinion extraordinarily long.  She has to prove that she has made reasonable efforts to find him.  She would not be claiming a deserted wife's allowance if she did not have difficulty in finding him. When she finds him, even if he is in another country, the Department will insist that she makes an effort to take out court orders and barring orders and orders for maintenance, involving all these traumatic procedures that many an Irishwoman does not want to resort to. She does not want to have the odium of <Col N="518" /> going through a court procedure to get a declaration of responsibility of the husband. Even if she achieves this legally, nine times out of ten the husbands disregard the court findings and allow the women to be penniless.</P>
    <P>She then has to turn to the supplementary welfare officer, who keeps on pressurising her every week that she goes to him and asks him for money to buy food for herself and her children and to do something about her claim.  She is told &ldquo;You will have to do something about it.  We cannot continually be giving you money.&rdquo;  I would like to remind the supplementary welfare officers that their code is specific; it is their job to look after people in difficulty, and women in this category are in difficulty.  I know a lot of women at the moment who have problems in this area.  I want to pay tribute to the Law Centre in Waterford which has been tremendously helpful to them in trying to advise them of their rights and how they should move to get their entitlements established.  They are having tremendous difficulty and they are almost subject to abuse in the week when they have to come and get money to feed their children.  That is an unfair system.  It is very difficult.  It is difficult enough for the woman as it is without having to go through all this bureaucracy that attaches to that allowance.</P>
    <P>The deserted wive's benefit is much simpler possibly because the woman has already made contributions while she was in employment.  She can claim from that and it makes the system that much easier. Where the woman has had no contribution the deserted wifes' allowance is quite difficult.  The period of waiting for establishment of a claim is too long.  Certainly, in this area I would ask the Department, having regard to the rules and regulations that they follow, to keep their hearts on the right side in this instance.  Even if an allowance is granted in circumstances that afterwards cannot be justified, that would be a small price to pay to counter the hardship that women have to go through during this period.</P>
    <P>The recent children's allowance increase &mdash; if you could call it that &mdash; in <Col N="519" /> the budget is a movement towards a child benefit scheme.  I welcome that and I am disappointed that the scheme which was announced in the programme <i>Building on Reality</i> has not come to fruition, because the sooner that payments are made from the Department directly to the mother in the home for her children and the sooner they are paid at a level that is commensurate with the responsibilities of looking after children in a home, the better I would like it.  I hope that the Government will move forward in that area now that they have assessed the child benefit scheme in its own right and will ensure that the normal child allowance would not necessarily be benefiting the rich, as it is today, but that it would be channelled towards the poorer families, the families more in need and the larger families which have such a tremendous draw on their resources.</P>
    <P>I would also commend the innovation of paying an allowance to the wives of prisoners, because before that came in they were literally deserted and had no income and were depending totally on supplementary welfare.  Now they are treated, in the period in which the husband is away, the same as any unmarried mother or any widow.</P>
    <P>The unmarried mother's allowance nowadays is being subject to critical analysis by people who are quite conservative in their outlook.  There was a time when women who went through this trauma of being unmarried mothers were locked away in institutions.  They were not psychiatric institutions; they were locked away in geriatric institutions and were expected to give a lifetime of service in that institution because they were unfortunate enough to have a child out of wedlock.  The child was usually then adopted by the institution, but the person concerned lived out her life in that institution. Thankfully, that has changed over the past decade or so.  I welcome it, because all of us were aware of these unfortunate people to whom this happened. The fact that the State recognised that they were one parent families was some help to them in that situation and <Col N="520" /> allowed them the opportunity to keep their children.  In spite of all that has been said about it, I am unaware of any great exploitation or abuses of the scheme or that women have further children so as to benefit from the income.  Statistics might prove me wrong.</P>
    <P>I would hope that in the whole area of women's affairs we have been moving towards equality for women.  Women who wish to remain in the home should be supported; people who want to go to work should be allowed to do so.  EC legislation ensures that there is equality for women in the workplace as well as in the home.  Equality is coming into the level of payments women get at work. That is another department and is not dealt with in this report.  We have been slow to move forward but there is no doubt that we have been making attempts to progress.  I agree that reports such as this gives us a vehicle to say to the Department through the committee and the House that there are areas we want them to look at in particular.</P>
    <P>Could I ask the Department particularly to look at the area of the appeals system in regard to women's unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and disability benefit?  Unemployment benefit for a woman has been difficult to obtain up to now.  She had to almost go down on her knees to prove her eligibility. When it came to unemployment assistance it was practically impossible.  If you were a married woman it was almost assumed by the investigating officer that you were not available for work and they even had the audacity at times to say: &ldquo;You are not making genuine efforts to get work.&rdquo;  I could produce reams of letters from unemployed married women who are trying to get work and need to get work from employers who have no work available.  Still the Department can suggest they are not making a genuine effort to seek employment.  If they have children they almost have to get a sworn affidavit from the grandparents to say that they will mind the children or that other baby sitting facilities are available. A married woman who is unemployed has to go through much more red tape to <Col N="521" /> prove her eligibility for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>In the whole area of disability appeals I am dissatisfied with the autonomy of the medical referees in the Department of Social Welfare.  I am dissatisfied that according to the regulations a medical referee or officer can give his opinion and because that medical officer was obliged to give an opinion under the regulations no matter how incorrect it may be on medical grounds and no matter how discriminatory that decision may be, it is almost impossible to change it.  I have had to go to the most extraordinary lengths to prove that the medical evidence produced by the applicant was of such a substantial nature that anybody looking at the case could not but agree that the person was unfit for work.  I had to produce X-Rays and medical evidence from all sorts of consultants.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in any future changes in the area of the social welfare appeals system where medical evidence is to be taken into account, that before a considered opinion is given by a medical referee or officer, that officer should have facilities to check the opinion he is giving, because X-Rays are involved and hospital reports are involved and the facilities available to the investigating referee are inadequate, just a room in some supplementary welfare officer's old brokendown courthouse with no facilities or equipment except what he may bring in a bag.  Decisions were made which I have proved were medically incorrect.  One I had to prove to the Ombudsman's office, after two years of pleading.  I do not support cases that are not genuine.  I know some people play the system.  When you have a genuine case involving medical evidence which can be substantiated by independent medical referees and independent hospital facilities, consultants and X-Rays then the Department's officers should take those into account and not just their own opinions.  I am putting that seriously to the Minister.  It is an area we should address ourselves to. I am speaking from experience.  The only way one can be critical of anything is <Col N="522" /> from one's experience of how it works on the ground.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure for the Department of Social Welfare is running at about £2½ billion a year.  That represents 25 per cent of Government spending or 14 per cent of the gross national product, a lot of money.  It is our job to ensure that it goes to the people most in need.  One way to ensure that it is given fairly is to have a contributory scheme for people who will then have allowances and pensions in their own right.  But while there is a differentiation involved in the system of analysing people's means, then there will be problems on the ground.</P>
    <P>I commend the report to the House.  I commend the members of the committee who have addressed themselves to the various problems.  I hope sincerely that the Minister and the Department will take account of what our representatives on that committee found regarding anomalies in the implementation of the system of social welfare, particularly in relation to women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the report of the Committee on Women's Rights because of the importance of social welfare to women. There are many anomalies and problems in the social welfare code but I want to begin my contribution by focusing on two areas and on those I wish to express the sharpest criticism of the Government that I can express from my position here. These are areas of flagrant, unlawful discrimination against married women. One is a discrimination that the Government are continuing despite their legal obligation to remove it.  The other is a new discrimination against married women which the Government introduced. It is important when we are discussing a report of this kind to highlight these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will begin with the inexcusable failure of the Government to carry out their legal obligation under the EC to implement the third directive on equal treatment in social welfare.  The third directive, as the House knows, was passed in 1978 by the Council of Ministers of the EC and <Col N="523" /> member states got six years time lag to introduce that legislation.  It was recognised that it was a complex area.  That six years ran out on the 22 December 1984. The Government have still not fulfilled their obligations under that directive. The Bill was passed last July but it has not yet been brought into operation.  The latest word given by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare in the course of the budget debate was that he hoped it might be done by June.  What does that mean?  It means that we have been flagrantly and unlawfully discriminating against married women for well over 12 months.  We have been discriminating against married women to the tune of approximately £5 a week for those who are on unemployment benefit or disability. We have been discriminating in the length of time for which they can obtain unemployment benefit or disability because the period for married women, as the house knows, runs out after 312 days and for married men, single men and single women it is 390 days.  That is a matter of £700 or £800 for a woman. She is being denied it.</P>
    <P>Married women are still being discriminated against in not being able to avail of unemployment assistance. The conditions under which a married woman can avail of unemployment assistance are so restrictive that virtually no married women can avail of unemployment assistance. They are also discriminated against in relation to allowances.  I would like to pose a question to the House.  If it was some other group that was discriminated against in this way what would be the reaction?  Let us begin with farmers.  If farmers knew that under the EC regulations they were entitled to £5 more a week since December 1984, do you think they would not be gathered in their thousands outside picketing this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not get all they are promised either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a promise. This is a legal entitlement.  It is different. <Col N="524" /> Promises are promises.  Legal obligations are legal obligations, and this is a legal obligation.  It is very significant that, although various bodies such as the Employment Equality Agency &mdash; and, indeed, this report &mdash; refer to the lack of implementation of the directive, it is done in polite language.  After all, these are only married women; it is not really serious.  We are depriving them of what they are legally and properly entitled to, but there are administrative difficulties. It is a bloody disgrace.</P>
      <P>I will now turn to the next matter, and that is the new discrimination which has been introduced by the Government. Under the provisions of the EC we are prohibited from discriminating on the grounds of sex, either in relation to pay or conditions of employment or social welfare.  Yet the Government introduced a measure which is a very commendable measure in itself &mdash; the social employment scheme &mdash; a scheme to reduce the number of unemployed who are on the live register.  The eligibility conditions for that scheme are directly discriminatory against married women.  They cannot qualify for them because the eligibility conditions for participation in the social employment scheme are as follows; you must have been drawing either benefit or assistance for one year.  You must, at the time you applied for social employment be drawing unemployment assistance. For two reasons married women cannot qualify for that.  They cannot draw unemployment assistance, so they cannot be eligible under that condition.  They cannot be on benefit for one year because they are cut off after 312 days maximum. Married women, unless they are in circumstances where they are separated from their husbands or in the very rare situation where the husband is incapable of work and financially dependent on them, cannot in any shape qualify for unemployment assistance, even if they satisfy the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, we have a Government scheme introduced which is flagrantly discriminatory on the basis of sex and marital status against married women.  Once again the matter has been raised.  The <Col N="525" /> Employment Equality Agency have drawn attention to it.  Other bodies have drawn attention to it.  It does not seem to matter because we are only dealing with married women.  I noted that the Joint Committee on Women's Rights did refer to the fact that women do not have a real sense of equal entitlement in the area of social welfare.  Why should they?  What would induce them to feel that they had an equal entitlement when they are treated in this manner?  I feel angry, and I am expressing myself in angry terms because I think the two areas that I have pointed out are quite unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to other matters, some of them dealt with by the Joint Committee, but first some matters that were not expressly dealt with but which I think are important in looking at the way in which the social welfare code affects women.  That is what we are looking at in debating this report.  One issue which is not dealt with in the report is the operation of the so-called cohabitation rule.  Very serious problems have arisen in the way in which the cohabitation rule is applied.  This rule, as Members of the House will know, applies in relation to a wide number of benefits, almost all of them, all except the survivor's benefit, are benefits which relate to women.  The effect of the rule is that the benefit or allowance is terminated if the woman is living with a man, if they are living together as man and wife.  That is governed by the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act and by various regulations under that Act.  It affects the deserted wife, the widow, the unmarried mother, the prisoner's wife.  If the woman in question is living with a man then her allowance or benefit is terminated on that ground.</P>
    <P>I would like to examine the basis of that.  The only reasonable basis for termination of payment of the allowance would be because the man with whom the woman is living is supporting her. That is the logical basis, the only reasonable and rational basis, unless we provide to the State a role in punishing us for our moral conduct.  Is it the case that the allowance or benefit is to be terminated <Col N="526" /> because the woman is living with somebody to whom she is not married?  That would be an absurd proposition.  People may not approve of the conduct of living with a man to whom the woman is not married, but we have not got to the stage of imposing a financial penalty on that ground alone.  We do not purport to do that, but that is what we are doing at the moment.  Allowances or benefits are being terminated under this so-called cohabitation rule where there is no proof of any support or dependency payment or receipt of financial benefit by the woman in the particular circumstances.  I know of a number of cases where the allowance or benefit has been cut off even though the man is himself in receipt of a single person's unemployment benefit so how could he be supporting someone else.  Yet the fact that they are living together as man and wife is the factor that is taken into account in terminating the benefit.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that this matter is examined and that it is made clear that the only basis on which the cohabitation rule can be applied is proof of financial dependency, proof that the man in question is in fact supporting.  The importance of this is that in almost all the cases where the woman is in receipt of the kind of allowance or benefit that we are talking about, there are children involved.  You have this cruel circumstance where the mother and her children have their allowance or benefit terminated because she is having an affair with someone.  This is in circumstances where there is no financial support from that person, yet that woman and her children are immediately placed at financial risk. What happens is that you have a whole covert operation by a woman who contorts herself in her sexual relationships in order not to pay the ultimate price of having her whole source of income cut off because of that relationship.  That is something that warrants some serious attention and in a way I am surprised that it has not been dealt with in the committee's report.</P>
    <P>There is a form of discrimination against unmarried mothers in relation to <Col N="527" /> the payment of the unmarried mother's allowance.  This was referred to by Senator Ferris in his contribution as being an important allowance.  It was first introduced in 1973.  It is an important allowance for single mothers and their children but, unlike the whole range of comparable allowances, there is no provision for a benefit.  There is no unmarried mother's or single mother's benefit.  Cherish and other organisations concerned with single parents have been making representations for more than a decade seeking to ensure that where a mother has been contributing and has been in insured employment so that she has accumulated the employment record to entitle her to a benefit she should be in a position to draw benefit if she was a deserted wife or a widow in comparable circumstances but for some strange reason for which there has never been a rational explanation there has been a consistent refusal by the Department to extend that to the unmarried mother.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to some of the areas that have been dealt with by the committee and in very large measure I agree with their comments.  I want to turn first to the system of appeals, which is dealt with in chapter 13 of their report. They look at the appeal system and note that there is general dissatisfaction with it.  They are right in their comments on it and in their call for a more independent element in the appeal system.  I am surprised that they did not go further in a way in their examination and note that there is no appeal system established under the supplementary welfare system although the 1975 Act which established the supplementary welfare allowances provides for regulations establishing an appeal system.  That has never been done. Why has this not been done?  Why is there not a proper appeal system at all for supplementary welfare?  They are the people in the greatest need.  Certainly in so far as I have come in contact, and I have done so probably with increasing frequency, with people who have problems in the area of supplementary welfare, the way in which their so-called <Col N="528" /> appeals are handled is appalling.  They do not have any way of knowing how it is being dealt with.  They have no way of knowing how long it will take and ultimately when they get a letter saying that their appeal has been refused they have absolutely no idea what the basis of that was.  The rules or principles of natural justice do not impinge at all in this area. Yet these are people in the greatest need. These are people who because they are in the greatest need have applied for and in some manner or other been refused supplementary welfare allowance.  I would hope that this is something that will be examined by the Commission on Social Welfare but I would add to the views expressed by the Joint Committee in relation to the needs for reform of the appeals system.</P>
    <P>Another area I would like to highlight is the number of recommendations made by the committee in relation to the payment of deserted wife's benefit and indeed the whole approach to the payment of this benefit or allowance.  I agree with the recommendations by the committee.  The present requirement or rule that a women must establish that she has been deserted for a period of three months, that she has made efforts to locate or seek support from her husband, are an incredible hardship at a time when a woman is already coping with multiple problems &mdash; the problem of desertion itself, the problem of coping alone with children and the problem of coping with financial bills on her own.  To put on top of that the very severe hardship of the three months rule and the burden of seeking the initial support from her husband have caused enormous hardship and I think it is something that should be dealt with.  I would agree with the approach recommended by the committee.  I think the burden of looking for support from the husband must be borne either by the Department or by a body established for that purpose as has happened in other countries and works much better and creates a much better possibility of obtaining more contributions from deserting husbands.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Joint Committee <Col N="529" /> note, and it is correct in doing so, that it is not in all cases the husband who deserts, that there are cases where it is the wife who has deserted, leaving the husband with the care of children and that here we have no provision for a deserted husband's allowance.  That matter, as Members may know, was tested in the courts but came up against the particular provision in Article 41 of the Constitution which recognises the special position of the woman in the home.  That was sufficient not to allow a constitutional challenge to that discrimination to be mounted but that does not say it is something that should not be looked at and examined on its merits because if either spouse is deserted and left with the care of young children, then there is no rational or reasonable basis for distinguishing between them in relation to their needy circumstances for an allowance or indeed a benefit and the entitlement should be there regardless of sex.  It should be part of and I hope will be part of the equal treatment which I have been talking about.</P>
    <P>As I emphasised, I think this report brings home the reality of the significant importance of social welfare for women and indeed it ties it in to a considerable extent with the problem both of poverty in a real sense, the number of families in Ireland who live at or below the poverty line, but also the problems for families where there has been a sudden drop in income.  Again under the general family relationships and cultural approach it is by and large the woman who is coping at the front line of trying to make ends meet, of trying to live on a very minimal income under our social welfare code. Yet, as I think has been evident from the report and indeed from the additional areas that I have raised, there is still not only evidence of anomalies and hardships under that code but also blatant and unacceptable discrimination.  When a system so unfairly discriminates against a particular category it creates its own judgment on the kind of people against whom it is discriminating.  It undermines their sense of their own worth and of their own standing in the community and of their <Col N="530" /> own participation as a group.  It is a matter of the utmost urgency that the blatant discriminations be removed forthwith and that the recommendations in the report be implemented.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister in his contribution, if he would, to give the House an indication of when the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare will be published.  This commission was established in 1983.  It certainly has been sitting for quite a period now.  The area that it is dealing with is very complex and very detailed and it is understandable that it would take a considerable time for the committee to come up with recommendations, but the truth is now that we are running out of time.  If the Commission on Social Welfare do not report very rapidly there will not be time to implement whatever recommendations they may make, particularly the priority recommendations which they may make.</P>
    <P>The time lags for any kind of legislation are appalling.  Take the time lag on illegitimacy. Even though there was a White Paper on it published last May we still have not seen a Bill.  Take the time lag on the Child Care Bill which is at the moment in the other House.  It was introduced last April.  It has only just finished its Second Stage and we do not know when the Committee Stage will be ordered.  If the Commission on Social Welfare come forward and I hope they will, with very radical proposals requiring reforming legislation, the time lags are going to be quite substantial and unless the commission report very rapidly they are not going to be within the lifetime of this Government.  I would be deeply concerned that, where a Government take an important step and initiative of establishing a commission of that kind, they ensure the commission bring in their report in time for their recommendations to be put into practice.  That is the point of establishing the commission.  I would hope that that would be the effect of it.</P>
    <P>With those words, I very much welcome the report and commend the Joint Committee for having highlighted this area in their second report.  It has had a proper sense of priorities in doing that <Col N="531" /> and I hope they will bring in many further reports to be debated in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the second report of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  The whole area of social welfare is a quagmire for most people.  There are two differing attitudes towards social welfare recipients.  There is the attitude of the people who are in receipt of benefits and the attitude of the people who are paying the taxes which provide the benefits.  There is a huge conflict as between the attitudes of these two groups of people.  We have a very high level of dependency on social welfare. We have a huge number of young people who are depending on benefits of one kind or another from the State and we have an increasing number of elderly people who are in receipt of benefits. There is a smaller number of people providing the benefits.  Unemployment is growing and people who are at work are in some instances very critical of some of the benefits which are being given to people.  They have the feeling that benefits are too high in many cases.  They have the feeling that benefits are going to people who should not get them.  They have the idea that there is wholesale fraud and that there is not enough monitoring of the social welfare system.  But, of course, as between the two attitudes, there is the reality that so many people are in need of benefit and it is essential that we look after these people, that we maximise their benefits and that we give them as much information as is possible about the range of benefits to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt but there is a huge number of people who are entitled to benefits but for one reason or another, because of lack of communication or lack of education, they are not getting the benefits to which they are entitled.  In many instances the blame for this can be laid squarely on the back of the Department of Social Welfare because communications from the Department of Social Welfare are not sent directly to the recipients in a manner in which the <Col N="532" /> recipient would be capable of interpreting. Too often an increase or a change of benefit scheme is announced in such a manner that it would take a civil servant to read it and analyse where the increases or changes in benefit will take place.</P>
    <P>Too often people who are in receipt of social welfare benefits have to put up with conditions which would not be put up with by anybody else in the State.  These people find that sometimes they are treated as if they are not deserving of the benefits and that they should not be getting them, especially by civil servants. At times they are treated like cattle in cattle pens.  In future I would hope that we would have proper training of civil servants who are going to deal with social welfare recipients, particularly social welfare applicants who go along for the first time to query their entitlement to benefits or indeed who go to sign for benefits of a particular nature.  There are civil servants dealing with the public, with people who are very stressful at the time, and the civil servants have had no training in dealing with people of this kind.  They have no training in the management of people who are under stress or in dealing with the problems associated with first time applicants for social welfare benefits.  There is absolutely no doubt but that, unless there is a more humane attitude on the part of civil servants who are dealing with these people, we are going to have huge problems.  It is easy to criticise the people who are dealing with the applicants but unfortunately because of their lack of training their attitude does not seem to be as sympathetic as it should be.</P>
    <P>Some of the buildings throughout the country to which people have a go for benefits are deplorable,.  We see people queueing in the open for hours, day after day, in all kinds of weather conditions. These are conditions which would not be put up with except by a vulnerable section of society who are totally dependent on social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>There is a need for very careful monitoring of the social welfare system to ensure that those who are in need get the maximum from the system and that only <Col N="533" /> those who are entitled to benefit will get it.  There are huge flaws in the administration of the social welfare system.  It is a system which is archaic in its administration. It is the most archaic of Departments in the sense that it is unable to cope with the number of people who are becoming involved in the network.  There is a need for decentralisation of the social welfare system and local social welfare officers should be able to monitor and to adjudicate on all of the benefits which are being applied for.  In this highly technological age there is a long overdue need for a computer terminal in every city and town in the country.  The cost would not be enormous but the benefits to the recipients would be enormous.  There is nothing more frustrating for somebody who is entitled to social welfare benefit than ringing 786444 and asking for the benefits section number and being told to hold on and that that number is engaged.  They may be ringing up to look for a cheque which is overdue.  They have probably borrowed the money for the phone call and suddenly they are left hanging on this one single phone line which seems to have to deal with every benefit number in the UA and UB section.  It is totally and utterly irresponsible for the Department of Social Welfare to have so few people manning these lines.  I do not know how many lines are attached to 786444 but obviously there are too few. There is no doubt in my mind but that the telephone system within the Department of Social Welfare in all sections is totally inadequate.  It is not cost effective either because there are too many people trying to get through at the one time.  I do not think a proper job is being done when an emergency arises and this is when the person down the country rings up trying to find out where their cheque is.  They probably have run out of credit in their local shop, they have no money in their pockets, they have not enough money to get their lunch, they have not enough money for their tea and they have nothing for the children in the house.  It is all right for the civil servant in Dublin to say that the computer is down today or the cheques were delayed <Col N="534" /> but that will not do the person down the country who has not a single penny in his pocket.</P>
    <P>Since this report deals with women's rights there are a number of areas where women's rights have not been addressed in the social welfare system.  One could go on all day addressing oneself to various aspects.  I am glad the report says there is a stigma attached to the appellation &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo; and that there should be some other way of describing people who, in 99 per cent of cases, through no fault of their own have lost their husbands through desertion.</P>
    <P>The system of adjudication on deserted wifes' benefits is atrocious.  Women are put through enormous trauma because they are queried about irrelevancies by social welfare officers who go along to check whether they are entitled or not entitled to benefit.  It takes three months before anybody is entitled to deserted wife's allowance even though the social welfare officer at local level knows very well that the husband has gone, that there is no hope of his coming back and of the deserted wife getting anything from him. The burden is thrown immediately on to the community welfare officer to provide the means to help out that family in their hour of need.  There is a long delay.  The attitude of certain social welfare officers towards these deserted wives is one of suspicion and this suspicion creates more stress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of Report No. 21 of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities: Crisis in Farming Summer 1985.</P>
      <P>Last year we had quite an unusual situation whereby, in the main, adverse weather conditions caused a crisis in farming.  The effectiveness of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC was demonstrated by their being able to address themselves to a problem that was causing severe financial hardship and a considerable amount of worry to large numbers of farmers in every part of the country.  It was encouraging and quite an experience to find that the Joint Committee proved so successful in highlighting the worries of many people and being able to marshal the support and the advice of the many different interest groups and, at the same time, to channel their combined views not only to the appropriate Government Department but to the European Community as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint committee, when considering this subject, were conscious of the circumscribing limitations of their order of reference.  While some of the areas covered can justifiably be held to be on the periphery of the Joint Committee's mandate, nevertheless, Community measures, particularly the Directive No. 268 of 1975 on mountain and hill farming and farming in less favoured areas, must place the subject well within the ambit of the orders of reference of the Joint Committee.  This contention is fortified by the fact that the European Parliament itself considered motions on the Irish farming crisis from four political groups and adopted a compromise resolution that was subscribed to by all the Irish MEPs, from both North and South.  I wish to place that resolution on the record <Col N="536" /> of the House because it is very much tied up with the work of the joint committee.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote Resolution No. 1 on Bad Weather in Ireland, as placed before the European Parliament:</P>
    <P>(a)  Having regard to the unparalleled crisis situation facing the farming community in Ireland, both North and South, following the disastrous summer weather of unprecedented rainfalls and storms,</P>
    <P>(b)  Conscious that a very high proportion of the Irish economy is directly dependent on agriculture &mdash; more so than in any other Member State,</P>
    <P>(c)  Aware also of the unprecedented devastation in many parts of the country to tillage crops and hundreds of animals killed following freak thunder, lightning and hail storms in July,</P>
    <P>(d)  Conscious that these disastrous weather conditions have led to the wholesale destruction of vital winter feed which cannot now be retrieved and to the drastic fall in livestock prices due to inevitable glut market conditions for cattle,</P>
    <P>(e)  Aware also of the disastrous losses in the cereal harvest, the destruction of the potato crop due to severe blight conditions and major losses suffered in the horticultural industry, all of which have resulted in significant reductions in farm incomes which cannot now be recovered,</P>
    <P>(f)  Whereas some individual farmers have suffered total loss of crops,</P>
    <P>(g)  Aware that Irish farmers are on average amongst the poorest in the Community and that this disaster will continue to aggravate their position for the coming years,</P>
    <P>(1)  Urges both the Commission and the Council to recognise the seriousness of the present farming crisis in Ireland;</P>
    <P>(2)  Calls on other Member States to demonstrate their solidarity by <Col N="537" /> supporting special measures of assistance to Irish farmers both North and South;</P>
    <P>(3)  Urgently requests the Commission and the Council to grant emergency aid to the affected areas and to propose appropriate measures to reduce the social and economic consequences of the disaster;</P>
    <P>(4)  Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council and the Irish and UK Governments.</P>
    <P>This resolution was subscribed to by all the Irish MEPs, both North and South, and in its own way it underlined the serious view that so many people took of the situation and the desire of so many people to ensure that the infrastructures and the legislation that is available, not only in the home country but in Europe also, should be brought to bear to come to the rescue of so many people who suffered the consequences of last summer.</P>
    <P>The report before the House was prepared for the Joint Committee by our sub-committee on agriculture and fishery matters.  It certainly measures up to the high standard of expertise we are able to assemble on all our reports.  We must be very conscious of the co-operation which we received from all the interested parties.  The Joint Committee in this report have expressed their thanks to ACOT, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society and the Irish Farmers' Association.  These bodies also made written submissions to the Joint Committee which were very helpful and useful in the compilation of the report.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee had the benefit of both oral and written submissions from the Department of Agriculture.  We are very appreciative of the Department's and the Minister's co-operation right through the entire problem.</P>
    <P>The loss of greatest concern was that of fodder for livestock due to the prolonged heavy rainfall.  While hay constitutes a <Col N="538" /> decreasing proportion of winter fodder supply &mdash; currently about 40 per cent as against 60 per cent for silage &mdash; last year's widespread loss of hay and to a much lesser extent of silage quality, which was not so dependent on good weather for successful harvesting, poses a very real threat of a severe loss of winter fodder this year.  Almost all of the larger, more progressive farmers across the country, have changed in recent times to silage making.  But a large number of farmers, particularly the smaller ones, perhaps especially in the western counties, adhere to haymaking.  In the south-western counties only about 20 per cent of the hay crop was secured and much of this proved to be of very poor quality.</P>
    <P>Even in the midlands, where these losses were not as catastrophic, they have been severe.  It is my experience that this year's quality of hay is very poor.  One of the most alarming side-effects of this is the number of farmers who in the normal course of handling hay and feeding it to cattle are suffering severe bouts of influenza or respiratory diseases.  This over the last number of weeks has been causing quite a problem on many farms. This has not been as bad since the difficult harvest of 1948, when hay was mouldy. It was not baled at that time and it was not so obvious a problem.</P>
    <P>The north-western counties would be the most severely affected.  In counties Mayo, Leitrim and Donegal about 70 per cent of the forage is hay.  Weather conditions there are particularly bad.  For the many farmers affected the loss of hay last year was, indeed, of crisis proportions. The lack of adequate fodder means they are having to sell off stock earlier than usual with consequent loss to farmers.</P>
    <P>In an effort to relieve this serious situation the Minister for Agriculture announced, on 8 August last, a nitrogen fertiliser subsidy scheme and a subsidy for first-time silage makers at a total estimated cost last year in excess of £2.5 million which was met, we are told, from savings in the agricultural Vote.  Given better weather, it was envisaged that the fertiliser would induce growth of grass <Col N="539" /> sufficient to enable the farmers concerned to take a late cut of silage.  That happened in some areas, but it was not possible in many others.</P>
    <P>In the case of the cereal harvest, damage to grain from sprouting due to humid conditions in wheat was widespread. However, an improvement in weather conditions towards the end of the season enabled crops to be harvested. Yields were well below normal and grain quality was generally poor, especially in the case of wheat.  There was, indeed, very little wheat paid for at the milling price.  In all, 1985 was not a profitable year for tillage farmers.  Most families engaged in tillage have carried severe losses into 1986.</P>
    <P>The subsidies and grants for first-time silage were estimated to have attracted 15,000 to 20,000 farmers.  I understand with regard to the fertiliser subsidy that about 10,000 farmers might have benefited from it.  That is of significant help with the entire problem.  We must be conscious of the prompt response of the Minister for Agriculture and the Government in this regard.  It certainly softens the blow in most quarters.  Of course, no matter how much money can be given on a national scale like that, it could never be sufficient to compensate for the losses and destruction.  Nevertheless, it was well worthwhile.  The Department's representatives gave the Joint Committee details of the rescue measures for the farmers in the Shannon valley. There are cash payments based on livestock units, with a maximum payment of £500 in any one case.  The offer of Community grain was considered by the Government and organised.  It has been of considerable benefit in the disadvantaged areas as well.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on the record that I very much appreciate the fact that last year was the first time any Government came with financial aid to farmers who have been affected by persistent flooding in the Shannon valley.  Regarding the flooding in the Shannon valley, on the western bank, where the farmers are all in the disadvantaged areas, they have <Col N="540" /> whatever benefits can be taken from the larger grants.  On the eastern bank, in Offaly, people do not see their land for at least five months of every year.  That is no exaggeration.  It just disappears in October and November, and with a little bit of luck it might reappear at the end of April or May.  I want to compliment Deputy Deasy, the Minister for Agriculture, and the Government in general for recognising for the first time the plight of so many farmers, large and small, in that area.  Up to a few years ago these people got absolutely no compensation or redress for the fact that they still paid rates on every one of those acres, while the rates were in force.</P>
    <P>It has been well established that as a result of the bad weather the situation in Irish farming reached disaster proportions. That has been accepted, both nationally and internationally.  The delegation from the Joint Committee who visited Brussels came away with the impression that this view was also shared at Community level.  The case was copperfastened by the visit of the Commission's Director General for Agriculture when he visited Ireland on 11 September to make an on the spot assessment for Commissioner Andriessen.  The delegates who visited Brussels came quickly to the conclusion that the Community Disaster Fund was not the appropriate vehicle to rescue Irish farmers, being limited in resources to approximately IR £2 million.  Our delegation learned from Commission officials that the idea behind the disaster fund was mainly compensation for personal injuries arising from natural disasters.  While it could be argued that the Irish farming situation, particularly in the Shannon valley, could justifiably be classified under this heading, the size of the fund ruled it out as being very effective.</P>
    <P>Intervention is another area that could be invoked to aid the beef sector.  Many farmers, when they did not have grass to continue on gazing their stock, were forced, in the earlier part of the summer or the earlier part of the autumn, to sell out.  The joint committee understood that in the past intervention rules have been <Col N="541" /> adopted on a regional basis in the Community to deal with specific problems. They urged that a similar course be sought for this country, as it was felt that at that time this could, perhaps, help to halt the side in beef prices and stabilise farm incomes.  Most fair-minded people will recognise the achievements of our Minister for Agriculture in negotiating a helpful deal in that regard towards the end of the autumn and in making the testing regulations a little easier on the ordinary farmer.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee, acknowledged the advantage of intervention grain from the Community both as a relief measure to Irish farming and as a solution to mounting surpluses in the Community. This scheme could be very effective if low-interest Euro-loans were made available to purchase it.  Underwriting of exchange risks and the waiving of handling charges by the banks would sharpen the impact of the scheme.  The Joint Committee welcome the intention of the Government not to limit the application of Community grain to any one area, but hopes that this scheme will not be the only response to the farmers' problem. The release of the grain in the Irish market was something which the committee thought should be carefully controlled.</P>
    <P>As regards the operation of the scheme, the Department, the Minister and his officials deserve the thanks of all concerned.  They have done an excellent job in a very short time.  It demonstrates the flexibility within the Department to be able to handle and take on board fairly substantial schemes at the shortest of notice.  Our thanks are due to the Minister and his officials both at headquarters and, indeed, at county and regional levels.  At Community level the grant of FEOGA schemes should be examined with a view to seeking a balanced solution to the problems in farming, which has fallen victim to unprecedented weather conditions.</P>
    <P>The joint committee are convinced that no single measure will provide an adequate remedy.  The problem must be attacked on several fronts.  The Irish <Col N="542" /> economy, as an integral part of the Community economy, is still heavily dependent on agriculture, accounting for up to 40 per cent of our exports.  Confidence in Irish agriculture has been badly shaken. The Community should do all it can to restore this confidence.  A big problem in Irish agriculture has been the shrinking profit margins, and with a disaster such as the weather imposed on the industry last year nobody can be blamed for this problem.  Since farming in the main is in the realm of the self-employed, medium term policies should be introduced to give the industry the lift-off it needs.  One of the greatest problems with aid in a disastrous situation such as this &mdash; and one the Department handled quite adequately &mdash; was being in a position to pinpoint the enormity of the situation. Despite the magnitude of the problem facing farmers last summer many managed to save their crops and provide fodder.  The problem is that in looking at the situation now a considerable percentage of fodder is of an inferior quality. The experience of many farmers is that the cattle prefer the barley straw being used for bedding purposes in preference to the hay.  That is an indication of the losses farmers will suffer because straw is only providing fibre.  Farmers who cannot feed adequate fodder this year will not achieve satisfactory weight gains in their herds.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee feels that there are many lessons to be learned from the experiences of last summer.  The farmers over-relying on hay instead of switching to a higher percentage of silage and the outwintering of cattle caused serious problems.  While the farmers could not have anticipated the unusual severity of the weather, it must be acknowledged that many farmers are ill-equipped to deal with it.  Group and co-operative fodder schemes must now be a high priority.  Drainage schemes with the aid of Community funds must also be considered in the long term, and extended and pursued with renewed vigor in order to prevent or lessen the impact of disasters such as that which befell the Shannon valley.  The drainage of the Shannon <Col N="543" /> valley is a subject I do not wish to go into, because elections have been won and lost on it for the last 50 years.  Nevertheless, there is an underlying problem. At least the farmers do not have to pay rates on those lands.  We look forward to a very fair and understanding system when the officials come to adjust the acres for the proposed land tax.  The fact that this land is submerged for several months of every year will, indeed, be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The committee have noted the galvanising effect that the farming crisis has had on farming organisations and are reassured by their unity of approach to the problem.  They agree that the measures to deal with the problem were well co-ordinated through the ACOT offices. Our committee, while not wishing to stray outside the terms of reference, think that it would not be injudicious to refer summarily to the non-Community measures which were advocated by farming bodies in their submission.  Those included the social welfare payments and the use of unoccupied factory space for fodder storage.  Perhaps when all the agencies are not under pressure, as they were at the end of 1985, it might be an idea at some stage to look at the problems and see how all those infrastructural facilities could be put to use in the interest of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I compliment and thank the Minister for Agriculture and the Government for addressing this problem and recognising the plight of so many farmers last year and for allocating considerable funds to alleviate the hardship.  Government measures were successfully introduced last year.  On 8 August, the nitrogen fertiliser subsidy was introduced at the rate of £35 per tonne of high nitrogen fertiliser. This was made available to farmers who purchased the fertiliser between the first week in August and the end of August. The only restriction in the scheme was to limit it to farmers with not more than 30 cows or 50 cattle.  Despite some gloomy forecasts, 24,000 applications for the subsidy were received.  The vast bulk were paid at a cost of over £600,000 to the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> Exchequer.  The second national measure was the silage subsidy at a rate of £4 per tonne, subject to a maximum of 50 tonnes per farmer in respect of silage made before 8 November on farms where silage had not been previously made.</P>
    <P>The response to the scheme exceeded the expectations of the Minister and his officials.  Over 30,000 farmers applied for the subsidy.  Over 9,000 applicants were paid before the end of the year.  The cost of that scheme exceeded £6 million.  The original estimate was very much smaller. On 6 September arrangements were announced for the payment to farmers in the Shannon valley affected by the floods of the sum of £20 per livestock unit up to a maximum of 25 livestock units per farmer, with a maximum payment of £500.  These payments were very welcome. It was the first time that any Government recognised the problem of the long-suffering farmers in the Shannon valley.  They certainly proved helpful to many of them.  I am not saying that the amount of money provided met the cost of the losses, but at least it was a help.  It certainly showed that the Minister and the Government recognised the difficulties of those farmers.  Payments were confined to people mainly dependent on farming with not more than 60 livestock units.  Special arrangements were made for those who suffered crop losses from flooding, so that they too obtained payment subject to an overall maximum of £500.  I understand that around 1,700 applicants under the scheme have been paid a total of over £500,000.  Those applicants will also be eligible to participate in the feed voucher scheme.  The Government also made special arrangements to bring forward last year's payments of the headage grants under the various sheep and cattle schemes.  These arrangements resulted in a total of £26 million more being paid in 1985 than in 1984.</P>
    <P>The most important measure, however, was the introduction of the feed voucher scheme over the whole country which enabled farmers who have a serious shortage of winter feed to buy feeding stuffs.  This scheme has worked exceptionally well in my constituency.  It <Col N="545" /> was based on £13,250 million from the Exchequer and 125,000 tonnes of intervention grain at 75 per cent of the intervention price from the EC, which was valued at £4 million.  Under the scheme farmers have received cash in grain vouchers which were exchangeable against the purchase of animal feeding stuffs from grain and feed merchants, subject to a value of £400 in any one case.  Almost 100,000 farmers applied under this scheme.  Most of them were proved eligible.</P>
    <P>The Minister extended the 30 day bovine TB test to 60 days.  That in itself greatly faciliated many farmers who were anxious to sell bullocks in the marts and it gave them the opportunity of showing their cattle at more than one mart.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister just last week of the introduction of a scheme for tillage farmers under which loans subsidised at the rate of 5 per cent will be made available to tillage farmers who suffered severe losses as a result of the bad weather.  This will cost around £2 million.  What compounds the losses of the grain farmers and tillage farmers is the fact that such a high percentage of them borrow or, as was always traditional, purchase their grain and fertilisers on account.  Last year when the harvest itself was not able to pay off the initial cost of sowing, that expense comes through.  While this latest facility being offered by the Minister is not really a direct cash grant, it will ease the burden of farmers who have to again this year borrow in order to sow tillage crops on their farms.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his powers of negotiations and on the continuation for a further year of the interest subsidy scheme which has proved so beneficial for thousands of farmers over the past number of years.  One thing evident in regard to the work of the Minister for Agriculture is the persistence of some farming organisations who do not seem to be able to quantify the amount of aid going into agriculture under the various headings.  The total Exchequer expenditure on agriculture, if we take 1980 as a base, amounted to</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> £3,752 million, whereas this year under the same heading we find that £6,827 million represents the total Exchequer expenditure on agriculture.  That figure has gone up.  Looking at the hand outs that the IFA have been distributing at recent meetings one would think that there were diabolical cut-backs all the way.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to invite colleagues in the farming industry to look at the actual figures and to ascertain the true facts for themselves, because, by and large, I think the response of the Minister for Agriculture and the Government in the difficult year just gone by for Irish farmers has been positive, helpful and has shown plenty of understanding.  It has been accompanied by a great personal response and understanding from the Department officials, whether the farm development service officers or the officers employed by ACOT.  Together they worked exceptionally well to provide as much aid and encouragement as possible to assist farmers in every way they could.  The difficulty last year, as a result of the adverse weather conditions, brought about a situation in our country that no Government, by Irish standards anyway, could afford to underwrite 100 per cent.  Nevertheless, the amount of funds made available without the introduction of a mini-budget was remarkable.  I would like to put on record my thanks and appreciation to the Minister and his colleagues in Government for the efforts they made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Joint Committee for the work they did on this report, highlighting some of the problems faced by the farming community during the disastrous year of 1985. Never before have such weather conditions been experienced by the farmers as in 1985.  The prolonged bad weather created many problems for the agricultural sector.  It created problems not alone for people involved in dairying but also for the tillage farmers, the horticultural farmers and, indeed, everybody connected with agriculture.  I only hope, for all our sakes, that we do not have a repetition of that kind of weather again <Col N="547" /> in our time.  It had one useful effect in that it succeeded in uniting all those people, all those agencies interested in the agricultural scene, because they all responded to the call and they all united in their efforts to try to help the farmers who were in trouble because of the disastrous weather conditions.  I should like to thank all those agencies, the farming organisations, the ICOS, the ACOT offices, the Department of Agriculture themselves who were to the forefront and everybody else who in any way helped the farmers over this particularly difficult year.</P>
      <P>We have seen terrible losses all over the country.  The biggest losses were experienced by farmers along the western seaboard.  They have got heavier rainfall in those parts of the country than they did in the midlands or in the east or south. In that part of the country they rely for their winter feed mainly on hay, which as far as I can see because of the weather conditions that we have experienced in 1985 is something that should be discouraged from here on in.  I think the day of the haymaking is gone and farmers along the western seaboard where the hay is still being made should be encouraged to get into silage making because I believe it is the safest way of providing adequate winter feed for stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They should be encouraged by, first of all, providing grants for silage slabs, providing grants for the erection of cheap housing for their cattle.  I understand that this may have been included in the recent grants announced by the Department of Agriculture, although I have not studied those yet and I am not sure whether it does include grants for cheap housing of this kind.  It is something that I have advocated for a long time and I believe it is very necessary because the day is gone when cattle should be allowed to trample on land during the winter months, poaching it and causing all kinds of problems for the farmer when it comes to the springtime again.  I should like to see those grants provided for cheap housing so that farmers could house their <Col N="548" /> cattle during the winter months and take them in off the land.</P>
    <P>As well as the bad weather along the western seaboard, we have seen &mdash; and it is recorded here in the report &mdash; that there have been instances of severe losses of livestock due to lightning while unusually heavy hail on 27 July caused damage to grain and horticultural crops in a narrow corridor extending from County Kilkenny to County Louth.  The high humidity caused some serious blight losses in potato crops mainly in north Leinster, north County Dublin in particular. So the whole country was affected by this unusual type of weather.  It is very unusual, I must say, to see hailstones in the month of July and yet that downfall of hail created havoc in those horticultural crops in County Kilkenny and County Louth.  Those farmers must have seen their livelihoods or their profits for that year wiped out in one hour by that hailstorm. It is a very unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>Many proposals have been made over the years by the various organisations as to how farmers could be helped.  The reintroduction of the group fodder scheme has been mentioned as a means of helping farmers, particularly in the west again, to go into silage making. Community measures were advocated by the farming organisations such as the bringing forward of intervention arrangements for calf carcase beef; the payment of the maximum rates of headage grants to farmers in disadvantaged areas and the bringing forward of payments for the newly designated areas; Euro loans at low interest rates for cereal farmers particularly to help them to reseed, with the Government underwriting exchange rate fluctuations and the banks waiving handling charges; and in the long term effective arterial drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>Those were some of the recommendations made by the various organisations during the year to help the farmers get over their immediate problems.  The one I thought the Government would have acted on without setting up any other additional agencies to help them in was the increase in the headage payments. <Col N="549" /> This was recommended by county committees of agriculture all over the country, by the farming organisations and by everybody else interested in the welfare of the farmers.  At present headage grants of up to £75 per livestock unit are allowable, whereas here in Ireland the cut-off time ranges from £32 down to £28.  If that were increased, it is estimated that it would cost about £34 million, half of which would be borne by FEOGA.</P>
    <P>This would have been a great capital injection into the agri-economy and would, indeed, have downstream benefits.  Unfortunately, for one reason or another it has not been done by the Government and I think they missed an excellent opportunity there of putting additional money into the areas that really needed it by increasing those headage grants.  When you consider the amount of extra money that we would have got from Europe, from the FEOGA section, it is obvious that that money would have been spent very wisely in the areas of the country most in need of it.</P>
    <P>It is hard to accept that the money was not there, that the Government were not prepared to put up the money, when you see a situation in which, as I understand, the amount of money allocated to the Department of Agriculture last year has not been spent.  I do not know if that is correct or not, but I would like some clarification on it because I understand that money that was allocated to the Department has not been spent, and I would be surprised if that is the case, particularly in a year when there was so much demand from the hard-pressed farmers for additional moneys under the various schemes.</P>
    <P>The grants paid to farmers for first time silage making were very useful and I am happy that farmers responded in such great numbers to the scheme, because it shows that in a very bad weather situation farmers realise that silage making is the only way forward.  Seeing that they have got into silage this year in such great numbers, I believe that they will continue. If it were not for that scheme I believe that a lot more cattle would have to be sold off or else they would have to <Col N="550" /> be maintained on very small rations on the farms.  The scheme encouraged farmers at the very back end of the year to close in a few acres extra, to put on the nitrogen and make the silage.  There is hardly a small farm in the west of Ireland on which you do not see a small heap of silage made in some part of the field because of that scheme.  That is very important because if that scheme were not there, they would not have made the silage and, as I said, cattle would have been very hungry for the past couple of months.</P>
    <P>The Shannon scheme, too, is really a short term scheme because the £500 paid per farmer under this scheme is not going to compensate the farmer for the terrible loss that farmers along the Shannon valley have suffered as a result of the flooding of the Shannon.  I think Senator McDonald mentioned this about the drainage of the Shannon and I think it is something that we have to keep plugging at even though some people might laugh at it and say there is no possibility and it is only election propaganda.  It has been used as election propaganda for years and years; nevertheless, politicians and Governments must keep striving towards that end and eventually it is the long term solution for those farmers to drain the Shannon.  I see no reason at all why it could not be done and why it should not be done.  There are acres and acres of good land along the Shannon basin that could be put into far more productive use if farmers were sure that their crops were not going to be washed away overnight because of the flooding of the Shannon basin as has happened this year.</P>
    <P>I believe the long term solution is the drainage of the Shannon and regardless of what criticism is made of politicians, I still believe that we must try to aim towards that objective at some stage.  It is going to cost a lot of money.  It is going to cost a lot of money even to prepare a report on the feasibility of the drainage of the Shannon but we should be working towards that.  I hope that the Government of the day or, indeed, any other Government will not throw in the towel on this project because there is too much <Col N="551" /> at stake here.  When you consider that the Shannon valley is extending back into the Suck valley right back into County Galway, it would be unfortunate if that project were to be written off.  I believe that at some stage some Government will tackle it.  While I say that the £500 grant per farmer that is paid this time is short-term &mdash; and I am sure it it appreciated by the farmers who suffered from the tragic flooding of their lands in 1985 &mdash; it is not the long-term solution and only the drainage of that river is the solution to the whole matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more money put into field drainage, land reclamation and so on.  A lot more could be done in that area.  I consider the western drainage scheme to be a very successful scheme. For the first time, grants of 70 per cent were paid to farmers to drain their land in the western region.  The farmers responded in no uncertain manner because a lot of red tape that normally applies to grant applications was cut out in that scheme.  The farmers responded and very large tracts of land along the western seaboard have been drained under that scheme.  I should like to see an extension of it and a continuation of it.  I hope that the Minister will examine the feasibility of doing that and continue with that very worth while scheme.</P>
    <P>We could go on and on about the different aspects of agriculture, but here we are confined mainly to the report before us and I do not intend to depart from that.  But I hope that in our lifetime at least we never witness the weather conditions we had in 1985.  It is hard to put an estimate on what it has cost Irish agriculture. Some of the farming organisations have put an estimate of something like £50 million or £51 million on it for the losses suffered by Irish agriculture.  It could even be more.  But agriculture is our main industry and the one thing that came out of all this was that all the organisations and all the agencies responded and united in their efforts to help the farmers to get over a very difficult situation. The losses would have been much greater were it not for the response from the Government and, indeed, I wish to <Col N="552" /> acknowledge that here today.  It would be very wrong of me if I did not.  I know that we are going through very difficult times and that money is very hard got, but nevertheless, the response from the Government is appreciated by the farming community.  If it were not for that response, the losses would have been much greater.</P>
    <P>We can learn a lot from the year under review.  We can help to make sure that those kind of losses never occur again and in particular we can work towards providing a situation where farmers will by their own means have adequate fodder to provide for their cattle during the winter months.  That was the scare that abounded last August and September because at that time farmers were getting very worried.  They could see no change in the weather.  In fact, August must have been one of the worst months of the year. There was very little prospect of sufficient foodstuff being provided.  But because of all the schemes introduced the farmers responded and they did provide a nearly adequate supply for their cattle.</P>
    <P>The one scheme in which I was disappointed was the &ldquo;grain for rain&rdquo; scheme. In my area this amounts to about £20 per tonne.  Farmers were allocated two or three tonnes.  They were allowed £20 per tonnes and I believe that that has dropped to £12 per tonnes this week.  That is very bad.  I do not know where the rest of that money has gone.  Has it gone on administration or what?  However that is all it is worth to the farmers at present.  I was very disappointed in that scheme and so were many farmers who qualified for it and who found that they were only being given £20 off the tonne or two tonnes of meal they were allocated.  That has now dropped to £12 per tonne.  I do not know why that is so.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to give us some reason for it.  I do hope that, in our time at least, we will never again witness the weather situation we witnessed during 1985.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the points already made and to make some additional comments.  Firstly, <Col N="553" /> we must not underestimate the severity of what happened in 1985 and in conjunction with that I would stress very strongly that the undercapitalised situation of agriculture had a very major effect in the position of farmers in not being able to cope with this blow.  If farming as it was, and, indeed, as it is, is so severely undercapitalised, it is a major factor as to why persons were so severely hit by the crisis of 1985.  In my view farming organisations and others failed to lay the sort of emphasis on that aspect it deserves.</P>
      <P>The question of the lack of capital and lack of finance in farming, coupled with rapidly reducing margins, has led to a situation where people are just about holding on in the farming sector.  That is very serious.  It leaves no room for manoeuvre. It leaves no room whatever for any calamity such as the one that took place in 1985 and this is something which we must not overlook or, indeed, underestimate. We have no guarantee whatsoever that we might not have a repetition weatherwise of what happened in 1985.  That is something we must be very mindful of. If people who have come through 1985 and the winter of 1985-86 were to be confronted with any kind of similar situation in 1986 it would put them in a very difficult financial position.  It is only at this stage that the effects of that disastrous season have manifested themselves.  In many instances fodder, which was regarded as being of reasonable quality, will be totally and utterly inadequate in its nutritional content and incapable of sustaining animals during the current winter, which fortunately up to Christmas was mild.  From Christmas onwards we have had a severe winter period.  I hope we do not have a recurrence of the situation to which I referred earlier.  It behoves us all to make sure that farming is given the support necessary to withstand a calamity that could at any stage befall it.  That is one point that must not be overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985 almost every front in the farming sector was very severely hit.  From mid-1985 onwards we saw a situation in which the part of the hay crop the farmers <Col N="554" /> attempted to conserve was being destroyed day by day and we saw it worsening and deteriorating in value and in nutritional content.  We have at present a very unhappy inbalance between grass conserved for hay and for silage.  We have approximately 60 per cent of total grass for conservation made into silage and about 40 per cent into hay; this is very inappropriate.  We must strive to have a higher proportion of grass conserved in silage.  The recent introduction of the farm modernisation scheme lays a lot of emphasis on the whole area of cattle housing, and wintering of cattle generally is a great step in that direction.  It helps to bring about a situation where we will have more silage and more of our cattle in-wintered rather than at present when we have 50 per cent of the total livestock herd still out-wintered.  This is a situation we must endeavour through all means at our disposal to get away from.</P>
    <P>In addition to our hay and silage problems farmers who had not made silage early found themselves in a situation that they could not travel the silage fields and could not make silage.  In many cases silage was made under very bad conditions, conditions in which the level of moisture or water was so high that good silage was not made even earlier in the year.  In desperation farmers tried to save hay in September or later for winter feed and also endeavoured to make silage as best they could.  The Government's intervention in this whole area was very helpful, but it could not meet or cover the losses that people had sustained.  It is important to recall that during a time when finance was in such scarce supply our Government found it possible to contribute in excess of £22 million to the rescue package for farmers and succeeded in getting an additional £4½ million from Europe, a total of £27 million assistance for 1985.</P>
    <P>The rescue package alleviated problems but left a number remaining.  The picture looked very gloomy in August. We had a situation in which many farmers, due to the waterlogged condition of their land, were forced on to the market with their livestock, forced to <Col N="555" /> take very low prices.  Many small farmers from the west were affected where they could least afford this major loss.  There were many cases in which farmers had eight or ten livestock units for sale, which they would have for sale on an annual basis in the late autumn or early winter. These were sold in August at very reduced prices.  Farmers lost at least between £100 and £150 per livestock unit. On the basis of ten livestock units one is talking about a substantial amount of the income of many farmers throughout the country and more especially in the north-western area.  That is a point that should not go unnoticed.</P>
    <P>The bad weather was an act of God; there is nothing anyone could have done about it apart from the remedies the Government put into motion to try to lessen the severity of the blow that farmers were suffering.  However, there are some measures the Government could take on board for the future and usefully pursue.  One is arterial drainage as distinct from field drainage.  Reference was made to the drainage of the Shannon. Many major rivers backed up and caused extensive flooding and waterlogging in 1985, which was the reason why farmers had to take their stock off the land.  This stock was then sold at the marts at giveaway prices or put into yards and fed winterfeed that they would normally be starting to consume around November-December depending on the climatic conditions of a normal year.  That position could have been alleviated if we had a better arterial drainage programme carried out in previous years.</P>
    <P>I would exhort the Government to pursue arterial drainage to the fullest extent.  There are rivers that would yield enormous benefits to the economy if they were drained at this stage.  One example that comes to mind in the Limerick-Tipperary region is the Mulcaire River, which has been talked about a number of times.  There are thousands of very fertile acres there which were waterlogged and unusable last summer and autumn or, if they were used, they were being used to the detriment of the future use of the <Col N="556" /> land.  That is just one example.  There are other areas which require attention also.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that, in the report which we are examining today, the position was indeed clearly and positively identified by the committee.  On an ongoing basis the committee did very good work.  There were several meetings which culminated in this report.  At the meeting on 3 September the following resolution was passed by the committee, and I quote from report No. 21 of the Joint Committee on The Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which gives a summary of the entire situation:</P>
    <P>That the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities recognises the special position of all landowners in the Shannon Valley and calls on the European Community to provide financial assistance from the Community Disaster Fund as a matter of extreme urgency; urges that the Shannon Valley in its entirety be regarded as completely disadvantaged; requests the Government to take steps to ensure that no farmer will have to dispose of his livestock under value; requests that the grave emergency in the area be fully recognised; requests that farmers throughout the country who are in difficulties with regard to Winter fodder be given an immediate subsidy to help them overcome their difficulties; and requests that the price being paid for the barley crop be subsidised to bring it up to a realistic level and to offset the increased costs, associated with reducing its moisture content.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Joint Committee stated in this report that a subcommittee on agriculture and fisheries would prepare a draft report on the Community measures that could be invoked to alleviate the serious position of Irish farmers brought about by the bad weather and storms over the summer months.  It was decided that a delegation of the sub-committee would visit the European Commission for discussions in connection with the preparation of the draft report.  A delegation did meet with the European Commission <Col N="557" /> and reported back to the committee in due course.</P>
    <P>On that resolution, it shows quite clearly the consciousness and awareness of the Joint Committee at that time of the severity of the problem.  The committee also had discussions with and written submissions from the Irish Farmers' Association, the ICMSA, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society and ACOT.  All these various agencies coincided in their views with regard to the severity of the problem.  There may have been a slighly different level of emphasis as to how the problem could be overcome, but everybody clearly saw that there was a major problem.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee sent a delegation to Brussels.  There was strong emphasis laid by the representatives of the Joint Committee in Brussels on the need for assistance.  The disaster fund which exists within the Community is for personal disaster purposes and there was no way that we were going to get any sort of alleviation or help of significance from that fund.  It could be argued that a certain amount of our problems came under those headings but in all, in that fund there was only £2 million and so it did not meet the situation with which we were confronted.</P>
    <P>On page 14 of their report the Joint Committee have clearly referred to this question of lack of cash within farming. A number of suggestions were put forward by the Joint Committee as means by which a solution could be found, such as the bringing forward of the intervention date of payment to early September rather than the end of September, and also that it should apply to a wider section of the cattle input into factories.  Regrettably, we did not have the sort of success that was hoped for by the Joint Committee. We had a pretty restricted period of intervention operation.  It is important that we bear in mind that to all intents and purposes, intervention is now being wound down to such a degree that it is of little or no relevance in an Irish context. This is extremely serious.  Intervention buying of beef is a necessary fundamental <Col N="558" /> ingredient for an effective marketing of our beef supply.</P>
    <P>We have aid for private storage and we have MCAs and so on for exports to third countries.  I believe that intervention in itself will now apply only in very limited cases during 1986 and for the next two years, and my understanding of it is that it will not continue from there on.  That is a matter that has to be viewed very, very seriously.  I stated in this House before, and I will restate now, that as an island on the periphery of the mainland of Europe, locationally disadvantaged in many respects &mdash; disadvantaged in the sense that our economy has not been developed to the extent that the Dutch, United Kingdom, German, French and other such economies have been developed over a long number of years, we are entitled to get special measures to meet our particular needs.  I do not believe that in the context of an overall EC policy we are going to survive within the EC.  We are at a moment when a whole revision of CAP is about to be made.  I state very emphatically that we must get very special measures to meet our case.</P>
    <P>While it is historical in one sense but yet very much related to the question of intervention mentioned in this report, we joined the EC in 1972 in the clear expectancy that we would have unlimited potential to develop our agriculture.  We also knew that our industries would be in very serious difficulty with regard to competition from various quarters.  We accepted the EC with its good points and its bad points, its good points being the capacity that it offered to us to develop agriculture and its bad points being the competitive aspects with regard to industry with which we knew we would have trouble. However 12 years later we clearly got the message in the context of the super-levy that the freedom we anticipated to expand in the agricultural sector no longer existed.  While very special concessions were granted to us on that occasion, we have seen since time restrictions envisaged in the beef sector, the cereal sector, indeed right across the board. This is extremely serious but I shall say no more now only that we must press on <Col N="559" /> to ensure that we get special measures as a nation.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee put forward a very good report.  It covered the very salient points that exist as a result of 1985.  This report was written in September 1985. We have dealt with the period up to that and since then.  As I said earlier, I believe that it is the consequential effects of 1985 that are relevant, not just 1985 <i>per se.</i> During the whole of 1985 we had a drop of income in the farming world of 10 per cent.  Approximately 4 per cent of that drop was directly related to the weather. That clearly indicates the severity of the weather in 1985 from our point of view.</P>
    <P>A lot of good work was done by many agencies during 1985 right up to the end of the year to ensure that the blow was lessened.  We had many of the co-operative societies arranging for the transportation of straw, as a replacement for hay, from the eastern seaboard to the western seaboard.  We had much good effort put into solving an extremely difficult problem.  I believe that the Government &mdash; and I have already referred to the magnificent contribution made by the Government in 1985 towards bringing about a solution here &mdash; acted very constructively and effectively in reducing greatly what would have been a disaster situation for many people.  This could not be over-stated or over-emphasised.  Were it not for Government intervention we would have had a major de-stocking on farms, and many farms would have been denuded of stock completely.  Unfortunately, the rebuilding of the herds in those instances would have been unlikely.</P>
    <P>A number of points with which the Government were presented could, I believe be looked at again.  I am talking in particular about low interest Euro loans.  As I mentioned at the beginning, we are talking about an industry severely and seriously starved of capital.  The Government in its wisdom thus far have not found it appropriate to continue the low interest Euro loans that have operated in recent times.  Granted there are extremely good reasons why the <Col N="560" /> Government have temporarily, I hope, left aside such arrangements, awaiting the realignment of the European currencies. I would urge that when that situation has stabilised and settled down there will be the possibility of introducing cheaper money for agriculture.  Quite honestly, agriculture, because of the nature of its operations cannot sustain the interest rates that apply to it.  The turnover in agriculture is a very long-drawn-out process, whether it is livestock farming or whatever else &mdash; livestock farming being the predominant concern of farming in this country.  You are talking about a four- or five-year cycle.  For that reason there is no hope that without cheap money the industry can progress as we would like.</P>
    <P>The extension of the 30 day test to 60 days during this crisis period is to be lauded.  The Government acted very intelligently in this regard.  It was regrettable however, that due to Brussels restrictions &mdash; and I want to make it very clear that it was because of Brussels restrictions &mdash; the 60 days did not apply to cows and heifers and female animals generally in the bovine world.  One would hope that in the future, we would have this 30 day test extended to 60 days on a permanent basis, not just until some date in the future and they revert back again. If the whole country is declared brucellosis free we would have no problem of course but in the event of that not being so, I hope we would be able to negotiate with the EC authorities to bring in line 60 day tests for all cattle tested, because the difficulties for farmers as far as the female stock are concerned are far greater than that for testing of steers in so far as that there is a blood test involved. Instead of the 30 day test that is talked about one is effectively talking about 20 days because it is ten days before results are returned to the farmer.  I believe that that measure introduced right in the middle of this crisis period should be continued on the 60 day basis and should be extended to include all livestock.</P>
    <P>The in-wintering or out-wintering of cattle which I referred to a few moments ago has to be tackled very seriously <Col N="561" /> because over the last few months people are seeing now as never before &mdash; perhaps because of the quality of fodder saved in 1985 &mdash; that cattle cannot be effectively out-wintered.  They are being damaged in so far as they are not thriving; they are damaging land and there are many very serious side effects of that policy.</P>
    <P>One could go on and on and I do not intend to do that; there are others who want to speak on this report.  All I want to say finally on it is that the Joint Committee is to be commended for such a comprehensive report.  They have identified the various problems quite clearly and quite well.  It brings to our notice the importance of our homing-in on this situation to ensure that if such a disastrous year were to come again we would be in a better position to counteract it.  I know of many instances during the current winter where farmers in relatively small operations, farmers of 40 or 50 acres, found that their feed bill for maintaining their stock over the winter was £5,000 higher than it was last year. That, coupled with a very severely reducing income position is something that could not be sustained if such a disaster were to occur again.</P>
    <P>Again I want to commend the Government and in particular the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, and the two Ministers of State, Deputy Hegarty, whom we are glad to have with us this evening, and Deputy Connaughton, for their absolutely magnificent input into this.  Deputy Hegarty and Deputy Connaughton together with the Minister, Deputy Deasy formed a very formidable team in securing assistance and relief for people.  I do know that the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, visited quite a lot of the areas of the country which suffered grain and general crop damage.</P>
    <P>I inadvertently omitted to mention a major point in regard to tillage crops &mdash; the losses were enormous.  We have had abnormally low yields of barley, wheat, oilseed rape and potatoes.  Then there was the very unusual hailstorm on 27 July which extended from County Kilkenny to County Louth and caused major losses.  The Minister of State visited a <Col N="562" /> number of areas and saw at firsthand the severity of the damage.  This is the type of thing which led us to a position where the Government eventually gave such a massive injection of support.  The one disappointing feature was the contribution we got from the EC.  It was low in comparison with what the Government put into the scheme.  In terms of the total proportion, what we received from the EC should have been several million pounds more.</P>
    <P>I commend the committee on an excellent report.  I also commend the Government for excellent handling of a severely difficult situation.  I appeal in the strongest possible terms for agriculture to be given the sort of injection of capital it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that we are debating this report in the middle of February whereas the report was presented to the House on 25 September last.  I do not blame the Minister or the Chair.  It would be much better if reports of an urgent nature were taken within a given period of, say, 21 or 28 days from the time they are produced by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be paying for many years for what happened in 1985 as far as the agricultural sector is concerned.  Already we are seeing the effects of it in 1986.  It now appears that there will be a shortage of supplies of cattle for slaughter.  There is already a short supply of lamb.  At present many of the meat processing plants, especially those involved in sheep, are either closed or working short time.  That is the effect of the premature slaughtering which took place in both sectors in the latter half of 1985.  Many of the cattle which were slaughtered between September and December 1985 would not normally have been slaughtered until the summer of this year.  Not alone were they slaughtered prematurely, but they were also slaughtered with a great financial loss to the farmers who had produced them. They were not in a position to keep them over the winter months or to buy feed to maintain them.  The schemes we had to deal with the crisis were not adequate and did not give sufficient compensation <Col N="563" /> to the farmers who were affected.  The maximum benefit was not got from the finances made available by the Department.</P>
    <P>I note that the chief recommendation of the committee, for the disadvantaged areas, was that the headage payments should have been increased and that the maximum level should have been paid in 1985.  The Minister felt that was inappropriate. He introduced his own schemes&mdash; the fodder scheme, the fertiliser subsidy and the Shannon flooding scheme.  Prior to Christmas, I had reason to raise on the Adjournment the problems caused by the feed voucher scheme which was adopted to meet the crises.  It is still causing those same problems.  The vouchers have now been issued.  Many farmers are discovering that what they thought would have been quite sizeable amounts are turning out to be rather small.</P>
    <P>There is also no appeal system available to any farmer who has been excluded for any reason.  I have received a large number of representations from farmers whe were told they were disqualified because they had 75 per cent of their feed.  It has now turned out that the feed they thought they had prior to the opening of their silage is as low as 20 per cent in many cases.  The feed value of those silage clamps is very low.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ask the Minister to try to introduce some sort of mechanism to allow those farmers to have their cases reassessed.  Many farmers who may have made mistakes when filling in the forms are now being excluded, while some of those who may have been a little more crafty in the filling in of forms may have got more than their share as far as the feed voucher scheme was concerned. The original idea of paying extra headage would have meant that nobody would have been able to abuse the system and everybody would have received a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>We should see what type of grant aid scheme can be introduced for winter fodder in the future by means of State aids and the use of EC aids to prevent <Col N="564" /> people being at the mercy of the elements, especially in the west.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the possibility of bringing in increased grants for farmers who are purchasing silage equipment and also silage feeding facilities in the west.  Many small farmers in the west will not be in a position to provide them from their own resources.  If a sizeable grant were made available, they would set about trying to alleviate the problems. This money would be well spent.  It would increase the viability of some of those small holdings in the west.  It would give many farmers the opportunity to get one or two extra livestock units which they are not in a position to do now with the facilities they have available to them. While that might not seem much of an increase spread across the small farming community it would make a considerable impact.</P>
    <P>The committee also considered the intervention beef buying section as far as the EC method of safeguarding the situation is concerned.  There should be an examination of the way this is now operated.  At the moment hindquarters are being allowed into intervention.  For three weeks at the end of the year full beef carcases were allowed into intervention. Then there was a glut.  Many of the factories were in a position to use the intervention system whereas those who had sold their product were handicapped in that they had to fulfil their contracts while some of the sunshine operators were able to take full advantage of intervention during that period.  Any further intervention schemes should be operated on a percentage of kill rather than on a full kill allowed into intervention.</P>
    <P>There were also suggestions with regard to low interest Euro loans.  In recent weeks the Minister announced that he is providing cash from that source for the grain farmers who were badly hit in 1985.  Agriculture in general must now be given an injection of those same Euro loans which would be guaranteed with regard to the rate of interest and the exchange rate.  If farmers do not get working capital at a realistic price, they <Col N="565" /> will not be in a position to stay in business. The recent hike in bank interest rates will be felt by the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>The lesson of 1985 should be that farming can no longer depend upon the weather to be its saviour.  We must devise a system whereby winter feed can be provided cheaply and also ensure that feed will not be dependent on the weather. We must examine the possibility of providing schemes which are more beneficial to those affected by a disaster.  I still believe that, as far as the 1985 crisis was concerned, the best way to help farmers in the disadvantaged areas would have been by means of headage payments. We are told that the Government spent between £14 million and £18 million on subsidies and on help to alleviate the problems caused by the bad weather. That amount would have been sufficient if it had been put in by means of a direct cash injection.  The disadvantaged areas were most affected and we already had a scheme which was readymade, which would not have entailed any extra cost in processing and would not have caused the problems created by the feed voucher scheme as it operated.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to ask his Minister to please form some type of tribunal or some type of appeal system to which those farmers who now find they are debarred from the feed voucher scheme, despite the fact that they should have been entitled to participate in it, could apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other speakers in paying a sincere compliment to the team involved, the Minister for Agriculture and his two very able and experienced Ministers of State, on the manner in which they addressed themselves to the fodder crisis.  It was obvious from mid-June that we were facing a crisis.  By early July there was criticism that the Minister was not doing anything about it.  People seemed to be attributing to him the powers of a deity to control the elements.  In fairness to the Minister for Agriculture, together with his Ministers of State, he was monitoring <Col N="566" /> and gauging and metering the problem on an on-going basis.  I do not know what holidays any Minister or Ministers of State had, but certainly the three people vested with the power and the responsibility to look after agriculture could not have had very much spare time in the summer holiday period.  They were on the ball on a daily basis at all stages trying to monitor and deal with the up-to-date situation.</P>
      <P>While the situation was bad in June, it was worse in July and nobody could have anticipated the absolute deluge which occurred after August 14, when things really took a turn for the worst.  Ten good days at that time would have helped to redress the situation.  The Minister and Ministers of State are due our compliments and our congratulations as, indeed are the members of the committee for the manner in which they have drawn up the report.  I share Senator Ellis's reservation that we should have debated this report at that time.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, at that time we discussed the crisis in this House.</P>
      <P>There is always a higher rainfall in the west than in the rest of the country.  Certainly that was shown on this occasion, particularly in the seaboard counties of Galway, Mayo and Donegal.  As has been pointed out in the report, the very high dependence of the west on hay for fodder left us even more vulnerable than the rest of the country.  When you couple with that the lightning, the hail and all the other freak climatic elements to which we were subjected, they set in stark perspective the problems with which the farmers in the west were confronted.  The hay we eventually got in the west was of extremely poor quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share with Senator Ellis also his reservation in relation to the quality of the silage.  As people uncover silage they are discovering to their dismay that the quality, the nutrient and the food value leave much to be desired.  At this stage it is a <i>fait accompli.</i>  The book has been closed and they are not in a position to appeal for further aid at this time.  I support Senator Ellis's advocacy of the introduction of some form of appeal for <Col N="567" /> those people who either (a) did not fill up the forms properly or (b) discovered subsequently that the silage that seemed to be there in bulk was not there in terms of quality.</P>
    <P>In the west we did benefit from a number of the short term remedial actions taken by the Minister and his Ministers of State.  We welcomed the introduction of the acceptance of mart receipts as bona fide evidence that the cattle were eligible for headage payment purposes.  The Minister was very well intentioned when he introduced the nitrogen subsidy in August.  Unfortunately, because of the wet weather it was of little benefit.  Again while some people have made derisory comments about the £500 for the farmers in the Shannon basin, in fairness it was the maximum that could be afforded at the time. Nobody can say the Minister did not have up-to-date knowledge of the situation there as he visited the area on several occasions to monitor the problem on land and in the air.  The speeding up of the headage payments and the extension of the pre-movement test period were developments which, although individually small, contributed in their own way to alleviating the hardship being experienced by farmers, particularly by western farmers.  While people have made derisory comments about the rescue package and people have gone out of their way to try to prove that the headage payments system would have been fairer, I do not think it would have been fairer in that it would have applied right across the board and irrespective of the fact that the majority of farmers were affected we do know, each and everyone of us, farmers did succeed in cutting hay in that first and only fine week in July and got good quality hay at that.</P>
    <P>I would refer to a remark made by the Minister in this House and made to the Irish Farmers Association and the ICMSA and in the Dáil that we are not in the business of compensating people. Senator Ellis talked about compensation. The Minister was at pains to point out that all we could do here was offer relief <Col N="568" /> to people, that it was a holding operation to help people to keep their heads above water.  The number of people who have benefited has been quite considerable. There have been some people, no doubt, who have been disappointed because they did not fill in the form correctly or, as Senator Ellis said, maybe filled the form too correctly or too conscientiously. We all know this can happen in certain cases when you are trying to rush through a scheme.  You are trying to have random samples here and there in order to try to gauge the cross-sectional representative view of what is actually happening in the locality.  By and large the majority of people are relatively happy with what occurred.  It has managed, in fact, to get people over the hump.  It has been largely well received by individual farmers but some farming organisations and leaders, no matter what is introduced seem to take a delight in the crude bludgeoning of the Minister.  One farming organisation stands out in this respect.  I really believe that such people, by constantly hammering the Minister and the Minister of State and every initiative and innovation that is introduced, in the long term do more damage than good to the cause of the farmers.</P>
    <P>I would, however, take issue on one point.  It is a point that western representatives of all parties make continually. That is the failure of bureaucrats at European and at national levels to take into consideration the position of part time farmers in the west of Ireland.  These people are part and parcel of the social fabric.  If you took them out you could close, in many towns, one bank.  You could close down one church.  You could close down many of the schools in rural areas.  I honestly believe that the time is long overdue to recognise this from the point of view of headage payments and to be offering them an off-farm income limit of £6,400 is simply not on.  For the number who are over the £10,000 bracket I honestly do not think it is worth having an off-farm income limit at all with regard to headage.</P>
    <P>The same thing happened on this occasion with regard to the feed voucher <Col N="569" /> scheme.  The same thing is now happening with regard to the establishment grants.  Somebody, some day, not too far down the line, will have to come up with a plan specifically geared to enable part time farmers who are so much part and parcel, by necessity, of the economic life of rural Ireland to play a full role and to be recognised for what they are &mdash; valuable contributors to the economy not alone of the west of Ireland but to the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Again, I made the point here before in relation to the case made to Brussels for special recognition for regarding the status of the west of Ireland.  The Cantal region has been instanced as a region that has got enormous benefit because of reclassification.  While they have it on altitude grounds we have more than compensating debilitating grounds in terms of high rainfall, low permeability of soils, low number of sunshine hours, high winds etc.  I urge the Minister to put his muscle again behind the document that already lies gathering dust in Brussels making a compelling case for the west to be regarded or upgraded to that of mountain status.</P>
    <P>Again I want to thank the Minister and the Minister of State for the manner in which they have acquitted themselves in this regard.  I think they have kept the heads of the farmers literally above water and in doing so will have the gratitude of the people involved.  Again I want to pay my compliments to the committee for bringing the document before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am raising this matter on the Adjournment is that the North-Western Health Board have for quite a considerable time proposed the provision of a rheumatology department with rehabilitation facilities at Our Lady's Hospital in Manorhamilton, County Leitrim.  This was decided by the health board following the transfer of the orthopaedic theatre facilities from Manorhamilton to Sligo some three or four years ago.  The health board felt that there was a grave need for the provision in the area of a rheumatology service with rehabilitation facilities to back it up.  They then proposed and the Department agreed, the provision of same at Our Lady's Hospital in Manorhamilton.  They had provided in their estimates for 1983, 1984 and 1985 for an amount of money from the Social Fund moneys being made available to them to be put aside to be used as capital for this project.  In 1985 they were instructed by the Minister for Health to cut a proportion of that which had been left aside and to take it into their budget for that year.  This continued again this year because the health board, I am told, are approximately £3½ million short in their allocation from the Department.  The net result is that without the provision of a special grant from the Department of Health they will not be in a position to continue the development of this facility at Manorhamilton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an undisputed need for the provision of this facility.  There are no similar facilities in this country outside of Dublin. We all know the pressures that are on the facilities that exist here in Dublin.  Indeed, the North-Western Health Board area has the highest incidence of arthritis in the country per head of population.  I believe the Arthritis Foundation have even recognised that, <Col N="571" /> because they have proposed to make a grant of £43,000 available to the health board for the provision of this facility.  I would like the Minister of State here this evening to ask the Department to provide the necessary capital for the immediate development of this facility at Our Lady's Hospital, Manorhamilton.  I believe from my inquiries that the provision of the facility will not involve further expense on the Department or on the health board with regard to running the facility.  The staff are already there but the facilities are not those that are necessary for the provision of proper service as far as the rheumatology and rehabilitation is concerned in that area.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister of State would understand the need for this type of development.  We see that many of our hospitals, such as that in Manorhamilton, which are modern hospitals having been built in the fifties, are in a position to provide the bed accommodation necessary for the service.  With the development of this proposed service it would be a safeguard to the employment which is created by the hospital facilities in that very small community.  The distance of the north-west from Dublin would make it very attractive to patients from that area and to their families who would be in a much better position to visit them if the full facilities were provided in Manorhamilton. I also feel that this is a project which not alone would serve the counties in the North-Western Health Board area but would also be in a position to serve Fermanagh and Tyrone, as well as Cavan, which are all quite close to Manorhamilton.</P>
    <P>I would like to appeal again to the Minister of State to provide for the North-Western Health Board the necessary finance for the extension proposed to Our Lady's Hospital in Manorhamilton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Manorhamilton hospital was formerly the county hospital for Leitrim and provided a service in the specialties of general medicine, general surgery, maternity and gynaecology.  A <Col N="572" /> temporary orthopaedic unit was established at the hospital in 1978 pending the provision of a unit in Sligo.  Subsequently all the consultant-staffed services in Manorhamilton were transferred to Sligo.  The orthopaedic unit in Sligo opened in August 1981 and this enabled the North-Western Health Board to vacate the temporary 28-bed orthopaedic unit in Manorhamilton.  At this stage the health board approached the Department with a proposal to establish a regional rehabilitation unit in Manorhamilton based on this 28-bed unit.  This regional unit was intended to provide a service in rheumatology and rehabilitation for the entire North-Western Health Board area.  Comhairle na nOspidéal approved the appointment of a consultant in rheumatology-rehabilitation for the unit in 1981 and approval in principle to establish the unit was issued by the Department in January 1982 and final approval to recruit the consultant issued in November 1982.  The consultant took up duty on 1 July 1983 and the unit treats the following range of conditions: arthritic; post-operative; post-stroke; post-accident and sport injuries.</P>
      <P>When the unit was being established it was indicated by the board that the present range of facilities available at Manorhamilton was adequate to initiate the rehabilitation service.  It was, however, envisaged that, as the service developed, extended facilities would be required but these could be provided on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>In November 1983 the health board proposed to my Department that funds which were at their disposal might be used for, among other things, improving the rehabilitation service at Manorhamilton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was proposed to provide custom-built accommodation and facilities to support the consultant-staffed rehabilitation services.  These included facilities for hydrotherapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, out-patients, day and community services.  Special emphasis was to be placed on the social and vocational aspects of the service and it was <Col N="573" /> indicated that the total capital cost involved was about £400,000.  This proposed use of funds was approved by my Department in November 1983.</P>
    <P>In August 1985 the health board informed my Department that: (1) the funds at their disposal were no longer available; (2) the cost of the project was now estimated at £700,000 (3) tenders had been received for the project and (4) a grant of £700,000 was now required to enable the project to go ahead.</P>
    <P>The normal procedure in cases where my Department are being asked to provide funds for capital schemes is that the various proposals and drawings have to be submitted regularly to my Department so that they can be checked and evaluated at each stage of the planning process. This was not done in the case of the scheme at Manorhamilton and the board have now been asked to submit their detailed plans and the tender documentation so that the scheme can be assessed in detail.</P>
    <P>No provision has been made in the capital programme for my Department for this scheme and in view of the current extreme limitations on capital funds it is highly unlikely that I will be in a position to provide funds for this project in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> The fact is that I was asked for funds for this scheme only late last year and many other desirable projects have been in the queue for much longer than that and, in all fairness, they will have to be considered before the scheme in Manorhamilton.</P>
    <P>I would like to say also that my Department have a well-defined procedure for the planning of projects of this nature which, in this instance, was not adhered to.  This procedure is laid down so that projects can be planned correctly, can be programmed to fit the capital allocation and to ensure that each project fits into the national order of priorities.</P>
    <P>As I say, the correct procedure was not followed in this case and, until the technical staff in my Department vet the plans and the documentation, I cannot even say if the planning done to date is acceptable.  Even if it is, I am not regrettably, in a position to say when funds can be made available for the project.</P>
