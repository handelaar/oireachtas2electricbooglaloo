      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in that order.  It is proposed to suspend the sitting of the House for lunch from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  It is proposed that if no new business is started after 3 o'clock that we should proceed to the Adjournment which would normally be at 4 o'clock.  If these motions are continuing at the time, we will continue up to 4 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not objecting to the Order of Business.  I discussed it with Senator Ferris last night.  He came to me to say that there was a change in the Order of Business and I had not much choice but to agree.</P>
      <P>I want to protest, not about any Member of this House, but about the attitude of Ministers.  For instance, the Order of Business for the week is decided on the previous Thursday evening and I get that from the Leader of the House. On several occasions we have been told at the last minute that a Minister cannot come in.  Item No. 7 on the Order Paper was supposed to be the first item on the agenda today.  Item No. 7 is a very important matter so far as agriculture is concerned and we were told last night the Minister would not be available.  I do not think that is good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It puts me in a very awkward position today.  At 10 o'clock last night I had to <Col N="1574" /> start running around to try to find someone who would handle item No. 1 today. Since none of the Fianna Fáil Senators expected it would be taken first this morning they were not prepared for it.  As I said, I had to agree to the Order of Business because if I had not we probably would not have had any business at all for today and we might have been finished in a short time.  I should like if the leader on the Government side of the House would convey the message to Ministers, that when they agree to come here to speak that they should come that day and not upset us.  It is most unfair.</P>
    <P>So far as Item No. 1, is concerned, it is not always the practice for the Minister to speak first on a motion but I should like if the Minister would speak first on this motion today in order to give our people an opportunity of finding out what it is all about.  Senator Ferris mentioned the Minister is taken up in the other House with the Order of Business or something like that.  I can understand that and I am quite prepared to wait for the Minister to come in to lead off on item No. 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally support what Senator Ryan said, that item No. 7 should have been item No. 1 on the Order Paper today because of its importance.  I want to ask the Leader of the House if Item No. 3 is to be completed today or will it be taken again next week?  I asked Senator Dooge about this some time ago as it was moved down the Order Paper.  It has certain important implications for the Irish insurance industry.  Now, without warning, it has gone up to No. 3 today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the points made by Senator Ryan and Senator Honan.  With regard to the proposition that the Minister should speak first in relation to this, I imagine there are people who will be contributing to the debate on this item and that might result in an unsatisfactory state of affairs.  Certainly so far I am concerned, I have queries to raise in relation to this report. I have queries to raise in relation to how it is being handled, how the conclusions <Col N="1575" /> which have been arrived at by the committee are going to be dealt with and a number of other aspects.  Unless there is an opportunity to raise these questions before the Minister speaks, what mechanism is there to get a response from the Minister and the Government in relation to the queries some of us will be raising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the comments of Senator Ryan, I have to agree with everything he said.  I think he will agree though that the Leader, whether it is myself or Senator Dooge, has always tried to facilitate everybody, whether it is a Minister or indeed the Opposition in the House.  We try to do so by discussion, agreement and consultation.  In this case, I was faced with a dilemma which was outside the Minister's control in that something urgent came up.  I requested the permission of Senator Ryan to order the business to suit the Minister.  If the Minister had a choice he would have been here to take the item on the milk cessation scheme.  Representations were also made to me by other Members of the House that they had urgent matters to attend to this morning and they would like to be here for the debate.  It suited them.  I thought that, in all the circumstances, we had reached a compromise. When this happens it creates problems for me because I have to find the next Minister available.  On this occasion it is the Tánaiste who already had a commitment for the Order of Business in the other House.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Honan's comments, Item No. 3 is not ordered without warning.  I suggested to Senator Ryan that we should put it in, in case the business allocated for today's sitting was completed before the appointed time.  It is safer to have a third report ordered in this way.  We may not reach it and I would like to assure Senators that we are most unlikely to complete it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Minister speaking first &mdash; and this point was referred to by Senator Howard also &mdash; the Minister cannot speak first.  The motion has to be moved, so I will be speaking on it first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> It is then a matter for the House but a Minister can intervene in a debate at any time in the House.  That is a Standing Order.  It is normal procedure.  If Members have a problem and want to make a comment on it, this is a report from an Oireachtas joint committee and I am sure the House wants to facilitate all the members of that committee or any other Members who wish to speak.  It is appropriate also that the Minister should give his considered response to the debate on the report, which I am sure he will do.  Facilities will be available at the end of the debate for people to have questions clarified and a response can be given if the House so orders.  That is the normal formula to be followed on any motion taking note of a report.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the motion is moved normally the Minister speaks.  He also has the right to conclude, so I think that will meet Senator Howard's point and everybody else's point.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Third Report of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies &mdash; Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity for this House to consider this excellent report from the committee chaired by my colleague, Deputy Frank Prendergast.  There is a summary of its recommendations on pages 1, 2 and 3.  I commend the members of the joint committee who have dealt with this very important commodity &mdash; natural gas.  The Minister has drawn up the formula in which natural gas will be dealt with in the formulation of Bord Gáis Éireann, that is, a statutory corporation established under the Gas Act, 1976.  It functions as the State's gas transmission company.  It is now becoming <Col N="1577" /> increasingly involved in the distribution of one of our natural resources.  Transmission means moving gas from large diameter pipes at high pressure and distribution means moving gas through smaller pipes at a much lower pressure to supply customers.  Many people have been serviced by this procedure, including natural industries operating between Dublin and Cork.  I am delighted the Tánaiste confirmed recently the extension of natural gas into my own town of Clonmel after lengthy discussions with the corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>No seat, Senator, no seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot pinch the Senator's seat.  It is an important development for an inland constituency like south Tipperary, I am delighted that the public ownership concept between the corporation and Bord Gáis Éireann has been protected.  The same formula has been found for Kilkenny and Limerick city. The Tánaiste is to be commended for his handling of this important commodity. There has been controversy about Dublin gas.  I always smile with amazement when I hear talk about Dublin gas, because it is Cork gas in Dublin.  The Minister dealt adequately with the controversy which has arisen in another place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Clonmel, where we have the formula worked out, Bord Gáis Éireann will have 80 per cent of the shares and the corporation &mdash; the elected authority &mdash; will have 20 per cent.  We hope and expect that this will be a successful undertaking. While the market in Clonmel at present is not large, there is great scope for increasing it because Clonmel and the surrounding district benefited from industrial development.  It is one of the fortunate areas which has not suffered the spectre of unemployment to the same extent as other areas.  I am sure there are industries there which will convert to natural gas.  A major industry in Ardfinnan has already converted to natural gas.  Last year they saved £1 million in fuel costs by adapting to natural gas.  It is a most efficient and versatile fuel and will be of tremendous benefit to the town of <Col N="1578" /> Clonmel and its surrounding district.  I compliment the corporation on their foresight in installing a whole new network of pipelines.  The fact that they had gone down that road, and made decisions in the earlier part of the eighties made the Tánaiste's job a little easier.  It probably put more pressure on him to make a decision but it made the eventual decision easier because the infrastructure was already there.</P>
    <P>Similarly, earlier this year the Government agreed to the supply of natural gas to Kilkenny.  I am sure my colleague, Senator Lanigan, the leader of the Opposition, welcomes that because he had always advocated the extension of the natural gas line to his own city.  In that case Bord Gáis Éireann will be the full owners of the distribution sector.  Work on this project is proceeding apace and like Clonmel, the people of Kilkenny will have natural gas next year.</P>
    <P>There are other recommendations in this report to which the Tánaiste might refer.  Like the chairman, the secretariat and members I was concerned about the attendance of members of the Department to give evidence before the Oireachtas joint committee.  It is important for all of us to defend public representatives who sit on Oireachtas joint committees.  It is important that the guidelines set down for sending for people to give evidence and information, should be protected.  The Tánaiste might refer to pages 53 to 57 of the report which refer to correspondence between the Oireachtas joint committee and the Tánaiste's Department.  I hope he will respond to this because those of us who believe in the committee system of the Houses would like to believe that, if an Oireachtas joint committee need information to make a decision before bringing a report to the Houses, the fullest cooperation will be forthcoming from all civil servants in all Departments.  That should be included in the guidelines and the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>It is an excellent report and I hope the Tánaiste's response to it will be of benefit to Members of the House who have an interest in this economic development of <Col N="1579" /> our natural resources.  I look forward to a good debate.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch go bhfuil seans agam san Seanad inniu páirt a ghlacadh san díospóireacht seo, an Triú Tuarascáil ón gComhchoiste um Chomhlachtaí Stat-Tionscanta Tráchtála &mdash; Bord Gáis Éireann.  Tá súil agam nach mbeidh na Seanadóirí sa seomra scoile seo ar feadh morán tamaill eile, go rachfaidh siad ar ais go dtí an seomra álainn a bhí ann agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé in a seomra álainn arís.</P>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation to the members of the joint committee for the work they have put into the preparation of the comprehensive report on Bord Gáis Éireann.  I welcome the report as a constructive document and I look forward to hearing the views of the House on it.</P>
      <P>Natural gas from the Kinsale Head gas field has been available in Ireland since 1978.  We have to recognise that the Kinsale Head gas field is an extremely valuable natural resource, but a wasting resource, and that it is vital for us to utilise it to the maximum national advantage. This involves achieving the appropriate balance between allocation, depletion and pricing.  It is not only for the benefit of those fortunate enough to be near the pipeline but for the benefit of the whole nation.</P>
      <P>BGE are the statutory corporation entrusted with the task of buying this gas from Marathon and selling it on to its customers, subject to the conditions and obligations laid down by the Gas Act, 1976.  It buys gas under contract from Marathon and sells it on under further contracts to its customers.  Then, out of moneys generated from this activity it funds its operations and development programmes, and remits a certain dividend each year to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>BGE have been in operation as a statutory corporation since 1976.  It originally had two customers &mdash; the ESB and NET. Since then their customer base has expanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1580" /> By 1980 the Cork district gas pipeline had been laid, the first branch going to the ESB power station at Aghada and another feeding the NET fertiliser plant at Marino.  The line then feeds industries on its way to Cork city and the Ringaskiddy industrial estate.  This part of the system was completed during 1980, supplying new gas directly to 27,000 domestic, commercial and industrial customers throughout Cork city.  The Cork system provided a basis for a line to Dublin which was considered the main market for gas.</P>
    <P>The Town Gas Industry Review Committee concluded that the future of the town gas industry in general hinged largely on the future of Dublin Gas Company which accounted for over 90 per cent of the sales of the industry excluding Cork.</P>
    <P>The 220 km Cork-Dublin gas pipeline was one of the biggest engineering projects undertaken in this country in recent years.  The pipe was laid in nine months during 1982 so that by the year-end, all the 120,000 customers of New Dublin Gas were connected to gas from the sea off the coast of Cork.  Since then, more progress has been made in further extending the natural gas grid throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In October 1985 the Government gave approval to BGE to proceed with the construction of a 90 km natural gas trunkline to Limerick.  Construction is now almost complete and is on time and within budget so far.  It is intended to have natural gas flowing in Limerick city by next spring, with the system being operated by a new company jointly owned by BGE and Limerick Corporation.  En route, the dairy co-operative at Mitchelstown, the Golden Vale Co-operative in Charleville and the Ballyclough Co-operative in Mallow are being supplied.  The approved estimated cost for the entire Limerick project is £15.6 million.  Up to 500 people have been employed during the construction phase.</P>
    <P>The Government also gave approval to Bord Gáis in October 1985 to proceed with construction of a natural gas pipeline to serve Waterford.  BGE commenced <Col N="1581" /> construction of the new 48km trunkline in June 1986 and work on the mainline to Waterford city is expected to be completed in March 1987.  Contracts for the supply of gas have been agreed with a number of major industrial companies in the country.  Two days ago I had the pleasure of switching on the gas for Waterford Crystal which is being supplied through a 4 km spur from the main Waterford line.  Overall, some 300 workers have been employed on the mainline project during the construction period.  The total cost of the project is estimated at just over £8 million, over 70 per cent of which will be spent on Irish goods and services.</P>
    <P>In June 1986 the Government gave approval for the construction of a pipeline to supply Kilkenny with natural gas. The contract was allocated on 15 October 1986 and construction work has now commenced on the spur line to the city.  BGE will control the distribution of gas in the city.</P>
    <P>In July 1986 approval was given to provide a supply of natural gas to Clonmel. Construction is due to commence in January 1987 and is expected to be completed in April 1987.  The system will be owned 80 per cent by BGE and 20 per cent by Clonmel Corporation.</P>
    <P>The committee has recommended that BGE explore the feasibility of providing some of its highly qualified expertise to the gas utilities.  I am glad to say that this expertise is already being provided in the case of Cork and Limerick and will be extended in due course to Kilkenny, Clonmel and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Natural gas is a very pure fuel and this brings major benefits to the users of natural gas on a domestic, commercial and industrial scale.  On the industrial scale, the capital costs and operating costs needed to provide energy in the industry are considerably reduced through the use of gas.  Sales of natural gas for use by NET for fertilisers and the ESB for electricity have grown rapidly since 1980.  Up to the end of 1985 natural gas supplied over half of the ESB's fuel requirements.  However, with the coming <Col N="1582" /> on line of the 900MW Moneypoint coal-fired station in the Shannon Estuary, the ESB's need for gas is rapidly diminishing.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a view around that we do not have enough customers for gas.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Because ESB usage is dropping does not mean that we now have huge amounts of supplies of gas to sell.  The ESB's quantity was upfronted in order to get them over the situation where coal units were under construction.</P>
    <P>The joint committee drew various conclusions and made certain recommendations in relation to BGE.  I would like briefly to comment on some of these. The joint committee has drawn attention to the need for BGE and the ESB to jointly quantify the volumes of gas likely to be required for power generation after 1989.  This is all the more necessary following the Supreme Court ruling in the dispute between BGE and Marathon over the interpretation of the supply agreement clauses relating to price and quality, the effect of which was to place a limit on the annual contract quantity.  I am informed by BGE that direct negotiations are taking place between the two companies to reach agreement on the quantity to be allocated for power generation in the future.  However, future gas supplies to the ESB are contingent on the outcome of a number of factors such as the limitation on gas quantities, and trends in oil prices.</P>
    <P>The issue of implicit subsidies was dealt with in another recommendation, implying that the ESB and NET are subsidised through cheap gas.  We have as a matter of policy to determine the best usage of our gas resource and its usage for the production of fertiliser can be judged from the relativities of fertiliser and oil prices taking account of the jobs and economic activity stimulated as a result of the manufacture of the fertilisers.  The use of gas to make fertilisers is quite a complex issue.</P>
    <P>The first recommendation talks about giving BGE greater flexibility in its pricing policy for individual industrial customers. Flexibility here presumably <Col N="1583" /> means lower prices.  Gas has an opportunity value which means we see its main use in the replacement of oil imports. Gas is not in competition with coal, or turf for that matter.  It is in competition with oil.  It is priced competitively with oil, and BGE have been issued with pricing guidelines in accordance with the Gas Act.  They have flexibility within these guidelines.  One must not lose sight of the capital costs involved to bring gas to any new customer &mdash; the price charged has to ensure that the supply project is viable.  Gas cannot be seen as a vehicle for subsidising industry.  In regard to the committee's recommendation that a review of the Gas Act, 1976, be undertaken, I have to say that the gas industry is controlled by complex old legislation, with Acts dating from the last century. The position is being examined in my Department at present to see what needs to be consolidated.</P>
    <P>For the town gas companies in Cork, Dublin and elsewhere to adapt to natural gas has not been easy.  A case in point is that of Cork Gas which spent major sums of money on conversion to natural gas and was then beset by a number of problems from within and without.  In June 1985, the Government decided to allow BGE to acquire a 100 per cent share holding in Cork Gas Company.  The purpose of this decision was to enable BGE as the supplier of gas to Cork Gas to control the company, improve its management and restore it to a viable state. The company is now being operated as a wholly owned BGE subsidiary and is managed within policy guidelines by a separate board with its own chairman and executive.</P>
    <P>Similar problems have beset Dublin Gas leading to the appointment of a receiver to bring it back to viability. When the Government decided to build the pipeline to Dublin it did so as part of a natural energy policy and strategy.  It did so because natural gas is a premium fuel and should be used primarily for cooking, home and other heating, for special industrial uses and after that for <Col N="1584" /> general industrial use.  Dublin is the largest premium market.  The key issues faced at the outset were the cost of building the pipeline to Dublin; the cost and feasibility of converting Dublin to natural gas; the extent of the potential market for gas in Dublin and the investment needed to capture the market.</P>
    <P>The pipeline was completed in 1982 and the conversion of the city was completed in September 1986 on time and under budget. However, the main aim of developing the premium market was not achieved to the extent necessary nor within the timescale envisaged originally. Dublin Gas Company was not viable. The company could not meet all its obligations or service its debt.  It failed to meet even its own revised marketing targets, could not provide its customers with the quality of service needed and did not make any significant in-roads into reducing its heavy burden of overheads.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that since the appointment of the receiver, considerable progress has been made in laying the basis for an efficient and viable natural gas distribution operation in Dublin.  The receiver has assessed the overall situation in the Dublin Gas Company and a major rationalisation of the company is in the course of completion.  With the completion of the conversion programme, Dublin now has a modern gas distribution network.  I am considering the future funding requirements of the operation and my intention is to ensure a well-run and publicly owned gas utility for the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I welcome the committee's suggestion that BGE should develop further its work on compressed natural gas.  Compressed natural gas or CNG is formed by submitting natural gas to high levels of pressure. Unlike liquefied natural gas, CNG is gaseous in form and can be transported under strict safety conditions by bulk tankers. This facilitates access to the customer and as the committee has mentioned in its report, this might be the most suitable method for supplying natural gas to the smaller towns and industrial centres in the event of it not <Col N="1585" /> being commercially viable to supply them otherwise.  BGE have undertaken a CNG project at the Minch Norton Plant at Athy, County Kildare.  The project has been initiated with a view to assessing the feasibility of supplying firms with natural gas using this method.  BGE report that there have been no major operational difficulties to date.  However, it will be sometime yet before a decision on whether to extend the facility to other customers can be taken.</P>
    <P>I agree with the joint committee's recommendation in regard to the laying of the annual reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas not later than six months after the end of each financial year. Unfortunately this year the publication of the report had to await the outcome of the Supreme Court judgment in the Marathon case.</P>
    <P>I, as Minister for Energy, through my Department have control of gas policy and responsibility for BGE.  The level of control and involvement by the Department is at issue in recommendation number 10.  Unlike other State agencies, BGE is very much in its infancy and so is geared at the present time to growth and development both of its infrastructure and its markets.  The laying of new pipelines to link customers or towns to natural gas are major undertakings.  BGE under the Gas Act, have to receive approval to lay these lines, and it has been my practice to have major investments also approved by Government, on my recommendation. All such proposals put before me by BGE are examined very carefully in my Department prior to submission to Government.  Following approval, the implementation of projects is an operational matter for BGE.  I have to say, because of the newness of BGE and the natural gas situation, that very many of the issues which arise cannot be classified as operational in the normal sense as they would in a mature undertaking and hence it might appear there is heavy involvement of my Department in the affairs of BGE.</P>
    <P>The natural gas resource has conferred many benefits on the nation.  It is the Government's concern to ensure that the <Col N="1586" /> benefits accrue to the nation as a whole. Last year, natural gas met some 21 per cent of the country's total primary energy demand.  This was twice the energy demand satisfied by coal and almost half the demand for imported oil.  Natural gas is, therefore, of major strategic and economic importance to the nation.  By reducing imports of other fuels, the effect has been to improve the balance of payments by nearly £400 million in 1985.  In the same year the use of natural gas resulted in a direct contribution of over £80 million to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The part which BGE has played in the development of the gas industry has been of major significance.  It adapted to the demands made upon it in the early years and built up a fund of skills in the technical, financial and marketing areas of an industry new to this country.</P>
    <P>Since then there have been enormous changes in the marketplace which have not helped.  Future development of the gas industry will have to be based on prudent planning and I endorse fully the committee's emphasis on planning in its recommendations.  I am awaiting at present the company's corporate plan outlining its strategies for the next five years.  In conjunction with this, work on the preparation of an energy policy document has commenced in my Department. It is hoped to have this work completed within about six months.  These two important steps should be of great assistance to the company in dealing with future problems and I look forward to the time when the Government objective will be achieved in the increased use of natural gas in homes, offices and factories throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to thank the joint committee for providing me with the opportunity to take part in this valuable debate and to have made available to me the views of the House on this major industrial enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this report.  I welcome the Minister's introductory speech and his comments in relation to the energy policy document <Col N="1587" /> which will be published shortly.  In that area there is a great need for information with regard to heating in particular for people building new houses and I hope the Minister will include such information in his policy document.  While the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards help many people and while the Hotline telephone call system is open to the public for at least part of the year &mdash; unfortunately it is not open all year round and I urge the Minister to consider making this service available all year round &mdash; nevertheless many people are unable to pay a heating engineer and are, therefore, unaware as to what is the best method of heating their homes.  In the United Kingdom at present a considerable amount of money is being spent in this energy efficiency year and this was highlighted by the recent exhibition in Milton Keynes, of which I am sure the Minister is well aware.  The same consultancy opportunities should be available here.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that gas is not in competition with coal or turf but I disagree with him.  In domestic heating gas is in the second category but the Minister has put it in the first category. Assistance should be readily available for people in this situation and I hope that the Minister in his policy document, which I warmly welcome, will include such assistance. I look forward to that document in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has given a very positive welcome to the recommendations of the committee.  He dealt with them in detail and, therefore, I will not repeat them but I am glad he has given a positive welcome to the recommendations which are included in the summary at the beginning of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute, as I always do, to the members of the committee for their hard work in producing this important report. It is straightforward and comprehensive and is very timely.  At the beginning of the report we are given a précis of the situation with regard to Kinsale Head, which is 30 miles off the Cork coast and it gives the geological details which apply <Col N="1588" /> to it.  It also covers the difficulty in getting the gas to the mainland and explains that the gas is transferred by means of a 24&rdquo; pipe.  This is dealt with later on in the report.</P>
    <P>In regard to my initial remarks about domestic buildings, while I understand the advantages of gas &mdash; and these have been covered very well in the recent debate which we had on the Air Pollution Bill, 1986 &mdash; it is interesting to remember the Milton Keynes situation where nearly all the houses are heated by gas and they have gas for cooking purposes.  Nevertheless, the house with the lowest cost index for heating was heated by electricity. That is very important to remember. Perhaps more could be done to market electricity for central heating. Quite a lot has been done in this regard but there is much scope in the area of off-peak electricity.  We have the ESB network of wiring throughout the country to which many people have objected and which aesthetically is not very acceptable, whereas in the case of gas it is all underground.  With gas supply we have a finite situation and with electricity the network is there for many generations to come.  All of these things have to be taken into consideration when evaluating whether heating by gas or by electricity is the better choice.</P>
    <P>The ESB are BGE's largest customer to date and, according to projections contained in the ESB's annual report for the year ending 31 March 1984, they will virtually cease using gas after 1989 when the Moneypoint coal burning station in County Clare becomes fully operational. The Minister dealt with that and it is mentioned in the report.</P>
    <P>The ESB have an obligation, and it is quantified in the report, to take a certain amount of gas per year and under contract if they do not do so they have to pay the price.  The report states that gas paid for but not used in a given year may be drawn off in a subsequent year.  I would like to know what is the present situation. Is it envisaged that that problem would arise?  In a sense it might not be an altogether undesirable thing.  Surely it would result in reduced prices for the following <Col N="1589" /> year or years.  I could envisage this happening for a number of years and perhaps after seven or eight years what would amount to free electricity would be available. Perhaps the Minister would comment on this in his reply.</P>
    <P>The report says:</P>
    <P>Originally the pressure of the gas leaving the Kinsale Head gasfield was 1,000 p.s.i.  This has now fallen to 740 p.s.i. as a result of the offtake of gas since commencement of production.</P>
    <P>I understand that to mean that, because of the depletion of gas in the Kinsale Head, we have a reduction of about 25 per cent in the pressure.  According to the report it may be necessary to introduce compressor equipment to increase the pressure to the required level.  Therefore, as the further use of the Kinsale Head gas continues, when 50 per cent of the gas is used we will have the pressure reduced by 50 per cent.  I wonder if the proposed compressor equipment is very costly.  I am sure it will involve some considerable cost and I wonder if this is being taken into consideration.  Perhaps the Minister would refer to that briefly when he is replying.</P>
    <P>The gas, of course, is completely odourless.  A sulphur based chemical has been added to give the gas a smell which I suppose is necessary.  As with the Air Pollution Bill, 1986, not enough consideration has been given to the problem of smell but, in this instance, the smell has been added in order to eliminate danger and I welcome that.  In relation to natural gas the report states:</P>
    <P>Natural gas is a highly attractive fuel with many commercial and industrial applications.  Because of its flexibility in use, ease of delivery and cleanliness it is favoured by large users of energy for heating and processing, particularly where accurate temperature control is required.  In Europe domestic consumers account for the next largest user category after industry.  In Ireland natural gas consumption by private industrial and domestic users has only been partially developed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> Nevertheless, while that is so, heating engineers, by and large, have specified more for gas in the past few years.  Quite apart from the advantages with regard to costs and being odourless, it is unnecessary to provide a chimney which is a saving in many instances because as in the case of oil, for example, a balanced flue may be used which means there is a very simple connection to the exterior.  This is another attraction of gas.</P>
    <P>Gas has helped to reduce Ireland's dependency on imported fuel from a high total of 80 per cent in 1979 to 61 per cent in 1983 which in round figures is one-fifth and this is very considerable.  In 1984 natural gas accounted for 54 per cent of the fuels used by the ESB to produce electricity.</P>
    <P>Then the report comes to what I feel is a very important part.  Paragraph 9 states:</P>
    <P>The Kinsale Head gasfield originally contained 1.253 trillion (million million) cubic feet of gas &mdash; about 20% of Ireland's total energy needs for twenty years.  In 1984, according to BGE's annual report for that year, 21% of the total primary energy demand was met by natural gas.  The value of the gasfield to the nation at 1984 oil prices is about £7 billion &mdash; say £350 million/year over its 20 year life. The field now produces more energy than the combined output of the ESB and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>In summary we are told that this contributed a cumulative £182 million to the Exchequer in 1984.  The payments in 1984 were £71 million and cumulatively helped the national balance of payments by £1,327 million and in 1984 by £367 million.  I wonder what the position would have been if this had not been discovered as these are very considerable figures.</P>
    <P>A favourable contract with Marathon provides for a drawdown of the gas over a 20 year period to 1999.  Again the Minister has referred to this.  The base price of the gas is indexed to annual movements in international oil prices as defined by Platt's index and the exchange rate of the Irish £ with the US dollar.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> This seems a bit complex.  The Minister said with regard to the first recommendation of the report that flexibility meant lowering the price.  By and large I agree, but it might also mean lowering the price or making a concession for a period.  As was brought out in the debate on the wider share ownership motion last night some firms may be in difficulty for a short time and it would be sufficient if they got some kind of concession over a short period.  This may well have been in the committee's mind when they referred to flexibility.  Bord Gáis Éireann are one of the few State boards operating completely outside Dublin.  On a first reading I am satisfied that the position is so but then the report goes on to tell us that:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee was informed in evidence that a high proportion of senior executives' time is spent commuting to Dublin in order to attend meetings with the Department of Energy, Dublin Gas commercial banks and legal advisers.</P>
    <P>Although the report does not state so categorically, it seems to me there is some implicit condemnation of that situation. It seems right in one sense that the whole operation should be outside Dublin, and decentralisation is something all of us would favour.  However, it is unfortunate that so much of the time of senior executives is wasted travelling to Dublin.  This is an important aspect that could be looked at.  Perhaps some other arrangement could be made?  In this day and age when communication is so much easier, it should not be difficult to devise ways that would be acceptable and would overcome this problem.</P>
    <P>In the annual report of Bord Gáis Éireann for 1983 it is stated that in the near future it is hoped to extend the national gas grid to Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford.  The Minister has dealt with that.  Paragraph 14 of the report states:</P>
    <P>...the principal reason for the delay in providing gas to Limerick resolved <Col N="1592" /> upon negotiations concerning the ultimate shareholding structure and the proportion to be held respectively by private and State shareholders.</P>
    <P>It seems unfortunate that this kind of problem would result in withholding gas from such an important centre.  The report states:</P>
    <P>The joint committee was also informed that, having regard to the cost of connection to the grid, the supply of gas to smaller towns might best be done through the use of compressed natural gas, CNG, delivered by bulk tanker.  It is understood that Wexford town will shortly be supplied on this basis.</P>
    <P>The use of bottled gas in this way is long established.  Perhaps the committee could have gone into more detail to determine the costs, particularly the transport costs involved, and whether they would make the proposition uneconomical.  It seems to me to be a very good suggestion. In rural areas in the past bottled gas was used quite widely.  For a time this product was withdrawn by the companies, presumably because of the high cost of transport. When it is possible to supply compressed natural gas in bulk tanker there is no reason why any area should be without it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the domestic market in the context of rural areas not being near the pipeline, the committee could have gone into this in greater detail because of the potential.  Nevertheless, the Minister has given a positive response to the recommendations and I am happy that if there is a future in this regard on a wide scale the Minister will follow it up.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 16 of the report states that:</P>
    <P>...the joint committee was informed that the Aughinish Alumina Ltd. (AAL) would constitute a major load for BGE &mdash; 25 m.c.f. per day compared with the ESB's current usage of 160 m.c.f. per day.</P>
    <P>While it is a considerable amount, compared to what the ESB use it is rather insignificant.  The report tells us that it <Col N="1593" /> has not been possible up to the present for BGE to supply gas to Aughinish Alumina Limited without the pricing guidelines laid down by the Department of Energy. These pricing guidelines are dealt with in detail.  They are based upon the price of heavy fuel oil and the position of the dollar.  The report tells us that these guidelines are continuously under review and this is important in such a changing situation.  The report further states that:</P>
    <P>The joint committee is concerned about the slow pace, since the completion of the Cork-Dublin pipeline in 1982, of making natural gas available to Clonmel, Limerick and Waterford, other towns en route, and in general, to industry.</P>
    <P>I agree with that.  It seems unreasonable that gas was withheld from those areas which are contiguous to the pipeline.  The report notes that the experience of supplying natural gas to industrial estates in the Cork region has resulted in 2,200 job approvals by the IDA which is quite a considerable number at present when there is so much unemployment.  It emphasises the importance of proceeding to make gas available on as wide a scale as possible in as short a period as possible. The report states:</P>
    <P>BGE, when negotiating with potential customers, is invariably queried about continuity and the availability of supplies of gas after the Kinsale Head gasfield runs out in 1999.</P>
    <P>This is a very important area and it is a question that would have to be asked by anyone considering the situation.  I am not sure that the replies given are as comprehensive as they might be.  A fairly honest attempt has been made to deal with the situation and there is a <i>précis</i> of the situation.  The report states:</P>
    <P>Prior to the recent announcement of a further, as yet, unquantified offshore find, there were no alternative sources from which gas could be drawn off. The fact that the entire network is, at present, supplied from one 24&rdquo; pipe from the Kinsale Head gasfield, places the entire grid at risk.  In the event of <Col N="1594" /> a interruption in supply apart from the inconvenience caused to domestic and industrial consumers, the ESB would be deprived of more than half of its input fuel at a single stroke.</P>
    <P>This is a rather serious situation.  I have some experience of pipes on the seabed in the Haulbowline area.  This matter should have been considered at the laying stage and it would have been easier to lay a number of pipes with the required capacity, in case of some accident or sabotage. It is wrong that the gas supply should be dependent on one pipe and it should be looked at very soon to see if an alternative can be arranged.  Paragraph 19 of the report states:</P>
    <P>In a written submission from BGE the joint committee was informed that it has commissioned the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to undertake a risk analysis of the likelihood and consequence of an interruption in gas supplies and the possibility of using a radar surveillance system to monitor the movement of vessels in the vicinity of the pipeline is also under consideration.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister in his reply would refer to this and bring us up-to-date on whatever communications have been received from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards because it is an important aspect.  Alternative sources of supply, in the absence of any further indigenous and substantial discoveries will need to be negotiated prior to 1990, either via a link to the UK gas grid or through direct imports of liquified natural gas.  The situation is not as serious as I would have thought if it is possible to connect to the UK gas grid.  I wonder if it is as simple as that.  Have negotiations been carried out?  What about the price structure?  In his reply, I would like the Minister to give us some information in this area.  We are told in the report that representatives of the Confederation of Irish Industry expressed the view that the level of offshore drilling activity depended upon the conditions attaching to the licensing terms.  I recall some <Col N="1595" /> improvement in this in the not too distant past.  I welcome that improvement and I hope that it will result in more drilling and more wells being discovered.</P>
    <P>The report tells us it was also suggested that conditions should be made more attractive in order to increase the level of drilling activity up to, say, 20 wells per year, thereby increasing the probability of finding more natural gas.  The conditions have been improved.  I do not have all the details but I know they have been improved.  I wonder what has been the result.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know whether as a result of the improved conditions drilling will be increased to his satisfaction.  The report tells us Bord Gáis Éireann have a relatively limited number of customers.  This is so.  In Ireland for example, if somebody decided to use gas as a source of heating in a new house that would mean automatically the ESB would lose a customer. We must take all these aspects into consideration. The ESB and Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta have provided the cashflow which in turn has helped to fund the entire national grid inclusive of the Cork to Dublin pipeline, the Cork city pipeline and the conversional development plans for both the Cork and Dublin gas utilities. Senator Ferris dealt with that aspect.  He explained that conversion means the cost of adjustments to appliances so that they can operate on natural gas and development means the seeking out of new markets for gas.  While this is limited to some extent, it also has the disadvantage that it takes a customer from some other area. Nevertheless that cashflow provided by the ESB and NET must be welcomed and we must pay tribute to them.</P>
    <P>The price of oil against which BGE must compete is not only governed by international supply and demand but also by the prevailing exchange rate for the US dollar, universally used for pricing oil products.  I have referred to this already. it seems a complex structure and a difficult area.  The matter must be kept under constant review, as we are told in the report it is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> The representatives of the Confederation of Irish Industry queried the pricing structure of natural gas for industrial users.  They advocated a price which would be mid-way between the present price to industry and that paid by BGE to Marathon.  It was claimed that such a reduced price would be more in line with that charged by other European countries and that it would have the following effects: (a) facilitating the allocation of the ESB quantities post 1989; (b) accelerating economic activity; and (c) helping the balance of payments by displacing important imports of fuel oil.  The joint committee were informed that the Confederation of Irish Industry would be willing to assist Bord Gáis Éireann to locate clusters of industrial uses which collectively would justify the cost of a spur line from the main grid.  This is important. I welcome it.  Bord Gáis Éireann should take advantage of this because it is more economic to supply the gas to areas of dense population or dense industrial use rather than isolated areas.  Bord Gáis Éireann have been offered help in this area by the CII and they should avail of it.</P>
    <P>The committee are of the opinion that, notwithstanding the need to maintain an energy related price structure for gas, more flexibility should be applied by BGE in their pricing policy for individual industrial consumers.  I have dwelt on that before.  It is the first recommendation of the committee.  The Minister responded to it but I think he dismissed it in a rather peremptory fashion.  I am not being critical of the Minister's speech in that regard but I do think it is worthy of far more serious consideration, perhaps in the area of firms who might have a short term problem.</P>
    <P>The report is timely and comprehensive. It deals with a difficult situation in an area where not everybody sees eye to eye.  In the past because of concessions or dealings with Dublin Gas a Minister resigned from the Government. I do not think it is appropriate to go into that in any depth.  I just mention it to underline the fact it is an area where <Col N="1597" /> not everybody will see eye to eye, not even all members of the Government.  It is important when we are dealing with a commodity that has only a short life span that there should be a consensus that this commodity of gas would be marketed to the advantage of the country in the best possible way.  For that reason I welcome the report and the Minister's positive response and I look forward to his final reply to this report and to answers to some of the questions I posed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh I welcome the opportunity to make a general contribution to this debate this morning.  I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies who compiled the report.  I did not have the opportunity to listen to the various representatives who appeared before the committee and gave their considered views.  I have read the report and the minutes of the evidence taken from a number of individuals and organisations who had an interest and involvement in this activity.  I listened to the Minister's speech here this morning.</P>
      <P>In recent times &mdash; and this is by way of a general observation &mdash; I have been of the opinion that the Oireachtas should consider the value and effectiveness of the manner in which we deal with and respond to the reports of joint committees. I have been an advocate of the system for a long time.  The reports of the joint committees are an important contribution to the welfare of the country and to democracy itself.</P>
      <P>I am becoming disillusioned to a degree with the response these reports seem to invoke in the quarters where I feel a response should be invoked.  That is not a criticism of this House, Senators have dealt consistently with reports of the joint committees.  The performance of this House is not being matched elsewhere. Therefore, we have arrived at a point in time when we should be questioning how seriously and how effectively the State and the Government are responding to the excellent work of the committees and the excellent reports they have produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's response to this report <Col N="1598" /> has been a considered one.  There has been on his part a willingness to look at the work of the joint committee and to respond to it in a positive manner.  While the work of the committee and their report are important, the attention the report receives in the Seanad is equally as important.  I hope the response of the Minister to the points raised here will be as thorough and as considerate as it was to the report of the joint committee.  The Minister said it might appear that there is a heavy involvement of his Department in the affairs of BGE.  He pointed out the extent to which the Department are involved in issuing guidelines to BGE. His Department are presently preparing an energy policy.  It is, therefore with the greatest concern that I read in the joint committee's report &mdash; and the evidence is there on pages 56, 57 and 58 &mdash; that there was considerable difficulty in obtaining co-operation from the Minister's Department.  The Minister told us this morning that his Department lay down the guidelines.  He also stated very clearly that there is heavy involvement by his Department.  That I accept as being right and proper.  If that is the case and if a committee established by the Oireachtas find themselves frustrated in arriving at their conclusions or in doing their work, if they are to be confronted by a stonewalling attitude, I expect the Minister to deal comprehensively with that and to clarify it to the satisfaction of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt quite extensively with the conclusions of the committee. His response was satisfactory and worthwhile.  I compliment the committee on the thoroughness of their report and on a job well done.  They raised queries as to where we are going in relation to this valuable natural resource in the years ahead.  If I am paying compliments it is right that I should also pay one to Bord Gáis Éireann because they are unique in this sense.  They are a new semi-State organisation who have turned in a respectable profit almost from the very beginning &mdash; not in their first year of operation but in every year since.  That brings me to the whole question of the <Col N="1599" /> pricing policy which the committee dealt with quite comprehensively in their report and which to some degree has been referred to by the Minister here today.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that gas cannot be seen as a vehicle for subsidising industry. It depends on how you look at it.  If the view that gas cannot be seen as a vehicle for subsidising industry was applied rigidly, we would be entitled to ask: how would you describe what the committee have discovered as a hidden subsidy of £36 million a year to NET and £51 million a year to the ESB?  They base these calculations on the 1983 accounts of Bord Gáis Éireann.  It is a question of what words mean.  If gas cannot be seen as subsidising industry fair enough, but how do you describe what we are doing where the ESB and NET are concerned?</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter we should also take into consideration. There is a general acceptance &mdash; I do not think the Minister or anybody else will dispute this &mdash; that the cost of energy has been a barrier to the attraction and establishment of more industries in the State.  As far as energy and communications are concerned, we are certainly at a disadvantage in relation to other countries within the EC and outside it.  If we were to use the available resources of natural gas to bring our energy costs more into line with average cost in European countries, would that be subsidising industry or would it be eliminating a barrier to the creation of industrial jobs?</P>
    <P>The point I am making was made far more effectively by Mr. Liam Connellan, Director General of the Confederation of Irish Industry, in the course of his discussion with the joint committee on 5 June 1985, where he stated that the last report published by Bord Gáis was in 1983.  At that time Bord Gáis were able to transmit £65 million to the Exchequer at a profit of 9p a therm.  The cost of the gas was about 13p a therm.  Apparently that would be the price that then appeared that Bord Gáis were paying to Marathon and the selling price was 22p.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> That 22p would appear to be the price it was sold at to the ESB and to NET.  Mr. Connellan gave one example of a heavy industrial user who would have a requirement of 400,000 therms per annum at a value of £1.25 million.  The price quoted was 51p per therm as against the 22p charged to the ESB and to NET.  He also pointed out that there were other cases where prices of 49p and 50p had been quoted.  He then referred to the fact that the average price in Great Britain and in France seemed to be somewhere in the region of 35p.</P>
    <P>In that situation, he pointed out, that were natural gas made available at the prevailing prices in Britain and France, it would be made available at a level considerably higher than that at which it was available to the ESB and to NET. Mr. Connellan pointed out that that would represent more than a doubling of the profit to Bord Gáis and that it would be also making a valuable source of energy available to industry at precisely the same level as it was available to industry in the United Kingdom and France. Therefore, I feel that Mr. Connellan has made a case which should be answered. I want to revert to what I said earlier.  It is recognised, and I do not think there is any dispute about it, that industrial costs in Ireland, particularly where energy and communications are concerned, are putting this island at a disadvantage in comparison with other European countries. We have the opportunity to utilise a natural resource but we must put energy costs at least on level terms with competing economies.  We can do that and still double the level of profit that we obtain from the ESB and NET.  Mr. Connellan in his submission has made a point in that regard which requires consideration and requires to be answered.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his speech said that because natural gas is a premium fuel it should be used primarily for cooking, home and other heating, for special industrial uses and after that for general industrial use.  I know, as indeed I am sure everybody concerned with the situation knows, that it has been stated over the years that the generation of electricity by <Col N="1601" /> the use of natural gas was one of the most uneconomic methods by which natural gas could be utilised.  People went so far as to describe this use as being wasteful of a natural resource.  We are conscious also of the fact that with the coming on stream of the Monypoint coal burning generating station the ESB's requirement of natural gas for generating purposes will be considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>I notice also that the committee produced on page 39 of their report a very useful graph to indicate the generating of electricity and the fuels used to do that over the period from 1980-84.  We have seen a fantastic growth in the volume of electricity generated from natural gas, rising from 11 per cent in 1980 to 54 per cent in 1984.  I understand that that trend will be reversed once the Moneypoint coal burning station goes ahead.  Therefore what has been generally accepted as a wasteful use of natural gas will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the expansion of the grid that has taken place since 1980 to provide natural gas to a number of towns and cities.  As the Minister outlined prior to that Bord Gáis were simply supplying the ESB and NET.  Cork came on stream in 1980, Dublin in 1982 and in 1985 work began on the extension of pipelines and so on to Limerick.  Naturally enough you and I, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, expect these pipelines to extend at least up to Shannon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>If you look at the progress of the past four years, there is no doubt that this is a natural progression with the present Government in charge of the situation.  We expect to see the pipeline crossing the Shannon and we are satisfied that there are industrial and domestic users of a satisfactory number in the Shannon and mid-Clare area to effectively utilise this natural resource.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on that part of the Minister's speech where he emphasises the value of this natural resource to the economy.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> Last year, natural gas met some 21 per cent of the country's total primary energy demand.  This was twice the energy demand satisfied by coal and almost half the demand for imported oil.  Natural gas is, therefore, of major strategic and economic importance to the nation.  By reducing imports of other fuels, the effect has been to improve the balance of payments by £400 million in 1985.  In the same year the use of natural gas resulted in a direct contribution of over £80 million to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am sure it resulted also in at least a similar sum as a subsidy, and that is how I still describe it, to both NET and the ESB.</P>
    <P>As I tried to point out earlier I am not complaining about that situation.  You cannot on the one hand say, no, we cannot use it as a subsidy to industry when we are using it as a subsidy to the ESB and to NET.  My problem is the understanding of the word &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; in this context.  I do not think you are subsidising anything if you are simply making energy available at a price structure which corresponds to that which competing economies have natural gas available to them.</P>
    <P>The report, as the Minister pointed out, was delayed in its publication because of the Supreme Court case between Bord Gáis Éireann and Marathon. Much of the work referred to in the report had been completed for quite some time.  When he is replying, the Minister might well like to comment on suggestions and reports that we are not going to be depending solely on Kinsale for supplies of gas in the future.  There are indications and reports that other worthwhile discoveries have been made in recent times.  The Minister should comment on these reports and to what extent they are speculation or are of value.</P>
    <P>Somebody, in the course of the debate in the committee, said it is hard to imagine there will be no more natural gas finds in the next decade, if the conditions exist which would make it attractive to drill exploration wells.  We have <Col N="1603" /> had indications since the report was printed and published of other discoveries. It would be useful if the Minister were to comment on these and, if possible, quantify them.  Not everybody would be interested but nonetheless he could comment on the accuracy or otherwise of the reports.</P>
    <P>I conclude by again expressing my appreciation of the work the committee put into this, of the many stimulating thoughts that can emerge from it and the detailed examination they gave to so many aspects of the field.  I would always regard it as a very regrettable situation if the work which these Oireachtas joint committees are putting into so many aspects of the functioning of the State was not treated with the seriousness they deserve and if there was not a response to their findings or their work from the quarters where it mattered most.  I believe the Minister's speech today was a reasonable response to the work of that joint committee in relation to this report but while it was a reasonable response, one or two areas require further clarification. I hope that in his speech at the end of the discussion here today the Minister will be able to clarify these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by congratulating the committee on the report.  I must also congratulate Bord Gáis Éireann for the very steady and effective gas deliveries to the various locations.  I welcome the developments in the area of supply contracts and the agreements which were reached to bring natural gas to places such as Limerick and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On examination you have to admit that their role in trading is good.  It has substantially assisted the balance of payments position.  In the matter of imports &mdash; which leads to the balance of payments situation &mdash; it played a very substantial role in 1985.  It is not possible to assess the position this year as yet.  We should not overlook this.  We should pay attention to it because we are talking about a very substantial amount of money becoming available to assist the balance <Col N="1604" /> of payments, by curtailing the necessity for imports.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the board have had their problems.  Bord Gáis Éireann were involved with the Cork project which was not disastrous in the general sense but they had to give some assistance.  There was also a very big problem with the Dublin Gas Company and they are having problems in their trading arrangement with the ESB.  These are things which could happen to any industry, private or public.  It does not take away from the overall performance of the board and that is recognised in the committee's report.  We should put on record that we are pleased with this relatively new body, who are progressing along the right lines.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with Bord Gáis Éireann &mdash; as with any other State enterprise &mdash; is the attitude of Governments down through the years.  Their attitude has been one of tolerance, not pushing them ahead and allowing them to develop in their natural way.  This is a pity when you study the whole question of the employment content and the assistance given to the economy, going back to the time of the Shannon when public enterprise was opposed at that time.  You can link that with employment.  Look at the performances of some of the public enterprises: at the moment you have six public enterprises in the top ten.  That is a good league to be in.  In the 21 State-sponsored bodies which are public enterprises 80,000 people are employed.  That is a very substantial number and we should be very careful when we are dealing with bodies such as Bord Gáis Éireann to see that they get every assistance possible. Where there are defects or flaws these should be pursued and that is where the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies come in.  I welcome that.  About £6.5 billion in capital is used in State enterprises and there is a turnover of about £3.9 billion.  These are very substantial figures particulary in a small economy such as ours.  Public enterprises have made an enormous contribution to the development of the Irish economy and to the lives of the people generally.</P>
    <P>There have been difficulties in the <Col N="1605" /> public sector regarding the worker &mdash; management situation.  It showed up as a hostile attitude in many cases.  On the other hand, those who are attacking public enterprise such as the special interest groups, farming, banking, industry and commerce, are living off very substantial grants, aids and incentives. They are up and then down; they get substantial payments to assist them so that they can compete internationally.  A kind of slanging match goes on with these special interest groups who are always having a go at the public enterprises. Even the biggest Irish private sector firms get many hand-outs.  One would begin to wonder if there is any such thing as a private company seeing how much assistance they get.  They are involved in naturally sheltered activities just as much as the public enterprises.  There must be a dialogue on the whole question of the function of public enterprises.  When you set up a body such as Bord Gáis Éireann you should see that they are not &ldquo;knocked&rdquo; by people having a special interest.  Where they propose initiatives these should be considered, not in the context that there might be a loss situation but in the context of how good the service is in providing for the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>There are many people who would like to rewrite the history of the Irish public enterprises.  I should like to see a revitalisation of existing Irish enterprises, not only in the public sector but also in the private sector and an end to the ideological argument about public enterprise. This country cannot survive without having a mixed economy.  The way to assist that is to give a little but more freedom and autonomy instead of the day to day Government interference that normally exists side-by-side with the running of public enterprises.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann are doing very well at present but the moment they make some sort of a mistake, we will have people from the private side being very critical.  Anybody who supports public enterprise would not object to seeking major reforms in relation to those public enterprises.  Everybody wants to see <Col N="1606" /> them become more efficient and dynamic.  People have worked to build them up from the very bottom on behalf of the public and there would be great resentment naturally towards people wanting to take over the profitable sides while leaving the loss sectors lying there.</P>
    <P>I should like to say for the benefit of Bord Gáis Éireann that they are going to be in the same position as everybody else. There is a need for a critical look at the public enterprises and they need to take a critical look at themselves.  They will have to acknowledge their own shortcomings as well as their achievements. They will have to identify their strengths and their weaknesses and they will also have to look to opportunities lost and renew their efforts where they did not fulfil their tasks as well as they should.</P>
    <P>With regard to workers and the problems in the Dublin Gas Company, I should like to say it is always a very sad occasion when workers are faced with the fact that they have to be laid off. Naturally, it builds up emotion and hostility when you have been working for 20 years or 30 years and suddenly you are called to a halt by the deeds of somebody else and you are not directly responsible for them.  It is a harrowing experience. Workers should not be afraid of change. I do not think they are afraid of change; what they are afraid of is being put out of existence as workers.  This is what all the cries are about from people with a vested interest.  We have heard quotes from them about public enterprise but none of them examined the 21 public enterprises to see how they are doing and the contribution they are making to the nation.</P>
    <P>The private sector are always complaining about the amount of money that goes into public enterprise to keep it going but they should consider the grant incentives, the rescue operations, the reequipment grants and modernisation grants for machinery.  You can actually get a grant to put people out of work in private enterprise.  If some big company like Guinness come in and get a grant to help them towards keeping the export trade going well, they introduce this new <Col N="1607" /> plant.  The result is permanent jobs are gone forever because they have to lay off people when new technology is introduced and the work can be done by push button.  Companies like that have been very good employers and have been very honourable people in dealing with their employees.  They are in the private enterprise system where if you run into this kind of situation you are given grants which ultimately will lead to the elimination of jobs.  I cannot see any difference between public enterprise getting the assistance and help that is actually doled out to private enterprise who usually end up in liquidation after a history of start-ups, close downs, redundancies and so on.  The people who built up the public enterprise had to start from the bottom and work their way up, whereas many private enterprises get assistance before they get off the ground.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard mentioned the question of hidden subsidies, the whole question of industries being subsidised through their energy supplies being subsidised for example, the gas supplied to them.  I would not have any objection to that if I thought it was going to help the economy.  What happens about the cry of private enterprises to take over places that are doing well?  If these ever became private enterprises, would they expect the same thing?  Would one expect private enterprise to get the gas at a subsidised price?  I would not object to such a subsidy provided everybody understood it was going to be an extra burden on the taxpayer and that when the reports came out and showed a loss as a result of the subsidy in the performance of An Bord Gáis we would not begin to complain that public enterprise was not working. On condition that everybody understands that if you start subsidising energy to industries you also have to recognise the burden placed on the taxpayer and on the particular public enterprise that was giving this subsidised energy, I would not oppose such a subsidy.</P>
    <P>I believe the report is the best the committee could come out with and they <Col N="1608" /> were able to come out with a good report because the performance of the Irish gas board was good.  They are a relatively new enterprise and, as a consequence, they are still going through their growing pains.  I trust that over the years they will be given the chance to develop.  I am all for continuing to monitor the activities of public enterprises through joint committees. It is a bulwark in defence of the public enterprise to examine it on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The other bulwark in the private area will have to be in the context of the whole question of company law.  The State will have to get its protection somewhere in that, although it may not be possible to write it in.  There will have to be a review of the rights of the community with regard to private enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, as I said in my own contribution earlier, I welcome the opportunity of having this motion before the Seanad. It has been an invaluable opportunity because at various times over the years there has been limited time for discussing either energy policy or the development of Bord Gáis Éireann, or in fact the operational responsibilities of the board.  This is worthwhile because energy policy is obviously a major policy area for any Government and indeed for any country and even though there has been a great deal of uncertainty since the mid-seventies in particular in relation to energy sources and energy pricing the situation is somewhat more stable at present.  It is important of course, from a strictly energy policy point of view, that we are prepared to take the swings and round-abouts in relation to pricing which may <Col N="1609" /> happen at any time.  There is a great deal of unpredictability and uncertainty in energy pricing because of our reliance on the Middle East and the OPEC countries for oil supply but we should feel very proud of the steps we have taken since the seventies to switch from the use of oil as our main fuel.</P>
      <P>Various points were raised and I welcome the Senators' contributions.  Senator Fitzsimons mentioned &ldquo;take or pay&rdquo; as a possible basis for the distribution of gas. There is, of course, a quantity of gas which has a &ldquo;take or pay&rdquo; condition and if an undertaking is given in any one year then the gas can be taken in the following year.  The price in the following year is not necessarily dearer than at present but there is a very complex pricing formula which is related to the price of oil and the dollar exchange rate at a given time and there are in-built flexibilities and variables in that formula which can be invoked on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>On the question of compression, the compression needs mentioned are of course for the Marathon offshore operation and BGE are at present working on a compressor station to sustain supplies into the Dublin region.  It is obviously a matter of judgment from the point of view of Bord Gáis Éireann as to their compression needs in the pipeline and decisions have been taken in the last couple of months to build a compressor station and work is ongoing to ensure that adequate and sufficient volumes of gas are available to service the Dublin city demands.</P>
      <P>The question of comparing oil with coal or other energy sources does not arise because the reality is that if there was no gas available we would be importing oil in its place and there is a straight equation between the import of oil or the usage of gas.  The basis of the pricing policy is oil-related because oil would be the substituting energy source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding flexibility in relation to lowering the price for a limited period, I discussed this in some detail in my earlier contribution.  Obviously, pricing guidelines had to be spelled out and those were spelled out in 1983 to Bord Gáis and <Col N="1610" /> they are working in that framework.  A comment was made in relation to BGE's executives' time wasted travelling to and from Dublin.  I have no information in this regard but the head office is in Cork where the gas is brought ashore and neither the Government nor I intend moving the head office from its present location as we feel it is still the operational base for the gas coming on-shore.</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify some points on the question of compressed natural gas. It is not the same as bottled gas because bottled gas is a liquified gas and compressed natural gas containers are much stronger.  The pressure required is very high and the supply using this method depends on the economics of the operations. Obviously, we are very concerned about the vulnerability of the supply, given that we have only one pipeline. BGE have an emergency plan to take account of difficulties arising under this head and that will basically be an operational matter for them.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised in relation to new terms for offshore exploration.  In relation to the impact of this, I am sure the House will be aware that in September we published further clarification of the oil terms and I am satisfied that in the light of the terms which were then published we will see increased activity. We should not for a moment under-estimate the difficulties being experienced in the offshore oil industry, not just in this country but worldwide.  There is the temptation in this country to look inward at what is happening in our own offshore situation as opposed to what is happening to the industry worldwide.  In this context it is very important that we actually look at what is happening to the major multinational companies.  Major rationalisations have taken place; some companies have cut back their staff by thousands of personnel at all ranks from board level to workers on rigs because of the tremendous fall-out that has taken place in that industry in relation to the drop in oil prices.  Revenue is obviously away down in those companies and, as in any business involved in long term projections, those companies had major <Col N="1611" /> nightmares and headaches in relation to their long term revenue projections because of the decrease in the oil price. Twelve or 18 months ago it would have been a very brave man who would have said in forecasting oil prices that the price would have gone down to as low as $7 or $8 per barrel.  Looking at any economic criterion, any economic basis of making forward projections, we can realise when a price is reduced in that scale what it would do to any business.  That has created an enormous shake-out in the oil industry worldwide.  Notwithstanding that, we made the decision.  I said many months ago that I would not be forced to do so because of fluctuations in prices, that we would have to see if prices would stabilise.</P>
    <P>We did that.  We did our calculations over the summer months and we published the new terms.  While the response has been quite muted, I believe from my discussions with the oil companies, with major oil companies in particular, which are of enormous importance to this country, that the new terms were well received.  There are firm commitments for next year for three wells.  Discussions are ongoing in relation to further clarification of wells.  I believe that gas will become of major interest, whereas it has not been of major interest in the past five to ten years of exploration because of the Kinsale Head gas field being in a position to supply our needs.  With the depletion of the Kinsale Head field taking place at a very steady rate, I believe gas exploration will take an additional interest in the coming years.  The BP company discovered more gas in 1985 in Block 4818 and there is a possibility that they will go back to that particular block for further clarification of the reserves that are available there.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of national energy policy and direction of energy policy, it would be of enormous benefit if we were in a position to spell out what reserves we had available and to know that, when the network and the natural gas pipeline grid is in situ we will have a continuity of supply.  That is why I see <Col N="1612" /> gas exploration taking on a more important role than it has in the past number of years during which time it has been rather subdued.</P>
    <P>I certainly hope we will have more economic discoveries offshore.  We can be reasonably positive that we will.  The obvious importance is to get clarification of the field that showed potential in the Celtic Sea.  More work is possible in the near future on that.  Of major importance is the fact that we are working in the Department of Energy on an energy policy document.  One of the lessons learned from the seventies and early eighties is that there are so many variables and unpredictable aspects to energy policy that we have got to set out options and alternatives to ensure that, from the industry's point of view and from the domestic consumer's point of view, we have an energy policy that will be consistent, that gives us some guarantees on prices and that does not leave us as a nation wide open to dramatic increases in prices which would have enormously bad effects on our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senator Ferris and his colleagues for the time and the opportunity to discuss what I consider to be a very important aspect of energy policy &mdash; the whole question of Bórd Gáis Éireann. I commend the committee again on an excellent report.  I look forward to working with the Seanad in the future on energy policy.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1983</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 14 October, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft order before the House provides for amendments to the list of investments in <Col N="1613" /> which trust funds may be deposited unless forbidden by the deed of trust.  Although some trust deeds permit a wide range of investments, other are restricted to those on the authorised list.  In order to provide a wide range of suitable investments the list is amended when appropriate.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, the Minister for Finance may vary, by order, the list of trustee investments by addition or deletion after a draft of the order has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and approved by each House. The Act requires that the following referees must be consulted in regard to the terms of the draft order before it is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas:</P>
      <P>A Judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice; the Governor of the Central Bank; the Public Trustee; the Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee; the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland; the President of the Stock Exchange &mdash; Irish.</P>
      <P>These referees have been consulted and have raised no objections to the proposed order.  The present draft order provides for three additions to the list &mdash; interest-bearing deposits in two banks: Ansbacher &amp; Company Limited and Smurfit Paribas Bank Limited, and also units of Bank of Ireland Gilt and Bond Fund.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank have recommended that trustee status should be granted to the two banks involved.  The bank use the following criteria when assessing the suitability of a licensed bank for trustee status: the institution should be of high standing, have satisfactory capital levels, have a satisfactory record of compliance with Central Bank licensing and supervisory standards and have gross assets and gross domestic assets of at least £25 million in each case.  The gilt and bond fund's policy is such that it invests only in securities authorised for trustee investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft order before the House also provides for the deletion from the list of <Col N="1614" /> deposit accounts with Royal Trust Company (Ireland) Limited which was formerly Royal Trust (Ireland) Limited.  The bank ceased banking operations when its parent, a Canadian trust company, decided to wind up operations here as part of a rationalisation programme.  No depositors or other creditors lost funds through this move as the bank was both profitable and solvent.  I am satisfied that these amendments to the list of authorised investments are appropriate.  I commend the motion for approval by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this motion. As the Minister has stated the order is to provide a wide range of suitable investments. The list is amended where it is appropriate and that is very important. My only concern is that there might be a loss of funds to the depositors.  I understand from the Minister's speech that no depositors or other creditors lost funds through this move as the bank was both profitable and solvent.  According to newspaper reports over the past few days, bank profits are enormous.  I spoke on this issue last Wednesday with regard to the entire banking system in this country. While I know this motion does not directly relate to what I said, I would still like to draw the attention of the Minister to the banking system.  Some alternative facilities should be provided in order to accommodate the business sector in this country, but that is not directly related to this motion which I endorse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. There are a few general comments I wish to make in relation to it.  I have been encouraged to make these observations in view of the two institutions that are being added to the list, Ansbacher &amp; Co. Ltd. and Smurfit Paribas Bank Ltd. There is a continental ring about both these institutions.  I believe they are German and French.  I presume Ansbacher are a German bank.  I believe the prevailing rate of interest charged by the German banking system to its customers is less than 6 per cent at the moment, which is approximately one-third of the <Col N="1615" /> rate that the licensed commercial banks charge for operations in this country.  I want to give every advantage to Ansbacher arriving on this scene.  I would like the Minister to comment on what restrictions are being removed.  Are there restrictions to prevent Ansbacher from making their German Marks available to the businessman in this country at the German rate?  If not, why not?  I would not be surprised if we are obliged to make this order in relation to these two banks because of our involvement in the EC.  I never cease to wonder as far as banking and interest rates are concerned that, while it would be reasonable to assume that we should have all the benefits of membership, this is one area where we have failed to gain any advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel we are doing this because it is part of our obligation as members of the EC.  Perhaps the Minister will tell me if I am wrong in that.  If we are why are there other aspects of banking to which the business community are denied access?  It is our membership of the EC which is responsible for having this matter before us today.  There should always be balance.  It was always the intention that there would be fair and open competition for everybody.  If we are providing a facility to a German and a French bank which was not available prior to the making of this order, I am asking the Minister, that having extended that facility, are there restrictions on these two EC banks from providing the entire range of banking facilities to the Irish community which they provide to EC citizens in their countries?  If that is not the position there is something seriously wrong and perhaps we should consider rejecting the making of this order.  There is far too much of a grey area here which has existed for far too long.  We are extending a facility here by virtue of our obligation as members of the European Community.  Restrictions should not exist on one side or the other. <Col N="1616" /> This will become a very live topic when we begin to discuss the Single European Act.</P>

      <P>I am glad the House has welcomed the motion. Senator Lynch mentioned the question of the deletion which arises in the motion. I can assure the House that there is no problem there.  The bank in question made a normal commercial decision in an honourable fashion and discharged its obligations in winding down its operations.</P>
      <P>On the question of bank profits generally this is an issue which perhaps should be discussed by the Houses of the Oireachtas in all its phases and manifestations. We are merely touching on a very minor aspect of banking in relation to this motion.  There are different views in relation to bank profits.  Some people look on bank profits as being an indication of the strength of an economy. Others will say that banks need to make profits to ensure that they can discharge their responsibility to their shareholders but, more importantly, that they can build up their reserves.  On the other hand there are people who will suggest that bank profits are excessive.  It is too wide a subject to get into because whatever side one is on there is a contrary point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer to take the view that where an economy is recovering it is an indication of that recovery to see banks having substantial profits and engaging in wider expansion operations which some of our banking groups have done. <Col N="1617" /> However, it is a very broad issue and rather unrelated to this motion.  Perhaps it is worthy of full debate in the House. I will be glad to come back for such a debate if the House so decides.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard referred to the two new additions to the list.  Despite the name &mdash; perhaps from a family point of view there may have been Teutonic origins at some stage &mdash; the bank in question, Ansbacher, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Ansley family trust which is an American concern.  Effectively the headquarters are in America but Ansbacher &amp; Co. Ltd. is registered and licensed here.  The other bank, Smurfit Paribas Bank, is in fact a joint venture between Smurfits and the French bank Paribas which is the thirty-first largest bank in the world and the fifth largest in France.</P>
    <P>On the question of the type of business these banks do there should be an understanding that they are commercial banks. They are not retail banks in the sense of the major associated banks.  That is the correct name for the big banks with branches throughout the country.  These banks are not involved in what is referred to in the UK as high street operations. They do not have branches around the country, they do not have current accounts, their main business is in dealing in large scale operations with the commercial and business sector.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard touched on the question of interest rates.  We should be a little careful here when we compare the money market rates, for instance in Germany, as opposed to the rates here.  The important thing to be borne in mind is that there is no restriction on business in borrowing abroad.  Of course they carry the exchange rate risk.  That is a factor that has to be borne in mind, and obviously is borne in mind, by business and commercial operations in deciding where they will arrange their borrowings.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in the most recent report of the Central Bank there is a reference to the strong shift in the currency composition of bank lending. There is the observation that in the seven and a half months to mid-August of this year lending in Irish Punts fell while foreign <Col N="1618" /> currency denominated credit increased by a sum of £442 million.  They state that this at least in part reflected the significant difference between IR£s and D.M. interest rates.  The point raised by Senator Howard is valid in that in fact already from the business point of view there has been some shift to borrowing in foreign currencies.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Cathaoirleach, wants me to go into the whole question of the interest rate situation here and the problems associated with it.  It is a little bit far from this particular motion.  The House is probably fully aware of the impact of public sector borrowing on the domestic market and the effect that has on interest rates.  It is also fully aware of the effect of any proposals to increase public sector borrowing and the impact that would have on domestic interest rates.  It is no harm to take the opportunity to reiterate the absolute relationship that exists between public sector borrowing and the level of domestic interest rates.  It is very easy to draw the conclusion that if public sector borrowing is curtailed it will have the impact of bringing down interest rates.  On the other hand those who suggest that there should be substantial increases in such borrowing must do so in the full knowledge that it will probably force interest rates up.</P>
    <P>I have chased after a few of the hares that have been raised here.  The debate brings home the need for a full scale discussion in relation to banking and interest rates generally.  It would be very useful to have such a discussion in the House at some stage.  I conclude by reiterating the purpose of this motion &mdash; to provide a wider range of authorised investments for trustees.  That is essentially what we are about.  Obviously the additions which are now proposed have been carefully checked out and are put forward in the full knowledge and confidence that they have passed muster with the resident bodies.  From that point of view it is, I believe, in the interest of everybody that the motion go through and that these particular additions be included.</P>

      <P>I would like to comment on this very interesting and worthwhile report which examines the position in Ireland in a comprehensive way.  When I get around to dealing with the recommendations I will find myself in general agreement with them.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, freedom of establishment for insurance companies within the EC has been with us for some considerable time.  There are many foreign companies operating in Ireland.  Of the 35 companies operating here, 29 or 30 of them are foreign companies.  Many of these are huge companies with very big resources with far more resources than the Irish companies.  For that reason they are able to compete in the sense of being able to stand minor and major shocks and are able to cope with years where the claims experiences are very adverse.  They can take these things in their stride in a way which is much harder for relatively small Irish companies to do. Approximately 50 per cent of non-life premiums at present are going to foreign companies.  What we must be concerned about is that with the new directive which allows companies to operate here without being actually established here there is a serious danger that the 50 per cent going to non-Irish companies will increase further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1620" /> Not only have foreign companies an advantage in competing fairly but there is also the danger &mdash; I am not saying they necessarily do it or do it very often &mdash; that they can do what is the equivalent of dumping.  They can give very competitive rates.  This is particularly possible and useful so far as insurance companies are concerned because they normally have a kind of portfolio of policy and claim experiences.  If it so happens that they find their experiences in other countries in fire, public liability or whatever insurance is very good at a particular period, then they are able to offer very low premiums in other countries.  In that kind of situation a company doing business in many countries throughout the world would be able to offer extremely low premiums and rates in Ireland in certain sectors.  This, of course, would have a very serious effect on the Irish companies.  Without them doing anything wrong they would be able to offer rates in particular areas at particular times which would have a very serious effect on Irish companies which are operating in Ireland only.</P>
    <P>One of the problems Irish companies have in facing up to the prospect of the new directive is the fact that they have gone through very difficult times in the past few years.  This was caused among other things as a result of what happened with the PMPA and the ICI.  What happened was that these companies for a few years before they went out of business were offering rates which were totally unrealistic and it was because they were offering rates that were totally unrealistic that they eventually went out of business. It also had the effect that other companies had to try to compete with them. Their rates went down, not as far as the PMPA or ICI, but down to such an extent that they lost business and found themselves making no profit for many years. The second effect of that situation was that a levy was applied which again undermined their finances.</P>
    <P>The Irish insurance industry is facing up to the prospect of the new directive in what can only be described as a weakened condition.  This makes it very difficult for <Col N="1621" /> them to face up to this potentially dangerous situation.  If the foreign companies decided, deliberately or otherwise, to under cut their rates, they would certainly completely destabilise the insurance industry.  This ultimately, of course would have a very serious effect.</P>
    <P>One of the dangers is that new firms coming in here would start, without examining the situation, by charging premiums or rates which would be comparable with what they were charging in their own country, not realising that claims are very much higher in Ireland than they are in other countries.  By doing this, of course, they would again destabilise the market.  Subsequently when they realise their rates were too low they would naturally bring them up to a realistic rate.  By that time they might have had a very serious effect on the native companies and put some of them out of business.  These stronger companies would put up their rates and would get the very much larger slice of the business.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again something which seems to be overlooked by many people when discussing insurance &mdash; the imperative connection between claims and premiums.  For more than a year or two, premiums cannot be kept down if claims are not kept down.  To look at it another way, if claims go up and are higher in Ireland than they are in other countries premiums will have to go up also.  That is one of the things that has to be continually borne in mind when talking about the necessity of bringing down the cost of insurance or bringing down premiums.  It can only be done if claims go down and claims are very much higher in Ireland than in most other countries. It was because of trying to ignore this fact that we had the position of the two companies who went out of business. We have to bear in mind the possible effects of the introduction of new foreign companies who will not initially, at any rate, be aware of the fact that claims in this country are very much higher than in most other countries.</P>
    <P>Having said that it is not merely a question of the insurance companies &mdash;<Col N="1622" /> some people would not lie awake at night worrying about whether they stayed in business or went out of business but these companies play a big part in the financial and economic life of the country.  When any of them go out of business there is a very serious effect on employment.  At present, there are something like 5,000 people employed in insurance in Ireland. If the new directive is availed of where people can do business in insurance without having offices here it would be a situation where very few people would be employed to do that business as compared with the number who are employed at present.</P>
    <P>That change would also have an effect on the funds available for investment in the national economy.  At present these are very strictly controlled.  Ninety per cent of the funds have to be invested in Ireland.  It would be impossible to control the funds of companies operating from abroad.  In very rough figures something like 1,000 million funds are generated by insurance of which 90 per cent is invested in Ireland.  That could be changed very much in the future.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are all kinds of other relatively minor spin-off benefits to the country for example, benefits to areas where local offices operate.  Apart from employment the amount of money spent by these offices in rates, power, upkeep and so on, is of important benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>Looking at the impact the directive will have, there is little doubt but that Irish insurance companies and, consequently, the economy, will be adversely affected. What we have to look at is the question of how far they will be affected and what can be done to limit the effect.  It would be unrealistic to expect that it will have no effect whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The form of the directive is very important. It is very important to make sure that the graft is done in such a way so as to avoid as far as possible, adverse effects on the industry.  It will be very important to have a derogation to allow the industry to recover from the effects I mentioned earlier to recover from the number of years where companies have been forced <Col N="1623" /> to operate at uneconomic rates because of the unrealistic rates quoted by the companies who went out of business and also because of the fact of having to pay levies to pay for the collapse of these companies.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters the Government should bear in mind in approaching this problem.  I would like to quote from the report made by the Irish Insurance Association in relation to this directive.</P>
    <P>At page 20, they state:</P>
    <P>(i)  A substantial derogation must be negotiated for the Irish market.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Both established and non-established insurers must compete on equal terms.  This would mean that both should be subjected to the same general rules and laws and in particular laws or rules regulating investments abroad (e.g. Exchange Control) contributions towards guarantee funds, government levies, etc.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Rules in the Directive and-or our own legislation implementing it must restrict the ability of services insurers to use persons established in Ireland to carry out certain duties on their behalf.  In particular, we feel that a services insurer should not be able to delegate to such persons power to settle claims on its behalf.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Provisions must be incorporated in the Directive to deal with cases of dumping or unfair competition.  The Directive, we would suggest, should define what constitutes dumping &mdash; unfair competition in the insurance sector.</P>
    <P>These are all matters which the Government should bear in mind and every effort should be made to ensure that they are observed.  If that is done, some of the more serious effects of the directive on services could, if not entirely avoided, at least be minimised.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that insurance companies coming in here from abroad may not realise at first the high level of claims.  This is something which is of course a fact of life &mdash; and it certainly has <Col N="1624" /> been a fact of life.  The Government could play some part in trying to deal with this problem.  There are a number of reasons why claims are high.  It is something that has gradually grown up and norms have been established which are difficult to interfere with at present. These norms are, unfortunately from the point of view of people who pay premiums, approximately twice as high as in the UK.  The awards of damages are, by and large, something of the order of twice what they are in the UK even though they have varied over the years.  The damages usually have a bearing on the costs and consequently, both the damages and costs are very much higher than in other countries.</P>
    <P>There is also another reason why insurance is so high, and that is because of uninsured drivers.  This has been estimated as being something of the order of 20 per cent.  In other words, 20 per cent of the premium paid by the motorist who does pay insurance represents the subsidy he has to pay to make allowances for the number of people who do not insure their cars.</P>
    <P>The Government have introduced a Bill which will probably have some effect on the high awards of damages and costs. It has taken some steps in relation to uninsured drivers and as far as they go they will be very helpful.  It is essential that the powers taken by the Government should be pursued vigorously by the Garda to ensure that everybody on the road at present is insured.  With the necessity of having a tax disc it should be reasonably simple to ensure that anyone who is not insured should not be able to continue to drive.  This is a very serious matter and something which I am hopeful will be improved dramatically in the next year or two.  Something like 20 per cent of people in Ireland are uninsured compared with something like 3 per cent in other European countries.  That is one area in which we can look forward to a very considerable improvement.</P>
    <P>In general, the recommendations made by the Joint Committee are very good and helpful and I am in general agreement with them.  The Government <Col N="1625" /> can do something very positive in relation to recommendations Nos. 5 and 6. Recommendation No. 5 states that:</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to the provision of tax relief on the annual increase in the minimum statutory insolvency margin.</P>
    <P>This is a technical matter but it is very important to insurance companies that when they have to put by funds in reserve to deal with the solvency margin they should not be taxed on that.  It is not something that will go towards paying out anything to shareholders or anything like that; it is a technical necessity.  It would be very helpful if the Government could look at that recommendation.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 6 states:</P>
    <P>The extension to the non-life insurance industry of the 10 per cent corporation tax should be considered.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no reason why the same relief should not be shown to insurance companies as being shown at present to industrial manufacturing concerns. This is particularly so if the insurance industry is to be given every opportunity and encouragement to extend its activities to other countries, in which case it would be the same as exporting goods.  In these circumstances, they should have the same treatment as manufacturing firms.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the joint committee are extremely useful, with which in general I agree fully.  I hope the Minister will give them very close attention and implement as many of them as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senator Ryan in commending the recommendations and the points set down by the joint committee.  In producing this report the joint committee have done a very good day's work.  The report was produced on 18 December 1985 and unfortunately it was virtually 12 months lying around before it finally got into this forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report it is quite obvious that the alarm bells are sounding and that <Col N="1626" /> there is a certain amount of panic, worry and anxiety within the insurance industry in relation to the liberalisation measures proposed.  As Senator Ryan said, the measures in question are Council Directive 73/240 which abolishes restrictions on freedom of establishment in business of direct insurance other than life insurance and Council directives 78/473 on the issue of Community co-insurance. There is a proposal for a directive on the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct insurance, other than life insurance, and laying down specific provisions for the freedom to provide services.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously, the joint committee met all of the interested bodies, the representatives of the insurance industry and the various departments involved in monitoring and regulating insurances. There seems to be general unanimity, having heard all the submissions, that the insurance industry as a whole is far from prepared to meet the anticipated onslaught that comes when there is deregulation, when barriers and prohibitions are taken down and when there is liberalisation.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that one of the main reasons for the UKs entry into the EC was because the insurance industry in the United Kingdom saw in Europe as a whole, and in Ireland as a component of the European Community, vast opportunities to expand their insurance business. They are the leading lights in this field of enterprise.  Quite rightly, everybody in Ireland fears the accession to the Irish market of the UK companies.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry has been a good one in Ireland.  It has been good in terms of the service it has provided and of the high degree of employment it has provided. The insurance business in the Community is vitally important also.  The report points out that:</P>
    <P>By 1980, the EC accounted for some 30% of total world insurance business and had a growth rate above the OECD average over a period of 20 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> Insurance, therefore is of very considerable significance and importance in the UK and of very limited significance in other countries &mdash; for example, in Greece.  There are great variations within the Community.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, as in the UK, the industry has been much less regulated than, for example, in Germany.  In most member countries, the insurance industry is well entrenched.  This has raised many difficult problems and conflict of interest in the context of the Community's objective to bring about harmonisation and co-ordination of laws and practices to facilitate freedom of establishment and services. Before Ireland's accession to the Community, the main statutes governing the operation of insurance here were the Insurance Company Act, 1909, the Insurance Act, 1936, and the Insurance Act, 1964.  The 1936 Act gave the Minister power to set up a company to which it would be obligatory for direct insurers to offer their non-life business by way of reinsurance.  The Insurance Act, 1964, which was again supplemented by the Insurance No. 2 Act, 1983, provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the establishment of a compensation fund to cover the claims and liabilities of insolvent insurers in respect of Irish policy holders.</P>
    <P>Legislation also enables the Minister to control premium rates.  Section 107 of the Insurance Act, 1936, provides that the Minister may fix maximum rates of premium in employers' liability and mechanically propelled vehicle business. To date the provisions of this latter Act have resulted in control being exercised over fire and motor insurance rates.  It is quite obvious that the coming into operation, in 1976, of this directive was followed by a large increase in the number of companies writing non-life business. The high interest rates in the late seventies and early eighties, the escalation of insurance claims, the increases in the level of personal injury awards, the ridiculous awards being made by juries and the rapid technological change, all of this has brought a great collective pressure on the insurance industry.  It is obvious that <Col N="1628" /> the insurance industry has been further weakened by poor trading results in recent years coupled with inflation and all the cost factors I mentioned earlier. Therefore, it is with pleasure that I support the recommendations made by the joint committee who, having heard the submissions from all of the interested parties, have set down a number of very important, very laudable and very necessary recommendations which should be taken into consideration by the Minister in relation to the overall regulation, monitoring and administration of the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>There is a case for a derogation for Ireland in respect of the draft services directive.  This should continue to be pressed in the instances of the council. The Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Department should keep their regulatory structures under constant review in order to ensure that these are adequate to discharge their monitoring and surveillance responsibilities, particularly in conditions of free provision of services.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 3 is important, in that the Department of Industry and Commerce should ensure that annual returns are promptly published.  The point highlighted by Senator Ryan concerning the extension to the non-life insurance industry of the 10 per cent corporation tax should also be considered. We owe a debt of gratitude to the insurance industry, to the people who have administered it and managed it.  It has provided a good service but it is obvious that in its present state it is too feeble to face the onslaught which we can anticipate when these regulations and liberalisation measures come into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I have to disagree with the two previous speakers about the insurance position and about this derogation, which the Government should not be looking for.  The sooner these people come in the better. Insurance, which should be a basic service to business, at a low cost, has become a very emotive issue due to spiralling premium costs and increasingly restricted <Col N="1629" /> availability.  People who run businesses or cars have a lot on their plates.  They have to cope with the consequences of endemic recession, including poor demand, grinding taxation, high costs and crushing rates of interest.  This week we have had a grim reminder of our interest rate problems, with the prospect of more to follow.  Why should we have to cope with unreasonable insurance costs on top of all that?</P>
      <P>Insurance cover for a business has now become a major issue due to a number of inter-related factors.  Firstly, the insurance industry in Ireland was cocooned in a protected home market for 40 years prior to EC membership.  In the years preceding our accession to the EC and the years immediately afterwards, our insurance companies carried out no strategic planning for changing circumstances. When other EC-based insurance companies opened Irish offices in 1976 we had the response of cut throat competition among insurance companies for a few years which Senator Ryan spoke about.  I agree that cut price insurance is not the answer; the answer I am looking for is a reasonable price insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This phase was followed by panic reduction on the part of the insurance companies to mounting losses.  The pendulum swung the other way.  People found themselves at the receiving end of massive premium increases.  A further EC development is pending.  The EC Draft Services Directive is due for implementation in 1988, which would enable any EC based insurance company to accept business here without the need to open a branch office in Ireland.  I agree with that.  One of the big faults of the insurance companies is that there are too many offices.  We talk about the Irish industry.  What we mean by the Irish industry?  Are we talking about our own Irish companies or about all the English companies and Swiss companies which have come in here?  My heart bleeds for the insurance companies when I hear people complaining about their mounting losses and the sad position they are in. This Government has offices in Setanta House.  Around the corner is Norwich <Col N="1630" /> Union and Irish Life.  Who owns all the big offices in this country?  The insurance companies.  They are not Irish insurance companies, there may be some but very few.</P>
    <P>Do they deserve this protection?  I do not think so.  If I ran my business in the way the insurance companies run theirs I would deserve to go under.  It is time we had a completely different tune from the insurance companies, and an end to their attempt to throw the blame for their own failure on to everyone else.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned two companies one of whom was the PMPA, who caused havoc in this country when they went into liquidation.  They were driven to that for the sole reason that they had a network of garages which is no part of an insurance company.  They are the only insurance company in this country with garages.  I do not know of any insurance in the UK which has garages.  PMPA also went into money lending and they caused havoc to both sections.  It is time we heard the last of PMPA and their troubles. They are now back in business.  They were able to close one day and open the following day.  They still did not get rid of their garages.  They have ten garages at present and they are losing a lot of money.  I am in the motor business and they are not competition to me and never have been.  I have no axe to grind personally. But I see the damage they are doing to the people in business and I saw what they did with their money lending office and their insurance and as a result of that everybody is levied today.  There is a levy on every insurance company, paying off some of the debts &mdash; only some of the debts &mdash; of the PMPA.  That will continue for many years to come.  The sooner we get these other companies to come in and create competition the better.  The Insurance Corporation of Ireland also caused havoc.  They ran their business reasonably well in this country but they had offices in the UK and they were known to take risks that any other company would not take.  They were a soft touch for anyone who wanted a dicey claim or a dicey risk cover.</P>
    <P>Of the number of claims which reach <Col N="1631" /> legal proceedings only 20 reach the court and they are decided by a jury.  About 98 per cent of claims are settled out of court. For that reason, whatever one might say about the legal system, to the extent that some of the complaints are justified, it is not a major factor in the picture painted in the report as is the essential problem of the high cost of insurance.  The report acknowledges that there are many factors contributing to the high costs.  It sets out some very interesting conclusions.  It is a very interesting report.  It combines a lot of essential information and it makes its recommendations.  Insurance companies as well as small businesses would welcome a determined effort to address the problems which are leading to high insurance and they would be very glad to co-operate in every way.  Insurance, which should be a basic service to business at a low cost, has become a very emotive issue due to spiralling premium costs and increasingly restricted availability. People with businesses to run have a lot on their plates.</P>
    <P>The second factor affecting the insurance issue is the growth in what some people would call litigation consciousness and what others would describe as the gravy train mentality. That may be attributed correctly to my own County Kerry.  The late John A. Costello, a senior counsel, a very able man, had a very warm spot in his heart for the people of Kerry because he said they were one of the greatest counties in Ireland for litigation.  In Kerry they had no greater desire for litigation than the insurance companies.  In many cases the insurance companies, notwithstanding the fact that about 99 per cent of cases are not reaching the courts, have incurred heavy legal costs before they settled their cases often on the steps of the courthouse. Much of this could be avoided.</P>
    <P>It could be avoided, in the first instance, by simplifying motor insurance. I know all motor insurance companies have to protect themselves and, the law being very tricky, they have to cover all loopholes.  However, we have a system whereby you fill a proposal form, you are <Col N="1632" /> quoted a premium, you get a temporary certificate, you pay your money.  The temporary certificate varies, depending on the company, from 15 days to one month.  Before the policy reaches you, which is usually five to six months afterwards, you get a number of these temporary certificates and, while all this is going on, each of these transactions has passed through their legal department.  I do not think it is beyond the legal profession to devise a system whereby a person could go in and have the particulars filled in on a card, as when you apply for a taxation disc, and have provision on the back of the card for a record so that, if the person has an accident, it is recorded.  When that person renews his or her insurance at the end of that year, the record will be there.  All the legal jargon and all the documents are unnecessary.  There is enough protection for the companies.  They know all the Acts and they could cut out a lot of this. That would help to make insurance cheaper and easier to get.</P>
    <P>In other countries they have a knock-for-knock system, not the knock-for-knock system we have here but a system where there is no fault, and no matter who has the accident the company pays and there are no legal expenses.  That is all recorded and when the person who caused the accident goes to renew his or her insurance, the company can assess the driving record, the risk and the cost of an insurance.  I know about claims because I am in the motor business and I have been in court very often giving evidence on the mechanics of cars as a witness for insurance companies or for the other side, either for the person who caused the accident or the person who suffered in the accident.  I know that in some cases they could settle a claim for a couple of hundred pounds.  The point is that, if they repudiate liability and go to court and win, they could spend thousands of pounds trying to save a couple of hundred pounds.  That to me is crazy.</P>
    <P>The feeling has grown, too, that if you have grounds for a personal injuries claim, however spurious those grounds might be, then you are on a winner.  You <Col N="1633" /> lodge your claim, you pile on the alleged injuries and the amount of damages sought and you threaten legal action in the belief that the whole system is on your side and the insurance company will pay up rather than go to court.  That is an irresponsible attitude but it has grown in recent years because it is seen to deliver.</P>
    <P>I know of a recent case where a taxi driver skidded into the back of a car at traffic lights.  He broke the tail lamp lens but did not do any other damage.  He got out and asked the other driver if he was all right and he was.  He showed him the damage and said he would pay for it.  He asked the passenger if she was all right. The passenger said she was but a week afterwards he got a solicitor's letter and there was a claim for £10,000 for whiplash. The woman said she had suffered whiplash.  The taxi driver said this was only put on and that the least they should do was to get her examined medically and go through the formula.  He did not want to lose his no claims bonus.  The solicitors' letters started flying, the barristers came into it and then the writs were issued and the company settled for £7,000.  There is no doubt whatever that the person who succeeded in that claim did so because the insurance company settled on the steps of the courthouse as they did not know what it might cost them if they went in.</P>
    <P>That is an appalling situation and it is one of the reasons I support the abolition of the jury system.  The legal profession are against that.  It is only natural that they will not deprive themselves of a lot of revenue and business so they turn their back on the abolition of the jury system.</P>
    <P>The third main factor in the insurance business is the courts system.  If you want an indication of our increasing litigation consciousness, turn to page 23 of the report.</P>
    <P>There has certainly been a major increase in the number of High Court jury actions disposed of in recent years. In 1978 there was 1,555; in 1982 there was 2,328, in 1983 there was 3,107; and in 1984 there was 5,725.</P>
    <P>Although these statistics encompass all jury actions disposed of by the High <Col N="1634" /> Court and there is no breakdown available of the various categories of cases, it is reasonable to assume that Liability cases figure prominently in increased jury workload of the High Court.</P>
    <P>There is also an extent to which increase in the jury caseload disposed of reflects an increase in the number of High Court Judges.</P>
    <P>However, the three and a half fold increase in jury cases between 1978 and 1984 mainly reflects a substantial underlying increase in the general level of litigation.</P>
    <P>There are those who would say that the Courts system is a licence to print money for the legal profession.</P>
    <P>Certainly our own work on this report indicated a need for the complete overhaul in the way the Courts conduct their civil business.  The wigs, the gowns and the antediluvian Court procedures have no inherent right to preservation order against the 20th century.</P>
    <P>I would oppose derogation for these companies. They are long enough in business. There are only a few Irish companies but there are many other companies and I would welcome the competition.  I would welcome also insurance at a reasonable rate.  A young girl who buys a secondhand car &mdash; it is her first car &mdash; and goes to an insurance company.  She has a full driving licence and she is asked for £1,400, almost more than the car cost.  That is one of the examples.  Motor insurance is prohibitive in this country.  Unless something is done about it people will continue to drive with no insurance.  There is no doubt that the numbers will increase.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is a disc on the windscreen is a help, to a certain extent, but then on the other hand it is misleading. I often wonder if it is the correct thing to do.  I do not think it is correct to have a disc on the windscreen.  I discussed the matter with the Department of the Environment.  When that disc is on the windscreen the person who owns the car and to whom the disc is issued may be the only driver who is covered by insurance.  A member of the family or a <Col N="1635" /> friend can get a loan of the car.  There is a Garda check point; the Garda look at the disc on the windscreen and say the car is insured and wave it on.  The person driving the car may not be insured at all. The owner of the car should have the disc in his pocket.  If he has other drivers named in the policy they should have a disc in their pockets.  Then there would not be any misleading of the authorities by having this disc on the windscreen.</P>
    <P>Another practice prevalent in Dublin is stealing these discs from the windscreens. They had already been stealing tax discs and now with the stolen insurance disc which they can stick up on their car they have <i>carte blanche</i> to drive so far as the law is concerned until they have an accident and find out then that their liability is not covered.  This matter should be reconsidered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make some brief comments on this very important topic.  The joint committee devoted considerable attention to this report.  The only point on which I disagree with them is on the point of derogation.  I do not share their view that we should be pressing for derogation.  We are entitled to have the Irish insurance industry compete.  It is unfortunate that in the past five years a number of major insurance companies have folded up or have become insolvent.  It is unfortunate that the person who is paying for insurance cover has to keep the lame dogs on the road also.  There is a special levy imposed to have a continuing salvage of the PMPA debacle.</P>

    <P>The difficulty with the ICI, which was owned by the Allied Irish Banks, is not completely settled and the onus is on the State, or indeed on some of the insurers, to subsidise that on-going saga.  As has been correctly mentioned by Senator Daly, the exorbitant fees that insurance brokers and insurance companies ask from young people is a farce when one considers that such a high percentage of the population are under 25.  I suppose the only young people who would be driving would be those between 18 and <Col N="1636" /> 25.  The cost of having these young people insured even if their names are only added to the family car insurance policy is prohibitive.  There is quite a difference in the cost of insurance premiums and loadings from one company to another. Some companies do not inflate the cost of the insurance premium if the young person involved has only a provisional licence but if he has a full licence and is under 25 the price shoots up.  I accept that if a young person had an accident and if it has been proved that additional costs had been incurred or that they have not been careful, the company are entitled to put on the appropriate loading but to penalise the complete population of young people in a money-grabbing exercise seems extraordinary.  This is one area where the young people need a clean break.</P>
    <P>It is difficult, especially in rural areas, to find employment.  The more active and dedicated people are prepared to take a job wherever they get it but if one lives in a rural area, in general there is no public transport and if they must get to their place of work they must provide themselves with transport, whether that be a car or motorbike.  As has been pointed out, it is possible for a young person to acquire a car and have it taxed without too much money being involved but when faced with a bill in excess of £1,000 for third party insurance, they would be in much difficulty.  The line should be drawn in this respect.  If the State is to underwrite these private companies it should move fully into the insurance industry and provide insurance cover for people in the category of third party and theft and have it part of the normal taxation system.  With computerisation this process should not necessarily incur additional costs on the Exchequer.  A simple statutory insurance cover such as third party could be part of the taxation code at no additional administrative cost to the State.  I am sure the Minister and his Department could work out something like that.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of jobs, clerical positions and so on, available in industries but at extraordinarily low wages, possibly <Col N="1637" /> no more than is paid under the social employment scheme or the work experience programme.  But if one is living in a rural area one cannot expect to find employment like that at the doorstep, a young person could not be expected to pay for accommodation out of such small wages.  It is possible for the family of a young person to buy for him an old car that would be in good mechanical order and at a reasonable price.  I hope the new Minister with responsibility for this area will devote his mind to reviewing commercial companies who are propped up by the State and who are ripping people off.  I hope he can devise a system that will give the youth of this country an equal break.</P>
    <P>The Joint committee in their consideration of this problem and indeed in their report have highlighted the areas they were concerned about.  They have made nine very important recommendations that are recorded in page 19 of the report.  I hope the Minister will be able to take those on board and consider them very carefully.  In its conclusion to this report the joint committee say and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee, conscious of the crucial role of non-life insurance within the financial services sector of the economy and of its importance in terms of employment and investment, views the prospect of the implementation in Ireland of freedom to provide services with concern.  The Committee believes that, even in the worst hypothesis as far as time-scale is concerned there is considerable scope for action by the industry to prepare itself to compete internationally, and to protect its share of the home market.  It is doubtful, however, that, starting from a weak base, the industry will, by its own unaided efforts, be able to gear itself for the competitive impact of a services regime.  For this reason, the Committee recommends that tax concessions already available to another services sector in Ireland and to non-life insurers in two of the Member States be extended to the Irish non-life <Col N="1638" /> sector.  In view of what is at stake, the Committee trusts that its recommendations will be given the most serious and sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>The joint committee have been very dedicated in their work and role.  This is report No. 24 and the problem with all these reports is in finding time in both the Dáil and this House to have them discussed adequately.  Nevertheless, that fact alone should not take from the importance of the work and the efforts of the joint committee to highlight the problems and to draw attention to the areas where, if we had greater harmonisation of the European laws, they would bring considerable benefits to the ordinary members of the Irish public.  I hope the work of the joint committee will not be lost on the Minister for State.  I certainly wish him well and we will give him the support he requires to improve the situation as far as insurance is concerned.</P>
    <P>It has been a very frustrating experience for many people who had the daunting and voluntary task of organising the social employment scheme and the Teamwork scheme in every county, parish and barony in this country.  Many of them experienced great difficulty in getting adequate public liability cover for their voluntary task force in order that schemes of public utility could be undertaken and carried out successfully.  It is most infuriating to find that sections of this industry rely so heavily on State assistance and subvention that they have endeavoured to milk the voluntary organisations with demands for exorbitant premiums to get the schemes under way. That frustrates the work of the Departments which have co-operated and joined together to put these schemes into operation. They have proved successful.  It is extraordinary that one sector of industry can play such a devastating role in frustrating the worth-while work of so many dedicated people, both civil servants and politicians, who have given thousands of young people a chance to set themselves up in business in Ireland.  They have introduced thousands of young people to <Col N="1639" /> the work ethic and work code and set them off on worth-while courses in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is much to be concerned with in the report of the joint committee dealing with the insurance.  The main causes of concern have been outlined by other speakers and I do not wish to dwell on them for long. I should like to point out that the matters of concern to the joint committee are very clearly expressed and it is only right that they should get serious consideration because all the indications are that in many ways we could be at a loss.</P>
      <P>It is true that in regard to membership of the EC Ireland could be an open hunting ground for these continental companies. We would be very much in the role of the small duck in the big pond. The committee expressed the view that it could be possible that these outside companies might cream off the best of the insurance business and leave the less profitable part of it to the home-based companies.</P>
      <P>Another point made in the report was the consequences of the outflow of capital from Ireland in the form of premiums, which would be injurious to the economy. I would point out that if services were provided from abroad without offices being opened up in the State that would result in a loss of employment for people engaged in the insurance industry.  Paragraph 34 of the report states:</P>
      <P>A matter of particular concern to the Committee is that provision should be made to guard against an excessive degree of selectivity on the part of insurers, to ensure that insurance is available, within reason, for all risks and not just for the good risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to go on any further on that point except to say I hope due consideration will be given to the items of concern noted by the joint committee. If this is the development which we as a member state of the EC cannot prevent, we should get a fair period of time in <Col N="1640" /> order to adjust and to gear the industry in Ireland to compete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senators who have contributed to this debate and indeed to the committee for drawing up the report.  It is regrettable we have not had an opportunity to discuss these recommendations earlier but I am glad, nevertheless, to be here now and perhaps they may be more relevant than ever in the light of recent developments in the EC, particularly in relation to the present hearing before the courts.</P>
      <P>Essentially the report of the joint committee relates to the draft non-life insurance services directive.  They noted with concern that the industry was unprepared for the opening-up of the Irish market in 1976 by the implementation of the first non-life establishment directive. The committee are exhorting the industry to &ldquo;accelerate and intensify the steps it is taking for the operation in a full services régime&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation is very appropriate at present.  The insurance industry must face up to the prospects of EC insurers doing business in our market on a services basis.  Certainly, we have sought a temporary derogation from the implementation of the directive in order to allow the Irish industry time to adapt and I note that the joint committee supports this request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, my Department are very conscious of the difficulties the insurance industry has been through in recent years. However, we must be realistic about this and &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; is the key word in any derogation we secure.  We cannot ignore our responsibilities under the Treaty of Rome which require the free establishment and the right that the Irish market be opened to &ldquo;services&rdquo; insurers eventually.  We should be acutely aware of the possible effects of the ruling in the European Court of Justice in the coinsurance cases, brought by the commission against Ireland, France, Denmark and Germany.  This directive was implemented around 1978 and the <Col N="1641" /> way in which those four countries including ourselves implemented that directive was to require leading insurers to be established in the State.  That was challenged by the Commission and the opinions of the Advocate General, Sir Gordon Slynn on these cases delivered on 20 March 1986 have signalled the possibility that freedom of services may be a reality much sooner than might have been expected previously.  It remains to be seen what line the European Court will take in its ruling on the cases.  Nevertheless, the opinions of the Advocate General should lend fresh impetus to the Irish industry's preparations to meet new competition.  People should be aware that the Advocate General's opinion has carried enormous weight in the past in rulings that finally emerged.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the negotiations on the Directive, which have been temporarily halted since 1984 pending the outcome of the court case I have just mentioned, these negotiations are likely to resume in the near future.  Our interest in these negotiations will not be limited to the question of a derogation.  We will be particularly concerned to ensure that the Directive provides for adequate powers to supervise to a reasonable degree those insurers who decide to cover Irish risks on a services basis and we will also need to ensure that we will be in a position to apply appropriate sanctions to such insurers who do not observe relevant Irish laws.</P>
    <P>There are other concerns also relating, for example, to the accounts and information to be supplied to the supervisory authority in the host country, the clear definition of insurance written on an establishment basis and insurance written by way of free provision of services.  It is also a major concern that liabilities associated with Irish risks, taken on by EC insurers on a services basis should be matched by assets denominated in the same currency.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the actual recommendations which the joint committee made in the report, some calling for action by my Department, some relating to the activities of other Departments, <Col N="1642" /> and some relating to the insurance industry itself.  In so far as the recommendations that deal with my own Department are concerned, action has previously been taken and we intend to take further steps as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The particular recommendations were first on derogation.  I have already said we have sought a derogation from the implementation of this Directive.  This will continue to be reviewed in the light of any changing circumstances, particularly in regard to the European court finding.</P>
    <P>My Department have already taken action to strengthen their resources in the insurance supervisory area.  Earlier on this year a detailed independent review of the non-life insurance supervisory procedures of my Department was completed. The review included an assessment of the frequency and quality of the information required from insurers and of the technical capacity of my Department to assess such information. I am pleased to say that the review has endorsed the supervisory methods used to date and has recommended a number of detailed developments of those procedures which will be implemented in conjunction with the new computer system due to be installed in the insurance section later this year.</P>
    <P>We can expect that access to computer facilities will speed up the supervisory process and highlight areas of concern at an earlier date and will also allow for a more detailed and in-depth analysis of accounts information, particularly in the area of monitoring the adequacy of provisions to cover the cost of claims.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that my Department should have access to statistical and actuarial expertise in examination of accounts and other information supplied by insurers and we will be recruiting two actuaries for this purpose.  In the meantime, we have access to independent actuarial expertise when needed. Senators will be aware that we have circulated the insurance Bill in 1986.  This Bill will strengthen my powers and give legislative force to some of the informal procedures already in place.  It will also <Col N="1643" /> adequately cater for present and future needs in the area of supervision.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended that my Department should ensure that annual returns of all authorised assurance companies in Ireland are promptly published. These returns are published each year in the summary of statements of assurance business or &ldquo;Blue Book&rdquo;.  It is official policy to aim to have the blue book for each year of account published as soon as possible, and in any event not later than December of the following year. Publication of the blue book has been delayed in recent years by factors totally outside the Department's control such as the placing of PMPA and ICI under administration.  It is intended that the 1985 blue book will be published by December 1986.</P>
    <P>I cannot comment on policy on exchange control since this is a matter for another Minister.  I can say, however, that exchange control, or the absence or reform of it, has more relevance to competition across national boundaries in life assurance.  Freedom of services in life assurance is some way off, but it would certainly require a counterpart exchange control directive to give effect to it.  One could not expect life assurers in one country, where investment opportunities were restricted, to be able to compete on the same terms with life assurance companies in another state who had the facility of a world wide investment portfolio.</P>
    <P>As for price control, this has been lifted since January last.  Insurers are now subject to a less stringent notification procedure. I note that one insurer has suggested that lifting price control will probably lead to more competition in the market and lowering of some rates: I certainly favour that.  In any event, my Department will continue to monitor premiums charged in order to ensure that policyholders are not hit with excessive or unjustified increases.  Indeed it can be said that when we had price control our experience was not very encouraging.</P>
    <P>Recommendations 5 and 6 deal with <Col N="1644" /> the question of tax relief.  Initial discussions took place earlier this year between officials of my Department and representatives of the non-life insurance industry on the question of providing tax relief to insurers to assist them in funding their solvency margins.  Certain proposals in this regard were put forward by the industry representatives and a number of suggestions on these were made by my Department.</P>
    <P>At present, my Department are pursuing the matter with the Department of Finance both in relation to the policy issues involved and the efficiency of the proposals in an operational sense.  While decisions on this recommendation do not rest with my Department, we are supportive of the recommendation generally. It is important that the insurers have the capacity to provide themselves with adequate solvency cover and the proposal of a contingency fund which is at the back of recommendation No. 5 sets about achieving that.  I am aware that such a system is in operation in some European countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands, for instance.  It is true to say that the existence of those provisions in other countries give a certain competitive edge to those countries. Generally speaking, my Department are supportive of these suggestions and will be looking forward to discussions with the Department of Finance.  The 10 per cent rate of tax raises a very broad issue as to the basis of the 10 per cent rate. Typically it has been applied only to manufacturing and exporting services. The criterion in the Government's view has always been the capacity for very significant exports.  In this context the 10 per cent rate has not been used in the past as a basis of providing protection. It would probably be more sensible to approach the tax problems of the insurance industry along the lines of recommendation No. 5 in the report. That is a personal view.</P>
    <P>On recommendations 7 and 8 I endorse the recommendation that insurers should accelerate steps to meet freedom of services. My Department have been diligent in offering assistance to the insurers to <Col N="1645" /> help them on this road.  The Government have also acted to improve the insurance environment here through a series of detailed measures.  However, it rests essentially with the insurers to take action and to realise that action and plans must be made now.  As for customer service arrangements, I indicated in my response last week to the report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses that I fully accept the main thrust of the committee's recommendations that insurance companies should improve their customer relations and publish suitable information booklets.  I indicated then that these recommendations were worthy of further discussions with the industry and that it is my intention to have my Department pursue them with the representative bodies of the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>Finally in relation to insurance intermediaries Senators will know that Part IV of the Insurance Bill currently before the Dáil provides a comprehensive measure of regulations of all insurance intermediaries both brokers and agents.  The scheme's basic aim is to protect the public and to assure them that, when dealing with an approved insurance intermediary, they can have confidence.  The proposals in my view are fair and will allow for the recognition of a self-regulation role for intermediaries.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate we had here some issues of a very broad nature were raised, such issues as the suggestion that the State would get into the job of providing third party insurance from tax revenue. I would have to say there are enormous difficulties with that sort of suggestion.  Insurance is based on the notion of risk and setting premia in relation to risk.  Any system that moves away from the link between the risk and the premium charged is a dangerous one <Col N="1646" /> in my view.  You end the incentive in an insurance system for people to avoid and to minimise their exposure to risk.  Any proposal of this nature on funding insurance premia through taxation necessarily implies the shifting of the burden from people who are in high risk categories, or who have been careless, onto those who are more careful.  The suggestion would have enormous implications which I would be slow to support. Senators must be aware too, in their comments on the very high rate of premia being charged, that the problem is not predominantly insurance industries forcing up these in order to push up their profit levels.  Predominantly, as some Senators have remarked, the problem in Ireland is the extraordinary high claims experience we have been undergoing.</P>
    <P>The thrust of what the Government are trying to do in this area is to bring down the cost of claims.  I am not saying there is no scope for improving the efficiency with which the service is delivered to the public by insurance companies. Senators would be misleading themselves if they think we can resolve this by simple controls on the insurance industry.  The problems of the high cost of insurance here run much deeper than that.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to pay a compliment to the joint committee for the balanced and thorough examination which they carried out on this difficult topic.  Their work is an important and welcome contribution to this debate.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 November 1986.</P>
