      <P>I have notice from Senator McAuliffe-Ennis that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today she proposes to raise the following matter: the operation of the means test in the civil legal aid and advice scheme.  I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  It will be taken from 4 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. or earlier if the business order is concluded. Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>Before I call on the Leader of the House for the Order of Business I would like to say that when he concludes, Senators are not entitled to ask questions.  Whatever questions they have, let them ask them before he concludes.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order today Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the Order Paper.  There is agreement between the groups in the House that all stages of No. 1 should conclude by 2.30 p.m. today and, accordingly, there will be no early signature motion.  If No. 1 concludes all its stages before 1.30 p.m. it is proposed to rise from 1.30 p.m. to <Col N="550" /> 2.30 p.m. but if it is not concluded by 1.30 p.m. we will sit through the extra hour in order to conclude it.  No. 4 is the statement by the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy, which was requested yesterday and the proposal is that this statement should be made at 2.30 p.m. and that the procedure should be a statement by the Tánaiste and an opportunity to a representative of each of the groups to ask a question related to point of clarification.  There will be no series of statements and no debate.  It is not anticipated that the Tánaiste's statement will exceed ten minutes and, accordingly, the whole proceedings should not occupy more than 15 minutes.  When that is concluded we will then revert to No. 2, if it has not already been commenced.  As is usual, no new business will be commenced at a time within an hour of the time of rising.</P>
      <P>Yesterday Senator Lanigan raised the question of the amount of time necessary to be devoted to legislation in order to get through our business and I undertook to have a meeting of representatives of groups.  There was general agreement at that meeting that at ordinary times it might be more appropriate instead of devoting one day to legislation and one day to the discussion of committee reports that we should devote one-and-a-half days to legislation and a half-day to committee reports.  In other words that Wednesdays and Thursday mornings be devoted to legislation and Thursday afternoons be devoted to the discussion of reports.  However, as I indicated yesterday there will be two measures coming to us within the month of May, the Finance Bill and the Constitutional Amendment Bill, both of which will almost certainly require to be passed by the end of the month.  Accordingly, I think it only right to say that during the month of May, because of this particularly heavy programme, there is a certainty that the Seanad will have to meet for three days a week, from the week after next onwards and the possibility of having to meet four days in one week is not excluded.</P>

      <P>Just to double-check on No. 4.  As I had arranged with the Tánaiste to make the statement, the Leader has suggested that there may be supplementary questions.  Do I take it that these will be questions arising out of the Tánaiste's statement?  Otherwise, we are going to have a debate and I do not think that is what is envisaged.  Therefore I take it that if people wish to speak on a point of clarity on what he says, that is the subject matter for questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to section 2 and the definition for &ldquo;industrial estate&rdquo; where it is stated that it &ldquo;means an area of land used mainly for industrial purposes and purposes ancillary and incidental thereto and having on it at least two factory buildings&rdquo;.  In my own native town of Kells we have an industrial estate which has one industrial building.  I would like to ask the Minister in that situation would the industry suffer under the terms of section 2?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (3), the Minister &ldquo;may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order terminate the designation of any area, or part thereof, as a designated area.&rdquo;  The designated areas are entitled to bigger grants. Could it happen under this subsection that an area which would initially qualify for the higher rate of grant could, because of this subsection and because of an order made by a Minister, get a reduced grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As I said in my opening remarks, we had the Department examine the situation with a view to having a more flexible attitude to the question of designation and to that end we requested an independent report. We asked the Economic and Social Research Institute to prepare an independent and objective review of the use of designation as a flexible policy instrument.  We have received their report and it is presently under consideration.  The NESC report was the basis on which the <Col N="554" /> Economic and Social Research Council submitted a report to my Department. That is presently under consideration in my Department.  As you can see from the thrust of industrial policy, it is important that we use weapons in a flexible manner. Great care would be taken in regard to the designation or redesignation of any area, whether it is a designation to establish the higher rate of grant or a redesignation which would mean that the area would be entitled to a lower level of grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the question I was going to ask.  How flexible can any Minister be under this section?  This is the one contentious area I see in this Bill.  I feel it is something that could be used as a political sop to people living in an area.  I live in north Meath, which is bordering the disadvantaged area of Cavan.  Over the years we have suffered due to the fact that high grant assistance was available to County Cavan.  Road developments which have taken place have been a tremendous boost to this area, but we find we cannot get the buckets of tar to fill the potholes in north Meath.  However, that is not what this Bill is about.</P>
      <P>Many requests have been made at EC level by Governments down the years to have north Meath declared a disadvantaged area, but the requests have failed. The EC examined detailed submissions made by the IFA, local authorities and the Government.  They gave small grants towards drainage and so on, but the land in north Meath is similar to the land in Cavan, especially the Oldcastle area, Crossakeel and so on.  Having failed to get north Meath as a disadvantaged area, would the Government feel like designating part of north Meath under the terms of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment is that this Bill proposes to continue all the Minister's existing functions in relation to designated areas and to continue the existing grant differential.  It goes further in that it allows the Minister, <Col N="555" /> with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order to terminate designation of an area or part of an area.  As I said, we have a report from the NESC, who make an objective assessment of how best to assess which parts of our country are the least well off economically, or with regard to the labour market.  The principles of that report were accepted by the Minister and he asked the National Economic and Social Research Institute to appraise that report.  That report of the ESRI is presently being considerd in my Department.  Obviously, no decision regarding changes in the designations of the area will be taken before this examination is completed and the matter is considered by Government.  Any Government would be very slow to move in this area.  I want to give an assurance of that to the House.  It will be some time before this matter is fully processed.  The Senator should appreciate the reasons why, and the reasons are that we want to use the designation method perhaps more selectively, to use it as a weapon in our armoury where and when it is necessary to ensure that a geographical area of the country which has suffered a disastrous consequence over a period in relation to industrial employment can be assisted.  It is a benign reason.  There are no serpents lurking underneath to go around de-designating places.  It is strengthening the Minister's hand and making the designation weapon more flexible if the need arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that County Cavan was declared a disadvantaged area under EC terms left north Meath in a more disadvantaged situation.  Many industries that would have been provided in the north Meath area &mdash; from Kells to Oldcastle &mdash; were not provided there because there was higher grant assistance being made available in Cavan.  Cavan has had a multiplicity of factories built over the years.  We became more disadvantaged in north Meath because Cavan was declared a disadvantaged area.  I cannot understand that designation is arrived at on borderline.  Government is <Col N="556" /> about people; it is not about borders.  I fail to understand why a certain area can be declared disadvantaged and the field next door not termed disadvantaged.  I could understand it on a phased basis up to a point.  The terrain in County Cavan is akin to that in Country Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel like Senator Lynch that the terms &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo; and &ldquo;designated&rdquo; areas could be synonymous.  Small sections of north Meath that were added in a restrictive sense to the disadvantaged areas should have been included and specifically spelled out in this legislation.  I accept the Minister's approach to this.  Flexibility is required and the Government would be very slow to move.  Could I ask him if the termination of the designated area coincides with the end of the financial year, because otherwise problems might arise with regard to grants which could be overcome if the termination of the designation of an area coincided with the end of the financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>To go back a bit and look at the designation policy, the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, first introduced the concept of undeveloped areas and provided incentives to industrial promoters to establish industries in those areas in order to compensate for infrastructural deficiencies.  They were the old congested areas.  Times have changed and there have been marginal changes made.  For instance, the Ferenka factory in Limerick was designated for a period. In Cork we designated part of Ringaskiddy for small industries for a period. Designation for industrial purposes is different from that for agricultural purposes which is used in the EC and not necessarily related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the people who are disadvantaged in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the concept of designation because it allows a higher grant to be given.  I have said on a number of occasions in the Dáil in Question Time that designation <i>per se</i> is not the be-all <Col N="557" /> and end-all of attracting industry.  I have asked on many occasions why an industrialist has decided to locate in a certain area.  I have got the following reasons on a number of occasions: because he liked the golf club; because he liked the view; because there was proximity to facilities for his children at first, second or third level education; because there was a good pool of labour resources; because he liked the seaside.  I have not got the answer nor has the IDA to why a promoter locates in one specific place.  There are a myriad of reasons.  The higher level of grants is not necessarily the golden cup that it is held out to be.  There are many other factors in a very complex matrix of factors that makes up a promoter's mind. The Government have tried to get an objective assessment of how to designate an area.  We are currently looking at a report from the ESRI on this.  We are trying to make Government policy more flexible.  We are allowing a weapon in the hands of the Government of the day to have this flexibility that will allow it to be used in areas where an order must be put before the Houses of the Oireachtas, to allow it to designate an area or de-designate an area if it has gone particularly well.  I do not think that that is a retrograde step.  It adds to the weapon of Government in their industrial policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, when the ESRI report is completed, if he would have another look at the matters raised here?  I know that an official appointed to a health board will go to an area where there are the facilities for golf, facilities for their children and access to larger towns.  The industrialists think in the same vein.  The fact that one has only to move a mile down the road to get the higher grant will not remove one from these facilities.  The fact is that that move has been made to a different county. The employment potential for people in Meath is not great.  We have suffered closure after closure of Meath factories over the last few years.  Most of the industries in my area are concerned with sand, gravel and bedding which are family businesses that were started years ago, many <Col N="558" /> of them without any grant assistance. They are there through hard work, sweat, endeavour and courage, qualities that are very much needed today to survive.</P>
      <P>Those who started up without grant assistance and built up their own businesses through hard work are the great survivors. Money should not be the incentive.  The incentives should be for entrepreneurship, dedication and hard work.  At the same time while the grant assistance is there &mdash; we feel very sore about this point &mdash; a mile down the road you can get a 60 per cent grant.  People have moved away from our area due to this fact.  The point I am making is that if there was phased grant system an in-between grant, 10 per cent lower than the disadvantaged area grant, available in the north Meath area, then we would feel that we had got some recognition. The fact that somebody made the decision to declare Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and all these counties disadvantaged areas just by looking at a border line is unfair and unjust.  It is there; but if we could do anything to remove it or remedy the situation, or if the Minister could help us, we would appreciate it very much</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that the same can be said for all the areas adjacent to designated areas.  The only alternative I have is to abolish the designated areas altogether and give one grant over the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would cause quite an amount of protest.  It would cause quite an outcry from people living in the west. We are trying to recognise what is essentially an infrastructure difficulty because of geographical location.  The philosophy of designation is a valid one because it takes into account the geographical distance from the main markets in Europe and the main transport centres and shipping centres, in particular on the east <Col N="559" /> coast.  It takes account of the infrastructural situation generally.  For that reason the designation policy has been used.  We are trying to make it a bit more flexible. We are doing no more, no less.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with Senator Lynch.  I have heard the same argument in Cork and in particular in Offaly where part of the county is designated and other parts are not.  There is a whole litany of this all along the areas bordering on the designated areas.  We must also accept it as a fact of life in modern industry that the question of commuting is a real one. People here in Dublin commute up to 20 miles every day to go to work.  I would not do it.  I do not think I would be able for sitting in a car for one hour.  Frankly, I am not used to it.  I drive up from Waterford &mdash; it is two and a half hours &mdash; once or twice or sometimes three times a week.  But, as a general rule, we have to accept commuting as a way of life.  To have to go one mile to get to work is a fair quality of life, generally speaking.  I have heard the same criticisms right along the borders of the designated areas.  What we are doing in this section is to make the designation weapon slightly more flexible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a point yesterday that as well as the advantages of the extra grant assistance, services are provided from the Social Fund of the EC.  Right across from me, where I mentioned about the bad roads, the potholes, we drive on to a place called Maghera.  It was not even a village some years ago.  I am sure a Chathaoirligh, you often drive through it.  Now it has a lighting system that you would not get anywhere, even in Dublin.  It has a road through it that makes our main roads look like boreens. The services have been provided.  The point I am making is that certainly &mdash; I know these people: I know them very well and they are hard-working people &mdash; they can be happy with their designation, but we are very unhappy with our discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, of course that <Col N="560" /> we must have some sympathy with the Minister with regard to the question of the dividing line between a designated. area and an area which is not designated. Obviously, no matter where you draw the line you are going to have difficulty. That is the problem really.  It is one problem that Solomon himself could not solve.  As long as you have areas which are designated and areas which are not designated, you are going to have that problem.</P>
      <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's attention an additional problem that has arisen with regard to the increasing practice of designating very small areas, and the problems that has given rise to.  I want to say in that regard that I have some small financial interest in a piece of land in Cork which was affected by one of these decisions.  I want my comments to be read in that context.  The Minister will be aware&mdash;and it is included in the Third Schedule, which we will be dealing with later&mdash;that designation has taken place, as he has mentioned himself, in places like the Ferenka situation, in Churchville, Hollyhill and Togher and Ringaskiddy industrial estates in Cork.  The result of that is that land in the remainder of the borough area is unsaleable for industrial purposes.  That is what it is.</P>
      <P>By designating land most of which is owned by the Industrial Development Authority, you have made the land in the remainder of the area unsaleable.  That is one of the effects of designating a small area, a small little island within an area which is not designated.  That is a separate and distinct problem from the problem raised by Senator Lynch.  That is most unfair, particularly as it appears that the designation which takes place is a designation by and large of Industrial Development Authority land.  What you are effectively saying is that if you have a difficulty with regard to the Industrial Development Authority having acquired a substantial amount of land, the way you get over the problem is that you designate it and force all the development in that area into that confined area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there is more than just Industrial Development Authority land <Col N="561" /> involved, but by and large what I am saying is overwhelmingly true.  What is certainly true and cannot be contradicted is the fact that by doing that, and I am not objecting to any area in Cork being made a designated area&mdash;but maybe I am&mdash;you should not be able to pick out four fields and say: &ldquo;That is a designated area&rdquo;.  The rest of the surrounding area is not designated at all.  That is effectively what is being done.  That is quite separate and distinct from whether you should have a designated area in Cork area or not.  That is a separate thing.  What you are effectively doing is designating this field and that field, and as a result of that you will increase the value of that property and reduce the value of the property around it.  That was what was done with Ferenka, too.  You did not create any new industrial employment: you just developed industrial employment that was already going to come to an area into one small little section and got somebody out of financial difficulty. That is not industrial policy on a national basis.  That is merely tinkering with the local market.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulty the Minister has with regard to problems created by the borders between the designated and undesignated area.  I accept that.  There have been problems like that in County Cork too, but I am not referring to those problems.  I am saying that to pick a few fields in an urban area or an area adjacent to an urban area and say that they are going to be designated and everything else is not is to force industry by economic rationality, into developing in that area and to make it impossible for anyone else who might want to develop industry in the remainder of the area to sell their land for industrial purposes.  That has been a major problem in the Cork area. I am very marginally affected by it.  I can assure you it is not relevant one way or another, but I feel I had to put it on the record of the House that I was in some way affected.</P>
    <P>I feel that, if designation was necessary in the Cork area, the Cork area <i>per se</i> should have been designated and not just individual estates in individual sections, <Col N="562" /> which are distorting the local property market and distorting the development of the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have dealt with the question of designation in general. In relation to what Senator O'Leary has said, the Government of the time moved there because there was major structural damage done to industry and we were trying to re-establish it.  In relation to Cork we all accept that there was major structural upheaval in the industrial fabric of Cork &mdash; one mentioned Dunlops and Fords.  That went hand-in-hand with other positive industrial locations.  What was done was that Ringaskiddy was designated for a three-year period for large industry.  The other industrial estates, apart from the Togher estate which is owned by Cork County council, are owned by the IDA.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer briefly to the NESC report entitled <i>Designation of Areas: Industrial Policy,</i> page 50, chapter 7, paragraph 7.5, it states:</P>
      <P>Ideally designation should be focused on as small an area as possible.</P>
      <P>That is their attitude, that efforts should be concentrated in building up a small area intensively as an industrial base. This is what is being done in IDA-owned estates and in the Togher estate and in Ringaskiddy.  We are anxious to get Ringaskiddy up and running as a major industrial focal point in Cork.  I would defend what we have done in Cork.  It was done on the foot of a task force report.  The task force was composed of local authority people who recommended this.  We were trying to take initiatives in Cork to assist in industrial development.  I do not believe that it will make other land unsaleable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is Government policy.  Government policy is to make Ringaskiddy attractive to <Col N="563" /> major industry and to make other industrial estates in Cork attractive for immediate development.  We are putting a three years time limit on its designation. It is a spearhead effort to attract industry into Cork to make up for what has been accepted as serious industrial dislocation in Cork.  It is not going to detract from the general overall value of land in the long term.  We are using State resources to bring industry to Cork.  I make no apology for that.</P>

The question I asked was: how can he defend a situation where land primarily owned by the Industrial Development Authority is designated and land surrounded is not designated?  I put it to the Minister that when the report from which he quotes says that as small an area as possible should be designated, it is not talking about a few fields; it is talking about a whole county or part of a county, not just an island in the middle of a big area.</P>

      <P>I object to the comment that I am blustering.  I am trying to show the Senator that the efforts the Government are making in Cork are made in consideration of a task force report in relation to a crisis situation which was perceived to exist in Cork.  We took positive action on a short term basis to attract industry to the Ringaskiddy estate, to the IDA estates and to the county council estate.  We did so after considering a task force report.  I am not blustering here.  I am saying what positive action the Government have taken in relation to the Cork city area and surrounding area in a short, sharp period in which we hope to attract industry at a special designation rate.  I make no apology for that.  I am surprised that Senator O'Leary is raising this matter in this manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the remission of rates.  A local authority may remit for nine years two-thirds of the rates if they think fit.  This seems to give discretion to a local authority.  With financial constraints a problem could arise here, a reluctance to &ldquo;think fit&rdquo;. There should be a constraint on the local authority to remit the rates.  Also subsection (3) says:</P>
      <P>If, in any local financial year, the Authority certifies that the undertaking has failed to observe the terms upon which the premises were provided, the remission shall not have effect in respect of the local financial year.</P>
      <P>That gives a lot of power to the authority. Subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P>A remission shall not be granted more than once in respect of the same premises.</P>
      <P>For example, what would happen in a situation where a company became nonviable and closed down and a new company set up, would the Minister not think that the new company shall be entitled to a remission of rates as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, of course, primarily a matter of revenue loss to the local authority.  It is they who are going to lose revenue out of it.  The purpose of section 5 is to ensure that the remission takes effect from the year in which the remission is allowed.  Under existing legislation there is the possibility that the remission would only become effective the year after, so that in fact, payment is made the first year.  Section 5 ensures that the remission takes place in the year in <Col N="566" /> which it is made.  It is a technical change. It is a reserved function.  Subsection (6) states that it is a reserved function for the exclusive decision by the elected members of local authorities.  It is members of local authorities who make the decisions.  I cannot envisage a situation where members of a local authority would not be disposed to granting a remission of rates to industrial undertakings.  It is a local authority matter and it is proper that a decision be taken by them, because it is the local authority who would lose revenue by way of remission of rates.  That is the reason why it now stands as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <P>(b) are situate in an area which at the time of provision of premises was a designated area under a repealed enactment or is a designated area under this Act.</P>
      <P>The two conditions would apply.  What would the situation be, say, where an undertaking did not qualify for a grant but was a viable undertaking?  Would it not be entitled to that remission?</P>

      <P>No.  There are two sections.  This subsection provides that in order to qualify for rates remission the Industrial Development Authority must certify that the premises concerned (a) were provided by the IDA or by means of IDA grants.  The premises were either provided by the IDA or the undertaking was grant-aided and are situated in a designated area under existing legislation or in a designated area under this Act.</P>
      <P>The clause &ldquo;are situate in an area which at the time the provision of the premises was a designated area under a repealed enactment&rdquo; is necessary to make certain legally that premises in receipt of rates remission under temporary designation orders under repealed enactments will continue to enjoy such benefits.  The two central criteria are (a) premises must be provided by the authority of (b) the undertaking must be grant-aided.</P>

Would the Minister not think that incentive should be there for that kind of undertaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am restricted in the area I can deal with.  I am talking primarily about manufacturing industries and service industries which are grant-aided by the IDA.  There are many other commercial undertakings.  It would be a matter for the local authority in those cases to make a decision.  This Bill primarily deals with IDA-aided undertakings whether they are manufacturing or services industries.  I am not going outside that scope.

      <P>Each company will prepare an annual report.  It seems logical to submit the annual report or review every year. Every third year is an arbitrary choice.  I am not sure what made the Minister decide three years as against four or five years.  In a sense, this review hopefully will be once in the lifetime of any Government.  It would be better if this review were submitted on a yearly basis.  If there were any problems to be sorted out, it would be much easier to deal with them if Members of the Oireachtas had an opportunity of going through a review every year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would beg to differ with the Senator.  The idea of a three-year review is to allow trends that are evolving to be properly evaluated.  It would not merely be a statistical profile of developments in industry over three years.  It would also evaluate industrial performance and set out conclusions on which action would be taken.  It is a policy triennial report.  There are many annual reports which Members can debate in the House.  There is the Estimate for Industry and Commerce, the annual reports of the IDA and CTT which are laid before the Houses and give a mechanism for an annual discussion on trends in industry in general.  There is the budget debate. What we are trying to do is to put in a major three-year look at industrial development from which we can draw some conclusions of a policy nature which might indicate a different direction in policy.  It is that kind of report we are looking for.  We have plenty of annual reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets out the functions of the Industrial Development <Col N="570" /> Authority.  One of the greatest things that ever happened in this country was the establishment of the IDA.  I want to put on record my appreciation of the great work they have done, are doing and will continue to do.</P>
      <P>I have a problem in seeing eye to eye with some of the decisions taken by the IDA.  For example, a business or industry might be termed over-developed and the IDA may feel that there are enough people producing a certain type of product.  An entrepreneur who has the business capacity to market a particular product will not in some cases be allowed grant assistance from the IDA because the product will not in some cases be allowed grant assistance from the IDA because the product will be termed over-developed or the industry might seem to be overloaded.  By not allowing this entrepreneur with the potential to develop to start his business we are in fact protecting a section of the business sector who are not performing as well as they should be, who are probably not producing the type of goods to meet market requirements, and have not got the market expertise.</P>
      <P>When an entrepreneur decides to go into business, produce a top quality product and market it cheaper than one which is already being produced and has the business ability to expand and export that product, he should not be hindered. I would like the Minister to ask the IDA to re-examine the criteria on which they base their decisions either to award or not award a grant.  I would also like to know what real function the IDA have in trying to save a firm which might be going into voluntary liquidation.  Over the last few years we have seen a fourfold increase in the number of annual recorded liquidations and receiverships. I hoped this Bill would produce the right business climate to reverse that trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many firms have failed in situations where the banks and other establishments have decided that the proceeds from receivership would not even cover the receiver's expenses.  I am referring to firms which have been grant aided by the IDA.  What authority have the IDA in <Col N="571" /> matters like this?  Can they come in with a rescue package?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Senator Lynch's contribution there are a number of issues which I would like to comment on.  I will take the last one first.  In rescue cases there has been a clear delineation between the functions of the IDA and those of Fóir Teoranta.  The Fóir Teoranta functions are primarily those of rescue and restructuring of companies who are in difficulties.  Therefore, it is outside the scope of this Bill and I cannot comment on it.</P>
      <P>In relation to the possibility of bringing two companies together or introducing companies the IDA take an active role. In relation to certain sectors of industry, which in the opinion of the IDA are in over-capacity, they have to take a decision to grant aid a company within an industry in over-capacity.  This would not be logical.  I know of a company in my constituency which recently met that criterion.  The IDA do not stop people from going into industry.  They grant aid them generally but they do not grant-aid industries where there is over-capacity.</P>
      <P>The general bakery industry is not being grant-aided currently.  The general carpentry-joinery business is not being grant aided and general printing is not being grant-aided to my knowledge because in the opinion of the IDA there is over-capacity in those industries.  To grant aid a company in that sector is simply diverting business from one company to another because the industry is in over-capacity.  Similarly in the meat trade the primary slaughtering in the beef sector is not being grant-aided because the IDA consider the beef industry to be in over-capacity.  However, grants for value-added projects are being grant-aided because the IDA and the White Paper find that this is the area we should be moving into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the section in general, it is a modernising and an innovative section. The primacy for industrial policy rests with the Minister and that is quite clearly spelt out in subsection 1 (a).  However, it <Col N="572" /> can be seen from the section in general that the greatest flexibility is being given to the IDA in matters of industrial development.  That is as it should be and the relationship between the Minister and the IDA is quite clearly set out.  This is a modernising section which brings up to date the role and responsibility of the IDA and the policy powers of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain subsection (2) to us.  It deals with paragraphs (b) and (d) of subsection (1) which states that the giving of grants and the developing of industrial estates shall not apply to the Shannon Customs Free Airport.  I understand that.  That does not require any further explanation.  I am anxious to know if there is a statutory definition somewhere of the Shannon Customs Free Airport.  Am I right in thinking that that is a very much smaller area than the area covered by SFADCo, that the SFADCo area is much bigger than the Shannon Customs Free Airport?

      <P>I appreciate that.  The <Col N="574" /> Minister might have a look at that point. It would be worth looking at it to get the thing crystal clear.  Getting back to the narrower point of the Shannon Customs Free Airport, which is the one referred to in subsection (2), is the Minister aware of where that is actually defined?  It is not defined in this Act.  If you read something like Shannon Customs Free Airport, the normal thing to do is to go to the start and say what exactly do they mean by that and you go to the definition section or interpretation section and it is not in it.  Where is &ldquo;The Shannon Customs Free Airport&rdquo; defined?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <P>It could be made under the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Act.  I am fairly certain.  There may have been other orders necessary in relation to the financial aspect of it as opposed to the grant giving aspect.  That is why it is outside of my Department.  We have also clarified section 12 (3).</P>

      <P>It states that the terms and conditions of every delegation made by the Authority under subsection (2) of section 4 of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.  I understand that.  Would it be better from a clarity point of view to consider the question of whether the Shannon Customs Free Airport should be put into the definition section? If we look at the interpretation section under &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; it says that &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; has the same meaning as in section 2 of the Local Government Act, 1941.  I would expect that somewhere in the Act the Shannon Customs Free Airport shall have the same meaning as in whatever its source is.  It appears to me that that would tie down exactly what is meant.  I am not objecting to the Shannon Customs Free Airport being included there.  But it is <Col N="575" /> not very tidily done from a legislative point of view.</P>

The lack of clarity which may exist is that nowhere in this legislation are you referred back to what is meant by the Shannon Customs Free Airport. Nowhere is that defined.  This is the point I am making.  The term &ldquo;Shannon Customs Free Airport&rdquo; is not defined.  I am not objecting to what the Minister is proposing to do, the exclusion of (b) and (d).  The Minister is just introducing into this Bill a concept which he is not referring back to anything which can be measured.  We are taking about something called the Shannon Customs Free Airport.  We are not saying the Shannon Customs Free Airport as outlined by a delegation made under subsection (2) of section 4 of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company legislation.  That would be one way of doing it.  I do not know how this concept exists.</P>

      <P>It is not a major point, but I just want to give the Minister an example of the kind of problem you could have if you did not define it.  Presumably there is somewhere at the moment a definition of what is meant by &ldquo;Shannon Customs Free Airport&rdquo;.  Somewhere there is an entity that somebody in 1986 can identify as being &ldquo;Shannon Customs Free Airport&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If it were decided next year to expand or to contract the area, or to add another 50 acres or 100 acres to it, you would have what might be called a new Shannon Customs Free Airport.  Would that fall within the definition of this Bill or not?  I would say that it could only fall within the definition of the Bill if the definition of &ldquo;Shannon Customs Free Airport&rdquo; is included, which would specify that not only does it include the present Shannon Customs Free Airport but any amendment or extension to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point.  There was no intention to deceive. It just was not mentioned as being amended or repealed or changed and because there was no amendment or repeal it simply was not put into any appendix that exists.  There is an instrument in existence to which people can refer and identify the Shannon Customs Free Airport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will realise, of course, that in respect of this particular point I am not making any reference to either the policy involved in it or to his own presentation of it.  I am merely <Col N="577" /> saying that, if you start using an expression in legislation which is not self-defined, if you talk about a local authority, for example, obviously you must say what you mean by a local authority and that is what they have done at the start of this Bill.  If you use the word &ldquo;local authority&rdquo;, &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; has a special meaning.  If you use an expression like &ldquo;Shannon Customs Free Airport&rdquo; that must also have a special meaning.  I do not suggest that the Minister personally should do it, because I know that this Minister does not draft the Bill himself, but a properly drafted Bill would include a definition of &ldquo;Shannon Customs Free Airport&rdquo;.  I am not going to make any further point about it.  I do not really mind whether he does it or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important sections in the Bill, setting out as it does all the functions of the Authority.  These are comprehensive and I welcome that.  I accept the Minister's statement that the Minister will be in control at all times having regard to subsection (1) (a).  I am not sure how this can be reconciled with paragraph (c) where the Authority may initiate ideas and make submissions to the Minister. Could we have that clarified, whether the initiative comes from the Minister or from the Authority with regard to new schemes?  I also welcome paragraph (h), which imposes a legislative responsibility on the Authority to provide on request advice and guidance to persons contemplating starting a new industry or expanding existing industry.  This is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, with regard to subsection (4), the Authority &ldquo;may in the exercise of its functions have regard to the extent to which an industrial undertaking will serve to promote national objectives for regional development&rdquo;.  That is very weak, that there is a choice left to the Authority.  Perhaps &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be <Col N="578" /> used there.  That the Authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the exercise of its functions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator looks at paragraph (e), the Authority shall be the autonomous body with the following functions, &ldquo;to foster the national objective of regional industrial development&rdquo;. The word there is &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  So it is covered already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives them the flexibility to look at a special responsibility for regional development in relation to an industrial undertaking and they may, as part of their consideration of a project, look at the regional aspects of that undertaking.  The other one would be a global general policy, that it shall have regard to regional policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this responsibility with regard to paragraph (e) to take into consideration regional development. That responsibility is imposed on the Authority under that paragraph.  Then, subsection (4) states that it &ldquo;may in the exercise of its functions have regard...&rdquo; It seems to me that in some sense there is a contradiction in terms here.  Under the earlier subsection it must have regard to the regional development plans and under subsection (4) it may have regard. I take that to mean, essentially, that it may have regard to regional development.  It seems to me that there is a watering down of the situation.  They are either constrained by the terms of regional development or they are not, or they are constrained and there are exceptions.  Is the Minister saying that in this situation the general policy is that <Col N="579" /> there would be this constraint, but this subsection gives them an opportunity to opt out in certain circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, on the contrary, section 11 is quite explicit.  As I have said, the Authority shall be the autonomous body with the function of fostering the national objective of regional industrial development.  That is general policy.  But in relation to any particular undertaking the Authority may in the exercise of its functions have regard to the regional aspects of that undertaking.  In other words, in considering an application the Authority may take into account its effect on a regional basis.  That allows them to look at an individual project in addition to the general overall powers it would have in relation to regional development.</P>

      <P>The Minister may give the Authority such general policy directives as he considers appropriate having regard to the provision of this Act and such an order would have to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas within a period of 21 days.  Subsection (2) states that:</P>
      <P>A directive under subsection (1) shall not apply to any individual industrial undertaking or to giving preference to one area over others in regard to the location of an industrial undertaking otherwise than as part of a general review of industrial policy for the country as a whole indicated in the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> I take that to mean that the Minister will have no power with regard to a decision of the Authority, that the Authority will be the final arbiter in deciding where an undertaking will be established.  In a general sense I would agree with this entirely, but perhaps there might be an occasion when it might be necessary to have some discretion on the part of the Minister.  It seems to me that in this section the Minister loses out in that power, that while we dealt with section 11 and it stated that the Minister was in total control, here we have a situation, not an undesirable situation, where the Minister does not have power in relation to where undertakings are established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I usually find Members seeking to ensure that the Minister has no powers at all and that powers would be taken from him.  What is quite clear here is that this section allows the Minister to give general policy directives to the Industrial Development Authority.  I think that is fair enough.  It is matters of policy which are the Minister's responsibility.  It also obliges the Authority to comply with and to set out a report of its activities on foot of the directives in their annual report.  In other words, they would have to account for their actions on foot of a Minister's general policy directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A limitation is put on the Minister's power to issue directives in that they shall not apply to an individual industrial undertaking or to giving preference to one area over another in terms of industrial location policy other than as part of a general review of industrial policy for the country as a whole.  It also proposes that both Houses of the Oireachtas shall be kept informed of policy directives given by the Minister under this subsection.  It allows quite an amount of transparency for Members of the Oireachtas even in relation to general policies in that the IDA must respond in their annual reports as to how they reacted.  The Minister shall not give a specific directive in relation to an individual industrial undertaking nor shall he direct that it goes to a certain place.  There may be a <Col N="581" /> general policy decision which affects the whole country and that would be transparent.  We could not be more open or transparent or visible in what we are allowing the Minister to do and in what the powers of the authority are and the fact that both Houses of the Oireachtas are being informed.</P>

      <P>Under this section the Minister would be allowed to specify or redefine what I spoke about, what we would term over-capacity on such matters, and review the whole structure of the administration of the system.  We are living in changing times.  Navan was the boom town of the midlands with regard to clothing and furniture.  In the past five years that industry has melted down. There is a lot of unemployment in this area.  We could claim that County Meath should be a designated area.  When a certain industry collapses in Ireland, such as the building industry, it affects all the spin-off industries that are attached to it such as the furniture industry, window glazing, carpeting and so on.  We found our major dependency in County Meath was the furniture industry in Navan.  Am I correct in stating that under this section the Minister could ask for a review of this area and perhaps issue a directive to investigate the possibility of putting in another type of industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be unhelpful to the Senator.  They must be general policy directives.  There is full information flowing between the Minister and the IDA.  With regard to Navan, it is not intended that the Minister would use this as a day-to-day weapon in industrial policy.  This is where it is a matter of general policy directives.  It does not have any regional or sharp impact like, say, designation or the power to designate.</P>

I agree, of course, with Senator Lynch but Kells is in a very bad <Col N="582" /> way at present.  With regard to the general policy, I appreciate what the Minister has said.  My understanding of the section is that the broad parameters of policy would be set out by the Minister and within that constraint the authority will have autonomy and the Minister will not be able to interfere in any individual case with regard to the selection of a company or with regard to the location. In general everybody would have to agree with that but the general policy outlines must be long-term.  Situations might arise where there would be some important change which might necessitate a change in the general policy.  In a situation of that kind a case could be made where the Minister could intervene not necessarily to issue new general policy outlines but as an interim measure to take into consideration factors which would be possibly out of date by the time a general policy change could be implemented.  In that situation could a case not be made for governmental or ministerial intervention?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In general we are anxious that the Industrial Development Authority acts as we have given the power autonomously in relation to regional development policies.  I do not think either Houses of the Oireachtas would wish the Minister to be involved in areas.  I think you would see the political dangers there.  That is why we have balanced this section very tightly in relation to the powers of the Minister to issue general policy directives and to exclude him from issuing powers in relation to an individual undertaking or in relation to locating a specific industry geographically.  We are talking about general policy directives.  It is not envisaged that they would be used frequently but rather at infrequent times for general policy purposes.</P>

As I understand it from the Minister this is not going to cost the State anything extra.  I cannot envisage that the situation would be improved when money is not being invested.  While it is costing no more to the State, we are paying out this kind of money at present.  I understand that it is necessary to change the emphasis of thrust and that considerable improvement will be made in that regard.  Nevertheless the conclusion is that the money is being badly spent at present.  It is a bookkeeping exercise.

      <P>This is an ongoing enabling section which allows the ceilings of the IDA in relation to expenditures to be established.  Capital expenditure during 1985 amounted to £1,433 million. With the enactment of this Bill it is considered appropriate to institute a new limit which would allow for a three to four year period of review.  That power is specifically taken because it will allow an amending Bill to come before the House for discussion.  It will give Members an opportunity to discuss the functions of the IDA.  This is a continuation of the enabling procedures which are similar to those imposed by section 17 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969, as amended.  It is not a new procedure.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, anyone looking at this Bill would say that it must have great beneficial effects because £700 million is being invested with the possibility of £125 million.  In reality, this extra money is not being invested.  It is a figure that is plucked out of the sky, so to speak.  Could we not have £1,000 million, and it would have no implications as far as the Bill is concerned &mdash; or an infinite amount of money?  My view about this whole area is that investment is needed.  Without that investment, we cannot properly deal with <Col N="584" /> the unemployment situation.  We have a figure mentioned which is meaningless. In spite of the Minister's reply, I still cannot understand how the figure of £700 million was determined or what significance that figure has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the figures of £700 million and £125 million are in respect of loan guarantees and are not plucked out of the air.  They are figures which we are advised by the IDA will be needed over the next three years or so.  We have pitched the ceiling to allow for a review at the end of a period which would need amending legislation to come before this House to further increase it.  It provides an opportunity for us to give sufficient funds to the IDA for a period of say, three years and to come back with an amending Bill to enable the House to discuss the IDA's performance in the three years.</P>

The thrust of what has been said already is that it is not going to cost the State anything.  It comes dangerously close to the magic wand idea.  I cannot see how this benefit will be reaped when no extra investment will be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may be confused regarding extra costs.  What we say is that if we were to divert the figures from different headings it would not cost any extra but this is the global figure that is necessary, and whether it is spent under capital grants, guarantees or whatever, the money is required.  In 1984, the total amount spent in equity shareholding loan guarantees amounted to £147 million. That is an annual sum.  So you can see that the figure we are looking for will roughly cover the company for the next three years or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This is not so. Subsection (8) says merely &ldquo;to enable them to borrow temporarily&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; is the operative word, in the bridging sense, if there was a small requirement to bridge.  It has no major significance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The word &ldquo;engage&rdquo; is significant because the word &ldquo;employ&rdquo; would exclude Members of the Oireachtas from being employed by the Authority under Standing Orders.  The word &ldquo;engage&rdquo; now allows expertise to be drawn if such expertise exists in either House of the Oireachtas.  It is a widening of the scope to allow this expertise be drawn.  For example, the House would consider the late Senator Alexis FitzGerald to have been an expert on international contract law and not to have his services available because he was a Member of the Seanad would be unfortunate.  This simply allows that Members of the Oireachtas can be engaged.  Under Standing Orders, they cannot be employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 21 refers to fixed assets.  I thought from the general tone of the debate that there was a move away from financial help towards fixed assets, but it seems that this is not so.  I would ask the Minister to expand on this.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (2), the amount of a grant under subsection (1) shall not exceed 60 per cent of the cost of the fixed assets, in the case of an industrial undertaking in a designated area, and 45 per cent elsewhere.  Could it not be envisaged that in exceptional circumstances it might be necessary, and it might be good policy, to exceed this limit? Would the Minister consider inserting at any time, the adverb &ldquo;normally&rdquo; there? If that had been done, the Minister would have discretion in very exceptional circumstances to exceed the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="588" />
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is in fact the kernel of the IDA's grant giving powers.  It would not be possible to put in the words &ldquo;normally exceed&rdquo;, nor indeed would it be possible to exceed the 60 per cent level for undertakings in designated areas or 45 per cent for the rest of the country.  We are subject to the aids code regimes within the EC and we cannot exceed the limits imposed on us by the aids code.  Indeed, we have been treated well under the aids code.</P>
      <P>In relation to what the Senator said about moving away from fixed assets, we are not changing the maximum grants payable.  An application for grants to the IDA is usually a package involving direct fixed assets grants, possibly guarantees, seldom equity participation, also manpower training and marketing.  There may be a <i>jumbleage</i> of grants.  The flexibility being adopted will see the mix evolve.  It is intended to ensure that a proper mix exists in relation to R and D grants and technology acquisition grants. We are going to see a <i>jumbleage</i> of grants.  But we are retaining the limits for the purpose of this Act.</P>

      <P>This section applies to an industrial undertaking in respect of which the Authority are satisfied that it will produce products for sale primarily on the world markets.  Everybody would agree with this.  The export market is the important market.  I could also see a situation where the manufacture of articles for home use would result in savings as regards imports &mdash; in other words, items which are presently being imported could be manufactured here.  That seems to be excluded under this section, help with regard to articles manufactured for home use.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) (c) indicates that it &ldquo;will produce products for sectors of the Irish market which are subject to international competition...&rdquo;. That meets the need mentioned by the Senator.  We are an open economy, of course.  We have to abide by international competitive rules, and indeed the rules of the EC.  We are quite will aware of the <Col N="589" /> development needs of Irish industry in all its aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says and I welcome it &mdash; in other words, where there is competition through imports, the help would be available in that area.</P>
      <P>The industrial undertaking should also satisfy the Authority regarding a number of conditions.  Subsection (4) (c) states it has an adequate equity base.  I feel there are many instances where this would be the big problem, that there would not be an adequate equity base.  There might be individuals or small firms where that would be the basic problem.</P>
      <P>Also, with regard to subsection (4) (d), suitable development plans might be difficult to prepare in some instances, particularly with very small firms.  Under (e), it might be very difficult to prove, at least in the early years, that it would give that extra employment.  Many small firms might lose out in this area.  Is there any special concession in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think it is at the discretion of the IDA to determine what is a sufficient equity base, but many projects failed frankly because they do not have a sufficient equity base.  It has been quite well established that quite a number of firms are over-relying on borrowings.  It is not unreasonable, where the taxpayers money is concerned, to seek a good balance and a fair equity base, whether it is a large or small company.  However, I do not think the IDA would be unduly stringent in that regard.  They do, in my opinion, have a fair responsibility to ensure that adequate equity is injected into the company.  I have seen a good few companies go under because of the lack of an equity base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  However, could the Minister not envisage a situation where somebody with an excellent idea would not comply with that condition of having an equity base?  It seems that in that situation an individual who would not have finance, but who would have some patent, plan or idea and <Col N="590" /> could prove on paper that it would be viable, would not be catered for under this section or, indeed, in the Bill as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there are other possibilities.  There are business development schemes, enterprise allowance schemes, for various small business people.  There is also the possibility of venture capital.  We have to insist on this, not in any harsh manner, but we will have to look after the taxpayers' money as well.  I do not think the IDA have ever been accused in any serious way of refusing to deal with good ideas.  They have been most helpful to many small business people.  Indeed, the regionalisation of small industry and the one-stop shops will go quite some way to advising people who have good ideas about how they can get grants and what is the best avenue.</P>

      <P>I welcome the inclusion of subsection (d).  The Joint Committee on Small Businesses' report on regional and distribution stated that the greatest potential for employment is in the service industries.  We must be more vigilant with regard to guaranteed Irish goods.  There is a scandalous abuse of guaranteed Irish products.  I bought a suit last Christmas twelve months which was supposed to be Irish made.  Hairs started to come out of it and I sent it back to the retailer.  The suit had to be sent back to Germany.  It was labelled as guaranteed Irish.  Companies who have got IDA grant assistance abuse the system to such an extent that they will put a guaranteed Irish label on a suit which was made in Germany.  I would ask the Minister to reassure the House that every step possible, will be taken to eradicate abuses of the guaranteed Irish label.</P>

We are dealing with research grants of an industrial and commercial nature.  We are talking in relation to pre-production research.  It is a difficult area.  In many cases it is only at experimental stage.  I accept the need for them but we cannot take on board in this Bill <Col N="592" /> all of the world of research which is being conducted at universities throughout the world.  The Industrial Development Authority will have to have a common sense, commercial and industrial approach to the research grants they are going to grant aid.

As an island we are surrounded by the sea and we are not able to harness wave energy.  By and large we have made very little headway with regard to solar energy.

A person who contravenes subsection (1), that is with regard to confidential information, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on a summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £800.  Would the Minister agree that this is a very unrealistic figure having regard to the fact that in some instances it might be very remunerative for an individual to disclose confidential information?  If this is a one-off fine of £800, it seems to me that in the circumstances it would be totally inadequate.</P>

      <P>I suppose my answer to that would be that, through the grapevine, a man's credibility with other authorities would be seriously damaged if he was guilty of such an offence.

I agree with the Minister <Col N="595" /> that a person's moral standard in society or in any company would be totally eroded if he were found guilty of such an offence.

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this House about the accident at the nuclear power station at Chernobyl near Kiev in the USSR.  It also gives me the opportunity to reiterate the concerns the Government have been constantly expressing about the safety of the Sellafield operation.  I want to assure the House that we are steadfast in our resolution to pursue unrelentingly our request for the establishment of a European inspection force. The accident at Chernobyl has brought home to the entire world the nightmare and appalling long term consequences which can result from an accident at a nuclear establishment.  We fervently hope that the radioactive plume which has drifted over Scandinavia and has turned back over Eastern Europe and the USSR will dissipate quickly.  We hope with equal fervour that any complacency about safety in the nuclear industry will also be dissipated forever.  The consequences of such accidents have an appalling potential for disaster.  The people of the world have a right to vigilance of the highest degree, constant inspection of facilities, constant review of safety procedures and standards and complete openness about what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> On this question of access to information it is very alarming that the Soviet accident was not disclosed until some days after it happened; and then only after high levels of radioactivity had been detected in Scandinavia.  The amount of information disclosed by the USSR since then is simply not acceptable.  They have an obligation to fully disclose what has happened.  The Irish Government have requested our Embassy in Moscow to get the fullest information possible, about the accident and its effects.</P>
    <P>There is still considerable confusion about the issue.  According to Soviet statements quoted in the media, a reactor building was damaged by an explosion. A fire started.  The reactor was shut down but the graphite in the reactor is still burning.  The Soviets are quoted as saying that two people were killed, 197 people were hospitalised but 49 were later released.  Life was reported to be normal in the nearby city of Kiev.  The Soviets were critical of the western media which they say exaggerated stories of the accident.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, reports from Washington last night claimed that the fire in one reactor was still out of control and that a second reactor may also have been affected.  American reports claimed that graphite was burning in the first reactor at very high temperatures and that radiation levels were also very high.  More recent reports from America suggested that they are not now so certain about the extent of involvement of a second reactor in the accident.</P>
    <P>Whatever the facts, the matter is a disaster of international dimensions. While contamination is greatest in the accident area, fallout has occurred in Scandinavia and in Eastern European countries mainly in Sweden, Denmark, Austria and North Eastern Poland.  It is some consolation that experts in those countries have indicated that the levels of radioactivity were not a hazard to health.</P>
    <P>This House will be aware of the statement issued by the Nuclear Energy Board on 29 April 1986.  The Nuclear Energy Board stated that they had been advised by the Meteorological Service that prevailing weather conditions are unlikely to <Col N="598" /> carry contamination in the direction of Ireland in the immediate future.  The board indicated that there was therefore no reason for the Irish public to be alarmed.  The board are monitoring on a continuing basis and results up to Tuesday show no indications of contamination from the Chernobyl accident.</P>
    <P>The Meteorological Office have informed us that the air around Chernobyl is expected to drift slowly south west during the next few days.  Their forecast for the next seven days shows that this drift is unlikely to come near Ireland.  The office is taking daily samples of the air in Dublin and Valentia and these will be passed to the Nuclear Energy Board for analysis.</P>
    <P>Public concern about incidents at nuclear installations &mdash; even as far away as the USSR &mdash; re-emphasises the point that complacency about anything to do with the nuclear industry is irresponsible in the extreme.</P>
    <P>As a country which does not have nuclear installations itself we feel particularly vulnerable to, and increasingly intolerant of any possible risks to our citizens resulting from the nuclear industry in other countries.  This is particularly so in the case of the United Kingdom, since it is our nearest neighbour, and since the Sellafield plant, the scene of several recent incidents, is so close to this country.</P>
    <P>The Government's position in relation to the Sellafield question is well known and has already been stated in this House. The Government are totally opposed to any discharge of radioactive water into the Irish Sea and want to see these discharges minimised and eliminated as soon as possible using the best available technology.  Any radioactive discharge event, if the level of radioactivity is small, is undesirable and should cease.  The Government recognise that the incidents at Sellafield are, in themselves, of little radiological significance to the Irish population.  However, the frequency of these incidents has caused the Government and the Irish people to lose confidence in the safety of the plant.  The safety record at Sellafield has been less than satisfactory and the frequency of recent <Col N="599" /> incidents poses the possibility of an accident occurring in the future which could have serious consequences for this country.</P>
    <P>The concern of the Government and the Irish public at the operation of Sellafield, particularly in relation to the recent incidents at the plant, has been conveyed to the United Kingdom authorities on a number of occasions, most recently by the Taoiseach to the British Prime Minister and at ongoing meetings of the Ireland/United Kingdom Contact Group on Nuclear Matters which was set up following my meeting in February 1984 with the then United Kingdom Secretary for the Environment, Mr. Patrick Jenkin.</P>
    <P>This House will be aware by now of the Department's view that, as we are being exposed to a potential hazard from an operation outside our jurisdiction, this makes the problem an international one. The view of the Irish Government is that this issue must be resolved by the European Commission under the provisions of the Euratom Treaty.  As I have said the Government are adamant that a European inspection force is necessary to determine independently whether Sellafield can operate safely or whether operations should be suspended or cease until it could be rendered safe.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, the Minister of State, Mr. E. Collins, and I have had separate formal discussions with Commissioner Clinton-Davis about this matter.  In my meeting with the Commissioner on 4 April 1986 I reiterated the Government's call for the establishment of an inspection force, and the Commissioner agreed with this suggestion.</P>
    <P>On 11 April 1986 our Ambassador in Brussels on behalf of the Government, formally requested the Commission to establish a Community Health and Safety (Nuclear Installation) Inspection Force to report to the Commission and in turn to the member states on existing or potential health or safety problems at individual nuclear installations in the Community.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to express the sympathy of the Government and the <Col N="600" /> Irish people to those killed or injured in the Chernobyl accident.</P>

      <P>In the unavoidable absence of our Leader, Senator Michael Lanigan, I would like, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party to thank the Tánaiste for having come to this House at rather short notice to give us this brief explanation as regards this disaster which has occurred in the last few days.  I say a &ldquo;brief explanation&rdquo; because I know that he has given us as much information as is possible to obtain.  We do not wish this disaster on any country.  Had it happened in any other country I am sure there would be much more publicity about it. The Soviet Union are reluctant to give information about what happens there.  I am satisfied that the Minister and his Department have done their very best to get as much information about the Soviet disaster and also about what is happening in Sellafield and that they have given it to us.  What has happened is a frightening thing.  When one does not get any proper news one gets false statements and the people in this country are frightened. Anything we can do to allay their worries is something well worth doing.  It was mentioned that each party could ask a question.  I am not asking a question.  I will leave that to any other member of my party who wants to ask a question.</P>

      <P>I should like to express appreciation to the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy for coming to the House and making a statement on this disturbing incident in Kiev.  I should like to ask the Minister for Energy if we could have an early and up-to-date report on the EC jet project on nuclear fusion.  It is 40 years since the nuclear bomb devastated Hiroshima with the resulting revulsion of caring people throughout the world.  We have been reading about this historical fact.  At this stage it has lost much of its impact on the public awareness.  Can the Tánaiste now say that nuclear energy even for civil and industrial use has been curbed or controlled and is safe, having regard to the fact that our scientists have had 40 years to mould it and do work on <Col N="601" /> it?  Can our population face the future with confidence in the knowledge that our scientists and experts are in control of the situation or can master or mould this important source of energy especially for peaceful means?</P>
      <P>The incident, this week, which has caused so much unease and unrest among all people in the civilised world shows the importance of our Government, our Minister for Foreign Affairs and all our Ministers playing a very significant role of increasing their input into the effort especially at the United Nations to ensure effective nuclear disarmament throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Again, I want to compliment the Tánaiste for his vigilance and the amount of work he has put into the ongoing debate regarding the Sellafield complex. While I accept that the unit is there for the indefinite future, we will be continuing to seek the guarantees that our population will be safe from incidental fallout.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Chairman for trying to explain what I was trying to write into the record of the House this morning about how we should approach this problem.  First of all, I think it would be inappropriate for me now in asking a question if I did not also join with the two previous speakers in thanking the Tánaiste for the way he has applied himself to this problem.  When the House expressed its concern yesterday on two occasions, the Tánaiste, in consultation with the Department, went to extreme lengths to try to elicit for me the information available both from the Eastern Bloc and from the Sellafield Plant.  I want to thank him publicly for having agreed to come to this House today to honour us with his presence and to be forthcoming with us in his explanations of the situation as he has ascertained it from his Department.</P>
      <P>I have a question, Chairman, to ask the Tánaiste which the Leader of the House now expresses delight about.  In the unfortunate event of this country being subjected to wind or rain or some other atmospheric situation over which we, or this Government, have no control &mdash; and the Department of Energy are the controlling Department at the moment, with the Tánaiste at its head and Minister of State, Deputy E. Collins, acting with him &mdash; and in the event of our stations, which are sampling in Dublin and Valentia, giving notice of an unfortunate &ldquo;red alert&rdquo; situation where the samples being taken indicate that precautions should be taken, who is going to be responsible, from the Government point of view through the various agents, for informing the public to ensure, first of all, that we would not have a stampede from Dublin to Galway, or <i>vice versa,</i> or that we might not have a stampede from Dublin to the south east of the country which would create further problems.  Who is going to be responsible for co-ordinating it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment already have a nucleus of civil defence units throughout the country.  I want to pay tribute to them, as a member of a local authority, who knows what they have been doing in this area.  They have <Col N="603" /> issued some comments to the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; already of what they would do. Can I take it that the Department of Energy, as a co-ordinating body, will involve the Department of the Environment and the Civil Defence in coping with the problems and that the Departments of Health and Agriculture will then alert the Animal Health Council.  Today they are setting up an advisory body on how to deal with the problems together with the producers' bodies and the consumer bodies.  Somebody has to be responsible.  The Tánaiste and I can tell them at constituency level.</P>

Perhaps the Tánaiste would clear up that point.  Perhaps he has given some thought to it.  I want to thank the Tánaiste again for coming in to us.</P>

I intend, in fact, to amend the rules to some degree in my contribution, <Col N="604" /> which will be extremely brief.  In the last few days the peoples in all parts of the world have been shocked and shaken by the devastating consequences of further accidents at nuclear plants, this time in the USSR.  Because of our proximity to Sellafield and the threat that that continues to pose to Ireland and to people in the UK, have the Government any proposals to deal with this matter at EC level and also to try to have it raised at world fora and particularly, perhaps, in the United Nations?  It seems to me that quite a number of those nuclear plants in different parts of the world are now becoming obsolete, very aged and even more prone to accident than we were led to believe up to quite recently.  Because of this and the threat that Sellafield presents to Ireland as a whole, will the Government be extending their efforts wider than just the European Community to try to get world opinion against these developments in other parts of the world?</P>

      <P>I, too, ask your indulgence to speak very briefly on the issue. To judge by some of the comments of previous speakers from my own perspective, I regard what has happened in Chernobyl in the last week to be among the most serious and significant events that has faced the population of the world in decades, because the impossible has happened.  As one who has been engaged in opposing nuclear technology since the late seventies when it was proposed at that stage to build our very own nuclear power station in Carnsore Point in the south-east, I remember very well the attitude that was prevalent among the so-called experts at that time.  Those who opposed the technology were regarded as somehow illiterate Luddites who could not understand that this was a perfectly safe technology that had been researched and investigated.  It is quite clear now that the impossible has occurred and that we have invested right around the globe in the potential for the annihilation of mankind.</P>

      <P>I will ask a last question. Thank you for your indulgence on it. People have congratulated the Tánaiste for coming here.  It is important that we address this most significant issue.  I would end by saying that the technology has proven to be flawed and faulty, as we predicted some decades ago.  Is it now the intention of the Government to rally European support to phase out this dangerous technology and to look for alternative sources of energy to replace, over a period, this proven flawed, dangerous technology?</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I would like to thank the Senators for their welcome.  I am always glad of the opportunity of addressing this House.  I hope not to have the opportunity of being a Member for a long time to come.  Senator McDonald asked if we would consider making information available on the jet projects.  If the House want a discussion on that I will certainly make arrangements and get information to this House on the EC project as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to give general advice as to the safety of nuclear plants.  As I said in the course of my contribution, I have said publicly for many months as we do not have a nuclear installation and do not have the benefits, then we should not have the risks and we should not have to live with the fears of the possible adverse consequences of nuclear problems in other countries.  We cannot afford to be any less vigilant in relation to the standards which we seek to impose upon other countries.  We are acting perfectly <Col N="606" /> within our rights as a sovereign State in seeking to impose the highest possible standards of safety which, I assume, we would impose on ourselves if we had nuclear technology in this country.</P>
    <P>I can allay Senator Ferris's fears in relation to the Government response in the event of a disaster similar to the Chernobyl happening in the vicinity of this country.  I can assure him that the Government would take the appropriate steps in the dissemination of information and that the sub-committee of the Government which would cope with disasters or emergency situations &mdash; which I think was taken rather by surprise in the winter of 1981 &mdash; would not be found to be wanting on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith asked, in relation to the question, if the Government are satisfied as to how we are seeking to act within the EC and should we not look in the United Nations context.  I believe that, first, we should at least seek to use every opportunity within the EC.  We have not as yet completed the process within the EC Commission and possibly within the European Court.  I believe that the proper context outside the EC would be the International Energy Agency.  That would be a body where these matters are discussed with frequency and at which we are represented.  It would be our intention to ensure that those matters are raised with the experts in this area of the International Energy Agency.</P>
    <P>Senator Howlin referred to the question of faulty technology.  I would have to admit that I am not an expert on whether the technology is faulty or otherwise.  It bears out the point that we have to insist, and ensure that our insistence does not fall on deaf ears, on maximum safety standards being applied to the nuclear power stations and the reprocessing plants.</P>
    <P>In relation to the diplomatic procedures which have been engaged in, as I said earlier, we asked the Irish Embassy in Moscow to seek out the maximum information available.  I think the Senator will appreciate the difficulties which the Irish State may have in this area when you <Col N="607" /> realise the other countries involved and the fact that countries directly affected would seem to have had little impact in terms of eliciting information from the Soviet Union on this occasion.  I am not in a position to answer the direct question as to whether the Soviet Ambassador in Dublin has been contacted but I believe that the procedure through our own Embassy in Moscow may have been the direct procedure.</P>

      <P>I will facilitate the House and confine my contribution to not more than 20 minutes to facilitate the other two Members who want to contribute.</P>
      <P>Some of the preliminary remarks I made with regard to the Vredeling report on the last occasion apply equally well, I feel, in this situation.  It is a very specialised area, an area in which I do not have any great expertise, and I feel that to make a meaningful contribution it would be necessary to have experience of some kind in that area or to have made a special study of that area.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Minister of State, Deputy E. Collins, I felt that his contribution on the last occasion was very succinct and positive and I want to put on record that I am grateful to the Minister for letting me have the text of his speech.  It is no harm to state at the start of my contribution the basis for this recommendation.  It relates to Article 54.3(g) of the Treaty of Rome.  It is not very lengthy and I would like to quote it: Article 54.1 states:</P>
      <P>Before the end of the first stage the Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Assembly, draw up a general programme for the abolition of existing restrictions on freedom of establishment within the Community.  The Commission shall submit its proposal to the Council during the first two years of the first stage.</P>
      <P>Section 3 states:</P>
      <P>The Council and the Commission shall carry out the duties devolving upon them under the preceding provisions, in particular:</P>
      <P>Paragraph (g) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>by co-ordinating to the necessary extent the safeguards which, for the <Col N="609" /> protection of the interests of the members and others, are required by Member States of companies or firms within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>Article 58 states:</P>
    <P>Companies or firms formed in accordance with the law of a Member State and having the registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the Community shall, for the purposes of this Chapter, be treated in the same way as natural persons who are nationals of Member States.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Companies or firms&rdquo; means companies or firms constituted under civil or commercial law, including co-operative societies and other legal persons governed by public or private law, save for those which are non-profit-making.</P>
    <P>I would not be doing an injustice to Minister of State, Deputy Collins, with regard to his contribution if I said quite bluntly that he poured cold water on the directive.  I think that would be a reasonable conclusion.  In the light of his analysis of the situation I would have to agree with that conclusion.  The conclusion is summarised very neatly towards the end of his speech and I would like to quote it.  He stated:</P>
    <P>... there is no broad demand in this country for the proposals, which are based on Continental European law; second, the proposals would not, in many instances, suit the Irish situation; third, the proposals would cause major disruption of current management practices; fourth, some of the proposals may prove to be too cumbersome for the smaller plc's; fifth, the proposals could slow down the decision making process and could adversely affect the competitiveness of Irish industry with a consequent adverse effect on employment; and finally, the proposals could affect the level of investment in Irish industry ...</P>
    <P>That is clearcut and straightforward. <Col N="610" /> With regard to the committee's conclusions, I think that, broadly speaking, they will be somewhat similar.</P>
    <P>The committee came to the conclusion that some degree of co-operation was necessary between employees and employers.  It is fair to say when dealing with this report that in my view we are dealing with the employer aspect whereas with the Vredeling report we were dealing more or less with the employee situation and consultations in that area.</P>
    <P>On paye 14 of their report, the joint committee stated that it:</P>
    <P>... acknowledges the importance of proceeding in this area by way of a Council Directive and broadly speaking it would accept the proposals of the draft Directive as providing a legislative framework within which both sides of industry would be encouraged to find agreement.</P>
    <P>Reservations are expressed throughout the report and in my brief contribution I hope to refer to these.</P>
    <P>I would also like to pay tribute to all the members of the joint committee, 18 Deputies and seven Senators, and being a member myself of an Oireachtas Joint Committee I know the onerous work involved and I know the problem there is in attending the different meetings and finding the time.  I had that problem yesterday with the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  Therefore, I want to pay a tribute to all the members and a particular tribute to Senator Mary Robinson who chaired the subcommittees.</P>
    <P>The Fifth Directive was published in August 1983.  The proposed directive is one of a series of ten dealing with company law, several of which have already been adopted by the Council of Ministers and of which two have been implemented by Irish legislation.  The report gives details of the area that has been amended.  One is the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983, and the other is the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1985.  It also lists the other areas which have still to be taken under statute law. This means a very heavy workload in the immediate years ahead to catch up on <Col N="611" /> this situation.  One could ask why only two have been implemented in that space of time.  One of them goes back to 1968, the Council Directive on the Disclosure and Validity of Obligations and Nullity of Companies.  Another one goes back to 1978.  It begs the question as to why these have not already been implemented.</P>
    <P>Since the appearance of the proposed Fifth Directive in its original form in 1972 it has been the subject of controversy. From the debate here it is easy to see that this controversy is going to continue. There are two conflicting interests trying to find a common goal.  The overall feeling of the committee is that some common ground must be found and that it is possible to find that common ground. It goes back to 1972.  At that time we had only six members in the Community; since then this number has been doubled, which has also brought problems.  We had the revised version of the directive which appeared last year.  It incorporates many of the suggestions of the European Parliament which adopted an opinion on the original proposal in May 1982 and presumably brought it up to date as regards the feelings of the other member states who joined since 1972.</P>
    <P>The revised version has been under examination by a Council working group since December 1983 and it is expected that consideration at this level will take considerable time.  Obviously, it will take some time to find that common ground. When this Government are making an input in this area with the feedback from Ireland towards this directive, I wonder will the contributions in this House be taken into consideration, I wonder will the feelings of individual Members or the general feeling of the House be put forward.  I hope they would be.</P>
    <P>It is important to pay tribute to all the organisations which made submissions to this committee &mdash; the Federated Union of Employers, the Federation of Irish Industry, the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as well as the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the <Col N="612" /> Department of Labour.  These are the same organisations that made submissions for the Vredeling report.  Before we discussed the Vredeling report a decision was made that it would be better to discuss these reports independently. With my limited knowledge and the information I have gained since then, I think a good case could have been made to discuss both reports together.  Many of the suggestions made in this report also relate to the Vredeling report, in particular the threshold of 1,000 employees.  This applies to both.  So, we are dealing with large companies, although in situations where we have smaller subsidiaries in different states I suppose the cumulative numbers will apply rather than the different subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>The draft directive contains a number of significant proposals dealing with the structural functions of companies and other issues within the area of company law which would apply to all public limited companies.  For that reason I believe it is a very specialised area.  When we come to deal with the structure and function of the board as suggested by the directive, I think we are in one of the most complicated of the specialised areas because we are dealing with suggestions for a two-tier basis.  The report tells us that if the proposed directive is adopted it would be necessary to enact national legislation so as to enable public limited companies to be organised on a two-tier basis, with a management organ responsible for the running of the day-to-day affairs of the company under the supervision of a supervisory organ.</P>
    <P>The significance of a two-tier system is that the supervisory section is separate from the management.  An alternative to the two-tier system is allowed.  This is the one-tier system in which the management and the supervisory members would be incorporated in the one system. Employee participation is covered very well.  The proposed directive sets out a number of options for employee participation and supervision of the management of a company in all areas.</P>
    <P>This is a very comprehensive part.  The <Col N="613" /> provisions relating to employee participation apply only to public limited companies employing 1,000 or more people. In calculating that figure it is allowable to include the subsidiary groups.  This is a proviso which can be accepted or rejected by the parent company.</P>
    <P>I also note in the report that it is possible for the subsidiary sections to adopt or reject the rules which related to the parent company and to draw up a code of rules of their own.  This was referred to also in the Vredeling report.  It is a difficult area.  The committee came to the conclusion that a legislative basis is essential.  While a voluntary code would be recommended it is most unlikely without the legislative basis that anything worthwhile could be achieved or decided on.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt very well with the problems related to the directive and Irish law.  The committee came to the conclusion that the directive contains a number of significant provisions dealing with a wide range of conventional company law issues which are at variance with the more stringent laws, and they are more stringent than existing Irish law and practice, while some few were less demanding.  If it is adopted in its present terms the directive will necessitate the amendment of the Company Acts, 1963 to 1983, which for any Government would be a major undertaking.  Regarding the structure and functions of the board and the comparison of the two-tier systems, the Minister has pointed out very well that the two-tier system is based on German practice and the position in the Netherlands in 1972.</P>
    <P>It is argued in the directive and by those who are in favour of it that it is the structure which offers the most satisfactory safeguards for shareholder and employee interests.  Companies will have the option of adopting the one-tier system, and the revised draft envisages that companies would have this right. This is really Hobson's choice, because we are told in the report that they would never be obliged to accept the formal division of management and supervisory functions which differentiate the two-tier <Col N="614" /> system as against the single one.  While on the surface they seem to have that choice in reality they do not have a choice, because the essential feature of the two-tier system must be implemented in any event.</P>
    <P>The two-tier system is the one which in various forms applies in Ireland.  The board of directors is appointed by and answerable to the shareholders at the general meeting.  The Minister had extreme reservations with regard to the conditions which apply to the annual general meeting.  In the event of some omission of a technical or inconsequential nature the annual general meeting could be declared null and void.  That would be a most unsatisfactory situation.  With my limited knowledge of company law, it would have to be gone into in much greater detail with regard to the two systems and the obligations of companies with regard to the systems and the options which they would have in reality.</P>
    <P>As well as the Minister having reservations about the directive, those involved on the employer side have also had reservations.  The Federated Union of Employers and the Confederation of Irish Industry are opposed to the imposition of a two-tier system.  Both of them consider that the two-tier system would lead to confusion and delay when the need is for flexibility and flair in adapting to changing circumstances.  The Department of Industry and Commerce do not see any particular merit in a two-tier system or in the formal separation of functions in a one-tier system and consider that considerable changes would be required in current management functions by the mandatory imposition of either.</P>
    <P>While the directive has been largely revised and amended since it was initiated in 1972, it seems that much greater amendment is necessary to make it more flexible, certainly as it would apply to Irish conditions.  In this House we are mainly concerned with the conditions here and we would be apprehensive regarding the views of the committee that in some ways implementation of the directive in its present form could result <Col N="615" /> in discouraging outside firms who might be thinking of coming here.  We would have to guard against that.</P>
    <P>The committee took the view that employee participation is important. This, one could say, compares with marriage.  It is a twin-engined machine and both engines have to be functioning properly to make it work.  This applies very well here.  The employees and the employers are important.  They are both indispensable.  On that basis the approach should be made to try to resolve the problem to satisfy the conditions in this country.</P>
    <P>The committee stated categorically that traditional patterns in this country with regard to company law would have to be changed and that the laws relating to companies would have to reflect the change of underlying philosophy and include provisions expressly dealing with relationships between providers of capital and the management of employees. That underlines the point I was trying to make.</P>
    <P>I will curtail my contribution in order to facilitate the other Members who want to contribute.  I will not go into some of the other aspects of the matter I had intended to bring up.  I was very impressed with the contribution the Minister made.  In motions of this kind the usual procedure in this House is that the Minister replies at the end.  If we were to compare one method with the other there is a lot to be said for that method.  Yet by coming in at that stage the Minister gives a clearer picture from his expertise and from his greater knowledge.  In this situation he helped me in formulating my views with regard to the situation. Broadly, I see that employee participation is needed.  Provision will have to be made for that and I would agree with the Minister that it should be made within the context of helping the situation as regards industry and employment in this country.  I thank all the members of the committee and I welcome the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>This report falls into quite an unusual category.  Generally <Col N="616" /> reports are welcomed and they reflect the positive views of the members of the committee.  This report is a result of very painstaking work undertaken diligently by Senator Robinson, the chairperson of the subcommittee, and members of that committee.  The directive the report is based on is one that does not appeal to a considerable cross-section of the people to whom I have spoken.  Since we joined the EC, since the mid-seventies, there has been an amount of social industrial legislation.  Looking back over the last eight years it is not too clear whether a lot of that was particularly suitable to the Irish mentality or to the prevailing situation in this country.  I do not think one could say all that legislation had combined to provide either additional job opportunities or greater profits.  Yet, it represents an advance on the conditions in the work place.</P>
      <P>Much of this legislation, although entirely desirable, should be balanced very carefully with the situation that its implementation will bring about.  As far as this Fifth Company Law Directive is concerned, the Federated Union of Employers and the Confederation of Irish Industry are opposed to the imposition of a two-tier system as envisaged by this directive.  Both considered that a two-tier board would lead to confusion and delay when the need is for flexibility and flair in adapting to changing circumstances.  Indeed, the Department of Industry and Commerce do not see any particular merit in a two-tier structure, or in the form of separation of functions in a one-tier system, and considers that a considerable change would be required in current management functions by the mandatory imposition of either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint committee thought that the separation of management and supervisory functions is necessary, at least in the Commission's view, to strengthen the shareholder control of management and also to facilitate employee participation in the decision-making process at company level.  The joint committee are not satisfied that a formal separation of functions would have any particular advantage over the present system for <Col N="617" /> this country as far as the management and control of companies is concerned. As the report says, the question then arises whether such separation of functions would facilitate the introduction of employee participation in decision making if such is considered desirable. The separation of supervisory and management functions might open the door to participation by employees in the former.  The committee noted that, not surprisingly, the development of participation in relation to decision-making bodies is most advanced in countries where the dual system operates.</P>
    <P>The main thrust in this country should be towards the expansion of industry in an effort to provide for the large number of people who are unemployed and to provide interesting and remunerative job opportunities for the large number of suitably educated young people coming on the the labour market each year.  I believe that every effort should be made to endeavour to make it easier for employers to take on more young people. We have not been able to strike a balance between the interests of the employees and the industrialists.  I do not mean those people who are trained and who are well established.  Employers are very apprehensive sometimes about taking on new recruits or young people.  They cite, sometimes very unfairly, the social legislation which makes it more difficult for them to let people off or to change.  I should like to see some better system introduced whereby it would be possible to have an expansion of the AnCO type training courses more closely related to ordinary industrial operations.  We should try to get back to something more akin to the apprenticeship situation that we had.  I do not mean that we should reintroduce the apprenticeship type remuneration that we had in this and other countries for far too long.  Young people should have more flexibility in finding an niche for a career.  I do not think it is good enough that people should be steered into a particular type of industrial employment and not given an opportunity of experiencing other types of related industrial work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> I share the view of the Department of Industry and Commerce who have expressed some opposition to this directive.  I also feel that the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Federated Union of Employers have made the point very clearly as far as this company law directive is concerned.  Some are inclined to think that each piece of legislation that emanates from Europe should be accepted and implemented.  There needs to be greater energy directed towards altering and tailoring these directives to fit into the Irish situation in a positive way.  Each directive should be adopted only if it makes a positive contribution to employment, to the quality of life for people who are employed and to the profitability of industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to the debate on this report.  As has already been mentioned, this report is, in effect, linked to the report on the proposed Vredeling Directive which we debated in this House last week.  Like Senator Fitzsimons, I believe it might have been helpful if we could have debated them together.  However, they do fall within the responsibilities of different Ministers and it was decided to take them separately in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the linkage is not only because of the question of employee participation.  It is also possible to note that the two proposed directives have had a somewhat similar progress, or rather lack of progress, at the European level.  Like the so-called Vredeling proposal for a directive, this proposal for a Fifth Company Law Directive has been around for a long time.  It was first put forward as a draft proposal in 1972, before Ireland joined the European Community.  The draft which the joint committee considered was a substantially revised draft which was put forward in 1983, following not only the extensive examination and views of the European Parliament Economic and Social Committee, but also following a process which the Commission instituted of having a Green Paper on Employee Participation, which <Col N="619" /> examined the company law system and the extent to which there was employee participation in the different member states.  They discussed the various models which existed.  They discussed the issues which arose and invited comments on that.  Therefore, there has been a very considerable amount of discussion at the European level.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view expressed by the Minister and by others that this is quite a radical proposal, but I am somewhat disappointed at the tone of the Minister's contribution to this debate.  He appears to be very reluctant to embark on the particular values which lie behind this directive and to be concerned in a defensive way about the implications without addressing some of the problems which we have at the moment under our existing company law.</P>
    <P>We have very real problems.  We have had some extremely bad experiences with large companies in recent years.  We should ask ourselves if we are entirely happy with our industrial relations with our company law structure with participation by employees such as it may be. The approach of the joint committee, in the report as adopted, is more positive in relation to the Fifth Company Law Directive than my reading of the Minister's contribution.  I have to confess that I read the Minister's speech, I was not present when he delivered it.  Sometimes one can read a more negative attitude into the written word than might have been present in the Minister's tone of voice.  He appeared to see difficulties in Ireland accepting either the separation of the functions, and not necessarily the separation of the two-tiered board proposed in the company law structure part of it, but equally in the employee participation which is envisaged in that new company structure.</P>
    <P>I would like to come back to the approach of the joint committee and argue for very serious consideration of this measure of company law reform.  I would take the point made by Senator McDonald.  It is important that in looking <Col N="620" /> at proposals from the European Community that we scrutinise them very rigorously and that we do not just accept them because they have been proposed from Brussels, that we ensure that what is envisaged does, either when drafted or when amended, improve and fit the Irish context.  I believe the values implicit in this proposal are something of merit to the development of company law and employee participation in Ireland.  In other words, I would urge the House to accept what is the more positive approach of the joint committee in this report and to seek more rapid progress at Community level in this proposal for a Fifth Directive in Company Law.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to go into detail at this stage in the debate on the scope of the proposals.  Although there is a clear distinction between the part of the directive which is dealing with the structure and functions of the board and the provisions in relation to employee participation there is obviously a clear linkage between them.</P>
    <P>The revised proposals &mdash; I am taking three proposals &mdash; in relation to the structure and functions of the board are much more flexible.  This can be done in the context of a one-tier board.  It can be fitted into the company law tradition which we have.  We have to ask ourselves if we are satisfied with performance by company boards, whether we are satisfied that our present structure is adequate.  Serious questions arise, particularly in the light of some of the extremely bad experiences we have had with large companies in recent years.</P>
    <P>The distinction between the functions of supervision and management is a very clear and logical one which need not and is not intended to become a bureaucratic and dead hand on a company.  It is not intended to prevent the kind of flexibility which would allow a company to engage in rapid decision making but it would be a clear identification of and taking responsibility for these separate functions.</P>
    <P>Equally, in relation to the other main pillar of this proposed directive the actual <Col N="621" /> proposals in relation to employee participation have become much more flexible because, as is set out in paragraph 6 of the report, there are various options in relation to employee participation.  A member state may adopt whichever of the options would be most suitable to the particular tradition.  What was most striking to the members of the subcommittee who heard representations from both sides of industry and from the Department but particularly from the two sides of industry on this measure, was that the representations made echoed very much the representations made in relation to the Vredeling Directive.  There were totally opposing views on the merits of the directive from both sides.  The union side were not only advocating support for employee participation as envisaged here but also criticising the watering down of this directive.  From the FUE and CII there was opposition to a measure which they saw as bringing a degree of inflexibility, bureaucracy and potential unattractiveness for industrial location in Ireland.  Certainly as the person who chaired the two subcommittees dealing with these reports, I can say it calls us to consider attitudes to the running of companies here, to the assumption of responsibility in relation to that running, above all perhaps to accountability for the actions of those who have that responsibility.  There did not seem to be an openness to considering the underlying values and to really examining whether there would be an improvement in relation to the area of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>It is clear in the report, when you come to the views of the joint committee, which are inserted separately in relation to the board structure, separation of the supervisory and management functions and the section in relation to employee participation that the joint committee favour the introduction of these developments into our company law, that with some amendments we would support the adoption of the Fifth Company Law Directive.  In that regard the joint committee had the <Col N="622" /> opportunity to assess the kind of considerations which were advanced in relation to the directive and, in particular, the viewpoint put forward in relation to employee participation.  There did not appear to be any faith in the greater involvement and sharing of responsibility by employees improving the management and working of the company.  This is encapsulated in the view expressed by the Confederation of Irish Industry which is referred to at paragraph 21 of the report and states:</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry has expressed the opinion that &ldquo;the unity board structure containing representatives elected by shareholders and employees would tend to promote conflict rather that consensus in the board room&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is a statement which bears examining.  It says much about pre-conceptions. If it is accurate, then we should be very concerned about it.  If it is not accurate, then it appears to be an extremely defensive approach to the possibility of reform.</P>
    <P>The view of the joint committee on that point was a very different one.  It was more in line with the view expressed by the Minister for Labour in 1980 in the context of the Government's discussion paper on worker participation where the contrary belief was expressed as follows:</P>
    <P>That workers' involvement will help to reduce the tensions which very often lead to industrial strife.</P>
    <P>That is the approach which the joint committee endorse and adopt in relation to this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister made it clear at the end of his speech to this House in the debate which commenced last week that the proposal for this draft Fifth Company Law Directive is under consideration and is receiving, in effect a slow First Reading at Community level.  He envisages substantial changes before the matter will be finalised at Community level.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the proposal has not generated more active debate in Ireland about employee participation.  It is significant that neither the Government's <Col N="623" /> White Paper which was issued in 1980, nor this proposal for a Fifth Company Law Directive has generated that debate for reasons which do not reflect that well on either of the social partners in an institutional sense.  We do not have a healthy debate about democracy in the work place, democratic decision making, accountability and assumption of responsibility in relation to the operation of companies.</P>
    <P>The worries expressed by the Minister in his speech about the implementation of the directive being a possible deterrent to location of industry here is not really borne out by the facts of the case.  If the Fifth Company Law Directive is passed at European Community level, then it will have to be applied in the 12 member states of the Community.  It will become the norm in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The advantages for companies outside the Community in having a company established within the EC and having access to the huge Community market far outweigh technical considerations in relation to how particular proposals for company structure will work.  It is of enormous advantage to the Japanese, the United States and to other third countries to locate and operate within the EC.</P>
    <P>We would be competing on equal terms with our Community partners in that regard.  It is difficult to see how it would prejudice us in that respect.  I believe what we would have to gain is significant. We would gain company law structure and involvement by employees which would bring about a much healthier relationship of identification with the company or enterprise and with decisions in relation to future development of that company or enterprise.  It would require on the management side a greater accountability and involvement of, and consideration for the interests of employees in that development.  Given the state of company law development and indeed the problems in recent years in Ireland, this would be very healthy and welcome indeed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it may be a question of which Department deal with a measure.  I tend <Col N="624" /> to be of the view that if the Minister who had responsibility for this proposed directive, had been, for example, the Minister for Labour &mdash; I am not talking about personalities here but about the viewpoint of a Department &mdash; advised by his officers in the Department of Labour, there might have been a great deal more enthusiasm for the thrust of the directive. I certainly hope that at Community level we will not be stalling on progress in that regard and that we will have more courage in our convictions, that the values in this directive are worth moving ahead with, that it may need some amendment and modification to make it fit the Irish system but that we have a lot to learn and gain from the kind of thinking behind this proposal and its adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the chairperson of the subcommittee, Senator Robinson, and the other members of the subcommittee for producing such an excellent report before us today on the vital question of worker participation either in the EC context or in an Irish context.  It is very much in accord with the broad points of the Vredeling Directive which we discussed last week and which by and large, we saw as something very appropriate maybe in the longer term but not necessarily very practical in the shorter term.  Last week we discussed the Vredeling Directive which had to do with the whole area of consultation by workers in companies.  Today we are talking about actual participation which is a step further.  I totally support the principle of worker participation in companies as proposed in this directive. I must state that there are a number of very positive arguments against its application in the way the Fifth Directive is set out.  We are talking in the Fifth Directive in the context of companies with 1,000 employees and upwards.  Of course, there is provision for member states to apply this to a fewer number of persons if that is considered the practical thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go over the ground which the joint committee have very ably <Col N="625" /> covered.  The whole purpose of committees is defeated if one is traversing the same ground the committees have covered.  It is a matter, therefore, that we should pick out from the committee's recommendations and suggestions what is relevant and what is in our view acceptable and unacceptable as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The joint committee had the benefit of advice and submissions from the various involved interests such as the Federated Union of Employers, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, the various congresses of trade unions as well as the department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Labour.  For that reason, the report presented to us is a very balanced one. Indeed the committee in their report acknowledge the help and co-operation of the various agencies.</P>
    <P>The directive, as proposed, has a number of limitations which could take from the attractiveness of outside investment in Ireland.  It is something which we must be mindful of at all stages.  We must balance what is desirable and what is proper in having worker involvement against what will be acceptable to would-be investors here.  There is no doubt that there are many outside bodies who would have reservations about certain aspects of this directive.  There are many outside bodies that would have a certain amount of reservations about certain aspects of this directive.  It is not always realised by members of unions and their representatives that worker participation is vitally important.  I am convinced that with effective worker participation on boards there is a greater likelihood of those boards being dynamic, successful and in fact, being energetic in their pursuits of their business.  Frankly, we have a situation very often where workers looking at management from a distance do not appreciate or realise the many difficulties and pitfalls that do exist.  There is little opportunity for companies to survive in the absence of that appreciation.  People working for a company, whether it is 1,000, 1,200 people, or whatever, are <Col N="626" /> more committed to the success of the company if they are personally involved in it and have a clear understanding of what is going on.  The unknown tends to create doubt in people's minds and they are not prepared to accept the reality of the position.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I would like to refer to briefly.  Senator Robinson made reference to employee participation in the various options that are put forward by the directive.  As has been stated earlier, a two-tier system is, in fact, most unworkable.  Unless there is a single-tier arrangement whereby workers and management operate together in a non-confused way, there will not be success at the end of the day.  That is one aspect of the directive which must be left aside.  The separation of management and workers causes lack of understanding and appreciation of problems that may exist. It is important to put on record that very often management do not totally appreciate the problems of the workers, just as very often the workers do not appreciate the difficulties and problems that confront management, whether it is a limited company or a co-operative society covered by this directive.  I would appeal to all concerned at management and worker levels to ensure better mutual understanding of the problems that exist for each member.  Due to time problems, I will conclude by saying that this directive as proposed has a great deal of merit, but I do not think it has relevance at this point in time to be applied in this country.</P>

      <P>Senator McAuliffe-Ennis on the matter on the Adjournment &mdash; The operation of the means test in the Civil Legal Aid and Advice Scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenaMcAuliffeEnnis" hpid="Mrs. McAuliffe-Ennis Mrs. McAuliffe-Ennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McAuliffe-Ennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you for allowing me time to discuss this matter this afternoon.  I am aware, and undoubtedly the Minister is aware, that there are many problems relating to the civil legal aid and advice scheme. Those concerns will be more fully discussed here today, briefly indeed, and even more so in the context of the motion already tabled in the names of Senators McGuinness and Robinson.  I have agreed to share this time, I might add, with Senator Robinson.  I intend to deal with one aspect of the scheme and Senator Robinson will deal with other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to direct the spotlight on one aspect of the scheme which is causing major problems for literally hundreds of people, that is, the means test and the limits placed on income in order to qualify for civil legal aid under the scheme. This matter, as the Minister is well aware, will worsen should the proposed constitutional amendment succeed.  In that context there is urgent need for attention. The scheme is intended to assist persons of little or modest means who may or may not be in a position to pay some contribution towards the cost of legal fees incurred but who would otherwise not have the ability to pay for private legal assistance in such areas as family problems, landlord and tenant problems, consumer protection, making a will, etc.  This scheme, which makes the services of solicitors and if necessary barristers available, is vital to those who wish to assert their basic rights in a professional and competent manner.  But because the means test ceiling of £3,500 disposable income has not been improved since February 1981, there are many who now find themselves ineligible and therefore <Col N="628" /> without proper representation in guarding their rights.  I realise that some modifications were made to the means test in 1983.  The reality is that the numbers being refused on the grounds of financial ineligibility are rising.  In 1983, for example, 25.8 per cent of applicants were deemed ineligible for financial reasons. That figure increased to 35.7 per cent in 1984.  Coupled with the fact that even those on social welfare payments &mdash; for example, deserted wives &mdash; are being deemed ineligible, it is obvious that the scheme now fails to cater for those of low means never mind those of modest means.</P>
    <P>Now is the time urgently to review the situation and, indeed, for the future a system to keep it in line with real increases should be devised.  The Minister, in being fully aware not only of this particular problem but of all the problems in the scheme, is undoubtedly sympathetic and will recognise the need for urgency and respond accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is, for example, a matter of urgency for one particular person that I know whose rights are being downtrodden to say the least.  She has a custody order in her favour.  Her husband has removed the children from her care and because he does not comply fully with the maintenance order she has not the means to engage professional help.  She is ineligible under the means test for civil legal aid, even though she has no personal income and is now in the horrendous situation that she cannot have a legal custody order enforced.  In other words, the law is not being complied with.  She is the victim of that breach and has no means of using the law to ensure that her legally defined rights in relation to her family are carried through.</P>
    <P>The civil legal aid board themselves are aware that this specific area, the means test, is causing grave hardship and indeed are under increasing public pressure and criticism in that the necessity for these services is felt most acutely by the poorest section of the community.  The board in their report show that 11,000 people availed of the scheme over the period 1983-1984.  Indeed, one must congratulate <Col N="629" /> them and recognise the importance of that service to those 11,000 people.  Equally, however, one must be aware that there are many more who will be unable to avail of this scheme and will therefore be in the most awful position of presenting themselves in court or perhaps taking matters into their own hands which they are not competent to deal with and by so doing may even make matters worse for themselves.  The alternative is to live and to continue on in a country without any help to defend oneself against the system which for those in that position now works against them.  I will hand over now to Senator Robinson.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity given me by Senator McAuliffe-Ennis to join in raising this matter on the Adjournment and I am aware that it is possibly quite a broad matter and adverting to the fact as Senator McAuliffe-Ennis has already mentioned, that there is a motion down to have a full discussion of all the issues which I hope will be taken for early debate in the House and in fairness to the Minister who has only ten or 15 minutes to respond to the matter, I am going to be both brief and narrow in the points that I will raise at this stage in support of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not agree strongly enough with Senator McAuliffe-Ennis about the difficulties that have arisen in relation to the means test as it applies at the moment within the civil legal aid scheme.  I am aware through FLAC, I am aware as a practitioner, I am aware from solicitors complaining about it that the numbers of incredible hardship cases that are arising have increased greatly in recent months. For example, a deserted wife with six children is probably ineligible for legal aid.  That is absurd.  How could a deserted wife with six children be able to afford to employ a solicitor?  This is about independent income.  That is the stage we have got to.  People on social welfare with a number of children are excluded because of the lack of variation of the income limit.  There has been no increase in that in real terms since 1981.  That harsh situation is combined with the fact that there <Col N="630" /> is a real problem of staffing in the law centres.  They have suffered very badly from the policy of recruiting only one in three in the law centres.  I know that there has been some concession made in this but nonetheless it means that law centres have to close altogether from time to time or have to postpone dealing with cases &mdash; family law cases &mdash; for an intolerably long time.  Those are all problems I hope to develop at greater length when we come back to the full debate on this issue in response to the motion tabled by Senator McGuinness and myself.</P>
    <P>The issue that is of critical urgency and should not have to wait is the question of revising the means test under the scheme. This is a non-statutory scheme.  The Minister does not even have to make a statutory instrument.  He has complete discretion as to what he does about it.  In his response I would welcome it if the Minister would give the House an indication of how often this is reviewed.  Does it come up for automatic review?  Is account taken of the numbers who are turned away at the moment?  Is account taken of the fact that recipients of social welfare who have a number of children are inexorably now above the income limit and cannot qualify and do not qualify? How is it that no adjustment has been made since 1981?  Surely it must have been clear that this was going to have a harsh effect on an increasing number of people.  This is the main purpose of raising the issue.  Senator McAuliffe-Ennis has referred to one case that she had in mind which brought it home to her but I would certainly like to support her on the broader issue and, as it will be clear from the motion, it is time this scheme was put on a statutory footing because there are a number of other problems relating to it.  I hope the Minister will respond favourably to the call for an immediate revision of the means test for civil legal aid.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the two Senators for raising this matter and I will limit myself mainly to the points that are at issue today without venturing too far on to a more <Col N="631" /> general response to the motion that is on the Seanad Order Paper, although there are one or two things I would like to say very briefly about that without prejudice of course to fuller discussion at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I take the point that it has been quite some time since there has been a general revision of the means test limits in the scheme.  It has been pointed out, and I would like to emphasise this fact, that some important changes were made in some of the means test provisions in 1983, the most important of those being a new provision giving the Legal Aid Board a discretion to make legal services available to eligible applicants in receipt of certain social welfare benefits and allowances for a maximum contribution of £15 for legal aid which could cover the cost of providing legal aid services in a case that might go as far as the Supreme Court.  That change was welcomed by the board and by a grant many people outside of the board as representing a very substantial improvement in the operation of the means test.</P>
      <P>I accept also that the present eligibility limit for applicants under the scheme that is a disposable income as calculated under the terms of the scheme of £3,500 per annum, is too low and that this and other limits in the means test need to be revised.  I would like to draw attention to the fact that the means test limit is £3,500 of disposable income, I will return to that in a moment.</P>
      <P>The board has referred to the need for a further revision of the means test, in particular the eligibility limit in the recent annual report for 1983 and 1984 and, as Senator McAuliffe-Ennis has pointed out the board reported that those found to be ineligible on financial grounds were, in fact, a growing proportion of the total number of applicants who were refused services under the scheme.  A general review of the means test provisions under the scheme has been carried out and as I informed the Dáil on 22 April last, I hope to submit proposals to the Government very shortly on foot of that review.</P>

      <Col N="632" /> I am not so sure if I fully understood Senator Robinson's remarks when she talked about the non-statutory nature of the scheme.  I would like to point out in case there is any confusion about it, that I do not have a complete discretion in the matter.  I do not have power to review means test limits without obtaining the approval of the Government.  There are times, of course, when one wishes that one had that kind of power but one does not.  Of course, I formerly was in a position where on the whole I thought it was rather a good idea that Ministers should not have that kind of power.  I would have to remain true to at least some elements in my past.  Others perhaps I would prefer to forget.</P>
    <P>There have been some criticisms of the means test provisions on a number of different grounds.  I intend to refer only to one or two of them this evening.  I would like to point out, first of all, that the means test system that we operate under the scheme is, in fact, the system that was recommended by the Pringle Committee in its report in 1974.  That is by way of being a kind of an advance shot with a view to the debate we will have on the other resolution.  It involves an assessment of the applicant's disposable income and disposable capital.  Here I am coming back to a point that I made a little earlier on.  In other words, it is based on what remains to the applicant after allowance is made for certain deductions in respect of accommodation and certain living expenses.  It is not gross income. Therefore, it is a more generous means test than the figure itself would suggest to the casual observer.  The main reason for that recommendation made by the Pringle Committee was to bring about a degree of flexibility and to allow the scheme to take account of the variation in circumstances between applicants to the scheme and it will be readily seen, of course, that applicants who were adjudged to have £3,500 or less of disposable income might be in very different financial circumstances one from the other.  There is an element of flexibility there which it is important to keep.  There would be general agreement that it shall <Col N="633" /> be kept.  If I were to go any further in the matter I would be anticipating the later debate, which I prefer not to do at the moment, and Senators would prefer that I did not.</P>
    <P>I have reviewed the scheme and I have proposals in mind that I would put to Government to improve the situation in relation to the means test and I hope that <Col N="634" /> we will come to a decision on that matter very shortly.  It would be foolhardy to go any further.  Were it the case that I had complete discretion, I would have done it by now.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 May 1986.</P>
