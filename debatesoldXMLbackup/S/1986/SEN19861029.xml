      <P>I have notice from Senator Jim Higgins that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to indicate his intentions in relation to the opening and staffing of the Aras Attracta Mentally Handicapped Unit at Swinford, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael D. Higgins of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The undue delay by the Department of Education in acceding to the request of the Sligo School Project who are seeking to establish a multi-denominational school in Sligo.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jack Fitzsimons of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to have the proposed extension to Longwood Vocational School, County Meath, completed as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Deenihan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The initiation of a ferry service in 1987 between Cork and Swansea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> I also received notice from Senator Killilea of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture to ensure that the vesting of the McHale estate in County Galway takes place as a matter of extreme urgency as the families of landowners are unable to complete extra family houses on this estate which are at a very advanced stage structurally.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Jim Higgins, Michael D. Higgins, Fitzsimons, Deenihan and Killilea as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>I have selected Senator Jim Higgins's matter for today's Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded. Senators Michael D. Higgins, Fitzsimons, Deenihan and Killilea may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. No. 1 is concerned with the business of the House. No. 2 is a State Guarantees Act order which relates to Aer Rianta. No. 3 is the Second Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill which was introduced into this House. No. 4 is Private Members' Business which will be moved by the Fianna Fáil Party and taken from 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m. It is the intention that the House should sit again tomorrow in order to continue and, hopefully, to complete the discussion on the Second Stage of the National Monuments Bill and, if that is completed, to go on to the discussion of joint reports which would be items Nos. 5 and 8 on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I would appreciate your advice on a matter that need not delay us. It is very appropriate that Seanad Éireann should express its sympathy with the Mozambique people on the tragic death of their President, given the appalling difficulties that country is <Col N="895" /> in at present. Perhaps if we just had a simple expression of sympathy by people in the House it would be appropriate. I am not sure what mechanism exists for doing this but time should not be allowed to pass without expressing our sympathy as a Chamber with the people involved.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any need to make statements. A head of state has died and I think we as a House of Parliament should express our sympathy with the people of Mozambique.

      <P>I too would like to be associated with the sympathy vote and to extend my own sympathy in addition to that of this House to the people of Mozambique on the death of President Samora Machel. In the economic difficulties that country has experienced of late added to by the campaign of destabilisation from the neighbouring state of South Africa, it is doubly tragic that a man of Samora Machel's calibre should be taken from the helm of the country at this time. We would all urgently like to have the results of an independent inquiry into the cause of his untimely death.</P>

      <P>Probably the longest colonial war in Africa was fought to preserve Portuguese colonialism in Mozambique and Angola. One of the welcome consequences of the return to democracy in Portugal was the liberation of both Mozambique and Angola. It was a matter of great regret, therefore, that a neighbouring power which has been frequently condemned in this House saw fit subsequently to destabilise Mozambique when it was struggling to recover from the shock of the loss of capital and skilled labour from Mozambique. In that struggle to build a humane and just society in Mozambique the late President was an inspiring figure, and was an inspiring figure in the struggle for liberation in Africa generally. It is, therefore, a matter of great regret that he died, and that he died in the circumstances in which he did die. I look forward to the verdict of <Col N="897" /> international opinion on the cause of his death and I wish to be associated with the vote of sympathy in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, notwithstanding anything in the Standing Orders relative to Public Business, on any Thursday the Cathaoirleach (unless on the Order of Business the Seanad otherwise orders) shall, where a division is claimed on a question &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo; (or on any amendment thereto) or on a Motion (or on any amendment thereto) ordered in the Order of Business to be taken on that day, postpone the taking of every such division until 5 p.m. on the next Wednesday on which the Seanad shall sit until that hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deals with how this House conducts its business and in particular with how this House conducts its divisions. I would like to explain to the House why it was thought proper to bring in a motion. I would like to explain why there is a motion standing in the names of the three political groups in the House urging a change in the way in which we take divisions. The way in which taking divisions varies in different parliamentary institutions is very interesting. We in this country have inherited from the British <Col N="899" /> the idea that the only way to take a division is to take it immediately at the end of the debate and by the bodily passage of a Member through an aperture of some sort, whether it be necessary to carry him on a stretcher or whether he is able to walk through freely.</P>
    <P>This is not the universal practice. For example, in the European Parliament to which we send Members they debate a number of matters during the week and on the final day they have their votes on all of these questions. In some countries in Europe, Whips are authorised to vote the full strength of their party. In the Congress of the United States they have an interesting procedure which I have seen in operation whereby when a vote is actually taken, within a certain period &mdash; I do not know if it is five minutes or so &mdash; a person can change his or her vote having seen the result of the initial vote. I do not know if in another part of this building some members would like that practice introduced but I do not think there is any need to introduce it in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Why then have we brought forward this motion? This House has, in the past year or so, gone from the question of sporadic meetings, first to the question of a regular meeting on every Wednesday, and then to regular meetings two days a week. When the idea of meeting regularly on Wednesday and Thursday was agreed to, I put it forward to my fellow Senators on the basis that I would endeavour to do my best to ensure that there would be no controversial business on a Thursday; that we would tend to devote Thursday to the discussion of reports of joint committees.</P>
    <P>Due to the fact that I have been unduly successful in getting Bills introduced in the Seanad, we now have quite a large backlog of legislative work and it will be necessary in the weeks ahead to order legislative business on both Wednesdays and Thursdays. Accordingly, I initiated discussions with the other groups in regard to this question.</P>
    <P>We have put forward here a proposition. It relates only to motions and to <Col N="900" /> the Second Stages of Bills: it does not relate to Committee Stages. The effect of this motion to postpone a division from a Thursday until the following Wednesday releases a Senator from the obligation, having made a contribution to a Second Stage of a Bill or having made a contribution to the debate on a motion, of having to remain for the remainder of that debate in case there were divisions.</P>
    <P>There are arguments against giving such a dispensation. In an ideal Seanad, anyone who spoke should be forced to listen to everybody else and I acknowledge the strength of that argument. The realistic position is that Senators are not in the habit, having made a speech, of listening to the remainder of the debate. This is an acceptance of the realistic position, a reluctant acceptance of the realistic position. I want to point out to Seanadóirí that this provision, while it will be made the presumptive procedure, can be varied on any Thursday on the Order of Business. Any suggestion that this procedure dispenses Seanadórí and allows them to go home on Wednesday night would lead to quite a dangerous practice on their part. The question of whether this customary procedure will remain in force or whether it will be dispensed with on a particular Thursday will be decided on the Order of Business of Thursday.</P>
    <P>I do not move this motion with any great enthusiasm or view the attendance in this House on Thursdays with any pride, but I do feel that this is a recognition of the position as it stands. As it is, the position on a Thursday is that the Leaders and Whips of the group are pestered by Members throughout the day: &ldquo;Is there going to be a division on this?&rdquo; Perhaps Members should be left to wait around and see. We are coming towards the end of this Seanad &mdash; we may have varying views about how quickly the end is approaching &mdash; and I think we should try this as an experiment for the remainder of this Seanad. I do not think it is going to improve our attendance. It may improve some Senators' nerves and perhaps that is a good thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this motion nothing was left unsaid by Senator Dooge for me to say except that he and I had a number of discussions about this over the past few months. Both of us came up with the idea. I say that because some people thought it was a Government-inspired motion and that this would suit the Government. I think it will suit the Government and it may suit the next Government too. That is not the way we looked at it. We looked at it from the point of view that there was nothing wrong in our doing it when the other House are doing it. They do not have votes on Thursday; they vote on Wednesday. I have nothing more to say and I hope the House will agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly the motion has the support of both sides of the House and so it will be agreed. I should like to raise one question on it. It may have a consequence which would be undesirable in that it would be difficult to get a quorum on Thursdays. That is not desirable. I commend the present Leader of the House on the fact that the Seanad has been sitting more often and examining both Bills and motions more regularly than any other Seanad since I was elected to this House. Part of that has been because Members have come on Thursdays as they have come on Wednesdays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course it is inconvenient. It is particularly inconvenient for those Senators who obey a party whip. They are the ones in particular who have to be here. I can speak more freely from the Independent benches because I am free of a party commitment, whatever about my personal commitment on a particular issue. I would be concerned &mdash; and I would ask that this be monitored very closely &mdash; that if we do it, we do it from now until Christmas and that it does not carry on after Christmas unless the House so orders so that we can actually monitor the effect it has on attendance on Thursdays. It would be very regrettable if only a small pool of Dublin Senators turned up from each of the parties on Thursday and nobody else showed <Col N="902" /> because no vote was being taken. That would be very undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point Senator Robinson made has been in the minds of those of us who have been discussing this matter. We have decided that there is a duty on the members of political parties that there should be a quorum. I would hope that the Independents would also make their contribution to this quorum. We have decided that the effect of this resolution here will be to make it easier to release Senators on a Thursday who have a good excuse. Both Senator Willie Ryan and I in discussion have emphasised &mdash; and in a sense worried about &mdash; the very point Senator Robinson has raised. What we propose to do is not to excuse all members of the group but to excuse some of them and endeavour to see that &mdash; without necessarily having a strict rota &mdash; we will not have the position that some Senators are never here on a Thursday and other Senators are left to bear the burden of the work of the House. We certainly have that in mind.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the review I would be quite happy that the question of the operation of this system would be put on the agenda of the first meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the New Year so that we could discuss how it is operating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion arises from the Government's approval of the construction of a new runway and associated works at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>Dublin Airport's runway system dates from the mid forties. The runways were designed to cope with the types of aircraft operating at that time as well as with aircraft developments then foreseen. In the meantime, the runways have been extended, overlaid with asphalt and continuously maintained. Bearing in mind the age of the Dublin runway system, the tremendous developments in size and weight of aircraft in recent years and the need to provide for the long-term traffic needs of the airport, a detailed examination of the airport's future runway requirements has been carried out by a group representative of Aer Rianta, the then Department of Transport and Aer Lingus. The group's main recommendation was that a new east-west runway should be built on the southern side of the airport terminal area.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the group's report, a technical analysis of the condition of the runways and an assessment of a number of options, the Government have given approval for the provision of a new 8,650 feet runway, together with associated works, at Dublin Airport, at an estimated cost of £31.26 million at 1985 prices.</P>
      <P>The project will be the biggest State airport project to be undertaken for some time. As well as the runway itself, the project will include the provision of a parallel taxiway system, advanced navigational and visual aids, a new air traffic control tower, technical building and consequential road works. The project will provide about 200 jobs at peak during its construction.</P>
      <P>As the new runway will have an east-west orientation there will be a significant reduction in aircraft noise levels for large populated areas in Dublin city and county. Aircraft noice nuisance will be significantly reduced in areas such as Ballymun, Finglas, Swords and Castleknock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new runway will intersect with the Ballymun-Naul road. Local residents and <Col N="904" /> other users of the Ballymun-Naul road are concerned about the proposal to close the road and to replace it by two new roads running parallel to and located on each side of the runway, linking the Ballymun-Naul road with the St. Margaret's road. An action group has made strong representations objecting to the proposed road closure and seeking in its stead the provision of a tunnel to carry the road under the runway and parallel taxiway. I can assure the House that all representations regarding the Ballymun-Naul Road proposal are being carefully considered and that a final decision in that matter has not yet been taken. It will also be necessary to close a section of Collinstown Lane and it is proposed to provide a replacement road to connect the lane with the Old County Road at Commons Townland.</P>
    <P>Development work on the project commenced last August on the provision of water and sewerage services to the proposed new air traffic control tower and technical building. Work has also commenced on the provision of high tension electricity supply for the project and on drainage works. Aer Rianta are engaged in the design and planning work for the runway itself, the parallel taxiway and buildings. Work on these elements of the project is due to commence early next year. The scheduled completion target for the entire project is March 1989.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the three State airports are managed by Aer Rianta on an agency basis on behalf of the Minister for Communications. Under the agency arrangements capital expenditure at the airports has traditionally been funded directly by the Exchequer and surpluses earned by Aer Rianta are surrendered to the Exchequer. The company have, however, been given responsibility for the funding of a western fuel terminal at Shannon Airport and the provision of US preinspection facilities at the airport at an estimated aggregate cost of £1.3 million. Given the very heavy demands on the Exchequer, the scale of expenditure involved in the Dublin runway project and the satisfactory financial results of <Col N="905" /> Aer Rianta in recent years &mdash; the company had a surplus on trading activities of £11.5 million in 1985 &mdash; it has been decided that the company will participate in the funding arrangements for the project. The company will provide 75 per cent of the funds &mdash; 25 per cent from their own resources and 50 per cent from borrowings. The remaining 25 per cent will be provided by the Exchequer. As regards the borrowing requirements, Aer Rianta are having discussions with a number of financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether the position of Aer Rianta should be changed to that of an autonomous commercial State company has been examined in the past. Previous examinations of this issue, including a report in 1979 by the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, concluded that the company's status should not be changed on the grounds that their financial performance cast doubts on their ability to service the accumulated debt on past State investment and to provide for the future capital needs of the airports. In the difficult environment of recent years, Aer Rianta have turned in a creditable performance. Against this background and Aer Rianta's direct involvement in the funding of the Dublin runway project the Minister for Communications has initiated a further appraisal of the future structure of the company. The appraisal is being carried out by a review group representative of the Departments of Communications and Finance and Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport is the busiest State airport; in 1985 it handled a throughput of 2.6 million passengers. This year there has been satisfactory traffic growth at Dublin Airport in a difficult economic environment for air transport. Traffic in August last showed a spectacular increase, 17 per cent above August 1985 and was in fact the airport's busiest month. This growth is due in no small measure to the introduction of reduced fares and approval of an additional Irish carrier on the Dublin-London route. As Senators may be aware, the long held view of the Minister for Communications <Col N="906" /> is that there should be greater liberalisation of air transport services which proceeds in a balanced way and avoids over-hasty expansion of capacity in the market.</P>
    <P>On the financial side, Dublin Airport continues to make surpluses; last year the Dublin Airport surplus was £7.8 million or 68 per cent of the total surplus of Aer Rianta. The provision of the new runway will enhance the future prospects of the airport and meet its traffic needs well into the next century.</P>
    <P>This project is indicative of the Government's commitment to the development of the State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork for the promotion of traffic growth to the maximum extent possible. I have already referred to a number of projects at Shannon. In 1986 a total of £1 million in Exchequer funds is being provided for capital works at Shannon.</P>
    <P>As regards Cork Airport there has been substantial support by way of Exchequer funding. During the past three years, £750,000 of Exchequer funds has been spent on capital works at Cork Airport. During the present year Exchequer funds of the order of £1 million are being provided for a number of capital projects at the airport, the principal one being the provision of a new instrument landing system. In addition, Aer Rianta have recently received approval for expenditure of the order of £250,000 for improvements to the terminal building. This work will be carried out in 1987.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta have submitted a proposal for an extension to the main runway at Cork Airport and the provision of improved navigational aids. The up-to-date position is that the project is being actively considered by the Minister for Communications.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Minister has adopted a series of measures aimed at liberalising air transport generally and he has taken a number of initiatives on air fares including in recent times the refusal of an application by carriers operating to the UK from Cork Airport for an increase in basic air fares.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> He has also recently announced reductions in air fares from Cork and the other State airports to continental destinations for the winter.</P>
    <P>As regards new services from Cork, Ryanair have applied for approval to operate air services to Luton from Cork. A decision on the application will be taken in the light of the outcome of discussions taking place between the Irish and UK authorities on a revision of the Ireland-UK Air Services Agreement.</P>
    <P>The motion which is now before the House, if approved, will facilitate the provision of a State guarantee for up to £25 million of borrowings by Aer Rianta. It is unlikely that Aer Rianta's borrowings will amount to £25 million but the draft order provides for a maximum of that amount to ensure that the amendment will be adequate to meet the cost of any unforeseeable developments. As I have stated, it is proposed that the company will borrow 50 per cent of the funds for the project.</P>
    <P>The guarantee necessitates an appropriate amendment to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, and it is in this context that the motion arises. Approval of the amendment by the House and by Dáil Éireann is necessary in order to complete legal formalities in respect of the guarantee.</P>
    <P>The cost of the works being carried out on the project in 1986 is being met by Exchequer funds of £0.9 million. Next year it is planned to spend some £11.5 million on the project and Aer Rianta's share of the funding will entail borrowing. It is, therefore, necessary to have the State guarantee in place in good time before the start of next year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I recommend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome any money that would be of aid to Aer Rianta. For a long time, as a Senator in this House, I have wondered about these draft regulations being laid before the House. My worries are confirmed today in that we are talking about an allocation of £25 million to Aer Rianta. It is laid before <Col N="908" /> the Seanad in draft form. This type of funding and this type of money would warrant a Bill on which we could have a long debate.</P>

      <P>I thank you. I wish to have a discussion on the Adjournment of the Seanad on a specified and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration. I am referring to the widespread disruption to business and community life. For example, no medical cards have been issued and medical services are in difficulty in the postal area of Galway city. There is need for the Minister for Labour, as a matter of extreme urgency, to inform the House of the efforts he has made to resolve this most damaging dispute, the dispute being about a triviality.</P>
      <P>The new city buildings were opened some weeks ago. Prior to that each of the offices of the Galway Corporation was in different areas. Each postman could take the post on his route to each of the offices. Now the situation is that all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am explaining a point because the public do not know what the reality of this situation is or the triviality of this situation. When the new civic offices were opened, all the post was put together and one postman on that route was expected to carry it on the carrier of his bicycle. That is a most unreasonable demand by management. I do not want to take sides at this stage except to say <Col N="909" /> that such triviality should not be tolerated. I am asking the Minister for Labour to intervene immediately to resolve this most stupid strike.</P>

People are living in the community of Connemara &mdash; which is bad enough as it is these days &mdash; where, for example, pensions to people who worked with the Galway County Council are not being paid. Medical cards are not being renewed. There is great hardship. If it was a serious strike situation, I might have second thoughts about raising it here.</P>
      <P>Last week I was to raise it, but Senator M. Higgins of the Labour Party did his utmost to bring sanity to that situation in Galway city, but to no avail. It has reached a serious point where people are suffering. There are sick people in the community who cannot get medical cards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not ready for that. I worry about this type of Government funding to Aer Rianta or any such body. I welcome it but perhaps present and future Ministers might look at this point rather than having this order in draft form. When we are talking about £25 million perhaps we should have a Bill which we might be able to discuss at more length.</P>
      <P>I understand that this type of money would come under the heading of a letter of comfort. That is funny, to say the least. A letter of comfort of £25 million from the present Coalition Government is certainly something that money institutions would be examining carefully at the moment before standing over it.</P>
      <P>I welcome this order, but if the Minister decides to give £30 million to Dublin Airport he must admit that the Shannon cross-runway is too short. We have asked time and again for a mere £5 million for the cross-runway at Shannon. The Minister made reference to the western fuel terminal at Shannon Airport and the provision of the pre-inspection facilities. I had communications with him on the fuel terminal at Shannon. I understand from the letter which I received that Aer Rianta or such bodies would have to pay totally for that new, extended fuel terminal at Shannon Airport. If I understand the Minister correctly, there is now a breakdown of how that will be funded. I want to ask him also about the pre-inspection facilities. I would like to know at first hand how that facility has worked. Is the Minister happy about it? I live near the airport and know that there have been problems and snags. As a legislator I think we should get a report on how the pre-inspection facilities worked at Shannon. We all supported the introduction of pre-inspection facilities. If I could read such a report I might feel that I could support the measure again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat my worry about laying this kind of a draft order before the House. <Col N="911" /> The Minister's address here indicates that we are really talking about £25 million for Aer Rianta. Lest I should be taken wrongly, I totally support this. I see, at first hand, a very, very successful operation in Aer Rianta. I am talking about Aer Rianta, Shannon. I do not know about the Aer Rianta situation in Dublin. Lest I should be misunderstood by the Minister, I totally support Aer Rianta but I worry about this kind of money when we are talking about cut-backs. This is laid before the Seanad in draft form on the last day of October with a ministerial address which tells us what we are at.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has noted my request that he might see his way to talk to various persons when they decide to spend £30 million plus. Like the Minister and his allegiance to Cork, I have my allegiance to Shannon. The marvellous thing about Shannon is that even though it was always in Clare it is sometimes claimed by Limerick. If there is trouble, Shannon is stated to be in Clare. If it is successful, as with SFADCo, Shannon is claimed by Limerick. That has happened under the present Minister and under previous Ministers I will not name but who claimed its successes.</P>
    <P>My main appeal here, as a Senator of ten years standing, is about the expenditure of this type of money being laid on the Clár of the Seanad in this type of draft form. I am sure the Minister will have a very correct and clear answer. A draft, such as this State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) Order, 1986, has confused me before and that is why I had to say so today. It is big money at a time when we are cutting back in many other areas. That money may well be needed in areas other than extra runways.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;letter of comfort&rdquo; is a lovely phrase. That should be noted, because a letter of comfort from old Governments or, indeed, future Governments could well mean positive cash and positive big money. I wonder about a letter of comfort from today's Government to the tune of £25 million. I just have my reservations about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. A. FitzGerald Mr. A. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion seeking approval for the draft State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) Order, 1986, in relation to Aer Rianta. I was interested to hear Senator Honan who spoke with quite a degree of knowledge of the Shannon Airport situation and was full of commendation of Aer Rianta for their management of that airport. I presume her colleague, Senator Hillery will be contributing shortly. I do not know whether it will be County Clare or County Dublin that will take his particular interest on this occasion.</P>
      <P>When the Minister spoke a few minutes ago, his voice changed quite audibly when he mentioned Cork. I do not suppose anybody here will mind me raising my voice in reference to Dublin Airport. I want to get one point across before I get into that area. It should be borne in mind by everybody, whether from Shannon &mdash; whether it is in Clare or Limerick &mdash; or from Cork, or who was lucky enough to be born, bred and living in Dublin, that Dublin Airport is taking the largest volume of air traffic into this country. In fact, the Minister's speech recorded the fact that there was an increase in August 1986 as compared to August 1985 of some 17 per cent in air traffic coming and going from Dublin Airport, with 2.6 million passengers annually using that facility. That is an enormous throughput of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we think about 2.6 million, it is not a great deal less than the entire population of this State coming in and out of that airport facility. When we bear that in mind and consider the transit traffic, which obviously is a major contributor to the use of Shannon and other airports Dublin Airport actually deals with 70 per cent of all incoming and outgoing traffic in this State. In other words, it is the State's main airport. We are asking the State by way of the motion before this House today, and presumably before the other House in due course, to consider departing from what has been the arrangement previously with Aer Rianta and coming up with an arrangement which provides 75 per cent of the <Col N="913" /> funds by way of the resources of Aer Rianta &mdash; who have been doing remarkably well in recent years &mdash; and 25 per cent from the State. In relation to the 75 per cent, 25 per cent will come from their own resources, and 25 per cent from borrowings by the company.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what the Minister has said that Aer Rianta had a surplus of £7.8 million last year, 68 per cent of which arose from their operation in Dublin Airport. To that extent the funding back to the facility, which has been recording almost 70 per cent of its surplus and also taking 70 per cent of the State's use of airport facilities by way of the arrival and departure of passengers, is very important. I say that for other reasons that I have not mentioned so far. Airport facilities for passengers departing or arriving in Dublin Airport have become tremendously well developed. In saying that once again I compliment Aer Rianta on their excellent arrangements for passengers, and not just the arrangements for the arrival and departure of passengers but conveniencing them in every way while they are within the airport complex. The airport has been developed into a very modern European airport comparable with many of the vary spectacular airports in other European capitals. Aer Rianta have served this State extremely well in their management of that airport.</P>
    <P>It is also fair to say that there has not been any serious development of runway facilities at Dublin Airport since the forties. There is a concern, shared not alone by Aer Rianta and the Department of Communications who are responsible for the airport, but on a wider brief by those engaged in piloting aircraft and in the running of the airport, that the main runway is breaking up. There is a clear need for the State to invest £31.26 million at 1985 prices in the runway facilities of the order mentioned today in the draft order before the House. The draft order deals with this urgent problem. It is not one that can be glanced over and patched up again. It requires the State to invest in runway development of a kind which provides our main airport with proper aircraft landing facilities. The runways <Col N="914" /> should be capable of taking aircraft of the size and technical capabilities seen in recent times. Clearly, what is in mind in this scheme is giving the airport those facilities and giving them facilities in modern terms that will bring, not just the facilities of the airport but the more technical needs of any of our aerodromes up to the highest standards. I have no doubt that this exercise will be welcomed by the vast bulk of the population using the airport in the years ahead. Hopefully, the target of March 1989 will be met and the new airport runways will then be in a position to be used.</P>
    <P>Finally, I could not help but notice that the Minister mentioned the considerable advantage that would be shared by the peoples of Finglas, Ballymun and Castle-knock in the new arrangements in relation to the east-west arrival and departure of aircraft into Dublin Airport. I share a house with a person who has a particular interest in that part of the city. I know from frequenting that part of the city the extent to which low flying aircraft interrupt family life and normal activity in the very largely populated areas in the suburbs which I have just mentioned. On those grounds, I am sure it is a most welcome development.</P>
    <P>I welcome this order particularly because it is putting the necessary capital behind a project which is of urgent necessity to go ahead with the development programme for runway facilities at Dublin Airport. It follows on the very major development we have all seen in the airport facilities, both for arrivals and departures. Dublin Airport carries 70 per cent of all arrivals and departures in the State and has not seen a development of this kind since the forties. Therefore, I welcome this order and hope the House will see fit to pass it today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Rianta are a profitable company and we should commend them for that. Under this draft order the company are being enabled, through the borrowing mechanism, to fund half the costs of the proposed <Col N="915" /> runway at Dublin Airport. It is understandable that, given the restricted balance sheet of the company &mdash; by which I mean they have no fixed assets of their own &mdash; the borrowings to finance half the expenditure of the runway would require some formal guarantee.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies. Aer Rianta seem to me to be very unusually structured and in need of change. They have a share capital of £51,000. Their fixed assets are owned directly by the Minister and are not included in the balance sheet. Aer Rianta then administer the fixed assets on behalf of the State. Capital expenditure has been funded by the Minister and the book value of these assets at 31 December 1985 was £27.9 million. As the Minister has pointed out, in 1985 there was a surplus on trading activities of £11.5 million. From a commercial viewpoint Aer Rianta are, as I have already said, inappropriately structured. I note what the Minister said about a review group to study the future structure of the company. I will take this opportunity to ask him when he expects the review group to report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to State guaranteed borrowings I understand that, in this instance, as the company have no fixed assets of its own, they cannot therefore offer those assets as collateral for the borrowings. However, I want to make a general point about State borrowings. It is appropriate that I do so on this motion. I share the view that a reduction in the amount of borrowings guaranteed by the Exchequer would result in a greater commercial awareness on the part of State-sponsored bodies. Furthermore, if these guarantees were not available a more rigorous appraisal of the investment risk would be made by the lending institutions. I will again make the point I have made before under different headings that State guarantees on borrowings should be reviewed at regular intervals. There should be time limits on the borrowing permissions. That would introduce a rigour which is the order of the day <Col N="916" /> in relation to borrowing for the private sector. It should introduce a greater degree of commercial orientation and awareness on the part of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the reply to the point raised by Senator Honan in relation to the draft order, the actual procedure we use, which in this instance commits the State to guarantee the very large sum of £25 million. I wonder whether a review of this procedure is under way?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the view of Senator Honan who painted a very rosy picture of Aer Rianta in Shannon, nor that of Senator Hillery. Aer Rianta are the greatest scourge this country has known since Shanahan stamps. Aer Rianta in Shannon Airport charge self-drive companies the sum of £6,000 for a five foot desk in Shannon Airport. Larger companies get ten feet at Shannon Airport for £100,000. When a jumbo comes into Shannon a number of people who have their self-drive cars booked go to the desk but they cannot be catered for at a five foot desk. There would be plenty of space in Shannon if Aer Rianta took the trouble to extend these desks but they have refused to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the self-drive operators in Shannon has a mobile coach which is converted into an office out on the airport. When the passengers arrive in Shannon they have to go out to the coach and queue up outside to complete their documents to take out their car. Tourists coming into the country and people who are providing a car service should not be treated in that way. Cars here are twice the price they are in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and the insurance on the cars is about four times what it is in the North of Ireland or the United Kingdom. In Jersey the manufacturers give the cars to the car hire operators free of charge. In addition to that, the manufacturers also give them £50 to tax and register the cars, the reason being that at the end of the season the cars are then sent to England as second hand cars where they are offered for sale in auctions. Two of the manufacturers, Fords <Col N="917" /> and GM then sell their cars. The reason for all this generosity in Jersey is that these companies want to keep up their market penetration.</P>
    <P>The production of motor cars in Europe is 14 million units. The demand in Europe is ten million units. There are four million cars to be dumped or used in other ways. The insurance on cars in Jersey, the United Kingdom and in Northern Ireland runs at about £150 to £200. It is £900 a car in this country. The self-drive operators who are providing a service without which our tourism and our airports would be useless, are paying very high charges for rental. They have no accommodation. Every disincentive is used to prevent these people giving a good service, making a profit, paying their way and keeping up valuable employment. I will move from Shannon to Dublin for the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that. The way Aer Rianta are treating these people is a disgrace. We look at television and we see, &ldquo;no VAT in Dublin Airport; money is gone out of fashion; you spend your money going out of Dublin Airport&rdquo;. The custom laws in this country are that a person is entitled to bring in £200 worth of goods provided no article costs more than £55.</P>
      <P>Recently a Cork man had occasion to go to London. He went into the duty free shop at Dublin Airport and bought a watch for £58. Nobody said to him in the Air Rianta shop that it was in excess of what the allowance is. He flew to London and on his way back the customs people stopped him and asked him: &ldquo;Where did you get the watch?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I bought it in the duty free shop&rdquo;. The customs man asked him how much did he pay for it. He said he paid £58 which was £3 over the rate and the customs man seized the watch. He is now without his watch. That is the kind of treatment Aer Rianta are giving to people. The first thing we should do is to investigate Aer Rianta and their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> I have already made complaints to the Minister for Communications about this. The Minister told me he has nothing to do with the day to day operations of Aer Rianta. Aer Rianta are not only an autonomous body; they are dictators. We all know what has happened to dictators. We know what happened to Hitler, Mussolini and the other dictators. I can assure the House that it is only a matter of time before it comes to Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>The Minister said Dublin Airport was the busiest State airport in 1985, that it handled a throughput of 2.6 million passengers and this year there has been a satisfactory traffic growth in Dublin Airport in a difficult, economic environment for air transport traffic. He said that in August of this year traffic showed a spectacular increase of 17 per cent above August 1985 and it was the busiest month. It was because Aer Lingus brought in a cheap fare of £69 to go to London. You booked today you flew tomorrow. You paid your fare. You went to London but they did not bring you back tomorrow or the next day.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of complaints about this. I went to London at my own expense to investigate this position. I found that Aer Lingus, first of all, would not take a booking by telephone. I had to go into the office which opens at 9 a.m. I arrived at 7.30 a.m. and found a queue of people before me. I went into the office and was told: &ldquo;There are no seats on this flight today&rdquo;. A number of people who were at the head of the queue, who had to get back, paid £73 sterling, having got their tickets from Aer Lingus with a contract to take them back to Dublin within 14 days. Some of the people who were outside were actually weeping. They had paid their money; they had gone on their holiday; and on three successive days they failed to get back to Dublin. On three successive days I failed to get a return trip.</P>
    <P>I decided then that I would come to Dublin and hold a press conference to give this the publicity to which it was entitled. I then paid my £73 by putting my credit card on the desk. They decided to get in touch with Dublin Airport and <Col N="919" /> having done that they said: &ldquo;There is no need for you to take that ticket; we now have 15 seats&rdquo;. Somebody waved the magic wand and there were 15 seats but there were still about 40 people in the queue. When I came back to Dublin the explanation they gave was that it was on humanitarian grounds that they provided these seats. If it was on humanitarian grounds, they should have given the seats to the people who were hardest hit, people who could not afford to pay to come back, or they could have asked was there any special reason why people had to get back. They did not. They just gave the seats to the first 15 people in the queue. Already two people had paid their £73 and they had gone away. I do not know what happened those people. I am sure Aer Lingus did not bother to give them back their money. It is very easy to have growth in the traffic, and they advertise this.</P>
    <P>I was contacted by RTE. The newspapers reported my case and I also sent a submission to the Minister about it. Aer Lingus came on the radio and denied that they did this as a result of my raising the matter. They said they did it on humanitarian grounds. I can understand that any airport can have a special fare, but if they issue a return ticket they should honour that ticket. I know one person who holds six tickets because he could not get back on particular flights. The six tickets are out of date, and he could not get a flight. That was a con job. There is no question in the world about that, whether it was deliberate or not. As far as he was concerned he lost his money and he paid far more to come back.</P>
    <P>The reality of the traffic Aer Lingus have generated is that, if air fares were reasonable, they would get the traffic and they would be busy all year instead of being busy for one or two months in a year. Those matters should be examined before Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta get any more of the taxpayers' money.</P>

      <P>I want to support this proposed development at Dublin Airport. Unlike the previous speaker I have <Col N="920" /> not had the experience of missing flights and being unable to get connections as he has had in London and elsewhere. However, we must all realise that as a result of Dublin Airport being in existence for many years now, it is only reasonable to expect deterioration in runways. Maintenance must take place over a period of years. In the Minister's speech it is pointed out that increased weight and size of aircraft demand greater length of runways. For that reason I can see the need for this runway to be built and to have the best facilities available for our larger aircraft to take off and touch down at our major airport with great ease and safety to all concerned.</P>
      <P>I welcome this development. It is interesting to equate like with like geographically and otherwise in the provision of facilities for aircraft. In Munster, Shannon can take all international aircraft and Cork can link services with Shannon and Dublin. The whole region of Connacht and Donegal is without the services of a State airport as is pointed out here. We look forward to the day when that will be changed and when the support of the Government will be forthcoming for the airport in Knock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the necessary facilities have been provided in Knock for around £13 million. It has a runway of 8,200 ft. and if the company had got permission, the airport would have a runway far longer than that, indeed, the same length, if not longer than the one we are providing now of 8,650 ft. All that cost the Government was £9.8 million. We are asked here today to provide a runway at Dublin Airport that will cost £31.26 million, according to the 1985 figures but knowing how figures change from year to year I am not sure what that figure will be finally. I hazard a guess that it will be in the region of £45 million by its completion date. That is a very humble estimate. Everything required for the provision of safe landing facilities will be completed to Department standards at Knock. I welcome a decision by the Minister in connection with the licensing of that airport as soon as possible. I could not let the occasion pass without complimenting the <Col N="921" /> people who carried out the development of Knock. It was a great achievement to have an airport the size of Knock Airport developed at a cost of £13 million. Everybody concerned with that development must be commended.</P>
    <P>There is development taking place at Cork and Shannon which I also welcome. People in the east here may not have had the same welcome for us in the west when we tried to develop. As a west of Ireland man I want to welcome any development at Shannon, Cork and Dublin. It is imperative that we have the highest standard of equipment and airports for the reception of our aircraft and the reception of aircraft from all over the world. We must provide the highest measure of safety for everybody using this country. I welcome that development also. As regards Cork, Ryanair have applied for approval to operate services to Luton from Cork. As regards licences for other airports I hope that, when they arrive on the Minister's desk, they will get the same approval as has been given to Cork and Ryanair for the Luton &mdash; Cork flights. Traffic into and out of this country is something that must be welcomed by every section. We should be on the side of development and producing far better communications between this country, European countries and the world in general. I welcome this development at Dublin. I felt it was an opportunity for me &mdash; I hope the Minister does not mind me doing this &mdash; to equate the cost of the development of Knock Airport with what is requested here now. As I said at the outset, I believe that when the completion date arrives we will be talking in the region of at least £45 million for this development here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I note that the new runway will intersect the Ballymun-Naul road. The Minister said he can assure the House that all representations regarding the Ballymun-Naul road proposal are being carefully considered and that a final decision in that matter has not yet been taken. Am I to take it from that that the intersection of Ballymun-Naul road may not take place at all and there may have to be further designs for this new runway and <Col N="922" /> that a tunnel under the runway may be a possibility? I would like the Minister to explain what is meant by &ldquo;a final decision has not yet been taken&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion before us. I note that the amount of money being spent on a new runway at Dublin Airport is over £31 million. The Minister's report gives us the general impression that no money was spent on Dublin Airport. Over the past three years £750,000 was spent in Cork, £1 million is allocated for this year for navigational equipment and Aer Rianta are looking for approval for £250,000 for the terminal building. He then said that a proposal for the extension to the main runway in Cork is to be considered.</P>
      <P>We have had many arguments in Cork over the years about our airport and Aer Rianta argued with public representatives in the Cork area about Aer Lingus not giving the service in Cork that they should be giving. Aer Lingus said the business was not there and the loads were not there. At that time we asked what would be the priority. Did they feel Aer Rianta were doing enough about getting Aer Lingus to stay in Cork or letting other people into Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister raised in the report the question of the size and the relevance of aircraft in recent years. I agree with that in comparison with the airbus 300, a fine aircraft which can land on very short runways as against the weight of the jumbo, the 737 and the 111. Aer Lingus spent a lot of money buying small aircraft, such as the 36 seater purchased in Belfast. I understand they bought four of them. They bought them because of commuter hauling between smaller airports. The people were not there and it was cheaper from a fuel point of view. At that time we made the argument that we should be giving priority to seeing that the runways were extended. Aer Lingus management at that time, in conjunction with Aer Rianta management, admitted to us that the priority would not be extra runways or the extension of runways. Because of the purchase of smaller aircraft for shorter usage shorter runways <Col N="923" /> were needed. They also admitted that the type of plane they would be purchasing, in particular the airbus 300 which was being deeply considered at that time by Aer Lingus, would not need an extension of runways as they are built specially to come down on the same type of runway as the 737.</P>
    <P>Since then we have had a complete change, again at enormous cost to the State because of the thinking by our State bodies, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. How could it happen that in a short period of time, between 1981 and now, there was a complete change of thinking by Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus. They are totally irresponsible. I certainly do not think they give the impression that they have to answer to anybody. That is the honest truth of it. I am glad that at last Aer Rianta are providing some of the money themselves for investment in this runway. At the same time let us not give the impression that they are coming up with the whole lot. The taxpayers must pay.</P>
    <P>They now have four planes which are used only for commuter flying. They should be used for collecting people from smaller airports and bringing them to the major airports. That is what they do in bigger countries. Aer Lingus gave the impression that there was no need for any extension to the runways but they are now saying they must have over £40 million for Dublin alone. The report says that £1 million will be spent for navigational equipment in the Cork area. How much money was spent in Dublin? Dublin has changed massively over the years. I am not saying there is no need for change, but there is a priority. We should be talking about some percentage going to the other areas in comparison with the rest of the country. We have a very worrying argument going on in Cork about our airport &mdash; whether we can go in there any more. I understand it is very safe. There is an argument on whether we by-pass Cork, that we cannot get in because of weather conditions or because of something else and we might not have enough people coming into Cork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> For a long time they by passed Shannon. There always was a question about it and always an excuse made that &ldquo;it is not worth dropping down because we do not have enough passengers for it&rdquo;. Let us not have the same impression now and have all the traffic going into the capital. I have to question it. I would be dishonourable and unfair to everybody else if I did not question it. Why is some consideration not given to looking for 1,000 feet extra in the Cork area. We cannot get it. The sum involved is only £3 million and I understand £2 million of that can be got back from the EC over a period of years. Yet no commitment and no consideration will be given to it.</P>
    <P>We are trying to get people into all our regions. Our second biggest industry is tourism. Every facility must be given to it. Shannon is a fine airport but an impression is given that it is only second best. We must never do that. It is our first international airport. You could fly over to London and come back to Shannon. An impression may be given that we cannot get in there. That is not good for the country or for us in the region.</P>
    <P>We are told now that because of a £1 million debt for the first time we cannot be given a commitment to extend the runway. Yet despite all the money that has been lost over the past ten years, massive changes have gone on at Dublin Airport. No figures are mentioned but figures are mentioned about Cork &mdash; £750,000 over the past three years. Do not forget to mention that. Do not forget the £1 million spent on Shannon. That is very important, because people up here will ask what is being done about Cork and Shannon. Mention the £1 million and the £750,000. Forget about the millions and millions that were spent in Dublin over many years. That is not mentioned. What are our priorities? I cannot approve of everything here, but the Minister must make this a priority in case something serious happens in the Cork area. We cannot tolerate this for the sake of a measly £1 million from the Government and another £2 million from the EC. I cannot allow taxpayers' money to be spent in this way and go back to the <Col N="925" /> people in my region who have been told by the Government to get involved in local industries because the Government do not want to know about ferries or anything else. I do not deny that money has been provided for the ferry, which is very important for our region but the extension to the runway is every bit as important because it will encourage tourists to visit our region and we can sell what we have &mdash; our character and our charm. This is very important.</P>
    <P>Let us not give the impression that one cannot come into Ireland unless one goes first to Dublin. This is unfair. When can we get the go-ahead to extend a runway at Cork Airport? We are not looking for a new runway of 8,000 or 9,000 feet. I always thought Dublin was well catered for. I did not think there was over-crowding in Dublin or that there was banking up because for a second runway to be provided, there must be banking up. I never knew there was any such problem at Dublin Airport and if there is, I would like to know about it. Is the Minister saying that a plane comes into Dublin Airport every five minutes, two minutes or ten minutes? What are our priorities? What are we interested in? Maybe we should tell Aer Lingus we do not need them. Maybe we should have regional bodies, or an airport authority.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta are giving a total commitment and priority to the Dublin area. I am not saying the capital should not get this help but maybe we should tell these people they are not fit to run Cork Airport or Shannon Airport and that we should have regional bodies, similar to the harbour authorities, and then we will fight for our own little corner. That way we will get the best out of everybody. I am not going to spend taxpayers' money on faceless people who do not accept any responsibility for their actions. They do what they think is best for their particular region. That is unfair. To ensure everybody's safety, the runway in Cork Airport must be extended.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister for an explanation of the £750,000 spent on Cork Airport over the last three years <Col N="926" /> because £750,000 would have done a lot of work. Since the lengthening of the runway in the Cork region is now being given top priority, why was that money not spent on the runway? An extra £1 million has been allocated for navigation equipment this year, but on what was the £750,000 spent? Why was it not spent on the runway?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that money will be spent on the provision of the new runway at Dublin Airport. There is no doubt that it is a necessary and long overdue provision. From a safety point of view, it is necessary to have this runway built in view of the fact that over the past number of years aircraft have got bigger and the present runways are not suitable for the size, speed and weight of modern aircraft. The method of providing the money has been raised by Senator Hillery, and I go along with his assessment of the situation. The debate on the new runway has given an opportunity to discuss the running of Dublin Airport and the problems associated with the running of Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Knock Airports.</P>
      <P>Over the years Aer Rianta have done a fantastic job in the management of airline traffic in and out of Ireland, ensuring that there is an order in the development of air traffic, the management of the airports, and putting people through the airports. For many years I have been of the opinion that Air Lingus have not been doing as good a job as Aer Rianta. I believe we have been suffering because of the cost of access traffic into Ireland since most of this access has been through Aer Lingus and they have been artificially keeping up the cost of access traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted there is order coming into the traffic situation in the sense that we have another major Irish company competing. It seems that this competition has done nothing but good in the sense that traffic through Dublin has increased dramatically since Ryanair came on the scene. I have travelled on both Aer Lingus and Ryanair quite a lot over the past number of months. There is an excitement travelling with Ryanair <Col N="927" /> because from the minute you get to the Ryanair desk in Dublin Airport until you land at Luton Airport you are looked after by people who care. You are not just another person travelling on an Apex ticket or a passenger travelling class Y or V; you are treated as a person of importance.</P>
    <P>Most of my criticisms of Aer Lingus are not of the ground staff. The Aer Lingus ground staff at Dublin and London Airports, and at other airports are excellent. They do a fantastic job attempting to help the people get through the formalities of getting on the plane, but for some reason, in the past number of years the service in the air has deteriorated. It is good to see Ryanair, an Irish carrier, bringing back personal attention to customers in the air. I am not suggesting that every person on the Aer Lingus air staff is not doing their job properly, but there is a lack of contact with the ordinary passenger. Too often, particularly on busy flights one sees the regular flyers, many of whom are Aer Lingus staff, getting priority treatment. After half an hour in the air one begins to recognise Aer Lingus staff being treated much better than the ordinary passengers. I am not suggesting that Ryanair, if they become bigger, will not lose a lot of this personal contact. All I am saying is that the warning light should be seen by the people who are training Aer Lingus staff. Possibly one of the problems with the Aer Lingus air staff at present is that many of them have been on flying duties for a long time and may get a little tired and therefore are not giving passengers the attention they should.</P>
    <P>I notice that Aer Rianta's profits have been building up at what would seem to be, for a semi-State company, a very good rate. There is no doubt that their duty free shops contribute to this to a large degree. However, one of the problems we find is that many goods in the duty free shops are not sold at duty free prices. These shops might be duty free, but the profit margins seem to be inordinate and there is no doubt that the Aer Rianta duty free shops are expensive in <Col N="928" /> comparison to many other duty free shops. They are very high in the league of expensive duty free shops. It is a little incongruous to find that Irish whiskey is dearer in Dublin Airport than it is in British airports or other foreign airports. The Minister might say that we should not be buying duty free whiskey, but I am sure he brings in the odd bottle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply I would like the Minister to comment on the margins of profit in these duty free outlets. I am not suggesting that Aer Rianta are not entitled to make a profit and that this profit should not be put back into the provision of facilities in Dublin, Cork, Shannon and hopefully, Knock but what I am saying is that if they are making these inordinate profits at the expense of the travelling public, we should know about it.</P>
      <P>Another matter I would like the Minister to comment on is the problem which has been mentioned on numerous occasions, and which has been highlighted in recent weeks &mdash; the bird problems, and what affect the new runway will have on this problem. Experts throughout the world suggest that there should not be a municipal dump within 15 kilometres of a major airport. This is agreed in Ireland, but apparently there are four major dumps within 15 kilometres of Dublin Airport and there is a further dump proposed. This could give rise to further problems in terms of seagulls and other birds which go to the dumps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of Cork Airport. When the Taoiseach was in Cork he ran into a certain amount of flak because the runway extensions at Cork were not going to be provided. The Minister is suggesting that the project is being actively considered. &ldquo;Active consideration&rdquo; is a beautiful way of suggesting you are doing nothing but you are thinking about it. Active consideration is not what is needed in terms of the <Col N="929" /> development of Cork Airport. Cork Airport needs an extension to the runway and extra facilities. When we see the extent to which traffic can be generated if we have proper fare structures, the only way Cork will get a share of this extra traffic is if there is an extension to the runway.</P>
    <P>Competition in the air &mdash; the same as every place else &mdash; is good for business. It is good for everybody. I do not think Aer Lingus need worry too much about competition from the new carriers. They have to meet this competition head on. They have the expertise to increase their traffic flow and still allow the other companies to perform well. As far as Ryanair are concerned, I have one particular worry and that is the airport they are flying to &mdash; Luton Airport. Luton Airport is a major British Army and Air Force staging point for holidays and troops going abroad. I am worried about security at Luton Airport in the sense that I think there is absolutely no security there. If you walk into Luton Airport, your bags are not checked. I am not an alarmist as far as air travel is concerned, but I am concerned if my bags are not at least screened going into an airport. The last time I travelled through Luton Airport there was absolutely no check on baggage. I was carrying hand baggage and we went directly from the ticket desk to the plane with no security check. That should not happen at a major airport. It is not our problem and this is not relevant to the motion but I think the authorities in Luton Airport will have to look at their security arrangements. Unless they have changed them in the last couple of weeks, the position is as I have outlined.</P>
    <P>In relation to Aer Lingus building on an extra runway which will generate extra traffic, I wonder how Dublin Airport can cope with extra traffic because at present, particularly on Saturday nights when there is a big volume of traffic to the seaside resorts in Spain, they are barely able to cope with the traffic that is generated. When traffic is being generated by people going to Lourdes and other places Dublin Airport gets clogged up very easily. If extra traffic is generated <Col N="930" /> by the extra runway, there will be a major problem because Dublin Airport will have to be enlarged.</P>
    <P>Many people made complaints, and anybody passing through the airport will have to acknowledge, that the standard of cleanliness in the restaurants in Dublin Airport, particularly the self-service, on occasion are not up to those one would expect in an area used by international travellers. The ground staff do a fantastic job, but the catering people do not do justice to that airport. I am speaking from a personal point of view. I pointed out to members of the airport staff that there was food on the floor and that frying pans had not been cleaned after use. When people are waiting for planes these are things they are very aware of. All services or facilities provided at airports should be up to international standards.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope Ryanair get the extension of services they are looking for. Also I hope the airport at Waterford is allowed to develop and that the full facilities will be provided as soon as possible. As I said, the generation of traffic is allied to fares. It has been proved &mdash; and Senator Daly has highlighted this &mdash; that even though there are anomalies in the fare structure, nevertheless the fact that fares have come down over the past 12 months has generated a lot of extra traffic.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope we can do away with the many differing airfare structures. It is crazy that a selective number of people can travel to London for £69. A Super Apex flight costs £74; a Ryanair fare is just under £100 but a person who cannot spend a weekend and has to travel from Dublin to London by Aer Lingus will be charged £181, plus £5 airport tax. In any aircraft at any one time there could be ten or 11 different air fare structures. On what basis are seats allocated to members of the staff of Aer Lingus? If they arrive at an aircraft with cut price tickets, are they allowed to travel when there might be a full fare or an Apex fare paying passenger looking for that seat?</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension although it is a bit late in the day. The points I have made have not been made in a contentious manner. I am trying to ensure <Col N="931" /> that the Aer Lingus of the past, and the standards of service provided by Aer Lingus in the past, are brought back and that Ryanair and the competition they are offering will be of benefit to Aer Lingus. What is the marketing policy within the Aer Rianta organisation as far as duty free is concerned, because it appears that excessive profits are being taken under the guise of duty free. A number of items in the airport are being sold as duty free which can be bought in downtown Dublin as cheaply or possibly cheaper than at the airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a tribute to the presentational skills of the Minister &mdash; and, indeed, the people of south-west Cork are lucky to have him as their representative &mdash; that he should come before Seanad Éireann today with a speech of this quality and be received seriously by this House. It is a tribute to the high regard in which we hold the Minister that, on foot of a speech like this, we are seriously considering a proposal to extend our approval to a State guarantee of the expenditure of a substantial sum of money. The Minister's speech is very long on problems and discussions about various airports throughout the country and very short on an analysis as to why we in Seanad Éireann should approve this proposed expenditure. It encourages the kind of twaddle we get in discussing whether there is food on the floor when, in fact, what we are discussing is whether we, in Seanad Éireann, should extend our approval to the State guaranteeing £25 million, because that is what we are discussing.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to discussing the details of the operations of any individual airline and not very much was said today about these operations with which I disagree, but they are not what we are discussing. I recognise that if the Minister extends the scope of his speech in his introduction, it is very difficult to restrict Senators to discussing what should be discussed, that is, whether it is a good thing to extend a State guarantee for a sum of £25 million to Aer Rianta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> What is being discussed is a proposal, which apparently has already been decided by the Government, to approve an additional runway of over 8,000 feet for Dublin Airport. I do not know if that is a good idea or not. How could I, because there is absolutely no information here, or no information has been made available to me, on which I can base my decision. It may be the duty of the Government to decide these matters in principle. Aer Rianta as a State-sponsored body are entitled to make their own investment decisions. I have no duty in this regard except in so far as the State-sponsored body concerned come in here and seek my approval to the extension of a State guarantee. That is where my involvement is. If they want to invest £35 million, or £45 million, or £105 million from their own resources, in any investment they choose, subject to Government approval, the responsibility for that rests jointly on the Government of the day on the one hand and the board of Aer Rianta on the other. Good luck to them if they want to do it.</P>
    <P>I am brought into the equation because, in the pursuance of my duty as a Member of this House, I am asked to approve a State guarantee. If I am asked to approve a State guarantee, it should be laid down in black and white why I should so approve that State guarantee. Why should I, as a Member of Seanad Éireann, agree to pledge taxpayers' money for a sum of £25 million? There may be very good reasons; the case may be unanswerable; the logic of the Minister's position may be overwhelming. I am not denying that these possibilities exist but what I am saying is that the information on which I can make the decision as to whether I agree or disagree with the Minister's decision is absent from the Minister's speech and therefore not available to me in this House.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about Ryanair. We are not talking about Cork Airport. We are not talking about Shannon Airport or Knock Airport. We are talking about the justification or otherwise for spending £31.26 million on extending the facilities <Col N="933" /> of Dublin Airport. Nowhere in this document is there any indication that there is any overcrowding whatsoever at Dublin Airport. For all I know, Dublin Airport is under-utilised at present. I am not saying these figures are not available. I am merely saying they are not available to me, and I have to make the decision. As long as I remain a Member of this House I will take my duties seriously, and I expect Ministers of whatever persuasion to come in here and give me a rational explanation of what they are proposing to do or what they are asking me to do. What they are asking me to do today is to stand four square behind a State guarantee of £25 million, that is, your money and my money, and they are asking me to do this on the basis of a presentation which is pathetic to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister of State in that regard because I know he has his brief. I am blaming the whole apparatus of Government and the way in which these decisions were arrived at under this Administration and previous Administrations whereby State guarantees were extended to State companies on the flimsiest of explanations. We know what happened with regard to these matters in the past. We know the difficulties we got into with Irish Shipping. I will not go into the rights and wrongs or the political arguments about Irish Shipping. In the heel of the hunt State guarantees were put up and they had to be met. We had a similar situation with regard to Dublin Gas. I will not go into the arguments for or against the early or late nationalisation of Dublin Gas. As a Member of this House and over my objections, certain guarantees were given to Dublin Gas. The Government were not necessarily incorrect in giving those guarantees, but sufficient information was not given to me, as a Member of this House to make a reasoned and rational judgment on whether these State guarantees should be given.</P>
    <P>I ask the members of the Government not here today, no doubt because they have many other important jobs to do, to listen to what I have to say on this <Col N="934" /> question. When they were deciding whether to approve an extension for Dublin Airport, if the information with which they were presented in making that decision consisted only of the information which is in the Minister's speech, would they have approved that expenditure? There can be only one answer to that question. Of course they would not have approved it. They would not necessarily have said it was a bad idea. They would have asked for more information and more facts before making a decision.</P>
    <P>There are a few points which could reasonably be made concerning this investment. There are three State airports in the country: Dublin, Cork and Shannon. There are a number of other private airports of which Knock Airport is the one with the biggest investment. I understand with regard to Cork Airport, Shannon Airport and Knock Airport &mdash; whether I agree with Knock Airport is not important at this point &mdash; that investment in those airports has a social as well as an economic dimension. There is a social reason why the airports are there and there is a social reason why Government money should be committed to them.</P>
    <P>If there is any airport in this State which must stand or fall on its own economic base, that airport surely must be Dublin Airport. The reason I object is that this airport is being partly funded by taxpayers' money. The partial funding of this airport by the taxpayers is saying that the busiest and biggest airport in the State cannot be self-financing. I have no objection to funds being made available to Cork, to Shannon or to Knock: If you want to make funds available to Knock on the basis of social need that is your decision. But surely extensions to the biggest and busiest airport in the State should be capable of being financed without resort to taxpayers' money. Why is it necessary that 25 per cent of this should be provided by the Government, as mentioned by the Minister in his speech? He said the remaining 25 per cent will be provided by Seán Citizen. He calls it the Exchequer but it is really Seán Citizen. Seán Citizen will provide 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> I see no good logical reason why an organisation which we are told has a trading surplus of £11.5 million cannot provide this out of its own resources. I recognise that in doing so it might still be necessary &mdash; if the project was reasonable and if the Government were satisfied that it was such a reasonable project &mdash; to give a State guarantee to the borrowing of the company. But there is no reason whatsoever why the company should not, out of its own resources, finance all this project. I await with interest the Minister's explanation as to why this uniquely very busy airport is unable to finance its own development.</P>
    <P>If you look at the situation in Great Britain where all the British airport authorities are being privatised &mdash; I am not suggesting we should do the same in Ireland; that is not the thrust of my argument &mdash; it means somebody has decided that, taking the good with the bad, the busy with the slack, they can, in the future, finance all their own developments. Armed with that information, we are unwilling to impose an obligation on Aer Rianta to finance from their own resources the busiest airport, situated in the most populated area of the country. Leaving aside the fact that we do not know whether the investment is a good or bad thing, I do not see why public funds should be committed to it at all.</P>
    <P>I would have quite a lot to say about the extension of the runway in Cork Airport and about the importance of Shannon, which has an immensely important part to play in Irish aviation. I would have much to say about the poor and bad decision to invest so much State money in Knock Airport if it were relevant to the motion. As it is not relevant to the motion I will not develop it. I ask the Minister not to lose sight of the fact that the Members of this House &mdash; whether they are supporters of the Government or members of the Opposition &mdash; are not possessors of a vast automatic insight into the mental processes of semi-State organisations. We cannot automatically say whether investments are a good idea.</P>
    <P>If parliamentary democracy is to mean <Col N="936" /> anything here it must mean that more information is given to more Members of Parliament who can express their view and their view can have a real part to play in the decision under discussion and in future decisions which are even more important. This kind of approach to public expenditure reminds me of a story told to me while I was a very young member of a local authority. An older and far wiser member of the authority spoke to me after a meeting one evening when we had approved a vast drainage scheme for the city of Cork, more or less on the nod. I expressed horror at this approach towards public expenditure. He said to me that, if the discussion was about buying an additional ten typewriters we would have discussed it for an hour, but we put through on the nod millions and millions of pounds of public money because, in some mysterious way, that is capital. Unfortunately, that is the way in which public affairs are run here. I am not satisfied that they should continue to be run in that way. There is a duty on this Minister and on all Ministers, in this Administration and in future Administrations, to be more forthcoming with the Legislature, to explain to them the rationale behind their decisions, to treat them as sensible human beings and sensible participators in the science of government.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has made the right decision he has nothing to fear in presenting us with the facts, because we will start from a position where we will be prejudiced in favour of the Minister's decision in the first place. Inevitably we will be presented with the same facts and in the vast majority of cases, we will arrive at the same decision as arrived at by the Minister but it will be an informed decision, one that we can stand over and not based on a blind faith in the political and economic wisdom of Ministers of this Administration or any other Administration.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply in this regard. Words fail me concerning why we should approve this order on the basis of the presentation before us today. I apologise to the Minister for the second <Col N="937" /> time for appearing to have taken a position which is antagonistic to himself. I take it because he is the only person here today about whom I can make such comments. He is not the only person about whom I would like to make the comments, but he is the only person about whom I can make the comments because of the restrictions when commenting on other public servants, placed upon me by the rules of this House.</P>
    <P>In concluding my remarks I look forward to the Minister's explanation as to why we in this House should approve a State guarantee in the sum of £25 million in respect of a project which will cost £31 million with 50 per cent of it borrowed. The borrowing is to be about £16 million but we are giving approval for a State guarantee of £25 million. That is an extraordinary way for a House of the Oireachtas to deal with taxpayers' funds.</P>

      <P>This has been a very lively and interesting debate. It ranged over a wide variety of subjects, some perhaps a little remote from the proposal before the House which essentially relates to the financing of a new runway at Dublin Airport. I intend to cover most of the points raised.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan raised the issue of whether we should be discussing a Bill before the House rather than a draft order. In case there might be any undue emphasis on the word &ldquo;draft&rdquo;, the order remains in draft form until it has received the approval of both Houses. It would be incorrect to suggest that we are using a procedure which is breaking new ground. The contrary is the case. There are quite a number of precedents for this type of order and, indeed, there was one last year relating to a guarantee for the borrowings of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>

      <P>Except, of course, that this issue was decided as far back as 1954 when both Houses of the Oireachtas passed the State Guarantees Act, 1954. That Act provided for the making of orders from time to time but it provided the precaution that such orders should not just be laid before the Houses but should be debated and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. The point raised by Senator Honan raises a far wider issue as to whether the 1954 Act is the basis on which we should be discussing this item but, from the legislative and administrative point of view, I can assure the House that we are following the proper procedures.</P>
      <P>Let us consider also the issue raised by Senator Honan. The issue involves, as I see it, the entitlement of legislators to voice an opinion on the issue before the House. Because of the need for approval by the Houses, Members have an opportunity to voice their opinions. Would there be a tremendous deal of difference if I came in to the House with a Bill seeking approval for it? One could say there would be a number of stages in the Bill, but I wonder if that would make much difference. Members of both Houses have the opportunity to express their view on the issue in question and in this instance have the right and entitlement to express approval or a dissenting voice in relation to the order.</P>
      <P>I am heartened by the general approval expressed by practically all Senators for the proposal before the House. Senator Honan raised the question of Shannon and referred in particular to the possibility of a runway extension at Shannon. I assure the House that Aer Rianta and the Department keep the adequacy of State airport facilities under continuous review. I confess I was unaware that there was a major priority in relation to a runway at Shannon but, the point having been made by Senator Honan, I will arrange to discuss it with my colleague, Deputy Mitchell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point in <Col N="939" /> relation to Shannon concerns the western fuel farm and I confirm that Aer Rianta are meeting the full cost which is over £1 million.</P>
      <P>Regarding preinspection facilities at Shannon, this project involves the provision of US emigration and public health preinspection of passengers and aircraft crew at Shannon for entry to the US. The benefit to Shannon is that Aer Rianta are able to market the facility. This is another reason why airlines should operate through Shannon, thus generating additional traffic at the airport. The facility was introduced on 1 July on the basis of a four months trial period at the end of which the results will be assessed by both the Irish and US authorities. Following that evaluation a decision will be taken as to whether preinspection should be established as a permanent feature at Shannon. The initial reaction of all concerned with the operation of the facilities has been very favourable but, I cannot say anything further pending full evaluation not just by ourselves but also by the US authorities.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald is enthusiastic about the proposal. It is important that it be made clear to the House that down through the years the Dublin runway system has been fully maintained and overlayed as necessary, but the point has now been reached where further maintenance and overlaying would not be a good investment and, therefore, a new runway is now a necessity. I will take this point up later because there is some misconception about the need for a new runway. Comments have been made in relation to overcrowding, overcapacity and so on. It is important that the House should understand the background to the proposal and the necessity for the new runway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hillery referred to the review group on the Aer Rianta structure. I do not want to be precise in relation to a date for a report of the review group. Senator Hillery is a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies and he will be aware that this question was considered by the joint <Col N="940" /> committee in 1979 who recommended, at that time, against change. Obviously there is now a new situation and there are complex issues involved. It is proper that these issues should receive more serious consideration before a recommendation is given. I hope the review group will complete its work comprehensively and within that parameter produce the recommendation at a reasonably early date.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised a number of points which perhaps strayed a little from the runway development. I understand Senator Daly's attitude in relation to a number of aspects of air traffic. I am not sure if my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, has been informed fully of that attitude but I confirm that I will ensure that the Minister is made aware of his attitude.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised an interesting point concerning the cost and as one would expect, considering his home base, raised some comparisons in relation to the Connacht Regional Airport. The figures indicate clearly that the proposal involves a substantial expense compared with what was involved in the Connacht Regional Airport. The reason for this is that the paved surface associated with the new runway at Dublin &mdash; the runway plus the parallel taxiway &mdash; is twice the area of the paved surface at the Connacht Regional Airport. Also the cost of the advanced navigational aids and associated lighting systems, the new control building and consequential roadworks exceed substantially the cost of the basic facilities provided at Connacht Regional Airport.</P>
    <P>Regarding proposals for the operation of scheduled services from Knock airport the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, is prepared to consider any such proposals in the most sympathetic manner possible within the ambit of the particular bilateral air traffic agreement. The Minister has authorised a charter service from Luton and Coventry to Knock and is currently examing proposals from two operators for authorisations to operate scheduled services between Knock and certain UK destinations. I understand <Col N="941" /> further that a lease to Manchester has been approved in principle.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised also the question of licensing for Connacht Regional Airport. The House should be aware that the airport is licensed at present for operations in accordance with visual flight aids. When landing aids and runway lights are commissioned the visual flight rules restriction will be removed. Obviously it cannot be done pending the provision of such additional facilities. The Senator raised also the Ballymun-Naul road project. I dealt with this in my opening remarks and pointed out that an action group made very strong recommendations objecting to the proposed road closure and seeking instead the provision of a tunnel. These representations are being considered carefully but no final decision has yet been taken and obviously I cannot prejudge the full consideration of that situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan raised the question of the purpose of the new runway. I can assure the Senator that it is not to increase capacity but to replace the deteriorating main runway which is near the end of its life. I would like also to scotch the view &mdash; if it exists &mdash; that this is a proposal which has developed over the past few weeks or, indeed, months, but is rather a proposal that has been discussed for many years. It was first mooted in the late seventies and a formal detailed report was received as far back as 1982.</P>

      <P>By the Minister for Communications. Since then there has been a further detailed examination. A group, representative of Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and the Department examined the situation. Criticisms might have been made that the decisions were slow in being taken but, on the other hand, criticisms that hasty decisions were taken have no foundation at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Senators raised regional issues and I fully understand their views but, despite the claims for different parts of the country, virtually everybody agrees that <Col N="942" /> there is a need for such a runway at an airport which carries 70 per cent of the traffic in and out of this country and this has to be catered for. Having said that, we have to consider the other airports and in particular the other two State airports. I fully understand the approach Senator Cregan has to Cork. I outlined in my opening remarks the fact that expenditure of £2 million was completed or was underway since 1982 at Cork Airport. Senator Cregan and other Members of the House will know where my heart lies in relation to the Cork proposal for a runway extension. I can fully understand the impassioned pleas from Senator Cregan. On behalf of Cork, I will be continuing my discussions with my colleague, Minister Mitchell, on this issue which is presently being actively considered.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised a point in regard to bird feathers at all Irish airports. It is a valid point and because of its validity the Department of Communications liaise with the local authorities on the location and management of refuse dumps in cases where birds that might be attracted to such dumps could constitute a hazard to aviation. Certainly it is a point which is fully taken on board by the Department of Communications and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>He also raised a point in relation to duty-free shops. There should be an understanding that duty-free shops in general must make a profit. That profit contributes to the surplus of Aer Rianta and that surplus goes to the Exchequer. Let us not lose sight of that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <P>That was their total. I think it is important that all Senators &mdash; and I will come to Senator O'Leary in a moment &mdash; should know that the Exchequer received of their surplus in 1985 a sum of £10.2 million from Aer Rianta. That is a point that has to be borne in mind, particularly by those who ask why does Aer Rianta not fund this from their own resources. Their surplus comes to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>On Senator Daly's point, I will have to point out that he is talking about Aer Lingus which is a separate semi-State body from Aer Rianta. The duty-free shops are under the control of Aer Rianta. I would not countenance excessive profits but I would expect Aer Rianta to run duty-free shops on a profitable basis. Considering that the return is favourable to the State, the Exchequer and ultimately to Seán Citizen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the profit margins in the duty-free shops are reasonable but in relation to any particular commodity, since that is a matter under the operation and control of Aer Rianta, I would not have the exact profit ratio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also raised the point about concessionary fares for Aer Lingus staff. He wanted to know the basis on which seats were allocated to Aer Lingus staff on cut price terms and the priority which they could receive over fare-paying customers. I have checked this point and I am assured that the staff of Aer Lingus using concession fares do not get priority over full fare-paying passengers, whether <Col N="944" /> they be business fares, Superapex fare or Apex fare. It has been confirmed to me that seats are allocated to staff on a standby basis only. They have the same entitlement as anybody else to pay the full fare if they so wish.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary made, as I would expect, a lively contribution. The basic premise on which he delivered his speech is incorrect and is answered by the point I made earlier that the surplus of Aer Rianta is virtually totally transferred to the Exchequer for the benefit of Seán Citizen. In that situation how can we suggest that Aer Rianta should, from their own resources, fund a capital project totally? In fact, the tradition in the past, because of the requirement to transfer the surplus to the Exchequer, was that capital projects were funded totally by the Exchequer. We now have a new approach in relation to this new development at Dublin Airport. We have a situation where the Exchequer is not directly funding the major part of the cost of the project. What will happen is that the company will provide a quarter of the cost from its future surpluses and own resources. It will borrow a further 50 per cent and what is left for the Exchequer to provide is one-quarter. That is a very considerable change in the situation in the past where total funding was provided by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I share Senator O'Leary's concern for the taxpayer but we are in this instance not talking about a lame duck, and certainly in relation to Dublin Airport we are not talking about a lame duck. Of the Aer Rianta profit in 1985, Dublin Airport contributed £7.8 million which has now found its way into the coffers of the Exchequer. I appreciate Senator O'Leary's compliment in the opening remarks but I cannot agree with the basic thrust of his argument on the basis of the situation which I have just outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an investment of £54 million by the Minister in Aer Rianta in capital at the end of 1984 and we are getting a return on that. Most years there is nothing at all.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned earlier, the traditional arrangement was that capital expenditure was totally funded by the Exchequer; surpluses were year-by-year handed in to the Exchequer. That situation has now changed, with 75 per cent of the responsibility remaining with Aer Rianta and the remaining 25 per cent to be provided by the Exchequer. I have tried to cover as best I could the majority of the points raised. I am pleased that there has been such support for this proposal and on that basis I am asking the House to approve the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to introduce the Second Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1986. Everybody in this House is aware of the importance of our architectural and archaeological heritage and of the need to protect it adequately. When we realise that it is over 50 years since the principal Act came into force and more than 30 years since an amending Act was passed, we must question if the legislation is now grossly out of date, or was it so good that it stood the test of time. The answer is a little of both. Let us hope that this piece of legislation will also prove to be effective for many years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main provisions of this Bill are not entirely new. On two previous occasions Bills of similar content were introduced in Dáil Éireann, the first by the present Minister for Finance in 1978 and the second by Deputy Donnellan in 1980. Both attempts were resisted on the grounds that comprehensive legislation was in preparation. It would have been better to have allowed the proposals to go through. We could have been spared some of the heartaches of the past eight years. Besides which, the comprehensive legislation proved illusory. Important <Col N="946" /> issues concerning the constitutional right to private property and other matters were coming before the courts. Some were resolved, others remain to be resolved. It is not possible today and will not be for quite some time to have the definitive answers which would enable comprehensive legislation to be drafted.</P>
    <P>The Bill which we are now discussing does two things. It up-dates the existing legislation and it breaks new ground. One important area requiring up-dating is the level of the fines which can be imposed. Under the present Acts, the highest fine that can be imposed is £50. Such an amount is derisory by present-day money values. Of course the term of imprisonment of six months which might accompany, or substitute for, the fine still has its deterrent force. Under the new Bill, the level of fines will go up to £1,000 for the more serious offences. Some still consider these too low. They may even wonder if we are losing our nerve especially if we consider how severe the law was in the past. It is worth recalling that the first enactment for the preservation of monuments in these islands, the Act of the 8th and 9th Victoria, chapter 44, section 1, passed in 1845 made it a misdemeanour, punishable by imprisonment not exceeding six months and a public or private whipping, once, twice or thrice, at the discretion of the court, to unlawfully or maliciously destroy or damage any picture, statue, monument or painted glass in any church, chapel or other place of worship; or any statue or monument exposed to public view.</P>
    <P>The level of fines and penalties is in the end the test of our seriousness. Not that we wish to err by excess but we must show that we are in earnest when it comes to preserving our heritage. Can the Members present visualise a recent occurence where a farmer asked an official of the Office of Public Works on the telephone the amount of the fine for destroying a monument because, as he said, &ldquo;if it is the right amount I will go ahead and bulldoze the monument&rdquo;. Hereafter if you find an archaeological object and fail to report it, or falsely report, you may be fined £300 instead of <Col N="947" /> £10. If you excavate in search of archaeological objects without a licence, you can be fined up to £1,000 instead of £25 as heretofore. If you bury a corpse within a national monument in contravention of a burials prohibition order, you can be fined up to £300 instead of £20 as of now.</P>
    <P>In many other ways too, the Bill up-dates the present law. However, its main thrust is to face the new challenges of today. Heritage preservation has been marching forward in a more united fashion recently. The European countries have been co-ordinating their efforts through the Council of Europe. There are some milestones along the way. The year 1975 was European Architectural Heritage year. Its purpose was to call attention to Europe's rich and varied architecture and the unique character of her historic towns which was fast disappearing through neglect, demolition and ill-considered redevelopment. It sought to sound the alarm and produce action before it was too late. That year produced model conservation projects throughout all the countries which became involved. It generated much interest in Ireland also. It culminated in the congress on the European Architectural Heritage Year held in Amsterdam from 21 to 25 October 1975 which signalled the formal adoption of policies of integrated conservation. No longer was the preservation of the heritage to be viewed in isolation. It was to be built into the planning process. Local authorities were to be more intimately involved. There should be citizen participation also. Ireland took a lively interest in these proceedings and participated in the subsequent drafting of the convention for the protection of the architectural heritage of Europe. This convention was signed by my predecessor in office, Deputy Joe Bermingham, at Granada, in October last, and I am confident that it will be brought before the Oireachtas for ratification in due course.</P>
    <P>The reconstitution of the National Monuments Advisory Council on a wider academic basis and under the new title of the Historic Monuments Council is <Col N="948" /> designed to be a major factor in the implementation of integrated conservation policies. It is a body which will have to be consulted in regard to all proposals which affect heritage properties. I hope to chair the first meeting of the reconstituted council within the next fortnight. I also hope many of the issues that will be raised by the public and here in the Seanad can be channelled through our advisory council when it comes to considering them at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Integrated conservation will be carried a step further by the declaration under this Bill that all pre-1700 AD buildings or sites rank as historic monuments and qualify for protection. This, of course, does not mean that the national monuments legislation is not also concerned with post-1700 structures. There is nothing in the Bill or in the National Monuments Acts which precludes the OPW from taking protective action in regard to such buildings. The commissioners already have in their care a small number of post-1700 buildings as national monuments and I need hardly mention that the commissioners also look after a number of post-1700 buildings which are of architectural or historical importance and which are in use for State purposes. Furthermore, the new concept of &ldquo;Archaeological Area&rdquo; is introduced. This would cover in a rural context an extensive site such as that of an ancient field system. In an urban context it would cover topographically definable areas of archaeological importance and, in particular, areas of original or medieval settlement.</P>
    <P>It is never sufficient, however, to take unto ourselves powers of protection without going to the trouble of identifying the buildings and sites which make up our heritage. Back in 1666, the Boy King Charles XI of Sweden, with the help of his mother and council, drew up the most comprehensive monuments decree that could be conceived. Although he was too young even to sign it on his own behalf &mdash; his mother, Hedvig Eleonora had to append her name to the royal proclamation &mdash; it gave Sweden a head start in heritage preservation that no other <Col N="949" /> nation could equal. As a result, the Swedish people have been conscious of their heritage in a way that others have not been. Nevertheless, this has not meant that monuments in Sweden have not been destroyed for the simple reason that many monuments had not been identified and, in fact, the local museums on whom the survey work has been devolved are still engaged in the identification of the heritage. If we had achieved our objective of bringing in a comprehensive Monuments Bill which gave blanket protection to all historic monuments, this still would not have sufficed. The two things have to go hand in hand, identification and protection.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that the work of identification has been proceeding at a more rapid pace recently. On 27 May last I launched the archaeological inventory of County Louth: sites and monuments records for Counties Meath, Carlow and Wicklow and reports on the urban archaeological surveys of Counties Laois, Offaly and Dublin city. Further sites and monuments records for Donegal and Wexford are to follow later this year and by the end of the decade such records will be available for the entire country. The availability of these surveys to planners, to farm development officers and to the public generally will make the task of protecting our heritage much easier for a start.</P>
    <P>Under the new Bill, a register will be established. Entry into this register of a monument or an archaeological area will mean that an owner proposing to do some work to the monument, or within the area in question, must give two months notice to the Commissioners of Public Works. This will give time for a decision to be reached as to whether or not the heritage interest in the site should be recorded by archaeological excavation, if not already recorded, and the site then should either be given legal protection or allowed to be utilised as desired by the owner for development or otherwise. Monuments and areas entered in the register may also be registered in the Land Registry as burdens affecting land. The effect of this would be that persons <Col N="950" /> buying land would know if a protected site or monument encumbered the land. This is, in fact, a sincere attempt to avoid the heartbreak which can occur when a person buys land for development and subsequently finds his plans halted because a monument or archaeological area of which he was not aware is found to exist there. It is not possible, however, to provide for every situation that may arise. No matter how comprehensive the survey carried out, something unsuspected may still turn up. Ploughing or land clearance reveals souterrains used for the storage in olden times and as places of refuge when danger threatened. Study of urban buildings may discover features indicating a history going back further than anybody suspected. These are part of the hazard of living and while we strive to ameliorate the adverse effects of such discoveries, the old adage <i>caveat emptor</i> must still apply. But by implementing the measure now before us, we can progressively eliminate the problem.</P>
    <P>I now turn to another area that is new; the control of metal detecting. We are all aware, I am sure, of the damage that has been done to archaeological sites by treasure hunters. Reports have been received from almost every part of the country of sites which have been scarred by their operations. Coins and other objects providing valuable dating evidence have been removed from their context. This represents irretrievable loss and it is clear that something has to be done about it.</P>
    <P>On publication of this Bill, there was an outcry from groups representing the users of metal detectors. It was alleged that under the Bill one could not use a metal detector even in one's own back garden without committing an offence. There was over-reaction in this. On the other hand, some archaeologists have said that we are not going far enough, that metal detectors should be banned altogether.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that most persons will find the provisions of this Bill adequate and reasonable. Up to the present, it would have been necessary to catch an <Col N="951" /> offender red-handed in the act of extracting archaeological objects from the ground to be sure of achieving a successful prosecution. This Bill puts the shoe on the other foot. Anybody caught with a metal detector at a protected monument or site is liable to conviction unless he can prove his innocence. At the same time, persons using metal detectors for legitimate purposes such as mineral prospecting, and tracing pipes and cables have no need to fear that they will be inconvenienced in any way.</P>
    <P>What of treasure hunting? Treasure hunters using metal detectors may no longer bring them on to protected sites on land or under water without a licence. What then if they use them at archaeological sites which have not as yet been afforded protection under the National Monuments Acts? If a person armed with a metal detector is found using it at a known archaeological site it will be presumed under this law that the device was being used for the purpose of searching for archaeological objects and he or she will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Does this mean that treasure hunting with metal detectors is being made totally illegal? No, provided those treasure hunters keep away from known archaeological sites, and that they are not specifically searching for archaeological objects. The great problem has been that, in the past decade or so, one archaeological site after another has been ransacked by the users of metal detectors.</P>
    <P>Holes have been dug all over certain sites. The Hill of Tara itself has indications of such probes. This is appalling vandalism and the perpetrators cannot be unaware of the damage they are doing. Bodies representing groups of metal detector users insist that their members observe a very strict code and that a few people have been giving a very bad name to the whole fraternity. That is undoubtedly true.</P>
    <P>The problem, moreover, is not confined to Ireland. The report produced by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the subject in 1981 under the joint editorship of Deputy <Col N="952" /> Flanagan and Mr. Alan Beith indicates that concern is being felt in all the countries of the Council of Europe in regard to this problem. The Parliamentary Assembly in fact in its recommendation R. 921 (1981) invites Governments to respond to the problem of affording full legal protection to all archaeological remains. This, however, has not been considered sufficient because one would still have to catch an offender in the act of interfering with an archaeological site. Hence it has been found necessary to build into this Bill the presumption already referred to of such interference where a person is found in possession of a metal detector at a site of known archaeological interest.</P>
    <P>While it is not the intention of the Bill however, to outlaw all use of metal detectors as a hobby, it is well to remember that treasure hunting almost always involves breaches of the common law. There is trespass on private property, interference with such property and, possibly, theft of property. I consider the provision necessary and fully justified.</P>
    <P>The next major development which this Bill has to deal with is that of underwater archaeology. The proliferation of amateur diving clubs has inevitably forced the pace here, particularly because of the number of historic wrecks being discovered. This, in turn, has revealed a certain imbalance in our situation. On the one hand, we have the increasing capacity of sports divers and others to discover historic remains preserved under water, whether in lakes, rivers or in the sea. On the other hand we have a dearth of archaeologists and conservation facilities to deal with this heritage area. One must pay tribute to the work of the Maritime Institute of Ireland in persuading a significant number of the diving fraternity to cooperate in the preservation and recording <i>in situ</i> of wrecks and artefacts under water. We must also recognise the work of the CFT or Irish Underwater Council in training so many amateur divers and bringing their members to a high level of performance and of observance of safety procedures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> Indeed only last week I was presented with the outline survey of the most important wreck, the <i>Queen Victoria</i>, which was done at the instigation of the Maritime Institute with the total co-operation of the Office of Public Works and involving three different sub-aqua clubs and divers who gave of their time voluntarily and I would like to commend all concerned. It is but a beginning; we have to build on that outline survey.</P>
    <P>The question of the increased capacity to locate objects of historical interest under water and the limited academic and conservation resources to deal with the discovered material has engaged the attention of the Council of Europe. In 1978 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe published a 200 page report on the matter, following which an international committee was convened to draft a convention for the protection of the under water cultural heritage. While this convention has not yet been open for signature, the final draft represents a broad agreement on how this heritage should be protected.</P>
    <P>The present provisions of section 3 of this Bill are in line generally with the relevant provisions of the draft convention. One of the significant features of the draft European convention is that it avoids interference with the rights of identifiable owners, the law of salvage and other rules of maritime law, these being considered to be too useful to be set aside, leaving a vacuum to be filled with new law which would, in turn, have to be tested in the courts.</P>
    <P>What section 3 does is to introduce sufficient controls to ensure that satisfactory recovery and conservation procedures are followed. It is to be understood, of course, that the Commissioners of Public Works would never issue a licence to conduct salvage operations at the site of an historic wreck unless they were satisfied that the operation would be subject to adequate archaeological supervision. However, once such an operation has been authorised, the existing machinery of salvage law and the role of the receiver of wrecks under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, would <Col N="954" /> come into operation so that salvage claims and claims to ownership rights could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>While discoveries of historic wrecks have provided the motive power to bring us to this point in our legislation, from an archaeological point of view wrecks are but one aspect of the very wide field of underwater archaeology. Crannogs and other early habitation sites have been preserved intact over many centuries by reason of being underwater. The section is so drafted that it may be used to protect such sites as well.</P>
    <P>The reference to the continental shelf arises from the fact that historic wrecks are occasionally located in the course of offshore oil exploration. Already the licences issued to offshore operators include a requirement to report any such finds. The next logical step is to be able to afford some sort of protection to such discoveries. Obviously there is no question of policing the entire area of our continental shelf but it is important to have the power to intervene if the need arises.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of the Historic Monuments Council. This council will have a broader academic base than the National Monuments Advisory Council which it replaces. It is hoped as a result that greater attention will be given to its recommendations. As successor to the National Monuments Advisory Council, it will be a prescribed authority under the planning regulations for the purposes of referral of planning applications which affect sites of archaeological or historical interest or buildings of artistic, architectural or historic interest.</P>
    <P>Because of the heavy academic representation on the new council there is of course, less room to accommodate representatives of local archeological societies. However, it is felt that their real place is on the historic monuments advisory committees which local authorities are authorised to establish under section 22 of the Principal Act as amended by section 14 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>A problem with the old council was that the terms of office of all members <Col N="955" /> lapsed together so that a hiatus would occur between the lapsing of one council and the reappointment of the next. This problem is now overcome by an arrangement where half the members' terms will lapse after three years while half will continue for six years. This will mean that, at no future time, will all members' terms lapse together.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the provisions in the Bill, while of minor order are nevertheless useful and necessary for the proper protection and management of our heritage of monuments and sites.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many who would regard the measures contained in the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1986, as being long overdue. There are also many who would regard them as being too little, too late.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to amend and extend the National Monuments Acts of 1930 and 1954 and to make further provision for the protection and preservation of national monuments and archaeological objects. It includes measures to deal with the use and possession of detection devices such as metal detectors. It also makes provision for the protection and preservation of historic wrecks. Other sections in the Bill, as the Minister has stated, provide for the establishment and maintenance of a Register of Historic Monuments and also for the reconstitution of the former National Monuments Advisory Council under the new title of the Historic Monuments Council. Penalties provided for in the Principal Act are increased and new penalties are introduced. As in most Bills which have come before the House in recent times, provision is made to enable fees to be prescribed for consents and licences granted under various sections. It would now appear that a consideration in relation to every piece of proposed legislation is the extent to which it can be used as a revenue raising device.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Bill in a general way. Anyone would have to support the Bill in so far as it goes, but one is entitled to <Col N="956" /> ask if it goes far enough or whether it should go much further. Sadly, in recent years many important archaeological sites throughout the country have disappeared or have been destroyed as a result of modern development. Historic earthworks in general and ring forts in particular have greatly suffered as a result of the amount of land reclamation that has been carried out in all parts of the country in recent years. I am not suggesting that all of the damage and destruction which occurred as far as these earthworks are concerned was deliberate or intentional. I accept that quite a lot of it was probably unintentional but certainly some of it was definitely deliberate. The Minister in her speech referred to the case of the particular developer who phoned the Office of Public Works with the query which she mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that, according to the best estimates, hundreds and, possibly thousands, of historic sites and monuments have been totally destroyed. For centuries one of the greatest protections that such sites had was the superstition which existed, particularly in rural areas, especially in relation ring forts and fairy mounds. This superstition ensured these sites were not interfered with but now it seems to have disappeared completely. Therefore, it is vital that it be replaced with some other form of protection. That protection can only be provided through effective legislation which should be strictly enforced.</P>
    <P>Vandalism and greed have also contributed in no small way to the destruction and disappearance of part of our archaeological heritage. The <i>Irish Times</i> of Saturday, 27 September 1986 reported the unauthorised removal in 1984 of five decorated early Christian grave slabs from a monastic site in Carrowntemple, County Sligo. The carved slabs were stated to be worth an estimated £10,000 each on the United States art market. They were part of a set of ten carved stones at Carrowntemple, believed to date from between 800 and 1000 A.D. The stones were elaborately decorated with Celtic crosses, spirals, abstract designs and, in one case, a full human <Col N="957" /> figure. According to that Irish Times report a National Museum spokesman described them as &ldquo;unique and irreplaceable&rdquo;. To make matters worse, this is not the only incident that has occurred in County Sligo. The report continued:</P>
    <P>Three similar carved stones are missing from another medieval site at nearby Mount Irwin, also in County Sligo, and there are fears that several of the estimated 30 to 50 early Christian monastic sites and cemeteries in County Sligo may have been looted. The three Mount Irwin stones are believed to have been smuggled out of Ireland for sale in the US.</P>
    <P>A spokesman for the Board of Works, which is responsible for the conservation and security of ancient monuments, said yesterday it was &ldquo;practically impossible&rdquo; to give an accurate estimate of the value of the Carrowntemple slabs. But a comparable carving had been sold at Sotheby's last year for £12,000, he said.</P>
    <P>The report then quoted a spokesman from Sligo County Council who stated that the council owned the cemetery in question and that the items referred to had been removed from it without their knowledge or permission. He then went on to say that a full statement of the facts of the case had been lodged with the Garda and that the council were anxious a prosecution would be taken and the culprits brought to justice. However, the report concluded with the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>But official sources in Dublin cautioned yesterday that a successful prosecution was doubtful because of legal difficulties in establishing ownership of the carvings, and uncertainties in the law relating to unlisted national monuments and archaeological treasures generally. Last year the State withdrew from a similar case in which a German national was appealing a District Court conviction relating to the theft of stone carvings from Clonmacnoise. Three of those carvings have never been recovered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> That report by John Armstrong gives some idea of the extent to which archaeological objects are at risk. However, in case anyone thinks that what happened in County Sligo was an isolated incident, I should like to refer to a further item, again by John Armstrong, which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday, 25 October 1986, exactly four weeks after the report to which I have just referred. Last Saturday's report was headed &ldquo;Stolen carving ripped from wall&rdquo;. This report referred to the theft of a unique early Christian stone carving this time for a 7th century monastic site at Inis Caltra on Lough Derg. The report went on:</P>
    <P>The carving of an interlaced cross inset with abstract designs was ripped from steel brackets embedded in a stone wall.</P>
    <P>A spokesman for the Office of Public Works is quoted as saying that they were absolutely dismayed by this latest outrage. He went on to add:</P>
    <P>We will obviously have to re-examine our whole policy of leaving historic monuments in their natural environment in the light of this and other recent developments.</P>
    <P>The report then referred to the removal of the five stone carvings from Carrowntemple and the reports of systematic looting of early Christian sites at other locations in County Sligo and along the west coast. In relation to the Inis Caltra theft, the report went on to say:</P>
    <P>The director of the National Museum, Dr. Brendan O'Riordan, said yesterday he was &ldquo;horrified&rdquo; by the theft, and he appealed to people in the area to report any suspicious traffic between Lough Derg and the mainland to the gardaí. He said: &ldquo;This kind of vandalism has become a serious threat to parts of our national heritage. The best defence against it is the vigilance of local people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to the Office of Public Works the Inis Caltra carving&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...a very beautifully decorated and <Col N="959" /> important artefact&rdquo;&mdash; was stolen within the past four weeks. The steel clamps holding it upright against one of the original monastery walls were broken with a crowbar or hammer, and the carving lifted out. &ldquo;It has been reported to the gardaí but so far they have drawn a blank,&rdquo; the spokesman said.</P>
    <P>Inis Caltra, one of the most important early Christian sites in County Clare, contains the ruins of five churches, the earliest dating from the 7th century, and a round tower. Brian Boru is said to have built one of the churches and the site was abandoned during the 14th century or the 15th century. It later became a place of pilgrimage.</P>
    <P>According to Dr. Liam de Paor of University College, Dublin, who excavated part of the site during the 1970s it is now &ldquo;virtually impossible to safeguard monuments left in places where they had been perfectly safe for hundreds of years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Dr. de Paor added that another stone cross had been stolen from Inis Caltra some years ago and never recovered. There were suspicions that some of the looting was carried out by &ldquo;well heeled tourists&rdquo; on boating holidays on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>If I wished I could catalogue many other incidents in relation to our archaeological heritage in order to establish the extent of the destruction and vandalism that has taken place and is taking place. However, that is not necessary. Everyone who is interested in these matters realises that the situation is serious. Clonmacnoise, for instance, has lost several of its carved tomb slabs. Souvenir hunters, treasure seekers and amateur archaeologists have done untold damage in the vicinity of many of our more important sites, not to mention the damage which has undoubtedly been caused to lesser known sites in every part of the country.</P>
    <P>The widespread availability and use of metal detectors in recent years led to a situation where every archaeological site <Col N="960" /> in the country was at risk from treasure hunters. I am sure it will never be possible to quantify the amount of damage been done over the years by such people. I am glad this Bill makes some effort to control the use of detection devices, such as metal detectors, and to provide penalties for their unauthorised use for the purpose of searching for archaeological objects. The Bill also makes it an offence to bring one of these devices onto the site of a protected monument, archaeological area, or wreck site. However, I wonder if the Bill goes far enough. I believe serious consideration should be given to the introduction of a licensing system for metal detectors and similar detection devices and that it should be an offence to own or be in the possession of such a device without being the holder of a current licence.</P>
    <P>The advertising of detection devices, such as metal detectors for treasure hunting, should also be prohibited in my view. I also believe the law should be strengthened in relation to the whole area of treasure troves. All treasure trove should automatically become the property of the State. There should be very severe penalties for non-disclosure. There should be no question of compensation being paid to anyone finding treasure trove. The laws of trespass, in addition to the other relevant laws, should be vigorously enforced against anyone found searching for treasure or for archaeological objects on property other than their own. The damage that can be done by the treasure hunter or the amateur archaeologist can never be over-emphasised.</P>
    <P>The point is very well made in the last section of that excellent booklet entitled &ldquo;Irish Field Monuments' which was published last year by the National Parks and Monuments Service of the Office of Public Works. The section, on page 23, is headed &ldquo;Archaeological Excavation&rdquo; and it states:</P>
    <P>Modern archaeological excavation is a highly skilled activity requiring much expertise in the recovery of the evidence and in its interpretation and publication. Contrary to popular opinion <Col N="961" /> archaeologists do not excavate in order to find gold or other valuable objects. Rather their intention is to get the maximum information about the past from the ground. Objects found in an excavation are important principally because of their recorded association with other objects, structures, layers or features. For this reason it is important that unqualified persons should not undertake archaeological excavation and if by accident a discovery is made everything should be left as it is without any further uncovering of the object or feature or any other disturbance of the immediate area until an official inspection has been made.</P>
    <P>I believe that is a message which cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
    <P>Another important provision of the Bill is the section which enables the Commissioners to make orders protecting wrecks on the seabed or in inland waters. This section also makes it obligatory to report the discovery of historic wrecks or ancient objects under water. It prohibits interference, dumping, surveying, diving and salvage involving such wrecks or objects by making these operations subject to licence. This section of the Bill is very welcome.</P>
    <P>As we approach 1988, which is the quadricentennial of the loss of the ships of the Spanish Armada around our coast, it is inevitable that increasing interest will centre on these wrecks and that, therefore, they require urgent statutory protection. In view of the rapid advance of salvage technology this is a very necessary and important section of the Bill. However, I have one reservation about this section, that is, that it appears it will apply only to wrecks which are more than 100 years old. If this is the case I would be very interested to hear why 100 years and not 50 years or 60 years are mentioned. In my view 50 years would be a reasonable period after which ownership of a wreck should lapse and pass on to the country in whose waters that wreck lies. Surely 50 years would provide any owner with ample opportunity to salvage his wrecked ship. If we do not change <Col N="962" /> the 100 year condition it will mean that wrecks which only date back to the early part of this century or to the First World War will not be protected for many years to come. With the rapid advance in salvage technology the likelihood is that they will require statutory protection long before that.</P>
    <P>We are told in the explanatory memorandum that the concept of an historic monument is being introduced in the Bill to cover the generality of monuments so as to allow the title &ldquo;national monument&rdquo; to be reserved for those whose protection is of national importance. According to the Bill the term &ldquo;historic monument&rdquo; is intended to include any monument associated with the commercial, cultural, economic, industrial, military, religious or social history of the place where it is situated or of the country and also includes all monuments in existence before 1700 A.D. Section 5 of the Bill lays down that the commissioners shall cause to be established and maintained a Register of Historic Monuments. This register will contain the name, location and a brief description of all historic monuments and archaeological areas which are known to the commissioners at the time when the Act comes into force or which became known to them afterwards.</P>
    <P>The monuments and archaeological areas entered in the register will enjoy a considerable degree of protection since the owner will not be permitted to carry out any work affecting the monument or the archaeological content of the area without giving two months prior notice to the commissioners. However, since a full archaeological survey of the country is still only in the early stages of being carried out it is inevitable that many important monuments and sites will not be included in the register. I believe that there are steps which can be taken which will ensure that omissions will be reduced to a minimum.</P>
    <P>In many parts of the country there are very active historical and archaeological societies whose members would be only too delighted to assist the commissioners in ensuring that the register would be as <Col N="963" /> accurate and as complete as possible in relation to their areas of operation. The commissioners should seek the assistance of such groups through public advertisements, requesting submissions from them in relation to the compilation of the register. I would like to pay a tribute to the various archaeological and historical societies around the country who are doing such excellent work, first of all, in creating an awareness of our many historic monuments and sites and also for playing such an important part in the preservation of the sites.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities also over the years have taken an active interest in identifying, surveying and preserving various relics of the past in their areas. I am pleased to say that the local authority of which I have the honour to be chairman, namely, Roscommon County Council, have been in the forefront in this regard. Several years ago Roscommon County Council carried out an archaeological survey of the county. The records of that survey, which involved the inspection of over 2,200 sites, are available in the County Library headquarters in Roscommon town. I am sure that other local authorities also have carried out similar surveys. I feel that the results of such surveys would be of great assistance to the commissioners in ensuring that the proposed register is as complete as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the reconstitution of the former National Monuments Advisory Council under the new title of the Historic Monuments Council. It would appear that the functions of the council will be mainly advisory although the wording contained in the subsection is that &ldquo;it shall be the function of the council to advise and assist the commissioners&rdquo;. Perhaps the Minister will tell the House if or how it is envisaged the council might assist the commissioners other than with advice.</P>
    <P>I hope that the advice given by the council will always be treated very seriously and acted upon by the commissioners. I would like to see a situation where the council would be the policy <Col N="964" /> makers and the commissioners would be obliged to implement the policies determined by the council. However, as the section is drafted it would appear that the commissioners could ignore the advice of the council in relation to any matter. The Minister should consider strengthening this section of the Bill so that the advice of the council, certainly where that advice was unanimous, would have to be acted upon by the commissioners.</P>
    <P>This Bill envisages that the council will consist of 18 members nominated by various individuals and bodies and appointed by the Minister and that the Minister will also appoint one of the members as chairman. The representation set out in the Bill should be extended to include the three other representatives. This would increase the membership of the council to 21 but I do not think that to increase the number to 21 would make it too unwieldy. I believe the additional representation which I have in mind would be beneficial to the council, first, in their public image and, secondly, in carrying out their role and functions.</P>
    <P>In view of the involvement of the Minister for Education with the National Museum and because of the educational dimension which attaches to the protection and preservation of every part of our cultural heritage, I believe that a representative of the Minister for Education, nominated by the Minister, should be a member of the council. Because of the involvement of local authorities in the ownership and guardianship of historic monuments, because of the provision in the Bill that a local authority may establish an historic monuments advisory committee and also because of the fact that heretofore the majority of local authorities did have national monuments advisory committees, there should be local authority representation on the proposed council. The appropriate body to nominate such a representative would be the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    <P>The local authorities will have an increasingly important role to play in relation to our historic monuments in the years ahead. Much needs to be done in <Col N="965" /> the areas of providing proper public access to the various monuments and sites, proper signposting and also information plaques describing the archaeological significance of the site or monument in question. For all these reasons I appeal to the Minister to give favourable consideration to the inclusion of a nominee of the General Council of County Councils in the membership of the Historic Monuments Council.</P>
    <P>My third suggested representative is a representative of the agricultural community. The vast majority of the historic monuments and sites throughout the country are situated on private property or the means of access to them are through private property. The goodwill of the farmers and landowners in question is vital and their co-operation is essential to the long-term success of any scheme for the development, preservation and protection of our archaeological heritage. That is why I believe their interests should be represented on the council. The most appropriate body to nominate such a representative is the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The General Council of Committees of Agriculture is the most authentic voice of Irish agriculture in the country at present. Its membership is drawn from the committees of agriculture throughout the country. The committees consist of elected representatives of the farming community, together with representatives of all the various rural and farming organisations. The General Council of Committees of Agriculture would be the ideal body to nominate a representative of farming interests for membership of the Historic Monuments Committee. I hope the Minister will be prepared to give favourable consideration to extending the membership of the council to include the three interests I have mentioned. Their inclusion would strengthen and benefit the council and would ensure the widest possible support for their aims and endeavours.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into detail as far as the other provisions of the Bill are <Col N="966" /> concerned. In so far as they will assist in achieving the objectives of the Bill, I welcome them. I look forward with my colleagues to giving every section of the Bill the type of detailed scrutiny it deserves when it reaches Committee Stage. I hope we will introduce amendments which will improve the Bill. I have given some indication of the main areas in which I believe the Bill could be improved. Perhaps the Minister will consider bringing forward amendments which will embrace some of the suggestions I have made.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by reiterating the general welcome I have given to the Bill. I come from a county which has a great wealth of historic sites and monuments dating from every age and ranging from the ring forts and megalithic tombs of the royal site of Connaught at Rathcroghan to the magnificent ruins of the Cistercian Abbey in Boyle, founded by Abbot Morris O'Duffy in 1161. We have crannogs and cairns, ruined castles and churches. From more recent times we have the burial places at Kilronan of Turlough O'Carolan, the last of the great harpers, and the burial place of Douglas Hyde, the first President of Ireland, at Rathra, near Frenchpark. These memorials of the past stand like so many milestones marking the advance of civilisation and the progress of history from the earliest times to the present day. It is our duty in this generation to take whatever steps are necessary for their protection and preservation. I welcome this Bill which is a significant step in that direction.</P>

      <P>It is usual when speaking to a Bill to say whether one welcomes it or that one is disappointed with it. I find myself in both moods in regard to this particular Bill. The actual items that are included in the Bill are indeed welcome, but I find at this stage the scope of the Bill, as introduced, indeed a disappointment. It has long been clear, not only to professional archaeologists but also to practising politicians, that our code based on the 1930 Act, as amended by the 1954 Act, is no longer <Col N="967" /> capable of dealing with the situation. It is the normal task of professional archaeologists to document the remote past and to record the wars and the social life of those remote ages. For the past 20 years our archaeologists have had to take time off in order to document the present and to document the growing danger to our heritage and the growing crisis in this regard.</P>
      <P>The statements that have been made and the reports that have been prepared have not been ignored by politicians. The Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, interested himself in 1978 in the preparation of a Private Members' Bill. In 1980 a Private Members' Bill was introduced into Dáil Éireann, sponsored by Deputy John Donnellan, in order to deal with the really urgent problems. If we look at that Private Members' Bill of 1980 &mdash; I took the trouble to take it out of the Library in order to do so &mdash; what do we find in it? We find section 3 dealing with the question of sea wrecks, section 8 dealing with the use of electronic devices and section 7 dealing with the problem of finding. We had already in the Private Members' Bill, which was the National Heritage Bill, 1980, the key problems. The things that satisfy me and satisfy Senator Mullooly were already there in that Bill of 1980. Unfortunately that Bill was opposed by the Government of the day on the grounds that comprehensive legislation was needed and in October 1980 it was defeated on Second Stage on a vote in Dáil Éireann. Here we are now, over six years later, and where is the comprehensive legislation that required the defeat of that Private Members' Bill rather than its acceptance and adoption as a Government measure for further pilotage through the two Houses of the Oireachtas? We do not have it. It would be unfair to say we have no more in the present Bill than was in the National Heritage Bill, 1980, but we do not have a great deal more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next attempt was made in 1982. Fianna Fáil were in office and the National Heritage Bill, 1982, was introduced into Seanad Éireann. This did <Col N="968" /> allow the Bill to be thoroughly debated. The Bill was introduced in June 1982 and the Second Stage was debated on 30 June, 1 July, 14 July and 15 July. I must, as Leader of the House, apologise to the Minister of State that the Seanad was not able to react as quickly to the introduction of the present Bill into the Seanad. That Bill was supported on all sides of the House, as I am sure the present Bill will be, and a great deal of useful Committee Stage work was done up to 3 November 1982 when, one can read at column 489 of the Official Report of that date that Committee Stage was adjourned until the following week. The following week there was a dissolution of Dáil Éireann and another Bill, another attempt to deal with this problem had fallen. I might say it was a more comprehensive attempt. At least it endeavoured to justify the defeat of the earlier Bill by attempting to be more comprehensive, bringing national monuments and national parks all under the one umbrella. Now we have this Bill introduced last May and we have only now got around to debating Second Stage. I hope there will not be any undue delay. I hope there will not be any untimely dissolutions that will interfere with its passage through the House on this occasion.</P>
    <P>When we look at the present Bill, what have we in it? We have, essentially, an exercise in crisis management. We have here the dealing with the two great problems of sea wrecks and electronic detection which created a crisis of greatest magnitude in regard to our national monuments and our heritage generally. It is good and I welcome the fact that we have these provisions but I must lament that we do not have more. One cannot be unduly critical of the Minister of State who is with us this evening because she has not been in charge of this particular Department for very long. I hope she will concentrate her energies on the question of following up this Bill which meets the immediate crisis by starting immediately on the comprehensive problems.</P>
    <P>We are in grave danger here of coming <Col N="969" /> up against what has been called the principle of unripe time. The time never seems to be ripe for the comprehensive attack on a problem. It may be that this legal difficulty exists, that another legal difficulty is there that money would not be available. All of these things have got to be tackled and I believe they can be tackled in a realistic way. We have got to face up to the problem that a national heritage is a national heritage.</P>
    <P>Too many times in regard to matters like this, and other matters of legislation, we have had people reading far more into the private property rights of our Constitution than exists there. An overstrict reading of the Constitution, not by lawyers but by politicians and by their advisers, has prevented many a good Bill from coming to the floor of this House and to the floor of Dáil Éireann. In this instance, even after this Bill has been passed, to deal with the major critical areas we still have &mdash; the Minister of State recognised this in her speech &mdash; the continuing problem of our heritage being lost, our heritage being damaged and, as time goes on, the losses becoming greater and greater.</P>
    <P>We should look not just at what is in this Bill; on the Second Stage of this particular Bill we should look at the problem as a whole. I suggest to the Minister we can all appreciate that for economic reasons the time is not ripe to undertake a massive effort, but that is no reason why the machinery should not be put into place so that such an effort can be made without delay when funds become available. I do not think this Bill puts the general machinery into place. That is part of my disappointment with it.</P>
    <P>What is the nature of the problems we face? I will base a fair amount of what I say on the material contained in the presidential address of Professor Frank Mitchell to the Royal Irish Academy in October 1978 &mdash; the title of his presidential address was Planning for Irish Archaeology in the Eighties &mdash; and propose what can be done under this Bill as we draw towards the close of the eighties against what Professor Frank Mitchell said on that occasion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> I will use the structure he used in order to discuss this problem. This is a suitable yardstick against which to judge the Bill for a number of reasons. One is the content of that presidential address because it was forward-looking and it was practicable, also because of who the author was, a man who is not just an expert in one subject but an expert in many subjects, possibly to a greater extent than any of our scholars and, at the same time, gifted with a great deal of common sense.</P>
    <P>I also think it suitable in dealing with the question of our national heritage and the question of archaeology to treat it against this most recent statement made within the ambit of the Royal Irish Academy because since its foundation the Royal Irish Academy has been concerned with our heritage. But for the efforts of the Royal Irish Academy, the loss of our heritage would have been greater by several orders of magnitude.</P>
    <P>I would like as a member of that Academy, elected as a member for science and not as a member on the other side of Academy House which goes by the name of Polite Letters and Antiquities, to remind the House of what the Royal Irish Academy did since its foundation 200 years ago. It is probably no accident that the Royal Irish Academy was founded by the Earl of Charlemont who was also the founder of the Irish Volunteers, a man who saw a connection between the preservation of the physical heritage, between the promotion of knowledge and between the question of establishing political independence.</P>
    <P>Right from the very beginning 200 years ago, the Royal Irish Academy established an antiquites committee and gathered a large amount of material which might otherwise have been lost. About the year 1840 it commenced controlled excavations for the first time in this country. Indeed it is on record that in 1847, when a very eminent committee of the Academy commenced the excavation of Dowth, in fact, this was done with tools borrowed from the Office of Public Works. This is possible the first connection between the Office of Public <Col N="971" /> Works and controlled scientific archaeological excavation. It was probably due to influence because Colonel Harry Jones, who was a very eminent military engineer and administrator was both a member of the Academy's antiquities committee and also chairman of the Office of Public Works. He is a man who even before that date had shown a great sense of preservation. I would like to put these achievements of the Academy on the record.</P>
    <P>I would like also to put on record here the achievements of the members of my own profession of engineering throughout the 19th century who, in the middle of their expansive engineering works, paid a regard to archaeological remains which has been matched in recent years but not matched in some of the intervening years. Harry Jones himself worked first on the Shannon commission, the first establishment of the Shannon navigation, and he diverted the workmen on that scheme to the preservation of monuments in the neighbourhood of the works, including the first clearing of the great national monument of Clonmacnoise and the examination of the safety of the foundation of the monuments here.</P>
    <P>It was the Royal Irish Academy who saved many of our treasures, some of them indeed from the melting pot, others from sale abroad. It was the Royal Irish Academy who in 1839 purchased the Cross of Cong. Here we find among that group a public spirit a regard for our heritage that we take for granted. We of this generation are, perhaps luckier than we deserve with these enlightened gentlemen, because the ladies did not participate in those days, of the Royal Irish Academy of the Royal Dublin Society who showed the degree of enlightenment which they did.</P>
    <P>In fact, in 1888, when the National Museum was founded, there was already there the makings of a national museum. I would also like to pay tribute to the 19th century engineers, many of whom were officers of the Royal Engineers of the British Army, for their work starting <Col N="972" /> with those who supervised the ordnance survey. If we look at the work of the ordnance survey it was the first ordnance survey in the world. It was, in fact, used as a trial for the British ordnance survey so the standards that were established in the 1820s in Ireland became the model.</P>
    <P>One thing which is remarkable about the ordnance survey is not only the way in which national monuments were marked on the ordnance survey maps of the periods but the great detail in which they were described in their notebooks, which still exist in manuscript. If we look back over what happened in the last century we can see that we have indeed been lucky that those generations met the problem of their day with the diligence with which they did.</P>
    <P>What then is the problem as it faces us today? I said I was going to structure what I had to say on the basis of what Frank Mitchell said in his presidential address talking about planning for Irish archaeology in the eighties. He identified seven elements and I propose to deal with them in turn. These seven elements can be summarised as:</P>
    <P>(1) record;</P>
    <P>(2) protect;</P>
    <P>(3) excavate;</P>
    <P>(4) examine;</P>
    <P>(5) conserve;</P>
    <P>(6) document; and</P>
    <P>(7) the publication.</P>
    <P>How well are we doing at the moment? How well will we be able to do after the enactment of this Bill under those seven headings?</P>
    <P>Let us take the first of them. It is the first essential step that must be taken in regard to the preservation of an archaeological heritage and that is to record. I have already said that we have an excellent headline here from the office of engineers of the ordnance survey in the 1820s, over 150 years ago, men of the calibre of Thomas Larcom who went on to make a most distinguished career in the Irish Civil Service and particularly in the Office of Public Works and left most valuable archives to the National Library <Col N="973" /> that tell us so much of the history of public works in the 19th century.</P>
    <P>How far have we improved on what these busy sappers did in the first ordnance survey? We established a register in the 1954 Act. This was essential in order to record, but this was not enough and it was quite clear that this was not enough. The Minister said she hoped that more attention would be paid to the advice of the new national advisory committee than was given to the advice of the past. My understanding is that it took a tremendous effort on the part of the National Monuments Advisory Committee, set up under the 1954 Act, in order to get the proper recording under way and to get a survey unit established in the Office of Public Works, as was done in 1960.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said &mdash; indeed we welcome it &mdash; that she was happy to announce that there already had been a publication of a number of records which were the result of this work and she said that the procedure had become more rapid. So it has but I am afraid it is also true that it has become more superficial. What is really required is an archaeological survey. I believe I am right in saying that, of those published only one, or possibly none, is a full archaeological survey. If a full archaeological survey cannot be established it is scaled down to be an inventory and if you have not enough staff to make up an inventory it then becomes a record of sites and monuments.</P>
    <P>I accept that the exigencies of the constraints on the survey unit must be such that there is a choice between doing thorough survey work in certain areas or trying to do the more superficial work over a wider area. That choice must have been a difficult one but we must realise that it was a choice. We should realise that, in fact, in what was done we were falling short of what constitutes adequate recording of an archaeological heritage. Can the Minister tell me if there is a plan that goes beyond what is being done now? Let us accept the financial restrictions of what is being done now, but let us have a plan. Otherwise we will find that we <Col N="974" /> will, perhaps, cover the country with a record of sites and monuments by the end of the eighties that will go very little beyond the work at Colby, Larcom and of those who directed the first ordnance survey over 150 years ago.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that next year so much more should be done. I recognise the reality of the situation, but I think there must be a recognition that what is being done is well short of what most people who have examined the subject would wish to do, and also what I am sure the Minister of State would like to do.</P>
    <P>We need full surveys, inventories and records of sites and monuments, but what we do not need is a self deception which would lead us to believe that a site and monument record is a substitute for an archaeological survey or even a substitute for an inventory. I suggest to the Minister that there is a duty on her and on her office to draw up a major plan for the adequate carrying out as soon as possible of this first function of recording.</P>
    <P>The second of the seven activities I have listed is that of protection. In this regard we must welcome what is in the Bill. In dealing with the question of the protection of what is there, we must be concerned with protection of monuments that are above the ground, the protection of monuments that are below the ground, and the protection of monuments that are below the water. I think it is one of the more welcome aspects of this Bill that it extends greatly the protection of monuments below the water and also through section 6 extends greatly the protection of monuments below the ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the handling by the Coalition Government of the economy, which has led to unprecedented borrowing, a record current deficit, and a crisis in confidence, and calls for urgent action to halt the drift into economic abyss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> I am moving this motion this evening because I think everybody inside and outside this House cannot but be acutely aware of the crisis which besets our country at this time. Therefore, it is necessary to put on the record what these problems are and seek to make some proposals to deal with them urgently.</P>
    <P>The Government seek to distort recent economic history, and there seems to be no limit to the blatant way they misrepresent what has happened. They continually try to blame others for their failures. It is necessary for us to keep putting the truth before the people. This Government, who pride themselves on honesty and integrity, have been in power for nine and a half years out of the past 14 years. Coalition Governments are responsible for two-thirds of the national debt which is currently running at over £22 billion. They are responsible for two-thirds of the present level of foreign borrowing. They continue to make fradulent claims about controlling Government expenditure, even though it is absolutely, abundantly clear that the finances of this country have gone out of control. Under the present Government, unemployment has climbed to record levels, now nearing 240,000, while at the same time we have again the spectacle of emigration. We do not have exact figures but it is estimated that close on 80,000 people have emigrated in the past few years.</P>
    <P>The 1973 Coalition Government started the practice of running current budget deficits and using foreign borrowing to pay for them.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister is comfortable in his chair and that I will be allowed to continue. I will allow him the same facility when he replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The highest ever ratio of borrowing by any Government in the history of the State was in 1975 by the then Coalition Government. It ran to 16 per cent of gross national product at that time. The largest ever annual increase in current expenditure took place under a Coalition <Col N="976" /> Government in 1975 when it rose by 42 per cent and public service pay by 50 per cent. Everybody can recall the solemn promises made by the Coalition candidates in the last general election. They promised to eliminate the current budget in four years. Later this was changed in the infamous document, <i>Building on Reality</i>, now Unreality, to change it to 5 per cent. The current deficit will reach record proportions this year. It could be as high as £1,500 million or between 8.5 per cent or 9 per cent of gross national product. Having created the deepest crisis in public finances in the history of the State, this Government in the words of their Leader, the Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald said this Government will not be seeking re-election. That must be the first occasion in the history of this State that an outgoing Taoiseach told his audience that his Government would not be seeking re-election. That is not an indictment by me, by the media or by any other political commentators; it is the view of the Taoiseach of the Government he has led for the past four years. In order to be exonerated of all of these difficulties, the two parties in Government will go their different ways.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at some of the targets set in <i>Building on Reality.</i> The unemployment target was 210,000; the actual figure is near 240,000. Manufacturing output was to be up by 36 per cent; it is up by one-third of that target. Manufacturing employment was estimated to rise by 13,000. It is just over half that figure, nearing 7,000. Agricultural output was to be raised by 10 per cent; that is down by 5 per cent. Agricultural employment was to be down by 9,000, but that figure is 12,000. Construction output was estimated to be up by 1.5 per cent, and we have a catastrophic fall to 12 per cent. Construction employment was to be up by 1,000, it is down by 7,000.</P>
    <P>I am not too enamoured by the notion of digging up these kinds of historical facts, but we have been presented over the years with an extraordinary effort to discredit Fianna Fáil in the context of the history of how this country has been run in recent times. It is no harm to recall that <Col N="977" /> every housewife was expecting a direct payment of £9.60. This was not a Fianna Fáil promise. The standard rate of income tax was promised to be reduced to 25 per cent, but over a four year period this Government have extracted the highest ever increase in personal taxation from the community, and in particular from the PAYE sector. They have reduced tax free allowances and hit hardest at large families.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have said that coalition as a form of Government is totally discredited. What the country needs is an extended period of secure and stable Government, agreeing on their economic and social philosophy and able to implement sound developmental policies over a period of time. Instead this Government hang on to office bargaining from day to day &mdash; and this afternoon perhaps from hour to hour &mdash; with disgruntled backbenchers who are unable to stand the heat of antagonism from the public outside. This continuing uncertainty is leading to a major crisis of confidence in the financial market. Millions of pounds are leaving the country and hard pressed borrowers already in severe trouble are doomed to further increases in lending rates.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael and Labour cobbled together a programme for Government and later changed it to <i>Building on Reality</i> which, in the words of one of their own Deputies, is now like a juggernaut careering down a hill out of control. What worries me in the context of our present economic difficulties is the accepted style with which this Government now plan to run the next general election. The signs are already there that we could be facing one of the most vicious campaigns this country has ever experienced. In the context of a huge problem of unemployment, high taxation and lack of incentive, with so many young people emigrating, this sterile type of politics cannot and should not have any place in our country.</P>
    <P>We have the agricultural industry practically on their knees and we do not need any further degeneration of politics into personality or mud-slinging episodes. We are at a crossroads. Problems require to <Col N="978" /> be faced and we will run democracy to its last legs if we consider that the only way we can win, hold office, stay in office, or gain office, is to operate politics on that basis. We require a newer, fairer and more open approach to the people if we hope to gain their confidence and, more particularly, to prepare the road for national recovery.</P>
    <P>Everybody has to accept that the public finances must be controlled and we will have to look closer at how that can be achieved. We have allowed the Civil Service to grow too big. We have also allowed this city, in the context of its pivotal position in the country, to develop too fast compared to other regions. By any standards, looking at our population structure, Dublin has huge problems and some of them have been caused by not having a proper decentralisation policy. I am not talking just about transferring offices; I am talking about transferring the decision-making processes into the regions so that we will not have the duplication and triplication of effort that abound in our system of Government which hampers management, middle management and saps initiative.</P>
    <P>In a report prepared by the Regional Development Organisation on eastern region settlement strategy to the year 2001, it is said that air pollution, crime, vandalism and traffic growth have contributed to a general downgrading in the quality of life in the eastern region. In the other House this evening they are discussing a Bill setting up a commission to deal with many of the problems that affect Dublin city. Congestion is widespread and is affecting the economic and social performance of the region.</P>
    <P>The most minute decisions to be taken by local authorities have to be considered in the Department of the Environment before permission is given to go ahead. At present the Government have power to allocate funds to local authorities in the different regions but we should have a system where each local authority will have the power to work within those confines and make their own decisions to suit their localities. The present policy has led <Col N="979" /> to considerable waste through duplication at central Government level. There is pettiness, bureaucracy and sluggishness in the way many of the schemes are carried out. In the normal way many of these schemes could be decided at local level but they have to be reinvestigated by staff who have never had to face the problem. Yet they are the people who decide which scheme is the most suitable. Unless steps are taken to loosen and reverse this cramped system, the trend may be irreversible in the future. The Government have power to take decisions of this nature, but politicians seem to be extremely reluctant to transfer those powers. Because of problems that face this country and the necessity to devise new strategies and policies to deal with the impact of changing régimes as far as agriculture and other industries are concerned emanating from the EC, we simply do not have the time as national politicians to be involved in the day to day decisions which have to be made. It seems Ministers still want to cling to these decisions, but I believe they should be taken in the regions by the county managers, the local representatives and individuals in middle management throughout our Civil Service system. I do not want to be interpreted here as being critical of the Civil Service. Over a long period I have worked with individuals whose commitment to this country could not be questioned, but they would be the first to admit that for far too long the system has been cramped and needs to be opened dramatically.</P>
    <P>In a variety of other areas we have to be much more sensible about how we discharge our public duties. Recently in a local authority adjoining my own I had the experience of a simple legal matter involving a court session for a couple of days. The local authority were liable to pay as much as £4,000 for a senior counsel when there may have been only one or two questions asked. The English system has changed. They do not require two senior counsel, two junior counsel and expensive legal procedures which are developed in a way which make it almost <Col N="980" /> impossible for the average member of the public to come to grips with them. Yet we carry on this kind of expensive system. We load new costs onto local authorities and other regions. We literally cannot afford this.</P>
    <P>We need to look at how our banking system is working. When has anybody met a bank manager who told him the reason somebody was in difficulty was a bad decision by the bank in the first place, our rates of interest which are reaching extortion proportions? Banks never make bad decisions. It is the individuals who are wrong all the time. Money was borrowed at 10 per cent but within a few years the rate went as high as 20 per cent and individuals in business enterprises and agriculture could not cope with that. It is time we had a fresh look at this and cut out some of the luxury developments that have taken place in the banking system which have to be paid for by an unfortunate public who are no longer able to cope with the ever-increasing demands on their resources. We must look at the cost structure in the banks and see that the interest margins are not excessive.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural area, the debate amongst farmers, farmer interests and co-operatives in the next few months must focus on the need to evolve policies that will do the least damage to agriculture. Every effort will have to be made by the Minister and his officials to secure recognition of the importance of the dairy industry to the economy. This summer the EC, in considering ways of dealing with the problems of the dairy sector and the build-up of stocks, brought forward a number of proposals which are clearly unacceptable to us &mdash; increasing the rate of the super-levy, the removal of the right to transfer the unused quota from deficit co-operatives to surplus co-operatives and the suspension of intervention for butter and skim milk powder from time to time. The suspension of intervention, even for a limited period, would remove the guaranteed price for dairy products and the effect on producer prices would be devastating. The effect of these proposals on market prices for butter and <Col N="981" /> skim milk powder will be very serious because there will be a disruption of the sales pattern even in advance of the introduction of such measures. No doubt the task that lies ahead will be difficult. Can a Government, who look over their shoulder from day to day to survive, take on the task of negotiating on behalf of agriculture in the context of these crucial, serious and impending proposals which will have, as I have stated, a devastating effect on the cornerstone of our economy?</P>
    <P>One of the greatest drawbacks to an increase in European food sales is the absence of distribution facilities. We must try to gain greater access to the major retail outlets in mainland Europe. To this end, greater co-operation between the co-operative societies is necessary together with an inward transfer of technology and new joint ventures providing a high level of speed and flexibility in getting our product to the marketplace at the least cost. Our domestic market is too small and, therefore, we cannot afford to ignore the opportunities for profitable investment in the EC, US and other markets.</P>
    <P>Our interest rates are four times the level of our inflation. We have low personal incentive due to high levels of taxation. We have severe geographical penalties due to distance from our main markets and high freight rates to these destinations. We have an absence of business confidence due largely to the lack of leadership and dynamism by the Government. If we believe in a strong food industry based on native raw materials, we must begin to solve and remove some of those constraints. There is no point in talking about huge imports of food unless we are prepared to make the changes which will make it possible for us to be competitive on the domestic market and, at the same time, penetrate the European and world markets.</P>
    <P>We also have to watch the changing trends that are taking place. Many consumers in developing countries are demanding more and more fresh food. They see unprocessed foods as farm fresh and associate them with high quality <Col N="982" /> nutritive value and the absence of chemicals residues and additives. We have to be conscious of meeting these demands if we are to create the kind of job opportunities that we will require for the future.</P>
    <P>We have also to look to greater promotion of forest investment and management, developing forest nurseries for the production of forest and ornamental tree species, exploiting the potential for sport and recreation, organising co-operatives for the provision of machinery, labour and contracting for timber harvesting and marketing. We have to have proper tax incentives to encourage private owners to invest in a commodity which is likely to have demand exceeding supply for many years into the future, and well into the next century. In the present climate of quotas and general uncertainty surrounding conventional enterprises, forests could be grown in some of the worst land in the west. We could produce three and four times more per cubic metre per hectare than competing countries. Planting small acres of individual farms with high unit cost is not viable and we must look to co-operatives to enable and encourage investment in this area.</P>
    <P>The lack of start-up capital is seen as one of the greatest obstacles to co-operative development. Many new co-operative ventures are started by workers who have become redundant, or by people with very little property and no financial standing or experience with the lending institutions. We need special programmes of tax incentives and State loan guarantees if new co-operative enterprises are to be set up. Many of the people involved, as I have stated, are people who became redundant and who would otherwise be in receipt of social welfare benfit. We pay £9 million or £10 million per day by way of social welfare payments. We must be more positive and try to create opportunities where people will not become dependent on a taxpaying community, the middle band, who are no longer in a position to continue to carry the load.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to deal with other <Col N="983" /> matters, but I would like to ask the Minister about the extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme. Have the Government decided to designate the areas which are now less severely handicapped as severely handicapped? Has a decision been taken in relation to the doubling of the headage payments?</P>
    <P>We need to take the bureaucracy out of the farm modernisation scheme particularly as it affects small farmers. As regards the ACOT services, we charge farmers who are getting a grant of £5,000, £6,000 or £7,000 the same as an individual who would qualify for a few hundred pounds under the farm modernisation scheme. We need to make those changes in the tourism area which has potential for this country. We need to come forward with proposals which will create more opportunities, enhance our country and at the same time provide much needed capital in the west and elsewhere where there are few other alternatives and where industrial development is at a very low ebb.</P>
    <P>We need to speak with our social partners. We need agreement with the trade unions. We need far less confrontation between unions and management, far less demarcation, and fewer individuals who decide to create situations where it is impossible for businesses to develop. There are many industrialists looking at this country who would be far more ready to commit themselves to it if we could rid ourselves of those developments which have militated against us in the past.</P>
    <P>We need to get rid of some of the taxes introduced by this Government which have created very considerable problems. I do not wish to go into detail on this matter because I do not have the time but it is clear to everybody that the introduction of the DIRT tax was a grave mistake. Any income that has come to Ireland as a result of the introduction of this tax has been more negatived by the outflow of money.</P>

      <P>I regard myself as a relatively young politician but I have been knocking around for a little while. I know there is a philosophy of despair in this country. I want to believe in the country as much as anybody else. We have the educational facilities, we can make the technological advances which are possible but we need to combine our resources to make the strides necessary at this time. I do not believe that the strategies which this Government have adopted during recent years have been suitable or have helped in this way. They have not, in their style of management, created that kind of hope and possibility for our people. For that reason I am glad to move this motion. If it does not have the effect of changing the mind of the Government in relation to the strategies, I hope it will signal to them that a great majority of the people want to see positive steps taken by the Government who went to see changes put in train and to see an end to the dismal policies which have been pursued in recent years.</P>

    <P>The first subject on the programme was unemployment, the target for which was <Col N="985" /> 210,000. However, the sad fact is that it now stands at 235,000. That does not take into account the 80,000 to 100,000 people who have emigrated. The exact figure is not known to us. My constituency of Galway West is devastated by this horrendous new emigration to various parts of the world. That is the first damning fact that this Government have to take on board.</P>
    <P>The second target in that programme concerned manufacturing output. It was going to be up 36 per cent but in the first nine or ten months it is actually down 12 per cent. That is a very serious situation and one which has turned this Government upside down. The third target related to manufacturing employment. We had been given a guarantee that employment would be up by 13,000 but the correct figure is 7,000 people. There again is a prejudgment which has gone wrong. In agricultural output the target was 10 per cent but it is down 7 per cent. The agricultural employment target was not met and it is now down by 12,000. Construction output was going to be up 1.5 per cent but instead it is down 12 per cent. The construction employment target was 1,000 but in fact it is down by 7,000. I could go on and on. The programme, <i>Building on Reality</i>, was introduced two years before the election was to take place, as they said at that time.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few points about agriculture. The milk yield is down 7 per cent this year, costing us £55 million. A horrific fact has emerged today. We are 2 per cent under the quota allocation. What a disgraceful performance. It is horrifying to think that a nation of farmers &mdash; agriculture is our primary industry &mdash; are now producing 2 per cent less than our national milk quota. Following all the advice this Government got as well as that obtained by the Minister for Agriculture, here we are nine or ten months later being told that our national yield is 2 per cent less than what it should be. What fools we must seem in the eyes of the world.</P>
    <P>In cattle disposal we are down 10 per <Col N="986" /> cent, costing us £80 million. In pig disposal we are down 3 per cent plus a price decrease of 10 per cent which is costing the farming community £30 million. In grain acreage we are down 8 per cent with a yield of minus 10 per cent, costing us a further £30 million. At the same time the imported component in our feed sales are up 20 per cent, costing us a further £67 million. That is the state this country is in and it is the state of our majority industry, agriculture. The farming community are £150 million less well off in one year and in two years the agricultural community have lost £400 million. That is the state this country has been brought to by the Government. It is no wonder that there is depression in the streets, in the marts and in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister and probably the Minister for Agriculture will say it was the bad weather. The bad weather was responsible for a certain portion of it, but not for everything. Certainly the bad weather cannot be blamed for the disgraceful situation in the milk yield where we have 2 per cent less than our quota. Today the greatest problem facing every farmer, big, small or middle sized, mixed or specialised is a cash shortage. It is easy to say we have got inflation down to 1 per cent or zero per cent. That sounds lovely and is statistically fine. Of course it helps the nation. The tragedy is that on the other hand interest rates are at such an appalling level due to the cash shortage in this State, and due to the mentality of the people who do not want to invest under this Government that they have completely destroyed the aim of the Government to bring inflation down to a zero rate. The whole system of banking has to be taken on board and something has to be done about it.</P>
    <P>I will give another example of this Government's inability to grasp the situation. The Taoiseach ran a race around the country recently visiting various constituencies. I was judging the constituencies from a marginal point of view and looking at them with a Fine Gael eye. I would say he spoke about the achievements of the Government in each of those constituencies. He said he had <Col N="987" /> received, through the powerful negotiations of the Minister for Agriculture in Brussels, £100 million to deal with the bad debts of the farming community at 5.5 per cent standard interest rate. That was fine. May I ask the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for the finances of this country, what it did to solve the problems of the farming community from a financial point of view? Has this money been distributed in an equitable manner? Farmers in my constituency of Galway West queued at the banks and at the ACC offices in the hope of getting some of that £100 million. If you take it over two years it is actually £200 million. They were told that their debts were not bad enough in most cases.</P>
    <P>I wish to have a query answered by the Minister for Finance, who is a responsible Minister. Is it true that if you live on the east coast, or in the south of Ireland if your debts are bad enough and if your credibility with the bank manager is good enough you qualify for the scheme? Was the money apportioned in a balanced way between people living in the west, the north west or in the northern part of this island? That is a very fair question. The farming community of Galway West will not agree that they got anything like a fair proportion of what was given to others in different areas.</P>
    <P>If that is so it is a disgrace that this Government are not able to distribute the national cake in an equitable fashion to those who need it. Some people still believe they may yet be able to line up for this money. In any event, the amount of money received was ludicrously small. Therefore compensation was not given, or if it was given it was not given to my constituency of Galway West. That is a matter the Minister should take on board. The Government have let down the people of the west. That is another day's story. One could write a history about it. I will not go into it at present.</P>
    <P>There are a few other cases against the Government which should be brought to their attention. Let me refer to the potato crop. Under the 1975 Coalition Government <Col N="988" /> of which the Minister for Finance, Deputy J. Bruton was then a Minister of State, potatoes were fetching £170 per tonne. Today the price of potatoes is £110 per tonne. Taking the devaluation of the pound and everything else into account, is that fair? Do the Government care about a crop which is fundamental to the Irish people and has a historical background; a crop which has been a source of finance in the west down through the years. However, bad as the price may be, we now have inspectors telling the farming community in the west that they must register their tonnage themselves and print on the bag the grade of the potatoes; otherwise they will be liable to a penalty of £1,000. I do not disagree with grading. I do not disagree with achieving quality, but it is not achieved by putting posters in public places such as: &ldquo;Government warning; watch out or you are dead&rdquo;. That is what is being done. In the wild west long ago if a man was wanted, a reward was given. That is typical of what is happening in the Department of Agriculture today. Yet last year the multinationals could offer for sale &mdash; this is public knowledge and this Government are responsible for it &mdash; Cara potatoes as Record potatoes. The significance of that is that Cara potatoes can be grown at approximately 24 tonnes to the acre whereas a Record potato can be grown at an average of 12 tonnes of saleable potatoes per acre. I am talking about an inferior potato being sold as a superior potato by the multinationals. When the inspectors were asked to check this we were told only circumstantial evidence was available to them. If they can harass the small farmers of my constituency of Galway West surely they can harass the multinationals as well.</P>
    <P>Lambs fetched 55p per lb. last year; this year they are fetching 38p per lb. The Department of Agriculture told us last year that we should produce lambs at 80 lbs. weight. However, when we did that they did not increase the price to the level we were advised to produce them at. The price of an 80 lb. lamb today is £30. Is that the way to treat the farming community?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> I will not refer to the beef situation. The devaluation of the Green Pound was a national scandal; it was to be devalued by 9 per cent, then 8 per cent and finally we were told publicly it was 6 per cent and would go directly to the farmer. On the day the Taoiseach told the farmers he was giving them a 6 per cent devaluation, the price of beef in any of the meat factories was 100p per lb. The price of beef today is still 100p per lb. Who hijacked the 6 per cent?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is responsible. The Taoiseach is responsible for guarding this State. Will the Minister tell us where all this hard earned money for the farming community has gone? They are robbed and crucified by the Minister's tactics. We heard at the Ard Fheis the Taoiseach criticised Deputy Mr. Charles Haughey who governed this State for two and a half years. In the past 16 years when Coalition Governments governed this State all we heard was hypocrisy and attacks on individuals but the Minister is not one who engages in this activity. The Taoiseach was a disgrace at the Ard Fheis in his attitude towards the people. Does he take the people to be fools? No, Sir. I assume they are not and they are awaiting to respond to the Government's attitude. The sooner they leave office the better for us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Government came to office we were borrowing large quantities of money for new services and projects. In the past four years spending has been brought under control to the extent that virtually all our new borrowing is now confined to what is needed to service existing debt. In 1981 Government borrowing for new spending &mdash; i.e. non-interest purposes &mdash; was at 8½ per cent of GNP. It is now down to 2 per cent and, in accordance with the Government's 1987 budgetary decisions announced last week, will be virtually eliminated next year.</P>
      <P>Preparations for the 1987 budget are well under way and the Government have already decided on the Exchequer borrowing requirement and current budget deficit within which the budget is being determined. The deficit for the year will not exceed 7.4 per cent of GNP and the overall borrowing figure will not be more than 11.8 per cent. The overall borrowing figure conforms to the guideline for the 1987 budget which is being recommended by the EC Commission in their recent annual report. The Commission also underlined the importance of taking account of the medium term dimension in framing budget policy for 1987 and this will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget strategy for 1987 will require a significant curtailment of public expenditure and tough decisions will have to be made to operate within the parameters the Cabinet has set. Priorities between different areas of expenditure will have to be set within a predefined overall budget. The Government have reiterated their view that higher taxation is not an acceptable alternative because of the consequent damage to the economy. I want to issue a challenge to the <Col N="991" /> Opposition parties, Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>The Government have made a decision as to the current budget deficit and Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1987. I want Opposition parties now to say what their proposals would be for the current budget deficit in 1987, and for the Exchequer borrowing requirement. That is a simple question. I am not asking them to go into detail about specific expenditure and taxation measures. I am simply asking them to say &ldquo;how much extra should we borrow as a nation next year?&rdquo;. Any party seriously seeking public support in this country should have no difficulty in answering that simple question. I hope we will hear an answer to the question from Opposition spokesmen in the Seanad today and tomorrow.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Government are on course virtually to eliminate borrowing other than for interest payments. It is worth comparing this with the approach of the main Opposition party who have initiated this debate in the Seanad today. Unlike Senators Smith and Killilea I do not have to, nor do I wish to, go back to 1972 when we had our first current deficit, nor to 1977. All I want to do is go back four or five months to April of this year. In that month Fianna Fáil at their Ard Fheis promised cumulative spending and tax reduction programmes amounting to £450 million. As no expenditure cuts were specified, one can only presume that this &mdash; on top of the borrowing that is already being criticised in this debate by the self same Opposition &mdash; extra £450 million would be financed by more borrowing. More recently we have had repetitions of these promises by the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Haughey. I have said before, and I repeat it now, these borrowing promises will push interest rates up even further. More Government borrowing means higher interest rates.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, as a political party, have tended in the past at least to have two great strengths. One of these strengths is their perceived appeal to nationalism in Ireland. People see Fianna Fáil as a party <Col N="992" /> that stand strongly for national interest as against the interests of the wider world of Britain or any other country. The other strength of Fianna Fáil is their perception of being a party of the working people. This is something that dates back to the thirties. The party were then seen as defending the interests of manual workers against those with money.</P>
    <P>I contend that the present policies of Fianna Fáil in regard to Government borrowing are directly contrary to these two basic strengths that underlie their own political philosophy. Present Fianna Fáil policy is against the interests and philosophies of their own supporters.</P>
    <P>Let me explain why I make this statement. The more this country borrows the more it loses its economic independence. A country that has borrowed heavily must depend on the perception of it by its foreign creditors. It cannot afford to say or do things that will frighten foreign bankers. Thus its economic and its political independence is in a significant sense diminished by foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>An indebted country must also pay large amounts of money in interest. If international interest rates rise or fall, an indebted country's fortunes fall or rise in a reverse direction to the movement of interest rates. Thus a country, by becoming heavily indebted, becomes less economically independent and more subject to international financial trends.</P>
    <P>A heavily indebted country has to send large amounts of its hard earned money straight out of the country to service debt. Ireland at the moment is sending out well over £700 million each year in interest on foreign debt. This is money that we should be using for job creation here in Ireland but we have to send it straight out of the country as dead money because of past borrowing and yet the Opposition party wants £450 million more borrowing on top of the borrowing already implemented. This is another way in which high Government borrowing is bad for national independence.</P>
    <P>Some Senators, Opposition spokesmen and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, talk about the fact that there <Col N="993" /> should not be an obsession with book-keeping, that there should be a developmental approach and there should be more imagination, all code words for saying, borrow a bit more, do not make the financial restrictions this year, put it off. Whenever people hear the Leader of the Opposition or other spokesmen for that party making that case about the need for creativity, developmentalism and avoiding an obsession with book-keeping, they should remember that lack of book-keeping compromised the national independence of this country, which is the very issue on which the Fianna Fáil Party, because of their interpretation of how that should be expressed, base their foundation as a separate political unit in this country. That is the true context within which this argument should be placed, a political one.</P>
    <P>In these three ways our present level of indebtedness is strangling our national economic independence. Yet Fianna Fáil seem quite happy to contemplate further increases in the level of debt if this will gain political support for them in the short term. This is contrary to the political philosophy and nationalism of their own supporters. It in something that Mr. de Valera, Mr. Lemass and Mr. MacEntee would never have supported.</P>
    <P>The high borrowing policies of Fianna Fáil are also directly contrary to the interests of working people who have been amongst their traditional supporters. High Government borrowing drives up interest rates. Who gains in this situation? Those who gain are those who already have money and can now invest it with high rates of return in risk-free Government bonds and accounts.</P>
    <P>Those who lose in a situation of high interest rates induced by high Government borrowing are working people &mdash; PAYE payers trying to pay a mortgage which has increased because of the pressure created by high Government borrowing, people trying to establish a business which is strangled at birth because of high interest rates created by high Government borrowing. High <Col N="994" /> Government borrowing makes the creation of jobs more expensive and makes money lying dormant in State secured bonds more remunerative.</P>
    <P>The big losers when an actual debt crisis occurs &mdash; that has not occurred in this country at this time &mdash; are always the poor, not the well-off whose cash is mobile. This is evident in the world today. We have seen instances of this in other countries &mdash; for example, Mexico &mdash; which are in dire financial difficulties. The rich have been able to move their money out while the poor have had to suffer the consequences of a declining economy. So let nobody defend high Government borrowing on the basis that it helps the poor. The ultimate sufferers from the continuation of the present high levels of Government borrowing will be none other than the poor and the least well-off people of this community. They are vulnerable; they depend on the solvency of the State. It is in no way capable of being claimed that anyone serves the interests of the less well-off community in this country by maintaining benefits that we cannot afford to pay at the cost of increasing the level of national borrowing. Ultimately those who suffer most from an unsustainable level of borrowing are the very people one is intending to help.</P>
    <P>No party which espouses the interests of less well off people could possibly therefore justify support for continued high Government borrowing. By their reckless and unfinanced promises, Fianna Fáil are turning their backs on the interests of some of their own traditional supporters, those who are least well-off in this community.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, in their recently published taxation and economic document, are proposing some cuts in spending but these are not to be used to curtail borrowing. They are to be used for reductions in personal taxation. While this is certainly attractive electorally, the country simply cannot afford it at the present time. These cuts in taxation will tend to be spent on imports. Thus any stimulative effect from them will quickly leak out to help the economies of our <Col N="995" /> trading partners, rather than ourselves. On the other hand the Progressive Democrats' economic policies will add further to our national debt and increase the interest burden that will have to be paid by Irish people in 1988, 1989 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Let me illustrate why this is so. The Progressive Democrats are proposing tax cuts in 1987 amounting to about £200 million. They are proposing expenditure cuts in the same year amounting to about £250 million. Thus, virtually no contribution will be made to the reduction in the deficit. Their policy will, therefore, do virtually nothing to reduce the current budget deficit in 1987.</P>
    <P>We simply cannot sustain this approach. It is not good enough for any Opposition party to ignore the 1987 budgetary situation. If the urgent obligation to improve the public finances is ignored, then we face borrowing hundreds of millions more than the Government's recent budgetary decisions of an EBR of 11.8 per cent and CBD of 7.4 per cent would involve. The annual cost of servicing this extra borrowing which is implicit in a policy statement published by the Progressive Democrats would be several million pounds. This would have to be met for each subsequent year and would represent a significant ongoing drag on the economy right into the next century.</P>
    <P>The level of interest payments involved in pursuing the high borrowing policies of the Progressive Democrats will very quickly undermine the very tax reductions their policy is designed to achieve. At the moment we are in a situation where the entire PAYE income tax yield is used up in debt service and that is without any addition to our present borrowing level.</P>
    <P>Under the high borrowing policies of both Opposition parties these debt service payments would increase even further. The result of this would be that, sooner rather than later, taxes would have to be increased again in order to pay the interest. The Opposition parties must realise that this country is on a <Col N="996" /> treadmill because of its existing level of debt without adding a single penny to it. This now amounts to more than 140 per cent of GNP and is among the highest to be found anywhere in the world. Moreover at present, levels of annual borrowing are continuing to increase.</P>
    <P>This situation cannot be allowed to continue. The upward trend in our level of debt accumulation must be halted and reversed. There is only one way in which this can be done and that is to cut the annual borrowing requirement as we have done since 1981 by some three percentage points of GNP, as the Government amendment points out.</P>
    <P>In addressing the performance of the Government, it is well to consider in the first instance the situation which they inherited on coming into office four years ago. There had been years of over-spending and over-borrowing. The Exchequer borrowing requirement had reached an all-time high of virtually 16 per cent of GNP in 1981 and there was just a marginal decrease on this in 1982. We were in the grip of a severe international recession, a recession that has persisted much longer than we could have reasonably anticipated at the time. Our options were, therefore, on coming to office severely limited. While priority had to be given to lowering the borrowing requirement, it was necessary at the same time to minimise the consequent short term risks to employment.</P>
    <P>The Government have been accused of failing to alleviate the problem of unemployment. This is just not so. When we came into office unemployment was increasing at the rate of 40,000 a year. In the past 12 months it has only shown an increase of 3,000 a year, less than 10 per cent of the rate of increase in unemployment when we came into office. However, the fact that there is any increase in unemployment is nonetheless at this time a great disappointment. It is due to a number of factors, including the continuing international recession and the impact of new technology on traditional jobs and the increasing number of new entrants to the labour market. But for the special measures taken by the <Col N="997" /> Government by way of increased incentives and special schemes, the unemployment situation would be considerably worse.</P>
    <P>It is fair to note that during the same period unemployment has been rising in other countries also, even in countries which have not had to cope with an expanding labour force as we have. The creation of more jobs must remain our central economic priority. This is a difficult task in a highly competitive environment, but there are solid indications that the situation is improving.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering that there can only be a solution to the job problem in Ireland if there is also a solution to the debt problem. Ireland's high level of borrowing has a negative effect on jobs. High Government borrowing has a negative effect on jobs because it means that virtually all income tax revenue is absorbed in debt service and thus it results in tax levels which actively discourage job creation.</P>
    <P>High Government borrowing has a negative effect on jobs because it absorbs large amounts of domestic money in Government stocks and thus diverts funds from productive investment and the uses which would provide jobs &mdash; lending to the Government does not provide jobs.</P>
    <P>High Government borrowing has a negative effect because it tends to push up interest rates, which makes investment in job creation less profitable and business prospects of survival considerably less rosy. High Government borrowing has a negative effect because interest on foreign debt takes revenues out of the economy, causing depressed living standards, depressed markets for goods and a consequential low profit profile of job creation projects designed to serve those markets. For these four reasons, there is no choice to be made between tackling unemployment and tackling the deficit. Both must be done together if either one is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The recent upward movement in interest rates has come as a disappointment and is a setback to our efforts to promote greater economic <Col N="998" /> activity. The high level of general interest rates in Ireland is due, in considerable measure, to the level of Government debt and the consequent appetite of the State for funds but the rises in interest rates have also been due to factors outside the control of Government and have much to do with international developments. The volatility of sterling has created particular difficulties for us, difficulties which are entirely outside of our control.</P>
    <P>Exchange rate stability is critically important for an economy such as ours which is so open as regards trade and other flows. It is difficult to achieve this stability when major currencies like sterling and the US dollar are very volatile. I have urged repeatedly that Britain should participate in the EMS exchange rate mechanism, but that is ultimately a decision for the UK Government. Our best approach is to maintain a stable position within the European Monetary System. We have now reached a stage where one-third of our trade is with countries participating in the EMS exchange rate mechanism and this proportion is growing.</P>
    <P>The Government have made it clear recently that there will be no downward adjustment of the Irish pound within the EMS. The August adjustment was a once-off change which has improved the overall competitive position of Irish industry, particularly in relation to continental European countries. The Government are determined to maintain the current EMS parities of the Irish pound.</P>
    <P>There have been outflows of funds from the economy, as reflected in the high level of the unexplained balance of payments residual. These outflows took place particularly in the first quarter of 1986 at a time when there was both speculation about an EMS realignment and a depreciation of sterling and the US dollar.</P>
    <P>While, of their nature, it is not possible to identify the unexplained outflows, it seems that the bulk of them can be put down to leads and lags in trade payments <Col N="999" /> arising from the exchange rate uncertainty. Given the continued uncertainty generated by the further fall in sterling and the dollar, these leads and lags have not yet been reversed and, if anything, have been intensified somewhat.</P>
    <P>The assurance which the Government have given on the exchange rate should make it clear to speculators that they cannot hope to make gains by transferring or keeping funds abroad in anticipation of an adjustment in the Irish currency. Indeed it is worth noting that anybody who has tried to do this at any point since we joined the EMS got their fingers burned and they will get their fingers burned this time also. The relatively high domestic interest rates make such speculation more expensive at this stage. I expect that the combination of these factors will lead to an early inflow of funds from abroad.</P>
    <P>High interest rates are not merely a problem for the business world. They are a problem for the average householder who has to meet higher payments and they add to the already crippling burden of interest payments on the national debt. We must continue to do all that is possible, within the limited scope available to us, to move back to lower interest rates with a minimum of delay. We have now moved into an era when real interest rates are positive; in other words, greater than the rate of inflation, this is a real turnaround from the situation of some years ago. Positive real interest rates mean simply that the amount repaid by a borrower is greater than the amount borrowed in the first place. Negative interest rates enjoyed in the 1970s meant the amount repaid by a borrower was less in real terms than what he or she had borrowed in the first place. This has changed. I think it has changed semi-permanently and it means that just as any householder has difficulties if he is a heavy borrower because of high real interest rates, so also has any country.</P>
    <P>Probably the best way to understand what has happened to this country since 1980 in terms of the results of the increase in interest rates is its effect on what has <Col N="1000" /> happened to any borrower. The effect on their cashflow position as a result of interest rates being in excess of the rate of inflation, where they were below the rate of inflation in the 1970s, is exactly the same as the effect on the Government finances. People must understand that it is not the result of bad Government or good Government, imaginative or unimaginative Government. It is a result of a reality that is occurring out there in the marketplace which no Government can overcome on their own. We are not in the position of King Canute of being able to hold back the tide. The tide in this case is flowing against borrowers, whether they be Government borrowers or individual borrowers. The sooner one gets out of that situation the better, just as people realise that postponing doing something about a problem if one is a high borrower at a time of high interest rates makes the situation worse. Exactly the same logic applies to a Government of a sovereign country.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by referring again to the problem of employment. I invite Senators to look at what the Government have achieved in this area. When we came to office, unemployment was increasing at 40,000 a year. The increase is now down to 3,000 a year. Jobs are created by selling goods abroad. When we came to office the country had a trade deficit: in other words, we were selling less abroad than we were buying from abroad. Now it has a trade surplus. By selling more than we are buying we have established the right conditions for job creation. We can only create more jobs by selling more; we are now selling more than we are buying, exactly the reverse of the situation inherited by the Government in 1982. We have achieved this because we have cut inflation and thus improved our competitive position.</P>
    <P>The Government have introduced successful and innovative schemes to help unemployed people back to work, for example, the enterprise allowance scheme, the social employment scheme and the teamwork scheme. They have given hope and challenge to thousands of <Col N="1001" /> people who would otherwise be unemployed. It is worth recalling that the OECD have asked this country to chair a special inter-ministerial study on special interventions in the job market because it has recognised that this country under this Government has done more in terms of special interventions to give unemployed people the chance of working themselves back into a full-time job than any other country in Europe or in the rest of the OECD. That is why we have been chosen to chair this committee that is being established to look at new ways of improving the labour market all over the world.</P>
    <P>The Government have also overhauled industrial and tourism policies, publishing the first-ever Government White Paper on either of those major industries. We have shifted the emphasis in industrial policy to marketing of new technology and away from capital intensive projects which had been the practice before. We have dramatically cut VAT rates on tourism, thereby creating competitive conditions for job creation in that most sector, a sector that will be probably the most important sector in the economy of much of the world in the next century.</P>
    <P>The Government have also greatly increased the incentive to work by introducing a family income supplement for low income families at work and adjusting pay-related benefits for those out of work. This has tilted the balance in favour of active pursuit of all available employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Much remains to be done. The biggest immediate challenge is the implementation of the budgetary decisions which will remove the greatest single threat to job creation in Ireland &mdash; unsustainable Government borrowing which causes high interest rates, an anti-employment bias in investment, a fear of future taxation and a general environment of uncertainty.</P>
    <P>This is why I have asked Opposition parties to say where they stand on the 1987 Budget parameters. If there is a national consensus on this issue &mdash; on what should be the overall CBD for 1987 as a percentage of GNP and the overall <Col N="1002" /> EBR as a percentage of GNP &mdash; that, in itself, will give a major boost to confidence and investment in the country.</P>
    <P>In 1982, in Denmark, that is what happened. Once it was made clear by the minority Government then come to office in Denmark &mdash; who incidentally are still in office there &mdash; that they intended to take the budgetary situation resolutely in hand, and it was equally clear that the Opposition were not going to attempt to defeat them for doing so, and that both Opposition and Government were taking their responsibilities to the nation seriously, and once it became clear that the problem that was creating uncertainty and overhanging the market with the fear of increased taxation and a fear ultimately of destitution for those who were relying on the State, as a result of the State being unable to meet its obligations &mdash; once that uncertainty was cleared away by the creation of a national consensus on the need to take action on the Government borrowing situation in Denmark in 1982, there was an immediate surge in investment and job creation which was quite out of proportion to the actual measures taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>Denmark brought about a situation in which they simultaneously had the biggest reduction in the Government budget deficit and at the same time the biggest increase in employment in the entire Continent of Europe. There are many people in this country who say nothing can be done about the Government deficit because of the huge employment problem; if something is done about the deficit it will have a negative effect on jobs. The Danish case shows that is not true, that by tackling the Government deficit, the uncertainty about possible future taxation, a possible further increase in interest rates, possible better rates of return for money invested in gilts rather than into a productive project is removed, and people are given the sense of certainty and a sense of knowing where they are going, they are able to invest money to create jobs rather than creating money for doing nothing.</P>
    <P>Essentially, if the Opposition parties in <Col N="1003" /> this debate can respond to the challenge I am putting to them by saying &mdash; having criticised the Government which they are perfectly entitled to do &mdash; what their budget deficit would be in 1987 and what their Exchequer borrowing requirement would be in 1987, if they are prepared to agree with the Government's targets or, better still, if they are prepared to say they would actually have a lower Exchequer borrowing requirement than we propose for next year, that will create in itself a sense of certainty in the community that this problem is going to be tackled over the next five years, no matter what Government are in office. If they continue to criticise the Government saying, as Senator Smith said, that they are in favour of virtue and against sin &mdash; that is about all he said &mdash; saying that they are in favour of more promises involving an additional borrowing of £450 million but at the same time condemning the Government's existing borrowing, refusing to say what their policy is on any subject because it might create public relations difficulties which would have to be explained by briefing afterwards, we will never get a sense of certainty in this country. We will continue with the destructive tit-for-tat approach to politics which has created an atmosphere of total unreality, and we cannot afford to go on with that.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate will be one in which people on both sides of the House will face up to the fact that, no matter who is in office, we have a problem with borrowing and we as a country must solve that problem. Within this House or the other House we can have an argument, once we agree on a 7.4 per cent deficit, about where the reductions should be. One party might say there should be more reductions in education and another party might say there should be more in the health area. We can have lots of arguments like that; there is no difficulty with such arguments; that is what politics are all about. But all the parties in this House should at least agree on the overall parameters within which we are prepared to work. As long as the main Opposition <Col N="1004" /> party continue to deliberately dodge that fundamental question, we will never get stability in this country. We will not have an honest election whenever it occurs within the next 12 or 18 months because the Opposition party will not come out of their bunker as far as telling the truth to the people is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have had the spectacle of the Opposition party trying simultaneously to say things that are directly opposite to one another. We read on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> on a date early in September &mdash; I will not go back to 1972 as Senator Smith did &mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Haughey promises £200 million to the construction industry&rdquo;. The following day on page three of the <i>Irish Independent</i> there was a briefing from the Fianna Fáil Front Bench that promises were out, that they were not making promises anymore. You even had the same thing in the one speech. In Cork, Deputy Haughey first of all promised to make an extension to the runway and promised to abolish the DIRT but in the same speech he said: &ldquo;I never made an irresponsible promise in my life&rdquo;. The man never made a promise in his life and yet he was actually making one at the same time. That suggests a degree of schizophrenia in the Opposition that is certainly not good for their health, and it is not good for the health of the country either. While my primary concern is for the health of the country it must be said that everybody who is responsible should have a concern, that all the parties who have and command considerable support in the country should try at least to face up to the fact that we are living in a real world at present.</P>
    <P>We are not living in some sort of kindergarten where one can dream about what one would like to be the case without regard to what would have to be paid for. That is a stage in psychological development that most people pass at about the age of ten. That seems to be the situation in which the present Opposition are labouring. They are saying they would like to cut borrowing but they would also like to be in Government. Therefore, they are prepared to promise <Col N="1005" /> more borrowing even though they would like to reduce it. That approach will not get them anywhere and it will not get the country anywhere. It will not give confidence to the financial markets either. We had the spectacle of one of the spokesmen for the Opposition party trying to say on radio on the Friday following the Government's announcement on Thursday, that these measures would not work and that the markets were responding badly to them. In other words, that spokesman for the Opposition was deliberately trying to sabotage what the Government were trying to do to bring about a reduction in interest rates. For pure party political purposes he was trying to say that these measures were not going to work. He was trying to create a self-fulfilling prophecy to the detriment of the Irish people and &mdash; he hoped &mdash; to the advantage of his own party. That is the height of irresponsibility and it is an irresponsibility that derives from the schizophrenia that is at the heart of Fianna Fáil's attitude to our economic problems.</P>
    <P>It is essential that they respond to the challenge I put to them in this debate and say what their deficit would be and what their Exchequer borrowing requirement would be next year. There is no problem about the books being unavailable to them. If they wish to see the books, they can see them any day of the week. There is no mystery about the books in this country. The information is either already published or available for publication at any time, and anyone who wants to see the books can see them if they feel they need to see them in order to say honestly what they believe should be done as far as the deficit in the Exchequer borrowing requirement is concerned. But, please, let us cut out the hypocrisy and, as an adult nation, face up to the problems we actually have in regard to our indebtedness as a people. There is no other way of doing it. There is nowhere as a nation that we can hide at this point and it would be a tragedy for the nation if the next election &mdash; whether in 12 months time or less or more &mdash; was <Col N="1006" /> fought again, as so many of them in the past have been, on the basis of slogans, simplification and the avoidance of reality. It may make life comfortable for politicians but it surely is extremely bad for the country. I hope that one result of this debate, which is a very timely one indeed, will be to put an end once and for all to that sense of self-delusion that has been the mark of much economic and political debate in this country since I became a Member of the other House in 1969.</P>

There is much the Minister has said that I have disagreed with totally, fundamentally and, I think on a few occasions in print, fairly colourfully. There is very much, I am sure that he both intends to do and aspires to do on the economic front that I will disagree with even more vehemently, and hopefully even more colourfully if I get the opportunity.</P>
      <P>The Minister has addressed the fundamental political problem which underlines the country's economic problems, which is that the party who claim to be the alternative Government will tell us nothing about what they are going to do, will tell us nothing about what their future will be, and will effectively attempt to satisfy a range of public opinion, ranging from people like myself on the left to people perhaps even to the right of the Minister.

      <P>The problem with this country at present is not an economic problem but is a political problem. It is a political problem based on an unwillingness to face realities. The realities are considerable and extensive, but to listen to the Fianna Fáil spokesman in this House &mdash; a party which traditionally has aligned itself with the weak and the vulnerable in our society &mdash; commit the Fianna Fáil party, as a first step towards remedying our problems to abolishing the first piece of decent capital taxation this country has introduced in 15 years, suggests to me that not only are Fianna Fáil out of touch with reality but are out of touch with their roots and history.</P>
      <P>The idea that the DIRT tax, however clumsily it may have been implemented with regard to the savings of some small people, is somehow the cause of the flight of capital from this country or is the cause of the country's present economic woes, is such an extraordinary conclusion that it defies belief. What is even more extraordinary is the degree to which the Irish economic, industrial and financial establishment have latched on to the DIRT tax as the cause of all the country's problems with a view to having it abolished. This, I think, is eloquent testimony to the effectiveness of the DIRT tax in compelling a section of our society to pay in taxation a reasonable share of their income from investment which they had managed to avoid on a grand scale for a considerable part of the last 20 years. It is, therefore, welcome. It is a dreadful commitment by Fianna Fáil, who in the words of their deputy leader claim to be a left-of-centre party. Yet, the very first thing they are going to do is to abolish a tax which compels people to pay tax on the interest on their investments in the way the rest of us pay tax on our earnings which we get for what we call work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My putting down this matter has been prompted by a longstanding desire on the part of many people to see an end to a sad deadlocked situation which has resulted in the much needed £12 million complex in Swinford for the mentally handicapped, known as Aras Attracta, remaining unopen since it's completion in 1985. On behalf of all Mayo people I want to thank the Minister for his commitment to the health services in Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We listened to Senator Killilea on the motion on the economy which has just ended decrying the lack of expenditure in the west. This is one of the great fallacies that has always been perpetrated by the Opposition Party. I want to record publicly the appreciation of the people of County Mayo of the Minister for his commitment in making the necessary funds available for the work at Aras Attracta in order to bring it to a fruitful conclusion and for the manner in which he has given the green light to the general <Col N="1009" /> hospital in Castlebar. After years of empty rhetoric it is significant that it was the present Minister, who has often been painted by the Opposition as the <i>bête noire</i> of the Cabinet, who made the money available to make this a reality. I regret that the time-honoured precedent and protocol of having the Minister involved do the honours on the occasion of the foundation-laying ceremony was thwarted by nothing other than a usurpation and an act of political sabotage of the cheapest kind.</P>
    <P>The development of Aras Attracta in Swinford is evidence of this Government's commitment. The development of the idea since it was first conceived by the Western Health Board on 2 December 1974 has been singularly successful. In January 1982 the Department of Health approved the proposed development and work commenced in March 1983. When work was completed in May 1985 there was on site a full and comprehensive range of facilities. We have now at Swinford the central assessment clinic for the Mayo-north Roscommon area, an assessment clinic for the people who will be privileged to be patients in this facility, residential accommodation for 140 severely handicapped adults and 50 children, residential accommodation in 16 brand new fully equipped bungalows of ten beds each, plus a 30 bed unit for non-ambulant persons of multiple handicap.</P>
    <P>Again, we have a further short term unit to accommodate six patients in the case of crisis relief being needed. We have a children's day care unit for 70 children, and 50 places for those in residence. We have three self-contained flats to enable one or both parents of children undergoing assessment to be part and parcel of the process, and to be rightfully with their progeny while this particular assessment is being carried out. We have an infirmity and a crisis relief centre which will provide 12 places for residents who will be committed from time to time. We have an adult day care centre for 40 residents, and ten day attenders. We have a sheltered workshop capable of <Col N="1010" /> accommodating 200 people between residents and day attenders. We have a vocational training unit for the provision of vocational training for 50 patients. We have a nurse training school for 90 nurses, that is, an intake of 30 per annum. We have physiotherapy, a swimming pool, gymnasium, shopping arcade, etc. We have a full community comprehensive range of facilities for children and mentally handicapped adults.</P>
    <P>It is a marvellous facility. Of course, there is the consideration for the Swinford area of 204 plus staff at Aras Attracta with the contingency to provide 64 community-based services outside. Naturally, there was a great sense of delight and euphoria, and a great sense of expectation that, once the much needed physical fabric and accommodation had been provided, everything would be on-stream for a fairly immediate and short term opening. Unfortunately, the badly-needed facility has lain idle and empty. Yesterday's <i>Western People,</i> page one, sets in perspective the need for this facility. It is headed &ldquo;The problem facing Eileen and others.&rdquo; It reads:</P>
    <P>Eileen is severely mentally and physically handicapped. Home for her is with aging parents who have pandered to her every need during her lifetime spanning 30 years. Now in their declining years they have urged Western Care Association to accept her as a resident in a group home. For Eileen &mdash; this is not her real name &mdash; there is a problem. Western Care know that £15,000 will be needed each year to support her in one of their facilities. The State will, however, agree to have Eileen accepted as a resident in a psychiatric hospital, even though her handicaps are not of a psychiatric or mental nature. Said a spokesman for the Western Care Association&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>There are seven people like Eileen on our books who are depending on organisation to cater for their needs. We can make available constant care and physiotherapy in one of the homes, but the State will not pay for her keep in one of our group homes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> It is obvious that the problem here is that Eileen is not a psychiatric patient but, in fact, is a mentally handicapped patient and that a psychiatric institution, which has very often been the home for such people in the past, is manifestly unsuitable for the type of disability or handicap she has. This deadlock arises not for the want of money but, again, from a conflict of aspirations in relation to the management and the running of the facilities. First of all, the desire on the part of the statutory authority, the Western Health Board, is that they, in fact, should provide the management, administration and the running of the centre.</P>
    <P>I want to fully commend the Western Health Board for the manner in which they have provided and administered the range of services in the Western Health Board area. There is a comprehensive conglomeration of services, ranging from three general hospitals in Galway, Castlebar and Roscommon, psychiatric hospitals again in Ballinasloe and Castlebar and an adjunct to the Regional Hospital in Galway. There is the full range of geriatric hospitals in Castlebar, Galway, etc., with other numerous outpatient services. Unfortunately, when it comes to the area of mental handicap the Western Health Board, for all their experience in those other areas, have not the necessary experience in this area which requires a particular sensitivity &mdash; and all health services require particular sensitivities &mdash; for the wellbeing of the patients.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the right of the Western Health Board to seek to run all facilities. What I question is the wisdom of taking on board additional responsibilities, new dimensions and new areas at a time of greatly expanding services and of new and exciting developments within the existing health services.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have the Western Care Association, which is a Mayo-based organisation, started initially as the Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped. Its initial title is central to the type of service they provide. They <Col N="1012" /> provide a marvellous service for the mentally handicapped children and the mentally handicapped adults of Mayo, relying a lot on the backup, support and supportive stance of the parents and of the community. In 1978 the Western Care Association were given complete charge of the children's units. This, in itself, was recognition of the association's knowledge, experience and expertise in the provision of services for the mentally handicapped. Today, the Western Care Association have four magnificent well-run schools for children, six homes for children and pre-school community services. For adults, they provide seven day training centres and 13 homes. I have had experience myself of being in some of these homes and seeing the voluntary community input, something that cannot be bought with money, but something that is irreplacable in terms of benefit to the patients and the children therein. They are a very professional organisation providing the full range of psychological, social work, physiotherapy, speech therapy and community back-up services of various sorts and descriptions. The full and comprehensive knowledge of mental handicap is the lot and, indeed, the rightful claim of the Western Care Association. The voluntary support structures they provide would be very difficult to acquire on the part of the statutory organisation for all their good intentions and for all their track record and wellbeing.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board have a statutory right to run the support services and the new complex in Swinford. They have a proven record in certain areas of the health services. The Western Care Association have a proven record, the confidence and the support of the parents and the guardians of the children and the people who are involved. It is obvious that if there is to be a successful embarkation on this project, there will have to be a substantial input by the Western Care Association by right, not merely in an advisory role but, indeed, in an executive and management role. Every mentally handicapped child in Mayo has come through their screening, has come up through the system and has benefited <Col N="1013" /> from the training under the Western Care Association. They have set their documentation, their brief and their submission down very conclusively and they are very hard to refute. I would point out to the Minister that when this issue came up on two occasions at Western Health Board level, this submission by the Western Care Association received the unanimous support of all the public representatives of all parties from County Mayo on the Western Health Board. This is proof itself of the groundswell of opinion at community level and at public representative level for the submission of the Western Care Association.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in conclusion, to clarify one point for me. It has been alleged time and time again that the money is not available. I have with me a letter from the chief executive of the Western Health Board in response to a query I made on 22 October and he says:</P>
    <P>Further to your enquiry of 22 inst. herein I wish to advise you that the present position is that an application dated 13 October, 1986, has been submitted to the Department of Health for the necessary funding to enable development of services at Aras Attracta to proceed.</P>
    <P>That seems to give the impression that the money is not being made available even though I understand that it was made available in the budget. This deadlock will continue unless there is intervention. It has gone on long enough and at this stage I would like the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that the necessary clarification is given to all the various bodies involved to ensure that the necessary assurances are given and that the necessary direction is given and that, in fact, everything will be ready for the opening of the units to proceed without any further or undue delay or hardship caused to the welfare of the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>If there is a balance of time left I ask indulgence to allow my colleague from Mayo, Senator Patrick Durcan, to come in and say a few words in support of the submission I have made.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to my colleague Senator J. Higgins for giving me a few moments to speak on this matter. I fully support and endorse the words he has uttered for the reasons outlined by him. It is extremely important that the Minister be aware, as he is no doubt is aware, of the tremendous commitment shown by the people of County Mayo towards the whole problem of mental health over the past number of years. We have experienced in our county, under the leadership of the Western Care Association, a tremendous voluntary commitment at all levels by the people of County Mayo towards the work of the Western Care Association. There is evidence now of complete lack of understanding on the part of the people of County Mayo and other areas of the fact that an impasse exists which is preventing the formal opening, and the act of opening, of Aras Attracta in Swinford. I join with Senator J. Higgins in asking the Minister to take the necessary steps to ensure that this impasse is resolved and to ensure that the commitment of so many people in County Mayo is given firm sanction by seeing that this tremendous infrastructural development comes into use at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank Senators for raising this matter at this stage because in some respects it provides an opportunity to outline some of the difficulties which we are facing. Perhaps to bring everybody up to date on the situation as it stands now I wish to say that I have just received in the past few days from the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board the board's and his detailed proposals relating to Aras Attracta and they are quite comprehensive. I will be examining them in the immediate future. I am determined, in consultation with our colleagues in the Department of Health, that we will take a decision on the proposals put before us by the Western Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been aware of the situation. I share the concern, not only of the health board, but of Western Care that there is <Col N="1015" /> one very major and very urgent need in the health board area and that is to relocate and in some senses repatriate &mdash; but certainly relocate &mdash; the mentally handicapped persons who are at present in a number of psychiatric hospitals. Indeed, in the Western Health Board area, as of last December &mdash; and I know there are more up-to-date figures &mdash; there were 110 such persons in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe; there were 92 in St. Mary's, Castlebar; there were 28 in St. Patrick's, Castlerea. I know that there have been some substantial amendments, even in relation to St. Patrick's, but if one were to just take a number of persons from those three psychiatric hospitals &mdash; I will not specify at this stage how many because that would be a matter of assessment and joint agreement &mdash; certainly their placement in the new facility in Swinford would be of enormous benefit both to them and to the facilities in existence. Of course, more particularly and above and beyond the relocation of a number of such persons, a very large number of persons from the Western Health Board area are a present in institutions outside the Western Health Board area. We have a whole schedule of such persons. In addition to all of that, there are those who are catered for by the organisations in the Western Health Board area, including Western Care.</P>
    <P>I am very worried about two aspects. Number one, substantial revenue moneys were allocated by the Government last January by Government decision. I want to confirm that my own Cabinet colleague, Deputy P. O'Toole, was particularly concerned about it at that stage. We reviewed the Swinford prospective budget. I want to confirm that we were allocated very substantial moneys &mdash; well over £1 million &mdash; for the initial opening of Swinford. I have had to re-allocate that money to other institutions on the mentally handicapped side throughout the year because it has not been possible to reach agreement on a joint basis, or a tripartite basis, so to speak, between the Department, the Western Health Board <Col N="1016" /> and Western Care on the future management of the outstanding facility.</P>
    <P>My Seanad colleagues this evening have clearly indicated the exceptional facility that is there. It is a very large facility. Frankly, it is probably the largest that will be built. I have deliberately redrawn other facilities on looking at their size, such as Enniscorthy and Loughlinstown. For all that, it is still an excellent facility in a particular setting, which will be quite capable of going in a very large way towards replacing a great deal of the impersonal and ineffective institutional settings which we have had for mentally handicapped persons in other areas.</P>
    <P>The board's detailed proposals for the development of services were received in the Department of Health last week. I am examining them now in great detail. The estimated running cost of the full facility in full occupancy of total involvement would be about £4 million each year. It was a shame that we did not manage to reach agreement on the precise management structure and administration within the facility. Equally, I have had to take action in relation to other developments in the Western Health Board area, notably on the psychiatric side. We have made progress there despite all the difficulty. I can assure Senators that I will initiate action within the Department now that we have received all the submissions.</P>
    <P>I met Western Care on two occasions. I have had very detailed discussions with them as, indeed, have the senior officers of the Department of Health, with the officers and board members of Western Care. We also intend to have detailed discussions with the Western Health Board now on their submission. That process will not be protracted. My wish &mdash; and I have an open mind on the situation at this stage &mdash; is to have the facility commissioned as a matter of urgency and to have it formally opened and occupied. It would have to be opened on a phased basis in any event. It is very big, requiring recruitment of a large number of staff; several hundred staff would have to be recruited into <Col N="1017" /> the facility. I want to assure Senators that a policy decision will be taken in the Department of Health in the immediate future. Certainly it will be taken in the next month or so. I will be in touch with the health board. Lest Western Care might feel in any way that their views are not being reported to me, I do want to say that the health board have confirmed the views of Western Care. Equally, Western Care have very clearly and adamantly confirmed their views. We have the details, reports and submissions from the chief executive officer, Mr. Eamon Hannon, and his programme editor, Mr. Pascal McDaid. These submissions have been quite comprehensive. I do not in any way regard either of the parties concerned as dragging their feet. They are both approaching this from different perspectives and these must be resolved. It would be a further final shame if, in the budget of 1987, we were not in a position to reinstate those moneys and have the facility opened.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senators for their concern. I assure them that it has not been a budgetary matter at all. God knows <Col N="1018" /> we have had enough problems with the health budget and, indeed, with the multiple problems of the Western Health Board and the various organisations. It is essential that we take that decision now. I make this a public comment. If Senators or if any members of the health board or individual members of Western Care want to give me final submissions in relation to their views, these will be very carefully considered. A decision must be taken because we have a very small number of staff employed. Only two staff are employed at the home at the moment but it is costing £140,000 a year just to keep the place intact. It is a very valuable, expensive building. It is costing that sum to keep it clean, heated and secure. That is a lot of money. It would be a shame if we had to continue with that exercise. Therefore, I want to thank Senators for raising the matter and I assure them that it will have my immediate and ongoing attention.</P>
