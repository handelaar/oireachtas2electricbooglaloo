      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.  I suggest that the House suspend the sitting from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. and on resuming take No. 3 followed by No. 4.  The intention on No. 4 is that the Minister will make the opening speech on this Bill and that there will be a response from the Opposition side.  After that we will return to the earlier business if it has not already been disposed of.  It is not intended to sit beyond 4 p.m.</P>

      <P>I made an announcement in the course of yesterday to the effect that I had received a request from the Opposition that the Courts Bill should be taken in the afternoon rather than in the morning.  It was in order to convenience that request that the Order has been changed to what it is now.  It is normal to take legislation in the morning and debate reports in the afternoon.  I am sorry if Senator Fitzsimons was misled.</P>

      <P>The position is the same in regard to No. 8, the Air Pollution Bill and No. 11, the Control of Clinical Trials Bill.  These are two very important Bills which will need substantial discussion both on Second Stage and on Committee Stage.  I am very appreciative of the fact that the Government decided to introduce these Bills into the Seanad.  I am somewhat perturbed that the press of other urgent legislation such as the CIE Bill, the Finance Bill which we will be receiving shortly, and the Constitutional Amendment Bill, will tend to push back these Bills.  I would hope that we would have time for a substantial discussion on the Air Pollution Bill and the Clinical Trials Bill, preferably in May but certainly before the adjournment.  I can say at the moment that on my tentative scheduled business I have the Air Pollution Bill listed for Wednesday, 28 May, but that may well be pushed on into June if Senators continue to do their work with the thoroughness they have been displaying in recent weeks.</P>

    <Title>Report of Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities &mdash; 33 Statutory Instruments: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of Report No. 23 of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the <Col N="735" /> European Communities: 33 Statutory Instruments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Normally it is only the function of the Leader of the House to move formally such a motion and thus allow the debate to proceed with contributions from those Members of the House interested in the topics raised by the reports of the joint committee whether they are members of the joint committee or not and to allow the appropriate Minister to comment on the report in the light of Government policy, Government decisions and Government thinking on the question. Nevertheless it is right that in moving Motion No. 1, noting this report on Statutory Instruments, I should deal with the matter at somewhat greater length.  I do not know if Senators have realised that in the period since the Joint Committee on the EC has been in operation &mdash; they only really commenced their operations in the autumn of 1984 so that it has only been operating for just over two years &mdash; they have reported to this House and to Dáil Éireann on 176 Statutory Instruments.  This represents a very large volume of work and should represent to this House as it were, a large volume of concern that this amount of indirect secondary legislation is being handled in the manner that it should be handled.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I want to call the attention of the Seanad in particular to paragraph 2-9 of the report that is before us this morning dealing with the general question of the implementation of EC directives.  We look back at what is the basis of this particular process which gives rise from time to time to reports such as the report we have before us this morning and which has, as I have indicated, in just over two years, resulted in the examination by the joint committee and the forwarding to the Houses of the Oireachtas of almost 200 Statutory Instruments.  I would ask the House to look at the basis under which this is done.  The statutory basis is simplicity itself.  It is dealt with the European Community's Act of 1972 and section 3 (1) of that Act reads very simply:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> A Minister of State may make regulations for enabling section 2 of this Act to have full effect.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Act from which I am quoting of course was the Act which gave to existing and future Acts of the Institutions of the EC binding force on the State and made them part of our domestic law. Section 3(2) of the European Community's Act goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Regulations under this section may contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister making the regulations to be necessary for the purposes of the regulations (including provisions repealing, amending or applying, with or without modification, other law, exclusive of this Act).</P>
    <P>That then is the statutory basis of the procedure with which we are concerned.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the application of that in practice we come to the very important distinction between Regulations of the EC and directives of the EC. The main point that has come up from time to time in the reports of this joint committee, to which I want to turn your attention today, arises from the difference between Directives and Regulations and from the fear expressed on a number of occasions by the joint committee and indeed by their predecessor that by acting in a certain way we may, in respect to our domestic law and in respect to the rights of our own citizens, turn a more permissive Directive into what would have the effect of a more rigorous Regulation.  Article 189 of the Treaty to which the 1972 Act gives force in this country says that:</P>
    <P>A regulation shall have general application.  It shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</P>
    <P>In the case of a regulation the whole of the regulation, every clause of it, every word, and the meaning of that word as interpreted by the Court of Justice is applicable to our State and becomes part <Col N="737" /> of our domestic law.  On the other hand, Article 189 says of a directive that:</P>
    <P>A directive shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.</P>
    <P>What we are concerned with then as a directive is that an objective agreed by the Community must be implemented in our domestic law, but we have far more discretion because I quote again:</P>
    <P>but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.</P>
    <P>Accordingly the distinction is a matter of very great importance.  We should be extremely careful in the form and the methods in which we implement directives in order to ensure that we maintain the maximum amount of flexbility, in order that having willingly surrendered a certain degree of our parliamentary sovereignty to Europe and willingly surrendered it in return for the greater good that results from this, we do not surrender any more of our parliamentary sovereignty than is needed under the Treaty. There is a duty in this regard on the Government.  There is a real duty on this House and on the other House through the agency of the Joint Committee on the EC to ensure that this position is maintained.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I want to ask Seanad Éireann this morning to pay particular attention to what has been said on this point from time to time by not only the present joint committee whose report we are considering today but previous joint committees.</P>
    <P>There is a situation that has to be faced here.  I do not want anyone to think that what I am saying is that we have unduly surrendered any part of our sovereignty in this regard.  My concern rather is that our approach to this problem &mdash; it would appear that we have not suffered in this regard &mdash; has been <i>ad hoc</i> and individual, that we have had the implementation carried out in individual Departments. When I have indicated what I see to be <Col N="738" /> the nature of the problem to be satisfied my urging to the Minister would be that there should be a broad look at this particular problem and that those who are concerned, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Finance, who have a co-ordination role also in regard to this, and the Office of the Attorney General, who are advising individual Departments in regard to individual instruments, should come together, treat this problem as a whole and adopt certain standard guidelines in regard to it.</P>
    <P>There is some element of concern here. The joint committee which sat from 1973 to 1977 devoted the whole of their 11th report to the question of the implementation and direct applicability of Directives. This report of July 1975 is Prl 4669 and I propose to quote from paragraph 6:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee's concern is to see that the power of the Oireachtas, as the sole legislative body in the State, is curtailed only to the minimum extent necessary to meet the Treaty obligations.  It would prefer a simple rule that all Directives should be implemented by statue or statutory instrument except where existing Irish legislation already provides the necessary authority.  It is not entirely convinced that the direct applicability of some Directive provisions does more than add another dimension to the accepted supremacy of Community law over national legislation in the areas covered by the Treaty.  If, however, the Government considers that it would be inadvisable to seek to incorporate a provision in Irish law because it is advised that it is directly applicable by virtue of the community instrument, the Joint Committee believes that the Houses of the Oireachtas have no grounds for objection.  It considers, however, that it is the duty of the Executive to ensure that, where a Community Directive is implemented without the intervention of domestic legislation its provisions are either directly applicable or are already covered by existing legislation.</P>
    <P>This is the point to which we must give <Col N="739" /> some concern.  Again, the same committee in its 30th report, Prl. 5419, returned to this question.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sitting suspended at 10.55 a.m. and resumed at 11.5 a.m.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I had talked of the comments made in paragraph 6 of the 11th Report of the Joint Committee on the EC which sat from 1973 to 1977.  This committee returned to the subject in its 30th report of April 1976 and I propose to quote from paragraph 3 of that document, which is Prl. 5419.  Paragraph 1 of section 3, under the heading Consistency in Implementing Instruments is as follows:</P>
      <P>This country has now had over three years' experience in implementing Community secondary legislation by domestic statutory instruments.  It might have been expected, therefore that a uniform approach would have been evolved by now in dealing with the various problems which this exercise entails.  The Joint Committee is not satisfied that this is the case.</P>
      <P>It goes on further in paragraph 3 to deal with examples of inconsistency.  Section 3 in its final paragraph reads:</P>
      <P>No doubt drafting problems of the type referred to in the preceeding paragraphs are difficult to resolve in the absence of judicial interpretation, but the lack of a consistent approach is confusing.  The Joint Committee considers that this matter should be examined to see if it is possible to agree upon a uniform and a consistent approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reading of subsequent reports and the reports which have been submitted by the joint committee established by this Oireachtas &mdash; there have been four reports in all dealing exclusively with statutory instruments &mdash; indicated to me that there has been a degree of improvement in regard to the situation as it existed in 1975-76, but it does not appear that the matter has been completely resolved to the satisfaction of the members of the <Col N="740" /> joint committee.  One can see this if one refers to paragraphs 4 to 6 of the report we are dealing with at present.  For the sake of completeness I will read into the record the concerns expressed in the report.  Paragraph 4 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee considers that, while it is essential to cite the title and the relevant Directive when making and implementing Ministerial Regulations, the Regulations should themselves be self-contained and should set out in terms normally used in Irish legislation what obligations are being imposed or what rights are being conferred on individual citizens.</P>
    <P>This is an important point because there has been a tendency in the implementation of directives to use the actual language of the directive in regard to the further implementation.  When we remember that what is important here is the objective of the directive and our obligation to implement this in the manner appropriate to our own law and circumstance there must be some degree of anxiety in this regard.  There must remain anxiety that even if it is less convenient, even if it does take more time, self-contained legislation drafted in language which has been judicially interpreted in our domestic legislation would be preferable.  Further on, in paragraph 4 the joint committee in the report we are considering go on to say:</P>
    <P>The Committee does not see that there can be any legal or practical barriers to adopting this course.  The Treaty explicitly leaves &ldquo;to the national authorities the choice of form and methods&rdquo; and the Department concerned deciding on &ldquo;the result to be achieved&rdquo; has the benefit not merely of the text of the Directive but the knowledge gained from participation in the Council Committee which examined the Directive when it was in draft form.  It should, therefore, be possible for the Department concerned to issue precise instructions to the draftsman so that he does not have to rely on the text of the Directive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> The latter remark is an interesting one. Left to himself the parliamentary draftsman will rely on the terms of the directive.  In doing so he may leave our means of implementation &mdash; in which we have a degree of freedom &mdash; of the objective of that particular directive subject to an interpretation of the European Court rather than subject to the interpretation of our own courts.  Of course, the question of whether we meet the objective must always be subject to the interpretation of the European Court but as regards the detail and manner in which it is done, we are free to act in our own manner.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 5 of the present report, the joint committee go on to say:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee has noted that in most instances Ministerial Regulations implementing EEC Directives seek to incorporate the Directive into Irish law sometimes in its entirety and more usually in part.  For example, these Regulations often provide that terms of the Directive shall be complied with, thus making those terms directly applicable and binding on Irish citizens.  It is also common practice to provide that a word or term used both in the Regulations and the Directive shall have the meaning it has in the Directive which, it seems to the Committee, has the effect of attracting the jurisdiction of the European Court in any justiciable dispute as to the meaning of the Regulations.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 6, the last paragraph that I intend to quote, it says:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee considers the effect of this current practice is in many instances to give to EEC Directives the status of the EEC Regulations within the Irish legal system.</P>
    <P>This is the point of principle.  It may well be that we will have to struggle through long negotiations in Brussels in order to ensure that a particular matter is not the subject of a European Regulation which will be completely binding on us but rather the subject of a European Directive.  We may agree with the objective, <Col N="742" /> but because of certain circumstances, whether it be our remoteness on the periphery, whether it be our present state of development, whether it be the level of our national income compared to many of our partners, all these may have been factors in which we will have negotiated hard to say that it is appropriate in this case to allow for the differing circumstances, to have argued, and argued successfully in Europe that what should be agreed upon should be a European directive and not a European regulation.</P>
    <P>The danger here is that by our subsequent action we may throw away much of that advantage.  Those reasons are known to the officials and to the Minister who took part in those negotiations but if the matter is sent merely to the Attorney General and to the parliamentary draftsman without a briefing to this effect his simplest way of doing the implementation is to follow the language of the directive.  It is a point that not only should the executive be concerned with in order that perhaps a hard-won piece of negotiation is not inadvertently lost in part due to subsequent action, but it is also the concern of this House.  It should always be our concern that the manner in which the Irish regulations are made should reflect in full the legislative supremacy of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We have here a point of principle.  It should be decided as a point of principle and not decided piecemeal in regard to each of the 176 cases where Directives are implemented according to our local conditions.  The questions will never be properly faced if we continue to act in a piecemeal manner.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am asking the Minister if he agrees with me, that there is a matter for concern here that he should seek to have it dealt with in a global rather than a piecemeal matter.  If he does not agree with me intellectually, he might be kind enough to put my worries at rest by doing so.  It is a question that involves the manner in which the Attorney General and the draftsman's office act in this regard but I have had to indicate that if we treat it merely as a question of legal implementation they will look at each <Col N="743" /> case on its own; that they will look at the documents before them.  As I have tried to indicate, there is much more of importance than this.</P>
    <P>It takes long enough to get a European directive.  We end up with a text with maybe 100 words.  How many 100 hours of discussions took place before those 100 words were agreed upon?  If the result is an EC Regulation then there is no option: that comes into our law.  If these 100 hours of discussions result in an EC Directive, then we are bound by the objective but we are not bound by the detail and we are not bound by any particular manner of implementation.  The question arises of what should be the best manner of implementation from the point of view of the rights of Irish citizens, from the points of view of the rights of the Houses of the Oireachtas to the functions they hold under our present position relative to the EC.  In regard to these points a good deal of what was said in those 100 hours of discussions may be relevant to the drafting of the Irish regulation that implements an EC Directive.</P>
    <P>This is a question that should be taken up.  It is not merely then the Attorney General who is concerned.  The Minister's Department is particularly concerned because of the co-ordinating function they have in regard to EC matters.  There are also a group in the Department of Finance who exercise some degree of co-ordination.  Every Department whose responsibilities are impinged on by an EC Directive are concerned with this.</P>
    <P>This point is the main point.  If this exercise were to be undertaken of bringing together under some umbrella all of those concerned for the purpose of this discussion, advantage could also be taken of issuing guidelines for uniformity and consistency in regard to these.  I do not want to go into it in detail but if one goes back through the four reports that we have had from the committee set up by this Oireachtas, there are repeated references to what are considered to be deficiencies in regard to notes of explanation, deficiencies in regard to citation, criticism <Col N="744" /> in regard to the question of the levying of fees and the imposition of penalties.  If such an exercise were to be undertaken, all of these things could be looked at at the same time.  The one exercise could leave us in a far stronger position.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that I think there has been no improvement in regard to this position.  There has been an improvement since this matter was first raised in the Eleventh report of the 1973-1977 committee.  It is not sufficient that there should be individual cases of improvement in individual Departments. It is time to tackle the whole problem, to tackle it thoroughly, so that we could on a future occasion receive a report from the joint committee on the EC indicating that this problem has now been solved.  I could make a much shorter speech in just expressing in one sentence my satisfaction that there no longer was a problem. I commend the report to the House and I commend the difficulty that I have raised for the Minister's consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of an opportunity to make a brief contribution on this report.  I listened with great attention and interest to Senator Dooge.  He has great experience and knowledge of that area which I do not have.  He was able to call on this erudition in making that very interesting contribution.  My approach is from a layman's aspect and practical point of view.  I would like also to cover some of the ground with regard to what Senator Dooge has said.</P>
      <P>The joint committee, comprised of 18 Deputies and seven Senators, have been working very hard, as Senator Dooge has also pointed out.  This report is dated 18 December 1985.  A report on 200 statutory instruments in two years speaks for itself.  Thirty-three statutory instruments were examined by the subcommittee under the chairmanship of Deputy Maurice Manning.  I would like to pay tribute to that subcommittee and in particular to Deputy Manning for this report.  While it is not as lengthy as the previous ones that came before the House&mdash;it is in the order of 15 pages&mdash;in its own way it is equally important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> With regard to the particular observations offered in the report on five of the instruments, it is a pity that there is no comment on the remaining 28 instruments.  I find it difficult to understand that 28 statutory instruments, brief and all as some of them may be, would not deserve some kind of comment by the Joint Oireachtas Committee.  I also feel that in the reports which are furnished to Members of both Houses, it might be possible in future to include copies of the statutory instruments.  I find some difficulty in getting the statutory instruments.  I understand they are only available through the Government Publications Sales Office.  Perhaps they are available in the Oireachtas library.  Sometimes these reports, while they are on the Order Paper for a long time, have a habit of suddenly disappearing.  That does not give the staff in the Library a fair chance with regard to getting copies of the statutory instruments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the EC directives and regulations, the report is convincing in this area.  There is some dichotomy and as Senator Dooge has said, maybe not in so many words, but my understanding of what he said is, that there is considerable room here for improvement in the lines taken by the Joint Oireachtas Committee.  My understanding of the directives would be broadly the same as Senator Dooge's.  There is some considerable discretion left with the member state with regard to implementing the directive.  On the basis of this report with regard to EC regulations, it might be generally necessary to enact legislation to cover the obligations of the regulations. That was one significant difference that I thought of.</P>
    <P>If I could go very briefly over my understanding in this area, the committee told us that, in their experience, the most significant use made of the power conferred by the European Communities Act, 1972, which was spelt out in detail by Senator Dooge, is in making regulations for the purpose of implementing the EC directives.  We are told that a directive shall be binding as to the result to be achieved upon each member State, but <Col N="746" /> that the national authorities have the choice of form of methods.  This is the discretion that was already referred to. Therefore, when a directive becomes binding on a member state as soon as it has been adapted by the Council or the Commission, it does not in the usual way, impose obligations on individual citizens until the choice of form of methods has been made by the appropriate authority, which I take to mean the statutory instrument.  With regard to this area, too, I must say also that I would share the views of Professor Dooge with regard to the draftsman following the language of the directive.  From a layman's point of view, I concede the points made in this report, that by so doing all chances of a mistake would be eliminated.  In other words, they would be keeping precisely to the same working.  I find a difficulty in that area.  While I do concede the points made, it does seem to me that by so doing, that problem is eliminated or perhaps a different interpretation or a different emphasis is placed.  Therefore, we would have uniformity.</P>
    <P>If that choice involves changing the national law, as it sometimes does, the national authority in this country must make the choice in the Oireachtas.  With regard to statutory instruments the Oireachtas has delegated this power to the Minister.  The Houses of the Oireachtas have retained, through the agency of the joint committee, supervision to some extent of these regulations.  The joint committee have a very important function.  It seems that the Minister, in getting this power, which is really the power of the Oireachtas, in relation to directives, has an enormous power in one sense. While he is of course, restrained to the terms of the directive &mdash; and I am sure that the statutory instruments being laid before this House, have some sense of supervision &mdash; I am not sure if we give sufficient time to them.  In that respect the Joint Oireachtas Committee have a very important part to play.</P>
    <P>With regard to the regulations, the report tells us that sometimes a statutory instrument is used to enact consequential provision arising from the adoption of the <Col N="747" /> EC regulations.  By virtue of Article 189 of the EC Treaty and EC Regulations it shall have general application and shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all member States.  Unlike the EC directive an EC regulation may impose obligations on individual citizens as soon as it comes into effect, on adoption by the Council or Commission.  This is the area that I spoke about.  I felt that in making it effective within the national legal system, the EC regulation may require supporting national legislation, for example, to provide for penalties and non-compliance, or to set up appropriate administrative procedures.  This is spelt out in the committee's report.  Such legislation in this country usually takes the form of Ministerial regulations.  Senator Dooge has gone into that in detail.</P>
    <P>The joint committee feel that while it is essential to cite the title of the relevant directive, when making and implementing ministerial regulations, the regulations should themselves be self contained and set out in terms normally used in Irish legislation, what obligations are being imposed or what rights are being conferred on individual citizens.  The draftsman has an important role to play here.  It is a difficult role also.  I feel it must be an almost impossible task to determine the correct etymology and subtleties of the various words used. Indeed, to my mind it is a soul-destroying task but nevertheless, a very important one.</P>
    <P>The committee point out that they do not see that there can be any legal or practical barriers to adopting this course, that is, to have a framework on the terms of the national legislation.  I cannot see any difficulty either except that I do not see any reason to do that.  Common sense would seem to indicate that in so far as possible it would be a good principle to keep it as near as possible to the directive. The treaty explicitly leaves to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.  The Department concerned in deciding on the result to be achieved have the benefit, not merely of the text but the knowledge gained and the <Col N="748" /> participation in the Council committee which examined the directive.  As has already been said, it should be possible for the Department concerned to issue precise instructions to the draftsman so that he does not have to rely on the text of the directive.</P>
    <P>The joint committee has also pointed out instances where ministerial regulations implementing EC directives seek to incorporate a directive into Irish law, sometimes in its entirety, but more often in part.  For example, these regulations often provided that the terms of the directive shall be complied with, thus making the terms directly applicable and binding on Irish citizens.  We are told that it is common practice to provide that a word or term used both in the ministerial regulations and the directive shall have the meaning it has in the directive, which the committee seem to think has the effect of attracting the jurisdiction of the European Court in any justifiable dispute as to the meanings of the regulations.  I cannot see any problem in this regard. We are bound, I presume, by the European Court: I am not too sure why the committee take such exception to the exact wording.  The joint committee also feel that the effect of this common practice is in many instances to give to the EC Directive the status of the EC regulations within the Irish legal system.  I can see a problem here.  If that result was what was intended, the Commission or the Council would have adopted a regulation and not a directive in the first instance.  In the committee's view Irish ministerial regulations should reflect the legislative supremacy of the Oireachtas within the national system.</P>
    <P>I can see that point &mdash; that it is very important to retain whatever power we have.  Most of it has been submerged in the European Parliament.  Much of it has been handed over.  I agree that it is necessary to retain whatever power we have. Also, I can see that we want to remain as individuals.  We want to retain that sense of individuality.  In that sense I can see the point, but overall I am not too sure that I can understand where the great loss is.  The Department have <Col N="749" /> replied at length to those observations and the committee is still not convinced that there is any need to change its views. It does not accept that the limited discretion left to national authorities by a particular directive or the convenience of implementing authorities should be a determining factor.  Then the Committee state very importantly that it would like to make it clear &mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that it is not raising objections to the Regulations in question on the grounds that they were not within the competence of the Ministers concerned.  What the Committee is suggesting is that there is an alternative method of implementing Directives which would better reflect the legislative supremacy of the Oireachtas in the domestic sphere and make it easier for persons affected to be aware of their obligations under Irish implementing legislation.</P>
    <P>In the reply from the Department of Finance it was pointed out that the matter was to be placed before the Office of the Attorney General.  I feel that, perhaps, while there is a problem about time that it might be reasonable to expect that we would have some indication from the Office of the Attorney General as to what the views of that office would be.  However, it is an ongoing situation.  I am sure that in due course the views of the Attorney General will be laid before the House.</P>
    <P>The committee goes on to criticise some explanatory notes.  It pays tribute in some cases where amendments have been made to explanatory notes previously criticised and where alterations have been made in view of the reports of the committee.  It points out with regard to an explanatory note in section 11:</P>
    <P>The explanatory note appended to the European Communities (Repeal and Revocation of Certain Provisions) Regulations, 1985 reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These regulations revoke the statutory requirements relating to the origin marking listed in Regulations 2 and 3 of the Regulations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In the Joint Committee's opinion this note is quite useless and gives no information that could not be gleaned from a casual reading of the instrument which itself consists entirely of legislation by reference.</P>
    <P>This is quite strong criticism and I am sure it is justified.  Certainly, from the point of view of a lay person with no expertise in this area I would welcome simplicity and anything that would help towards a better understanding with regard to the information given.</P>
    <P>In the committee's opinion, the explanatory note should have indicated what in practice the changes made by the instrument amounted to, and why these changes were necessitated by the court's decision.  This would not have been too difficult.  It is something that we would all welcome.</P>
    <P>The report pays tribute to the Minister for Agriculture for the amendment of two instruments and I would join in welcoming that also.</P>
    <P>I would just like to make reference to one of the statutory instruments.  It is a very brief reference.  That is No. 1 of the statutory instruments: Wild Birds Regulations, 1982: Statutory Instrument No. 241 of 1982.  I understand that the EC have made general regulations with regard to wild birds.  Some of the species may be in danger.  I also believe that other species for which there is a preservation order would be of a type that we could regard as predators or, perhaps, vermin in this country.  I know that gun clubs, which do a very good job in this area, have some power with regard to the containment of this type of bird.  I fail to see why there should be a global injunction imposed on all the member states with regard to wild life.  I can see the purpose of the statutory instrument.  I can see that birds might be in danger in one country but their numbers would be a problem in another country.  I would like the Minister to indicate what scope there is with regard to the statutory instruments in relation to wild birds.  I know from personal experience through the gun club <Col N="751" /> in my native town of Kells that with regard to one statutory instrument &mdash; I am not sure if it is this particular statutory instrument &mdash; there was serious concern regarding the type of bird preserved. There should be some simple way to make provision for clubs who would have a problem with regard to one type of bird or another.</P>
    <P>That is all I wanted to say.  I welcome the report.  I pay tribute to the members of the committee for their hard work. Perhaps some of these statutory instruments are not of much practical benefit with regard to any member state.  For example, Statutory Instrument No. 228, 1985, which deals with the European Communities (Units of Measurement) (Amendment) Regulations, 1985 reads:</P>
    <P>The European Communities (Units of Measurement) Regulations, 1983 (S.I. No. 235 of 1983) are hereby amended by ...</P>
    <P>and it states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unit of Length: The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am sure that for scientists, for somebody of the erudition of Senator Dooge, this may be of great interest.  I am not sure what practical benefit it is to the ordinary individual and if there is such a person as an ordinary individual.</P>
    <P>Perhaps from that point of view it might be possible for the joint committee to make a meaningful reference to the 28 reports I mentioned.  They have been very busy.  They have performed a very good task and I look forward to the following reports, to see in what way their recommendations with regard to this report have been implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can begin with Senator Fitzsimon's penultimate point and join with him in thanking the joint committee for their efforts and for having produced another very detailed, very fine and <Col N="752" /> thoughtful report.  In thanking the committee, I include Senator Dooge and Senator Fitzsimons for their contributions here this morning.  There was an underlying accord in their contributions and their general approach was quite similar.  They differed in one respect, and in that respect, while something of an agnostic, I would lean in favour of Senator Fitzsimons and lean against Senator Dooge.</P>
      <P>Report No. 23, deals with 33 statutory instruments made in implementation of Community legislation in Ireland.  While the committee have made detailed comments regarding only five of the statutory instruments they have examined, I am conscious and appreciative of the detailed work the committee's role inevitably entails.  It is a little unfortunate that none of those Senators who were members of the committee contributed to the debate this morning.  Their particular backgrounds and their telling us of the way in which they approached their work might have been helpful.  Senators will be aware that the statutory instruments in question relate to the responsibilities of several Ministers and their Departments.</P>
      <P>The committee, in their comments, and the contributions this morning also, examined and addressed themselves to two particular issues, first, the methods by which EC directives are implemented in this country and, secondly, the nature of the explanatory notes accompanying statutory instruments.  Let me take up the committee's views and the contributions this morning on both of those questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the first of these issues the joint committee made a number of observations and recommendations. They comment in particular on three statutory instruments: the European Communities (Customs) Regulations, 1984 (Statutory Instrument No. 365 of 1984); the European Communities (Customs) (No. 2) Regulations, 1984 (Statutory Instrument No. 366 of 1984); and the European Communities (Stock Exchange) Regulations, 1984 (Statutory Instrument No. 282 of 1984).  The first two regulations were made by the then Minister for Finance to give effect to <Col N="753" /> certain provisions of Council Directives. The provisions concerned specific procedures designed to simplify, in certain limited circumstances, the formalities applicable to the importation and the exportation of goods.  The last named regulation was made by the then Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and was designed to give effect to three separate EC Council Directives relating to Stock Exchanges.</P>
    <P>Reading the report, it seems that three basic points were made in relation to those instruments.  First, the committee express the view, in paragraph 4 of the report, that, while it is essential to cite the title of the relevant directive when making and implementing ministerial regulations, the ministerial regulations should themselves be self-contained and should set out, in terms normally used in Irish legislation, what obligations are being imposed or what rights are being conferred on individual citizens.  They consider, in this regard, that it should be possible for the Department concerned to issue precise instructions to the Parliamentary Draftsman so that he does not have to rely on the text of the directive. This, again is a subject that was raised this morning.</P>
    <P>In response to this point, let me say what the existing practice is and then take up some of the comments made.  The practice is that ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, to give effect to Community directives, do so by reference to the relevant provisions of the Community directives where these provisions are considered to be of such a nature as to make this course appropriate.  That is done instead of reproducing those provisions of the directives in the ministerial regulations themselves.  Furthermore, the ministerial regulations always provide the relevant references to the Official Journal of the European Communities under which the directives are published and this can be obtained from the Stationery Office.  For the information of the Senators, I would remind them that the Oireachtas Library is a depository library <Col N="754" /> for the Official Journal.  In these circumstances I submit that the current practice is reasonable.  It would be difficult to justify its abandonment in favour of a practice which involved the necessary reproduction in ministerial regulations of the contents of the directives, as has been suggested by some.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 5 of their report, which is one of the paragraphs to which Senator Dooge made reference, the joint committee go on to observe that in most instances ministerial regulations implementing EC directives seek to incorporate the directive into Irish law, sometimes in its entirety and more usually in part.  The committee noted also that it is common practice to provide that a word or term used both in the ministerial regulations and in the directive shall have the same meaning as it has in the directive.  This is the subject on which Senator Fitzsimons and Senator Dooge took somewhat differing views.  Senator Dooge, who spoke in accord with the majority of the committee, was concerned that that seemed to have the effect of attracting the jurisdiction of the European Court in the event of any justiciable dispute as to the meaning of a ministerial regulation. What the committee are suggesting, and what I understand Senator Dooge is suggesting, is that not only should ministerial regulations reproduce the substance of EC directives but that they should then do so in terms normally used in Irish legislation.  There is, of course, an argument to that effect.  In some instances it is an argument which is very cogent and very compelling.  Senator Dooge has made the point that in particular circumstances to simply follow the precise language of the directive could have the effect of upgrading the directive into a regulation in all but name and that in so doing advantages which have been gained in negotiation could thereby be forfeited. I accept that that is something that can happen in theory.  The report accepts, perhaps with less than enthusiasm, the fact that an approach of this nature is <i>ad hoc.</i> For <i>ad hoc</i> I would prefer the word &ldquo;flexible&rdquo;.  What that means is that we <Col N="755" /> are able to adopt the approach that is most suited to the particular circumstances.  If the experience of the consideration of the directive in the working groups and in the council indicates that there are sensitivities or particular areas of concern and that it is an area where we need to optimise our room for manoeuvre, we should take account of that in deciding in what form we will implement the directive.  That has happened in the past.  In so far as the danger has now been highlighted in the report and in Senator Dooge's contribution that is worthwhile and it puts people on notice of what the implications of failing to consider the question could be in some circumstances.</P>
    <P>The case against was put by Senator Fitzsimons who said that it makes common sense to stick to the same language because everyone knows where they stand in that situation.  In many cases that argument has a great deal of force. What we are concerned about here is trying to achieve the maximum degree of certainty.  Individuals or enterprises seeking to order their affairs want to know with some certainty what their obligations are and how those obligations are likely to evolve.  It seems to be a situation where the same language and the same approach is adopted lends itself to that degree of certainty and to a uniformity of interpretation.  That seems to be quite desirable.</P>
    <P>The comment was made that adoption of this approach is likely to involve the European Court more than might otherwise be capable of being avoided.  Perhaps.  Far from being a disadvantage such a method has some strength and some advantages.  In particular, it lends itself towards a uniform interpretation and application of community law.  That is a very substantial point in its favour.  Even if one accepts the arguments of the joint committee and Senator Dooge's arguments that references to the European Court concerning the interpretation of directives are to be avoided it seems to be extremely doubtful that the suggestion the committee makes even were they to be followed would avoid such references. <Col N="756" /> An Irish Court of first instance which considers that a question arose as to the consistency of the Ministerial regulations under the European Communities Act with the provisions of a directive could and would if it saw fit seek the guidance of the European Court as to whether the directive has been correctly implemented.  An Irish court of final instance, the Supreme Court in most cases, would be obliged under the Treaty to seek guidance in such a case.</P>
    <P>The next question raised by the committee &mdash; paragraph 6 of the report &mdash; is where the joint committee expressed the view that ministerial regulations should reflect the legislative supremacy of the Oireachtas within the national system, a principle from which none of us would for a moment dissent.  In effect what the committee was suggesting is that where there is an alternative method of implementing directives which will better reflect the legislative supremacy of the Oireachtas in the domestic sphere, that should be taken and by doing so make it easier for persons affected to be aware of their obligations under Irish implemented legislation.</P>
    <P>I find myself part of what I take to be a complete consensus in agreeing that the legislative supremacy of the Oireachtas should be reflected in ministerial regulations.  However, I do not accept that the making of statutory regulations in the form referred to in the joint committee's report fails to reflect the legislative supremacy of the Oireachtas.  The regulations in question are always made pursuant to powers which have been conferred on Ministers by Acts of the Oireachtas, most specifically the European Community directive of 1972 and the subsequent legislation.  The regulations are always grounded in and rooted in the supremacy of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>What we have here is a somewhat wider question than simply the relationship of comestic law and European law. What is really at issue is the whole question of delegated legislation.  It is the case that over many years the Houses of the Oireachtas and other Parliaments have delegated very substantial law-making <Col N="757" /> powers to subordinate bodies and specifically to Ministers through ministerial orders.  The question of the extent to which Parliamentary control remains effective is one that rightly concerns us. While not agreeing with the details of some of the comments made by Senator Dooge, I am in full philosophical sympathy with the approach he takes.  I hope that that will put him at ease.</P>
    <P>The second point raised by the joint committee was the nature of the explanatory notes that are appended to statutory instruments.  The comments of the committee with regard to the contents of a number of the explanatory notes have been noted.  Senators will recall that the committee made reference to two statutory instruments which were made by the then Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  Favourable comment was made in relation to one, namely, the Merchandise Marks (Prepacked Goods) (Marketing and Quantities) (Amendment) Order, 1985.  The committee regarded the explanatory note as adequate.  However, the committee criticised the explanatory note which was appended to the other statutory instrument, the European Communities (Repeal and Revocation of Certain Provisions) Regulations.  In this later case the ministerial regulations revoked a number of statutory provisions which had required a mark of origin on a wide range of goods.  The comments have been noted and I would say to Senators that the Department involved considered that the explanatory note was in the circumstances sufficient.  They took that view bearing in mind the knowledge which interested parties had in the background in the making of the regulations in question.  I concur fully as I am sure other Ministers in other Departments generally do with the firmly stated view of the joint committee that explanatory notes appended to statutory instruments should be clear and informative.</P>
    <P>One other matter I want to mention in conclusion is that the joint committee indicate that it is pleased to note that further to an earlier recommendation which it made two statutory instruments <Col N="758" /> have been amended.  That is further evidence if further evidence were to be required of the value of the work done by the committee and of the seriousness with which its work is treated right throughout the legislative process.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge expressed the hope that the concerns he had expressed would be taken account of and that in moving future debates he would be able formally and simply to welcome them.  I want to tell him that the report will be taken very seriously.  I look forward to coming back to hear some very short speeches from Senator Dooge on future reports.</P>
    <P>The final comment I want to make is that Senator Fitzsimons raised one question in relation to the statutory instrument dealing with wild birds.  I am not in a position to reply in detail today but I will write to him on the subject.</P>

      <P>Speaking as Leader of the House rather than mover of this motion, while it is true to say that there was an expectation that this question would be taken early this morning there may be an expectation on behalf of Senators that it would not be taken until after lunch.  Senator Fitzsimons came here this morning under that impression.  I raise the point now as Leader of the House, since we are within 20 minutes of the time at which we did agree to adjourn for lunch whether or not it might be advisable in the event that Senators had made that assumption that we should now adjourn until 2 p.m. in case such Senators wish to reply.  I would hate to think that not one of the seven Seanad Members of the joint committee was here to discuss this report. If they have not turned up by this afternoon I will make that point in my concluding speech.</P>

In accordance with Standing Order No. 82 it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and it is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question that the Bill be received for Final Consideration the Taoiseach may explain the purport of the amendment by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendment made by the Dáil.  For the convenience of the Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of that amendment.

      <P>In the Dáil on the Committee Stage of this Bill there were, in fact, only three amendments, two of which were identical to amendments put forward in the Seanad, which I had not accepted, and this amendment before us today.  It is a measure of the thoroughness of the work done in the Seanad that the Dáil did not have more to say on the subject.  This amendment was put down by Deputy John Kelly and relates to the question of penalties in section 18.  He suggested that the penalties involved might in certain circumstances not do justice to the seriousness of an offence. The penalties involved were £800 on a summary conviction or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months. It was suggested that stiffer penalties might be needed in more serious cases and it would be open to proceed for conviction on indictment.  For that purpose it is proposed that if that happened a fine not exceeding £10,000 or, at the discretion of the court, two years imprisonment be imposed.  That amendment commended itself to me.  I hope we will never have occasion to use it but nonetheless it is important that we should have a very severe penalty in case there is a really serious breach of the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome this amendment which has been made by the Dáil.  I do not think the Seanad will have any difficulty whatsoever in agreeing to it.  We were concerned in our debates with the prime importance of the archives, and the fact that this amendment gives additional protection to the archives by way of additional threat for those who would attempt to deprive us or damage the archives in any way is something that will also be welcomed by the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I also welcome what the Taoiseach has said in regard to the way in which this Bill has gone through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We had an excellent debate here while the Bill was before us and I am glad to see that we did our work with such thoroughness that only a single additional suggestion has been made in regard to it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the background of the division bell I would like to thank the Taoiseach, or whoever was responsible for having him paired, for the fact that we do not have disruption of our business which is all too common.  We would only hope that this might become a permanent practice.</P>

While the Taoiseach is here I might say that I did at one stage attempt to get copies of plans of houses from the congested district boards through the Land Commission and that I failed in that.  It was an area in which I was particularly interested.  Perhaps on another occasion I might get some cooperation from the Taoiseach in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the amendment, I am not familiar with the procedure in relation to <Col N="761" /> the different courts but it seems to me that a summary conviction is dependent on the value in question.  It seems to me that it is very difficult when dealing with archives to fix a definite value on documents or other items.  It seems to be an arbitrary procedure.  Does the Taoiseach envisage that there might be a problem in this regard?  Otherwise, I agree wholeheartedly with what has been said.  This is a very desirable amendment.</P>

Anything that emphasises the importance of our national archives and that underlines the value with which we all hold them, for example, this amendment, must be welcomed.  It just strengthens the commitment that lies behind the Bill and indeed the Bill itself.  I am delighted to note that all the work we did on this Bill, as it passed through the Seanad, is reflected in the Dáil procedure and that, in fact, just this tiny amendment came back.  I would use this occasion to make a plea that more and more legislation would be initiated in this House so that we can do the work so effectively.  I thank the Taoiseach for his compliments on that today.</P>
      <P>I feel that a certain status was given to this Bill by the fact that the Taoiseach came into this House and debated it at great length with us and took to heart the various points we made.  That is something I would like to see recurring.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> With regard to the point raised by Senator Fitzsimons the question of by which method to proceed would be a matter of judgment by the authorities at the time.  In accepting the amendment from Deputy Kelly I did not work out in my mind a very clear distinction or basis for distinction.  That would have to be done <i>ad hoc</i> on any given occasion, but I think one could at least envisage a distinction between, for example, a case where there was an individual case of a document being purloined or something like that and a case where somebody set about doing this as a regular process and making a business of it.  I do not know whether I have any legal basis for making that distinction in my own mind because I have not considered in any detail the point the Senator has raised.  It seems to me that one should at least allow for the possibility that there might be a case of particular gravity for which the proposed penalty would seem inadequate.  Therefore, the amendment commended itself to me, to the Dáil and now to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the House again for the way they received this Bill.  In relation to what Senator Bulbulia said I am concerned to see if Bills could be initiated in the Seanad.  In discussions in Government and in considering a programme of legislation we have been giving consideration to that and we have quite recently been earmarking certain Bill as ones which would be particularly useful to have initiated in this House.  I assure the House that this is the way in which I would wish to proceed as frequently as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this short though rather technical Bill is <Col N="763" /> to clear the way for the introduction of revised comprehensive Rules for the District Court that have been in preparation for some time.  The rules in question cannot be brought into effect until certain changes have first been made by statute. This was recognised by the Rules Committee who recommended that legislation be enacted accordingly.  The amendments of the law for which the Bill provides require some further redrafting of the rules and this aspect has been drawn to the attention of the Rules Committee.</P>
      <P>While the object of the Bill is to make the changes in the law that are needed to enable the comprehensive District Court Rules to be made, the amendments that the Bill proposes are incidentally designed to simplify procedures in the District Court in relation to a number of matters, principally the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences.  As is pointed out in the Explanatory Memorandum, the Bill also proposes certain other changes of which the most important relate to the periods of imprisonment that may be imposed in default of payment of fines.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill simplifies the preliminary procedure for the enforcement of a judgment debt and will enable the District Court clerk to issue a summons to the debtor for his examination as to means, provided the creditor fulfils certain requirements.  An amount of court time and that of the legal profession is at present taken up with a preliminary hearing merely to order lodgment by the debtor of a statement of his means and to order his attendance for an examination as to his means.  The need for this hearing is being dispensed with under section 1 which provides a new section 15 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926.  In future, where an enforcement of a judgment debt is being sought, a single sitting of the District Court will normally suffice to settle the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 provides a new scale in relation to the periods of imprisonment that may be imposed, on summary conviction, in default of payment of a fine and any associated costs, compensation, or <Col N="764" /> expenses.  It reduces the present maximum period of one year to 90 days and makes reductions of much the same order at other levels of the scale.  Revenue offences, that is revenue cases apart from ordinary motor taxation cases, will continue to carry their own penalties.  I should add that the new scale that is proposed will reflect more closely than does the present statutory scale the current practice of the court.  The present scale is set out in a statute of 1851 and is clearly in need of the updating that section 2 provides.</P>
    <P>The amendment of section 3 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940, that is proposed in subsection (2) of section 3 of the Bill is consequential on the proposals in section 1 of the Bill.  The other changes in the Act of 1940 that are proposed in section 3 represent improvements in that Act.</P>
    <P>Senators may ask whether there should be some means of reducing the level of dependence on imprisonment in cases where a court orders payment of a debt and the defendant is unwilling to pay and also in cases where a court imposes a fine and the person concerned is unwilling to pay.  Those matters are outside the scope of the present Bill but they are being examined and I will be making announcements about them in due course.  For the moment, I simply point out that no one is liable to imprisonment for simple inability to pay.  Liability to imprisonment arises only from failure to pay where the person concerned can indeed pay.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill will simplify the procedure for renewing intoxicating liquor licences without, at the same time, causing any diminution in the right of any person to object to such renewal.  At present a person intending to renew his licence must, as a first step, obtain a certificate of the District Court at the licensing sessions held towards the end of September each year.  Unless there is objection to the renewal, the certificates are usually issued without question by the District Court.  In practice there is no objection to renewal of the licence in the great majority of cases and the court certificate is issued straightaway.  The <Col N="765" /> renewal licence is then issued by the Revenue Commissioners on the basis of that certificate.</P>
    <P>The District Court Rules Committee have recommended that this procedure be simplified so that where no objection is raised, the renewal licence can be obtained direct from the Revenue Commissioners.  This should effect a significant saving in time spent by District Court clerks in preparing for the annual licensing sessions.  Accordingly, I am proposing in section 4 to abolish, except in certain exceptional circumstances, the need to obtain a court certificate as a prerequisite to an application for a licence renewal.  In future, where objection has not been lodged with the court to renewal of the licence, a court certificate will not be required save in the exceptional cases referred to in the section.  The applicant will to straight to the Revenue Commissioners who, on payment of the requisite fee, will renew the licence for the following year.  Senators need have no fear that controls over the renewal procedure will be lessened.  The power of any person to object to the renewal remains and the licensing sessions will continue to be held throughout the country every year at the end of September, to deal with objections and to make determinations in the other exceptional cases to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I am proposing to introduce stiff penalties, including the possibility of forfeiture of a licence, where renewal has been obtained on the basis of false or misleading information.</P>
    <P>Where renewal of licence is secured on the basis of false or misleading information given to the Revenue Commissioners, a fine of up to £300 can be imposed.  In addition it will be a matter for the court to decide in each particular case whether the licence should be forfeited.  This power is particularly important because removal of most renewals from the aegis of the court might lead in some cases to the mistaken belief that a fraudulent renewal will be easier.</P>
    <P>Senators will have noticed a fairly long list of amendments and repeals proposed in the Schedules.  One significant change <Col N="766" /> proposed in the First Schedule, which I will take the opportunity of mentioning here, is the amendment of the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904 to ensure that all club certificates will be renewable on a common date &mdash; in practice the date of the annual licensing District Court.  Otherwise, the amendments and repeals of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts proposed in the schedules are either consequential on the provisions in section 4 or are changes of a procedural nature being made in the light of recommendations of the District Court Rules Committee.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing in section 4 was recommended by the District Court Rules Committee and the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  I can recommend it to Senators as a relatively minor but nevertheless worthwhile contribution to court efficiency.</P>
    <P>The change that is proposed in subsection (1) of section 5 of the Bill is procedural.  The change proposed in subsection (2) will mean that where a person is remanded on bail in accordance with Part III of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, and there is no sitting of the court on the day to which he is remanded he will be required to appear, not at the next sitting in the District Court district concerned, which might be in a relatively distant location but at the next sitting in the same District Court area.  The provisions of the 1967 Act in relation to persons remanded in custody are not being amended.</P>
    <P>The commencement provision in subsection (5) of section 7 means that certain provisions in the Bill will not come into operation until a commencement date or commencement dates are fixed by me by order or by orders.  The operation of section 1 and its associated provisions depends on promulgation of the proposed new District Court rules.  A commencement provision is being provided for section 4 and its associated provisions as it may be necessary to defer the commencement of that section to allow persons affected sufficient time to comply with the new procedures before the date of the next licensing court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct in being rather modest about the proposals in this Bill.  They do represent very minor reforms.  There is nothing earth shaking in them.  The deal with the examination of debtors, with the imprisonment on summary conviction, the amendment of the Criminal Procedure Act and miscellaneous amendments and repeals. It can be said that no one of them is of any great significance.  It could be argued on the other hand that each of them represents some marginal advantage over the position as it exists.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand why such a limited Bill should have been introduced when so many reforms are necessary and when the opportunity could have been taken to introduce many more reforms of a more important nature.  It would be different if this were an emergency Bill, then a short Bill would be acceptable. We had that kind of a Bill here a couple of months ago when it was suddenly realised that the court did not have any jurisdiction over the new county borough of Galway and it was necessary to rush through a Bill to deal with that particular problem.  No such emergency is disclosed in this Bill.  Consequently it is a pity that a lot of other matters were not dealt with.  That there was no urgency is amply proved by the fact that this Bill has been meandering through the other House and this House for approximately one year. It is difficult to understand why, on the one hand, it was introduced in such a limited form and then why it was not put through the Houses very quickly.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Justice said when this was introduced in the Dáil that the urgency was to enable the District Court rules to be made.  Whatever the urgency may have been at that time, it seems to have abated in the following months.  As I say, the Bill has been going through the Houses for over one year and the new rules still have not been made. As I understand it, they will not be made for many months to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is not one to which one could <Col N="768" /> object.  It contains some useful, if minor, reforms.  I think that, as so much time was taken to bring it through the Houses, it is a pity that amendments and additions were not introduced to include many other reforms that, I am sure everybody agrees, could and should be made in the legal system.</P>
    <P>So far as the actual sections are concerned, the first section deals with the simplification of procedure for examination of debtors.  This is a useful reform. Section 2 deals with the period of imprisonment for failure to pay fines. This is certainly in accordance with modern attitudes to imprisonment generally.  I welcome the fact that these have been reduced and also the undertaking by the Minister that this whole situation will be examined further.  I am glad to note that in fact this period of imprisonment is only imposed if the court is satisfied, not merely that the person concerned refuses to pay the fine but is able to pay the fine and simply refuses to pay it.  It would be very unacceptable that a person should have to go to jail merely because he could not pay the fine.  This is an important element in this situation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 dealing with the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences is again probably an advantage.  It will save some time for the court, some time for legal practitioners and so on.  It is a minor form which is acceptable and worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the rather complicated and devious ways in which amendments and repeals are dealt with in this Bill.  They are lumped together in schedules at the end of the Bill.  It is one of the things that happens again and again in Bills of this kind.  It will not be surprising if practitioners looking up some of the Acts concerned, overlook the changes made in this rather innocuous Bill.  The Intoxicating Liquor Acts should be consolidated.  This is a very complicated section of the law.  It has been amended again and again over many years.  For the best part of a century amendments have been made.  It is reasonably simple in the sense that all the law could easily be consolidated and should be consolidated, instead of having <Col N="769" /> these numerous amendments which have made it extremely difficult to know what the law is in regard to the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  A consolidating Bill is long overdue.  I certainly recommend to the Minister that this should be considered. Members of the Oireachtas are wont to criticise members of the legal profession for the complicated laws, for the archaic language used, for the difficulties which, it is implied, the legal profession make in regard to the interpretation of laws.  It must be realised &mdash; and nobody should realise it more than the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; that the legal profession merely interpret the laws, that the Members of the Oireachtas make the laws.  It is the Members of the Oireachtas who make the laws in such a complicated way.</P>
    <P>Some countries have a practice of, in effect, consolidating every law so that when they introduce an amendment of the Intoxicating Liquor Act they merely re-enact the particular Act that existed up to then incorporating the amendments.  In that way anybody looking up an Act of that kind knows that the latest Act contains all the law as amended on that section of the law.  That may not be possible in every case, but it is certainly an ideal which the Department of Justice or the parliamentary draftsman should endeavour to achieve.</P>
    <P>In general, apart from making these observations of a general nature in regard to the way in which amendments and repeals are introduced, I should like to welcome this Bill.  One could not be enthusiastic about it.  Certainly one could not say one is against it.  In so far as it goes, one can welcome it and hope there will be other Bills in the future to deal with the many reforms which are necessary and unfortunately were not dealt with in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Before lunch we adjourned this debate in the hope that perhaps after lunch other Senators would be offering.  It is unfortunate that there are not other Members who wish to contribute to this debate.  I believe, even though we only had three contributors this morning, that we had an interesting and I hope a useful debate.  I have said in this House from time to time that the new committee system that has been established will only be worthwhile if its reports are debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We run the risk of destroying that committee system, with its many advantages if, in fact, there is not a reasonable discussion on the reports as they come to the House.  I am, of course, extremely conscious of the fact that the existence of the committees themselves has added to the burdens on Members, added to the demands on their time. Nevertheless I feel that, if this committee system is to work, Members must make a substantial effort, both Members who are Members of the committee concerned and Members who are not. Coming into the subject as it were, from the outside, they must make a considerable effort.  Of course, it may be that Members do not like this burden of committees and perhaps this is a good way of killing the system and relieving themselves of this burden.  I feel, in fact, this is what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of particular regret that, in the case of this report, which once again highlighted the question of the method of implementation of EC directives by Irish regulations, a point of principle to which the committee and their predecessor have returned again and again, is that not one of the seven Seanad representatives on the committee was here to take part in the debate and to put <Col N="771" /> forward the case which must have been discussed in some detail.  I feel it incumbent on me, as Leader of the House, to deplore this.  Senators accept a responsibility when they accept a nomination to represent this House on committees.</P>
    <P>In regard to the discussion itself, the subject has been well aired.  The Minister, in his contribution, seemed to indicate that I should now be well satisfied, that my fears should now be mollified.  I am very sorry to disappoint him on that point.  There are still distinctions that have to be made and difficulties that have to be removed.  When the Minister, in his contribution, says that surely it is reasonable that the meaning of a directive should be a matter for determination in the European Court of course he is right. Of course there is no quarrel between us in that regard.  When we come to the question of what is the effect under Irish law of a particular method of implementation adopted in an Irish statutory instrument, then that is another question.</P>
    <P>The Minister also put forward, since he still retains vestiges of his legal training and his legal approach, the tremendous importance of certainty.  Certainty is a valuable thing, but it is not an absolute good.  There are indeed legal systems, which manage to attain a very high degree of certainty by making assumptions, for example, that the public prosecutor would not bring anybody to the court unless he were guilty.  There is a great degree of certainty under such legal systems.  What we are looking for here is certainly a higher degree of certainty but a degree of certainty that is compatible with the rights of Irish citizens and that is compatible with the sovereignty which we still possess under the accommodation of the European Community legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of delegated legislation is always a difficult one.  This House has always recognised that it is a difficult one.  This House many years ago set up a committee on statutory instruments because the Seanad felt at that time that it was necessary that these should be <Col N="772" /> thoroughly examined with all the advantages of the committee system in the name of the Oireachtas.  Seanad Éireann took this role upon itself, originally as far as my memory serves me, as a result of the prompting of Senator Luke Duffy of the Labour Party and, indeed, in later years vigorously pursued by Senator George O'Brien and Senator Bill Sheldon.  This work was extremely valuable work.  It behoves us in the Seanad to be completely satisfied that this work is now being done at least as adequately under the new dispensation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the main question on which the Minister seemed almost to move from an initial agnosticism to a faith different from my own in the course of his speech, I would like to say that his wish that he would not hear from me on this subject again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In spite of the small number taking part it has been a useful debate.  I merely want to say in reply that I do not think it is yet a dead subject.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of <Col N="773" /> the Second Report of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries: The Bilateral Aid Programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the case of the motion which is on our Order Paper to note the report of the Committee on Co-Operation with Developing Countries I do not intend to raise major points of principle as I have on the last report. Nevertheless, I would like in moving this motion to make just a few remarks.  The main contributions on behalf of the Fine Gael group will be made by Senator Catherine Bulbulia and by Senator John Connor.  However, it would be wrong for anyone like myself who has an interest in this particular problem not to give a personal welcome to this report and not to underline certain points which are in the report, while leaving the more detailed discussion for other Senators.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the phrasing that was used in the report at paragraph 7 where it says in effect that development aid is a matter of poverty and not of politics.  This is something that must never be forgotten by us and we would hope that other countries would remember it more often. There is possibly a danger even here in Ireland that people's interest awakened by the horrors of the North African famine may begin to subside with the passing of the worst of that crisis.  There is also a danger that people in this country will feel that, once we have responded in terms of short term aid to crises such as this, we have done what is required.  Of course, this is very far from the truth.  It is the middle term aid and the long term aid that can cure poverty and underdevelopment in Africa as elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We must realise what is the enormity of that persisting problem, never mind the temporary crises that become superimposed upon it.  In this connection I am concerned in my professional capacity with the key problem of water and the Third World.  Perhaps then I would be allowed to illustrate from my own field what is the magnitude of the problem that the world is facing.  I say &ldquo;the world is facing&rdquo; because that is the way we have <Col N="774" /> to look at it.  We have to look at it in the sense that what is being suffered in this regard is being suffered by part of our world.  That is why I probably should not have used the term &ldquo;the Third World&rdquo;.  It is bad to use terms, even for convenience, that attempt to divide up our world into the First World or the Second World and the Third World.  We have to tackle all of these problems from the point of view that we are one world.  In the long term, and even in a reasonable middle term, it is as one world that we will survive or not.</P>
    <P>The Brandt report talked about itself as being a programme for survival.  It was not talking about being a programme of survival for the south.  It was as being a programme for the survival of the south and the north.  This is something that we should realise.  In tackling the problems with which I am professionally concerned of the provision of water for the Third World I am continually reminded of the fact that there are on this planet 1,000 million people who do not have access to safe water.  We are in the middle of a UN decade of water and sanitation.  Despite all the efforts, at the end of that decade that problem will still remain as huge.  It may be dented, something may be done, but we have a problem of enormous magnitude.  The small increases in radiation in drinking water on the Continent of Europe is something of a much smaller order of magnitude.  What are the consequences of this lack of water?  In extreme cases, of course, it can result in famine. The main effects are that whereas an individual can live on something between one and three litres of water per day a person cannot live under healthy circumstances without something of the order of 30 or 50 or preferably 100 litres of water a day.  So, we have, throughout the world, the prevalence of water-borne diseases.  We have water-borne diseases such as trachoma.  In every year there are 500 million cases of this disease.  In every year there are 250 million cases of elephantiasis; every year there are 200 million cases of schistosomiasis.  This is the <Col N="775" /> type of problem being faced in this area. This is only one aspect of it.</P>
    <P>We move on to the problem of food, the problem of desertification, the problem of education and training.  We find problems of this enormous nature which have to be tackled.  Perhaps then we say to ourselves: &ldquo;It is so big; how should we tackle it?  Maybe this can only be done through the big UN organisations; maybe it can only be done through multilateral aid; it may be that bilateral aid, which is the main topic of this report, cannot do anything in regard to this type of problem.  I would say that that would be a mistaken view.  I think there are particular advantages in regard to bilateral aid.  In the case of aid from Ireland there are very special advantages in bilateral aid which are not true in the case of larger and more developed countries.</P>
    <P>I commend the policy that has been adopted over the last decade or so in this country of increasing the amount of bilateral aid.  We would probably be equally wrong if we went too far in that direction.  But as I understand it, the policy of the Department now is to get an approximately equal balance between multilateral and bilateral aid.  This makes a sensible policy to adopt for the next five years or so and, in the light of development, to decide how that might be adjusted.  In regard to this balance the Government are doing the right thing. Of course what we can give is small.  We got off to a very late start in this regard. We are still well short of the UN target, and very frequently there is criticism of this fact.  I would like to say that I think the Department of Foreign Affairs have done extremely well in the light of the financial pressures they have been experiencing.  I had to experience those pressures myself in one particular financial year.  They have done particularly well in order to maintain such progress as has been maintained.  It is all right to take just the straight figures and to say we are not doing as well as others, to say that our percentage of GNP being devoted to development aid is less than that of the other OECD countries and therefore this <Col N="776" /> is something we should be ashamed of. We must remember, on the other hand, that our income per head is about half of that of the OECD average.  Without being complacent in regard to the question of progress towards the UN target, we should acknowledge the fact that even in our public charity, through the Department, our contribution per head is substantially higher than that of the other countries of Europe, in the same way as it was in a recent charitable effort.</P>
    <P>Again, I had better put in a footnote. I have used the word &ldquo;charity&rdquo;; I am using it only for convenience.  What we spend, either as private citizens or as a public citizens through our foreign aid programmes, is not payment of charity, but payment on the basis of justice, payment in recognition of our particular good luck to be born, to live and to work in such circumstances as we do.</P>
    <P>We should continue to strive.  I would urge the Minister to continue the effort to move towards the UN target.  This is something in which I take a particular interest.  I can recall a number of occasions in which the Taoiseach and I joined in writing into our party programme a pledge to this effect, anxiously asking each other if there is any way the Department of Finance could get around that particular formula.  I urge the Minister to continue the struggle in that direction.</P>
    <P>We can, at the moment, afford so much.  I hope, as the years go on, it will be more, I think we are getting good value for the money spent.  The Department have, in recent years, improved the management of this programme. Their monitoring has been improved. This may be a by-product of the fact that there has not been such a rapid increase in expenditure.  If the Minister were given an enormous increase in the amount of money next year he would be concentrating so much on getting projects going that we might not be getting such good value for money.  That is no reason we should not look for more money.  I think the expenditure in this country is as effective as that in any of the countries, many of whom have reputations for being very <Col N="777" /> good in this field.  One of the reasons is that so much of our bilateral aid goes to countries in the least developed category, the 30 poorest nations on earth.  Surely this is money better spent when we can do so little in this area.</P>
    <P>There are advantages of scale.  When we send out an expert from this country, whether it is an agriculturalist, engineer, doctor or nurse, if we send them out to a developing country they very often find that the scale of operation they are concerned with here, and in some sense the whole social framework within which these projects are set, are much more similar than in the case of a very large and highly developed country.  In this sense also we are getting value for money.</P>
    <P>These were just a few points that struck me while reading this report.  I would like to commend the committee on the report.  There are a number of points raised which can be stated in quite some detail.  I trust that Senators will do so and that they will reward the committee, as it were, for the thoroughness of this report and for the insights they have shown, by a debate which will take up these points and examine them.</P>
    <P>One final point in conclusion.  It would be wrong if I did not on this occasion pay tribute to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who was responsible for this programme for a number of years and who pursued his responsibilities in that regard with commitment, energy, enthusiasm and intelligence that were utterly commendable.  At the same time, I would like to welcome Deputy Birmingham to the office.  We know that he, too, has the energy, enthusiasm and commitment necessary for this task.  We wish him well.  He has here a challenge in this post but I think it is one to which he will be equal.  In congratulating Deputy O'Keeffe on what he has done I look forward to what his successors will also do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my pleasure to second the adoption of this report in the Seanad.  In doing so, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Jack Fitzsimons, <Col N="778" /> for waiving his right to do so.  I welcome this Second Report from the Joint Committee on Cooperation with Developing Countries.  I, too, would like to add my words of commendation to the committee and to the dedicated chairperson, Deputy Nora Owen, because I feel that this report is painstaking, thorough and valuable.  It gives us an opportunity in this House to discuss and evaluate our bilateral aid programme.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to do so here this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I was interested to see that the committee decided to choose the bilateral aid programme as the subject for their second report.  It was a wise choice because it represents a major initiative and the thrust of our entire development co-operation work.  Such a review is timely because BAP, as I intend to call it from now on in the course of this debate, has been ten years in existence. An in-depth review and evaluation of its content and operation is desirable and necessary.  This the committee proceeded to do to good effect.  That represents a significant portion of our ODA, as I have stated.  It represents 66 per cent, approximately, of discretionary as distinct from mandatory ODA.  Therefore, it is something over which we have direct control because it is administered by Government.  It is true to say that it is the centre-piece of Ireland's development co-operation effort and as such it was a wise choice of the committee to make this the subject of its second report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past we have had some really excellent debates in this House on development co-operation matters.  It is fair and reasonable to say that the quality, standard and nature of the debates in this House have been superior to debates held elsewhere.  Also, we have had the opportunity to debate and discuss development co-operation matters more than in another place.  I look forward to hearing what Members have to say on this report, particularly members fortunate enough to be members of this all-party committee.  I would dearly love to be a <Col N="779" /> member of this committee, but there is no vacancy at the moment.  So, I must content myself with reading their reports and following their progress and letting my voice be heard at debate stage in this House.</P>
    <P>I, too, welcome the new Minister of State with responsibility for this portfolio here to this House this afternoon and I wish him well with his brief.  He has recently been given this very big responsibiity and I know, as Senator Dooge has said, that he will be more than equal to it.  We, in the past in this House have had the pleasure of Deputy Birmingham's predecessor, Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, and I, too, would like to place on record my appreciation of and gratitude to him for the tremendous commitment that he gave to this portfolio while it was his remit and responsibility. He certainly travelled the length and breadth of the country.  Any groups or individuals involved in development co-operation always felt that there was an open door to them.  He made himself known and respected among all these groups of people.  I have no doubt that Minister George Birmingham will do precisely the same.</P>
    <P>The history of Ireland in development co-operation goes way back in time.  It is rooted in our missionary effort and has always had a measure of support from Irish people, albeit relatively less sophisticated than it is today.  There is a tendency now to sniff at the notion of the black babies and the boxes pushed under the noses of people to assist in missionary endeavour.  Nevertheless, although it is now seen through a certain historic perspective, and is perhaps denigrated, it is not such a bad thing.  It did make the plight of the oppressed become impressed on the consciences of Irish people.  It was a reasonable foundation on which to build what is today a far more sophisticated and effective style of development co-operation.</P>
    <P>Nowadays the whole picture is far more complex.  It involves direct aid, political relationship and trade.  More and more people are becoming aware of the <Col N="780" /> Irish thrust in this area.  They are enthusiastic and supportive of Government endeavour and initiatives.  That is good, but I do share the reservation expressed by Senator Dooge and the apprehension that the flood of support engendered by the sub-Saharan famine could dissipate and could be but a momentary, hysterical, gut reaction to a problem.  We have to realise that the true nature of the problem is immense and requires much more than that to even attempt to cope with it.  It is important to bear this in mind and to recognise the sheer scale, scope and nature of the task that has to be done.  The statistics in relation to the diseases which were given in the House this afternoon by Senator Dooge can leave nobody in any doubt as to the scale and scope of the problem.</P>
    <P>The joint committee report makes a total of 48 recommendations.  In my view all of them are necessary and highly pertinent.  The report itself is concise and it is tightly argued.  In many instances when I read it I felt the obvious was being stated. Then I reminded myself that it is necessary to state the obvious and to have it there in black and white for the record so that decisions are made against a background of carefully thought-out policy which has been clearly enunciated and articulated.</P>
    <P>In this regard I would like to ask the Minister when he is responding to the debate to indicate when it is proposed to unveil the White Paper which has been talked about for a considerable time and is I understand in the melting pot, because the gestation period &mdash; if I do not mix my metaphors &mdash; has been overly long.  It is necessary that there should be a White Paper on the table so that Irish people can see clearly what policy there is because, excellent and all as this report is, its circulation will probably be fairly limited and it will not have the impact of a Government White Paper on development co-operation although I would imagine that much of what is contained in this report would be part of the substance of such a White Paper.  I do hope that the work that is probably ongoing in <Col N="781" /> the Department will see the light of day under the new Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The committee state as their first recommendation that our BAP policy should be poverty oriented and it goes on to define exactly what it means by this.  It states that each programme should tackle the basic needs of the most poverty stricken people of a particular area in a manner directly beneficial to them.  It is probably obvious that this must be what a poverty oriented programme means but again it is necessary that it should be established clearly and indeed that it should be adhered to as a basic principle of policy from which decisions as to programmes and projects will be made.  I was pleased &mdash; and I note that Senator Dooge plucked it out of the report as worthy of strong emphasis &mdash; that a special statement was made in the report that aid should be given without regard to the political complexion of receiving countries.  It is gratifying to realise that that principle has been clearly enunciated and established.  I do wish that it were so elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I was very fortunate in January to have been invited to go to the Philippines and I saw there aid policies of another country which were clearly dictated more for reasons of strategic importance and East-West relationships than for any poverty-oriented motives.  I saw the folly of such an approach and indeed it is very limited in impact on the ground.  Also, I experienced the cynicism of local, native populations who clearly saw through that type of development co-operation approach and I am pleased to know that it will never be part of Irish development co-operation policy.  I think such an approach sets us apart from countries whose aid policies are bedevilled by political consideration.</P>
    <P>We must remind ourselves over and over again and give ourselves credit for the fact that we are neutral, small and we can, because of those two factors, be particularly effective in the field of development co-operation.  It is my very strong gut feeling that we do not give ourselves sufficient credit for that and that we do not build on it and give ourselves the <Col N="782" /> necessary moral authority that can go with neutrality and our small scale.  We should do that more and more.  I hope it becomes increasingly a feature of speeches and policy emanating from the Department.  We have a unique position and we must make far more use of it. We are in a particularly advantageous position to urge that the principles of social justice and a more equitable distribution of resources should be the key factors in development co-operation policies.  We should particularly press home these two points in international fora and in the EC where we have a voice and where I feel that it is along those lines it should be heard.</P>
    <P>Our past history as a colony creates a very special empathy between us and developing countries who also experienced a history of colonisation.  At the same time while much of what I have said could be regarded as a certain highminded idealism it is important to mention that by virtue of the fact of our EC membership we participate in a system of tariffs and protections which in some instances ensure or even guarantee that the capacity of many of the oppressed countries to produce agricultural goods cheaper than we can is not capable of realisation.  The very existence of the CAP and its operation ensure than many of the goods from these countries cannot be and will not be effectively marketed. Here is where we can have a certain influence in the EC by bringing up this point and by insisting that it be developed and not be relegated when the CAP is being discussed.  Certainly, following the recent price negotiations and settlements in the EC it is obvious that the consumer lobby and those in Europe who are concerned about surpluses and the build up of surpluses are being attended to and listened to increasingly.</P>
    <P>The next step is for people to say how can we effectively and without blowing out of the water price structure and production here ensure that the suitable surpluses can be diverted elsewhere but at the same time keep some sort of harmony and stability in trading.</P>
    <P>It must also follow from acceptance of <Col N="783" /> the principle of the non significance of the political complexion of a country that countries have the right to overthrow dictatorships and autocracies or other types of authoritarian regimes.  However, I am pleased to note that the report in paragraph 67 rules out involvement with countries where a political situation is so odious that any collaboration would be clearly construed as a betrayal of the population.  No doubt the committee members had regimes such as South Africa in mind when they specifically included that proviso in that paragraph. I am pleased to see that because it is self-evident that it would be quite unacceptable and would be construed as a betrayal if we became involved as a matter of policy in development co-operation activity in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The committee make a recommendation that the possibility of rescheduling or temporarily suspending Third World debt be pursued by Ireland in international fora.  I certainly endorse that view because the fact is that control over the World Bank and the IMF is exerted by the developed nations and it is quite obvious that the recipient nations of the Third World should have a greater say in decision-making at these levels.  Conditions attached to IMF loans should be less stringent, particularly as they relate to health and welfare programmes.  If Third World countries default on debts Western banking and finance generally could be severely endangered.  From that point of view it makes sound economic sense globally either to reschedule loan repayments or in some instances to suspend them.</P>
    <P>I support the view in recommendation 4 that we should continue to pursue our policy of establishing small scale projects to cater for basic needs in an integrated manner and, of course, in co-operation with our host authorities.  The best feature of such projects, in addition to their scale, is that they are capable of a replication and that we can learn from them and modify them to suit prevailing circumstances in different countries where we operate because generally speaking they <Col N="784" /> have been found to be a sure-fire formula. When one has got such a formula one has got to use it, refine it, hone it and improve on it.  In that way you will go from strength to strength.  These are tried and tested in all our BAP priority countries.</P>
    <P>In chapter 2 the report deals in some depth with problems and guidelines for programme administration &mdash; slightly turgid stuff but necessary in the context of reviewing BAP.  Such a review and evaluation was necessary.  In outlining the structures and organisation the various bodies which dovetail with and &mdash; or are funded by BAP are mentioned.</P>
    <P>On reading through it I was once again struck by the fact that the whole area of development co-operation now has a specialist vocabulary of its own.  The pages positively bristled with acronyms &mdash; APSO, HEDCO, DEVCO, ICOS &mdash; but I was very pleased to see that those who compiled the report decided that a glossary would be a useful addendum.  At the back an entire page of abbrevations are listed, so the uninitiated need have no fear and, in fact, can have great fun skipping back and forth to establish the which, what, where and when of the different organisations.</P>
    <P>The structure of the administration of BAP is clearly set out.  Only two areas were felt to be of concern.  The two areas picked out for a closer look at were ones of staff continuity and professionalism.</P>
    <P>The committee are heavily in favour of removing the embargo on recruitment to the public service in the area of development co-operation.  That should hardly be a surprise.  In every area there are special pleadings.  I remember during my time as a member of the health board it was one of the areas where it was felt that there should be absolutely a hands-off policy and that the embargo should not apply at all.  I can quite understand the feelings of members of the committee who felt that a similar hands-off policy should be applied in the development co-operation field.  I support this recommendation because I am keenly aware of the very damaging effects a lack of continuity in policy and planning can have on development projects out in the field.  There <Col N="785" /> is nothing more undermining or more damaging than stop-start `lack of funding' type difficulty being experienced by workers in this field.  A turnover of personnel can have an extremely demoralising effect on projects.</P>
    <P>I support the view that the Department should build up a fund of expertise and should, where necessary, engage specialist consultants.  The committee strongly support the view that the wisdom and experience of returned volunteers should be drawn upon.  I endorse that view. What is the point of having a body of expertise with pertinent, relevent information if it is not going to be drawn upon in order to enrich our development co-operation endeavours?  The difficulty seems to be that there is no formal mechanism for ensuring that this expertise will be drawn upon.  The committee in their report offered themselves as the vehicle for this necessary valuable input.  This is where I have a certain reservation because the existence of the committee is very much dependent on the will of the Government of the day.  It is not so long ago since a Taoiseach decided that a Minister of State with special responsibility for development co-operation was unnecessary.  In fact the function was described as &ldquo;superfluous&rdquo;.  That was certainly one of the epithets used.  It is true to say that there is no guarantee that future Governments will have the same commitment to development co-operation.  The idea that the committee would offer itself as the vehicle for the transfer of experience and information into the policy making area is, perhaps, a limited one.  It would be more important to have another vehicle for this necessary input. Perhaps it would be better if formal consultations were set up with Comhlámh, who are the organisation of returned development workers.  Comhlámh are a member of the ACDC Council.  If the arrangement was formalised that could be the mechanism for getting the information from returned experts and volunteers.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read, in paragraph 30, that the development co-operation officer, who is a vital person, has in fact <Col N="786" /> an ill-defined status.  A particular difficulty in Lesotho is referred to.  Not being a member of the committee.  I was not privy to what the particular difficulty was, but it was obviously of sufficient significance to ensure that this whole matter was discussed by the committee.  It may be that in developing countries diplomatic status is something of significance.  While we here might think that this is something that should not be catered to, nevertheless if it makes the function and the role of our officials in the field an easier one, if it gives better access, if it soothes the way and ensures the success of projects, it should be sensitively and intelligently approached by our people in Ireland so that the lack of such status should never be an impediment or handicap to our work.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 32 there was a hint of criticism to the effect that the Department of Foreign Affairs could be somewhat hidebound in their approach to innovative projects.  I would be concerned that this might be so.  I take the point that in order to get over this difficulty, if it is a real one or a particularly critical one, greater dialogue between the NGOs and the Department of Foreign Affairs would be helpful in this regard. We can all become hidebound.  We can all become less receptive to new ideas. We can all become chary of innovation. It is part of the human condition and it does not reflect particularly badly on the Department of Foreign Affairs but it bears watching to ensure that it does not become an established feature of policy. I do not mean that in any particularly critical way.  I would echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Dooge when he spoke of my admiration and enthusiasm for all the work being undertaken by the Department of Foreign Affairs in the field of development co-operation.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 33 the committee stress the importance of monitoring and evaluating projects.  The importance of consulting the project workers and taking them into one's confidence is emphasised, I have already spoken about that.</P>
    <P>One interesting point was made in connection with the lack of monitoring of <Col N="787" /> overseas personnel who have training in Ireland and have gone back to put that training into practice in their countries of origin.  I must confess it is something I have never actually thought about.  I was aware of the presence of poultry workers in the country, of Aer Rianta's training of airline mechanics, of the various training programmes in administration in the semi-State and Civil Service bodies.  One assumed that people went back to their countries of origin armed with a certain knowledge and expertise.  I certainly never thought much beyond the fact that they came, were trained and left.  The committee forced me to think about the fact that everybody in intern or post-training situations should be monitored and should be assisted and their skills and training re-enforced.  I know this would be complex and, perhaps, difficult to set up but I think we owe it to the investment we make in the training of these personnel to ensure that we do not sell them short at that vital stage in their development.  It is necessary and important that we should have some sort of process in place so that this can be attended to.</P>
    <P>The committee make an interesting point that the basic evaluations of projects should be published.  I find this recommendation an appealing one.  I hope it will be followed through.  We often underestimate the interest of the general public in matters of development co-operation.  Particularly, our young people are enthused about this aspect of our foreign policy.  I have had the pleasure of chairing CONCERN debates in various parts of the country.  I experienced there the general excitement and interest and love of development co-operation work, not only among the selected few who participated in the debates but also the camp followers who were there in force and who, judging from the questions from the floor when it was a sort of &ldquo;open season&rdquo; when the adjudicators were doing their work showed that the knowledge and the interest was not confined to those taking part &mdash; the actual representatives of the schools&mdash;but right throughout the first <Col N="788" /> year students to sixth year students there were at varying levels of sophistication an interest, a concern and an enthusiasm. I am sure that if the evaluations of various projects were published and the debate was brought more into the public arena all of these youngsters would be keen to follow up and to see how various projects were faring.</P>
    <P>It is only reasonable that taxpayers, in whose names all of this activity is carried out, should be brought more into the arena and should have access to this kind of information.  It is a useful part of an open, consultative democracy that this should be the case.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 35 the report stresses the necessity of having rigorous selection procedures for volunteers.  That is a necessary point to have made in the report.  There is a grave danger, in our recession-ridden western democracies where graduate unemployment is rife, that people without the necessary commitment, motivation and sensitivity would pop up as volunteers.  Great care must be taken in screening and selection procedures to make sure that this is not so.  At this juncture I would commend APSO and their director, Bill Jackson, for the excellence of the work they undertake in this entire area.</P>
    <P>A correct emphasis in the report is placed on the value of proper pre-departure orientation programmes and language training.  Having been the subject of a pre-orientation programme before my visit to the Philippines I have personal appreciation of the value of this.  It is rather like a lot of other things in life, particularly if one goes out for six months of a year, perhaps after an initial six weeks there should be the possibility of getting a second &ldquo;go&rdquo; at an orientation programme.  It is only when one has experienced something at first hand that the value of one's orientation programme is felt.  Perhaps that is something that could be looked at.  Maybe it would be possible after six weeks or two months to bring volunteers together and have a fresh evaluation and &ldquo;reorientation&rdquo; based on experience in the field.  At that <Col N="789" /> stage very often information can have a far greater significance to people.</P>
    <P>The strict application of the four year rule limit is questioned.  The report stresses that often the good of the individual project might demand latitude in this regard.  The report invites the Department of Foreign Affairs and APSO to exhibit a greater degree of flexibility and to look at this area closely. It may be that in the field of project and programme work the four year limit is too blunt an instrument and, in fact, it could be counter-productive and work against the very project in which it is involved.</P>
    <P>In praising and valuing the work of so many excellent volunteers, the report indicates that with medical volunteers, particularly doctors, difficulties in relation to careers are experienced on their return to this country.  The IMO are invited to address themselves to the problem.  I do not mean to nit-pick or to cavil unduly but reference is made to the IMA and the IMU.  In fact for the past 18 months those two bodies are now amalgamated into what is called the IMO, and so a slight correction is necessary there.</P>
    <P>At the end of chapter 2, paragraph 39, the report makes a strong plea for better and greater co-ordination between the various agencies.  This would have the effect of streamlining activities and avoiding duplication and consequent wastage of resources.  The report recommends that the ACDC be asked to undertake the study of this whole area which I also feel would be valuable and cost effective.  A strong plea is made that the recruitment, training and administration of volunteers and expert personnel should be the preserve of one agency only which seems to me to be eminently sensible.  I think to concentrate expertise of this nature in one agency could only improve the service.  I hope that that principle is established as one of policy.</P>
    <P>Chapter 3 of the report deals with BAP funding arrangements under two headings &mdash; bilateral aid as a percentage of overseas development assistance and, <Col N="790" /> secondly, the relative proportion of BAP funds allocated to its constituent parts.</P>
    <P>The committee affirms their support for an annual growth rate of ODA of 0.5 per cent of GNP until the UN target 0.7 per cent of GNP is achieved.  I feel that this particular target ought to be declared to be politically sacrosanct.  It should never be hostage to the daily, weekly or yearly vicissitudes or political trials and tribulations of individual administrations in the donor country &mdash; in this case, Ireland.  The blunt facts are &mdash; and it pains me to state them because I feel deeply about this area of development co-operation &mdash; that successive Governments have regularly and consistently not managed to follow through on promises in this regard.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Dooge's point that we, perhaps, are not necessarily in a position to follow-through but, nevertheless, the ideal should be kept firmly in mind.  I am sure if it were put to the people, they would want to see this shining target held firm.  It is true to say that in times of development recession back home this target can sometimes be seen to be an expendible item.  I am hopeful, because of the attitude of the general public and their growing awareness of the significance of development aid matters, that the lowering of our aspirations is becoming less and less likely to occur.  I fully endorse what Senator Dooge said about Third World aid never, ever being regarded as a charity.  The circumstances of the Irish people are so good and we are so fortunate, that in common humanity and in justice we owe it to the less fortunate and the oppressed to ensure greater equity.  We should do all we can to assist this.</P>
    <P>It is useful to note that the report states that Irish ODA is expected to grow to £50 million by 1987, which is an increase of roughly 50 per cent on the level of funding in 1984.  This scale of increase will have implications for future planning and policy.  A major portion of our BAP funds from the ODA goes on projects and programmes in our four priority countries in Africa, namely, Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and the Sudan.  The <Col N="791" /> NGOs take up approximately 16 per cent of that funds, which situation is paralleled in other European states.  The committee express a view that this balance should be maintained.</P>
    <P>The NGO's who were invitees of the committee and had an opportunity to participate and to make their views known, expressed concern about the absence of criteria or guidelines for selecting projects.  There is a feeling, on reading the report that structures are badly needed in this area.  At present, the Department of Foreign Affairs guidelines for co-financing projects limit its assistance to capital and equipment. They do not allow for the recurring costs involved in funding personnel.  This creates problems, particularly for missionary NGO's where the work in health or in adult education is personnel-intensive, and where workers leave relatively well-paid salaried positions in the west to become volunteers.  The report requests the Department of Foreign Affairs to have a fresh look at this.  The committee would appear to be generally sympathetic towards that problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge spoke about our advantages of scale.  The committee in their report come down firmly in favour of a `small is beautiful' type of approach to our development education and activity. They make the point that, for a relatively small amount of funding of, for example, a food nutrition centre or a creche the benefits to the local community can be enormous and have lasting significance. In the Third World countries, I have seen what tremendous achievement can be got from small amounts of money and how very significant this type of micro-project is on the ground.  On the other hand, the report does not overlook more major projects which may, from time to time, get into difficulties and become ailing. Sometimes such projects need just a one-off injection of funds to maintain viability.  An example of such a project is given in the report.  It is the carpet factory in the Kilosa region of Tanzania.  The committee felt that this type of request should not be brushed aside but that it <Col N="792" /> should be viewed sympathetically.  Sometimes a change of direction or diversification or an appeal for funds on the multilateral side could be considered as a way of saving what might be a vital industry in a region affecting the economic lives of several hundreds of people.</P>
    <P>The committee, in their report, affirm that our choice of four priority countries, with a similar colonial, historical and language background was a good one.  Questions are raised &mdash; and I am interested in this &mdash; as to whether, funds permitting, we should look at other possibilities.  I favour extending our scope beyond Africa.  I support the suggestions which, I understand, were made by Concern and Trocaire who were invitees of the committee that we should go into India or even Bangladesh where we find some of the poorest regions in the entire world. If our programme and our policies are to be poverty-oriented, then it makes perfect sense that these are the regions that we could consider going into.</P>
    <P>Interest was also expressed in the course of the report in going into Latin America.  The Worker's Party made a submission which suggested that we should perhaps consider an involvement with the non-aligned countries.  I support this.  India, Bangladesh, Latin America or indeed, the non-aligned countries would underline and underscore the two pillars of this report &mdash; the one being that we must be poverty-oriented and the second being that political affiliation or political involvement should not mean that we must discount considerations of getting involved in these countries.</P>
    <P>The committee, in their report, express the wish that with the likelihood of increased funding it should be possible to designate a further priority country.  It gives the date of 1987 by which we might consider this, this country, of course, to be outside Africa.  However, it is careful to state that our existing commitment to our four priority countries should be maintained, intact and undisturbed.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 60, I was interested to see the breakdown in the sectors in our BAP programme.  It is quite predictable <Col N="793" /> that the rural, agricultural sector should head the list with 39 per cent of funding. This was followed in turn by education, 33 per cent of funding; infrastructure, 10 per cent; industry and trade, 7 per cent; and amazingly, health, only 5 per cent. This is really surprising.  It was very useful for me to read it.  I cannot quite understand it because in any poverty-oriented programme, I feel that health must be a key element.  We know that in this country we have an over-supply of medical graduates.  We have an over-supply of nursing graduates and of paramedical graduates.  I cannot understand why we are not able to get in place systems which would allow these people to utilise their training in an overseas situation under the aegis or umbrella of our bilateral aid programme.</P>
    <P>I would also say that we have to remind ourselves that much of this work in developing countries is not &ldquo;high tech&rdquo; work.  It is in the area of primary health care and preventive medicine.  We have so much expertise which could so easily and with encouragement be made available.  I would love to see that when we next <Col N="794" /> get a report from the development co-operation division or from the committee that this mere 5 per cent health funding would have gone way up the scale and that it would be, perhaps, second or third after the agriculture and education inputs.  I feel that it is really necessary.</P>
