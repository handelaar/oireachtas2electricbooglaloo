      <P>I have notice from Senator Rory Kiely, that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need to extend the Maigue drainage scheme, County Limerick, to tributaries which have not yet been approved of by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to allow local authorities, as an executive function, to deploy a greater proportion of the national road grant, to the repair and renewal of the minor roads (county roads) network.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Séamus de Brún of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Communications to ascertain in the public <Col N="1342" /> interest CIE policy on the use of the Irish language in their services in view of the recent expulsion from a Cork-bound train of an Irish-speaking student allegedly on the grounds of refusing to give her name in English and its implications for future users of CIE services.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Kiely and Connor as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I regret I have to rule that the matter raised by Senator de Brún is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.  I have selected Senator Kiely's matter for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at 4.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senator Connor may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>In regard to the motion that I submitted, I accept your ruling but I would like to put on record that I believe it is both ironic and disappointing that this House in a few moments should proceed to discuss a matter relating to the promotion of Irish within and without the Houses of the Oireachtas in view of the fact that an incident such as I have mentioned in my motion should occur, that is, that a young student on a Cork-bound train should be expelled or compelled to leave the train at Mallow station because, it is alleged, she refused to give her name in English&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be remiss of me, as Deputy Leader of the House, even if I am going to be ruled out of order, if I did not agree with everything that Senator de Brún has said.  This House should condemn the action.  I am sorry if I am being out of order but it is Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Ferris, as Deputy Leader of the House you might put down a motion and we can discuss it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should express an opinion about it and I am expressing it as Deputy Leader of the House.  The Order of Business today is Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  I suggest we suspend the sitting for lunch from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. and if no new motion is started after 4.30 p.m. we should conclude at that time.  In other words, we will not take new business after 4.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Item No. 36 on the Order of Business, this is a motion in my name and in the names of Senator Cassidy and Senator Michael Lynch.  While I cannot say it is a critically urgent matter, it is in relation to the Gaming and Lotteries Acts and I understand that RTE have a problem at the moment, that An Post are losing out and that many many thousands of people are suffering as regards enjoyment.  In the ordinary way it would be a long time before this motion comes before the House.  I believe a simple amendment would be a rather innocuous operation for this House and I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would consider introducing such an amendment.  I believe he can do this since the legislation has been inaugrated in this House.  Seeing that this is a matter about which there will be no objection, I would ask the <Col N="1344" /> acting leader if he would consider bringing forward an amendment at a very early date to get over this anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it No. 36 is a Fianna Fáil Private Members motion and could be taken by arrangement with the Whips on the next sitting day if the Fianna Fáil Members so wish.  Next week is the Private Members' Time of the Labour Party and we are taking No. 30, which is not an unrelated matter.  Indeed, it might be possible in the discussion on the Labour Party motion on credit to raise the matter referred to by Senator Fitzsimons. However, in view of his last remarks, I will communicate his views to the Minister for Justice to see if it would be appropriate to legislate in the way that Senator Fitzsimons suggested and if, in fact, the Minister would bring forward legislation in that area.  If that does not happen I take it that it would be the next resolution that would be taken in Private Members' Time.  Number 30 is next week and that is the Labour Party.  I think that is the only question on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal go díreach a rá faoin Tuarascáil seo ó Chomhchoiste na Gaeilge.  Sa chéad dul síos tá sliocht anseo as an chéad leathanach den tuarascáil dheireannach de Choimisún um Athbheocan na Gaeilge. Is fíor an méid atá ann nuair a deir sé muna bhfuil an gradam atá ag dul don Ghaeilge á thabhairt ag Tithe an Oireachtais gur ait ar fad an rud sin.  Má táimid fá choinne an Ghaeilge a chur Chun cínn agus í a athbheochaint agus más é sin polasaí an Stáit agus polasaí na bpáirtithe uilig sa tír, réitím leis an méid atá sa sliocht seo go bhfuil sé fíor-riachtanach go mbeadh sampla á thabhairt ag na polaiteoirí iad féin agus na páirtithe.  Leis an fhírinne a rá, agus ní maith liom go gcaithfidh mé é seo a rá, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an sampla sin a thabhairt ins an pharlaimint. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil an locht go hiomlán ar na polaiteoirí gur mhaith leo a bheith ag caint as Gaeilge.  Tá rud amháin go mór mhór a chuireann isteach air sin, is é sin go bhfuil mí-bhuntáiste ag baint le a bheith ag caint nó ag déanamh óráide sa Seanad nó sa Dáil as Gaeilge.  Is é sin má tá rud tábhachtach le rá agat ar ábhar ar bith agus má deireann tú é i nGaeilge féadann tú bheith cinnte nach bhfeicfidh tú focal de sna nuachtáin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam gur cóir an locht a chur go hiomlán ar lucht an Phreas.  Is cóir an locht a chur ar na Rialtais a bhí againn leis na blianta.  Dá mbeadh aistriúchán láithreach ar fáil do dhaoine a bhí ag caint as Gaeilge agus an t-aistriúchán go Béarla ar fáil do lucht an Phreas is cinnte ansin go mbeadh siad ábalta scríobh sna nuachtáin faoin méid a bhí le <Col N="1346" /> rá ag na polaiteoirí.  Ach tá a fhios ag an saol nach maith le polaiteoir ar bith a bheith ag caint agus a fhios aige nach bhfuil duine ar bith ag éisteacht leis taobh amuigh den Teach agus nach bhfuil poiblíocht ar bith le fáil aige nó nach bhfuil na smaointe atá aige ag fáil poiblíochta. Mar sin tá mí-bhuntáistí ag baint le bheith ag caint i nGaeilge san Teach seo nó sa Dáil agus ba chóir sin a chur ina cheart chomh luath agus is féidir má tá na páirtithe agus an Rialtas i ndáiríre faoin Ghaeilge a bheith á úsáid go fairsing sna Tithe seo.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam féin, mar shampla, Teachtaí nó Seanadóirí ón Ghaeltacht go bhfuil sé chomh furasta acusan bheith ag caint i nGaeilge agus a bheadh sé bheith ag caint i mBéarla.  Is fearr liomsa labhairt i nGaeilge.  Tá sé níos nádúrtha dom a bheith ag labhairt Gaeilge.  B'éigean dom mo chuid Beárla a fhoghlaim nuair a bhí mé ceithre bliana d'aois.  Ach tá a fhios agam fosta dá ndéarfainn iomlán a bhfuil le rá agam anseo i nGaeilge nach mbeadh seans agam na smaointe sin a chur os comhair mhuintir na tíre mar nach mbeadh sé sna nuachtáin.  Sin an pointe is tábhachtaí, is dóigh liom.  Ciallaíonn sé, má táimid i ndáiríre faoi úsáid na Gaeilge go gcaithfimid airgead a chur ar fáil faoi choinne áis an aistriúcháin láithrigh sa dóigh go dtig le daoine an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus go mbeadh cothromaíocht ag Seanadóirí agus Teachtaí a labhraíonn i nGaeilge le lucht an Bhéarla.</P>
    <P>Tá cúpla pointe eile anseo sa tuarascáil. Sílim gur iontach ar fad an rud é go bhfuilimid ag caint anois, 65 bliain i ndiaidh an Stát a chur ar bun, ar chomharthaí a chur i nGaeilge san fhoirgneamh seo.  Cinnte gur chóir go mbeadh sé sin déanta ó thús.  Tá sé iontach ar fad go raibh comharthaí i mBéarla agus nach raibh siad i nGaeilge sa Teach.  I dTuaisceart na hÉireann tá dlí ann atá ag caitheamh anuas ar an Ghaeilge.  Tá sé mídhleathach ainmneacha sráide a chur sa Ghaeilge.  Sin polasaí diúltach don Ghaeilge, ach anseo i Stát go bhfuil sé de bhun-pholasaí againn an Ghaeilge a athbheochaint agus a chur chun cinn agus <Col N="1347" /> san Teach ina bhfuil an Rialtas féin in a shuí, tar éis 65 bliain táimid ag cur chun tosaigh an smaoineamh gur cóir na comharthaí a bheith i nGaeilge chomh maith le i mBéarla.  Sílim go ndeireann sé sin cuid mhór faoin toil a bhí ag polaiteoirí i dtaobh na Gaeilge leis na blianta. B'fhéidir go ndearnadh barraíocht cainte faoi agus nach ndearnadh go leor gnímh air.  San am céanna, fáiltim roimhe go bhfuil sé againn anois agus go bhfuil na comharthaí sin thuas i nGaeilge le tamall.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil mórán eile tábhachtach a thig liom a rá san am atá i láthair.  Ba mhaith liom dul chun cinn a fheiceáil ó thaobh an aistriúcháin láithrigh. Ó tharla go bhfuil an tAire sa Teach ba mhaith liom a rá, an uair dheireannach a labhair mé anseo ar phlean gníomhaíochta Bhord na Gaeilge dúirt mé gur mhaith liom go mbeadh iriseoir ó Raidió na Gaeltachta lonnaithe sa Tuaisceart le freastal a dhéanamh ar Ghaeltacht an Tuaiscirt, agus tá Gaeltacht an-fhairsing sa Tuaisceart anois, Gaeltacht atá ag fás. Tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil duine ceapaithe anois i mBéal Feirsde le gníomhú ar son Raidió na Gaeltachta mar iriseoir do Ghaeltacht an Tuaiscirt.  Fáiltím roimhe sin agus ba mhaith liom buíochas a thabhairt don Aire ar a shon.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil sé le bheith ann go fad-téarmach. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil sé ann san am atá i láthair ach mar thriail sa ghearrthéarma, ach tá súil agam go mbeidh an post fad-téarmach ann agus cuideoidh sé go mór le Gaeilgeoirí an Tuaiscirt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil sé de phribhléid agam labhairt ar an rún tábhachtach seo atá os ár gcomhair inniu, is é sin ná:</P>
      <P>Go dtugann Seanad Éireann dá aire an Tuarascáil ón gComhchoiste don Ghaeilge &mdash; An Chéad Tuarascáil i dtaobh úsáid na Gaeilge a leathadh in imeachtaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid agus i dtimpeallacht na dTithe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Toisc gur Seanadóir mé ó cheantar Gaeltachta Baile Mhúirne-Cúil Aodha, tá suim faoi leith agam i leathadh na Gaeilge ní hamháin i dTithe an Oireachtais ach <Col N="1348" /> sa tír go hiomlán.  Ba chóir dúinn smaoineamh gurb í an Ghaeilge ár dteanga náisiúnta agus go mba chóir dúinn mar Sheanadóirí spreagadh a thabhairt don daonra go hiomlán.  Réitím go hiomlán leis an gcuid sin den tuarascáil den Choimisiún Um Athbheochaint na Gaeilge a foilsíodh i Mí Eanáir 1965, in ar dúradh go mbeadh sé mar chabhair mhór do mhuintir na hÉireann dá mbeadh níos mó Gaeilge á úsáid againn in imeachtaí i dTithe an Oireachtais agus go mbraitheann tábhacht na teanga i súile an phobail ar chomh dáiríre agus atáimid i leith na teanga.</P>
    <P>Is cúis bhróin dom nuair a smaoiním ar an méid dul chun chinn atá déanta againn i dTithe an Oireachtais ón uair a foilsíodh an tuarascáil seo sa bhliain 1965. An gcloistear daoine ag caint i nGaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais go minic?  Is oth liom a rá gur beag Gaeilge atá le cloisteáil i dTithe an Oireachtais.  Rud a chuireann isteach orm níos mó ná aon rud eile ná go bhfuil go leor Gaeilge ag a lán de na Teachtaí Dála agus ag na Seanadóirí chun beagán Gaeilge a labhairt ó am go chéile ach is beag duine a dheineann é.  Ceann de na cúiseanna atá leis seo, ceapaim féin, ná nach bhfuil atmaisféar na Gaeilge le braith i dTithe an Oireachtais.  Mar sin réitím go hiomlán leis an moladh go mba chóir go mbeadh níos mó fógraí as Gaeilge le feiceáil i dTithe an Oireachtais &mdash; is é sin fógraí ar na doirsí éagsúla, ar na fallaí, agus molaim chomh maith go mbeadh fógraí den tsórt &ldquo;Labhair Gaeilge&rdquo;, &ldquo;Gaeilge OK&rdquo; etc. le feiceáil go soiléir in áiteanna tábhachtacha ar fud Tithe an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán rudaí ar siúl ag muintir na Gaeltachta chun spreagadh a thabhairt dár dteanga náisiúnta.  Tógfaidh mé i dtosach comórtas peile na Gaeltachta. Ar eagla go mbeadh éinne ann nach dtuigeann cad atá i gceist agam léireoidh mé díobh.  Seo comórtas a eagraítear idir na Gaeltachtaí éagsúla, is é sin ná go mbíonn ionad an chomórtais sna Gaeltachtaí éagsúla gach bliain.  Tógann siad foirne éagsúla &mdash; peil, liathróid láimhe, cailín Gaelach, ceol agus a lán eile de ghnéithe cultúrtha atá sa Ghaeltacht leo go dtí an comórtas seo.  Bíonn deireadh <Col N="1349" /> seachtaine iontach acu.  Téim ann gach bliain gan teip agus ní labhraítear aon Bhéarla &mdash; ní bhíonn le cloisteáil ann ach ceol, Gaeilge &mdash; agus craic &mdash; an deireadh seachtaine ar fad.  Dá bhféadfaimís anseo i dTithe an Oireachtais sampla na ndaoine seo a thógaint agus rud éigin cinnte a dhéanamh do chás na Gaeilge &mdash; seachtain na Gaeilge nó fiú an rud a mholtar san tuarascáil seo &mdash; is é sin na treoracha agus orduithe etc. a thugtar sa dá Theach a thabhairt trí Ghaeilge, ceapaim go mbeadh sé mar spreagadh do mhuintir na hEireann breis Gaeilge a úsáid in áiteanna poiblí agus an dearcadh ceart a bheith acu i leith ár dteanga náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Maidir le hobair Údarás na Gaeltachta caithfidh mé ar an gcéad dul síos moladh a thabhairt dóibh don obair atá ar siúl acu do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá roinnt mhaith airgid curtha ar fáil acu do fhostóirí na Gaeltachta chun postanna a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Deineann siad siúd a ngnó go léir trí mheán na Gaeilge cé go mbíonn siad ag deileáil le daoine thar lear.  Éiríonn leo a ngnó go léir a dhéanamh agus is beag duine a chuala mé ag gearán futhu.  B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn anseo i dTithe an Oireachtais sampla a thógaínt uathu agus níos mó Gaeilge a úsáid in ár gcuid ghnó.  Más féidir leo sin cruinniú a bheith acu trí mheán na Gaeilge, cén fáth nach féidir linn cruinniú a bheith againn ó am go chéile trí mheán na Gaeilge?  Ceapaim gur chóir dúinn rud den tsórt seo a dhéanamh mar is cinnte go dtabharfadh sé spreagadh do mhuintir na hÉireann an tábhacht ará ag an Ghaeilge a fheiceáil.</P>
    <P>Dream eile atá ag déanamh obair mhór do chás na Gaeilge ná Bord na Gaeilge. Ba mhaith liom iad seo a mholadh go hard as an iarracht atá déanta acu muintir na hÉireann a spreagadh chun ár dteanga dhúchais a labhairt.  Ón staidéar atá déanta agam ar thuarascáil 1984-85, feictear dom go bhfuil roinnt moltaí déanta acu agus ceapaim go mba chóir dúinn tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh iontu.</P>
    <P>Mar atá ráite ag an Teachta Gemma Hussey, iar-Aire Oideachais, san tuarascáil sin, tá tacaíocht na Roinne tuillte ag Bord na Gaeilge sna hiarrachtaí atá á <Col N="1350" /> ndéanamh acu staid na Gaeilge a láidriú sna scoileanna agus ar fud na tíre i gcoitinne. Tá a fhios againn go léir anseo na deacrachtaí atá ag daoine go dteastaíonn uathu a gcuid ghnó a dhéanamh leis na Ranna Stáit éagsúla trí mheán na Gaeilge.  Baineann an scéal seo ní hamháin le muintir na Gaeltachta ach le muintir na tíre go léir.  Tá sé molta ag Bord na Gaeilge go mbeadh seirbhís trí Ghaeilge le fáil ag na daoine go dteastaíonn uathu úsáid a bhaint aisti.</P>
    <P>Molaim go láidir go ndéanfaí iarracht láithreach go mbeadh an tseirbhís seo le fáil do Ghaelgeoirí na hÉireann.  Mar sin réitím go hiomlán faoi litreacha a chur chuig na hAoiarí as na páirtithe éagsúla ag iarraidh orthu a n-aird a dhíriú ar cheist na Gaeilge agus faoin teanga a úsáid go forleathan i dTithe an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom chomh maith cúpla focal a rá faoi mholadh eile atá déanta ag an chomhchoiste, is é sin go gcuirfí ar fáil i Leabharlann an Oireachtais breis leabhar Gaeilge agus irisí, etc. do na Baill.  Ceapaim go bhfuil an moladh seo an-tábhachtach ar fad.  Is minic atá sé ráite agam le Seanadóirí agus Teachtaí Dála eile an laghad leabhar atá le fáil san Leabharlann chéanna.  Cuireann sé díomá orm dul isteach sa Leabharlann agus leabhar éigin tagthartha trí Ghaeilge á lorg agam agus a fháil amach nach bhfuil sé sa Leabharlann.</P>
    <P>Ceapaim go bhfuil tus áite tugtha don Bhéarla anseo agus is mór an trua é.  Níl a gceart á fháil ag Seanadóirí ná Teachtaí Dála go dteastaíonn uathu úsáid a bhaint as an nGaeilge.  Ba chóir go mbeadh le fáil ansin i Leabharlann an Oireachtais leabhair Ghaeilge de gach sórt agus chomh maith leis sin gach iris agus paipéar Gaeilge a chuirtear i gcló agus go dtabharfar don Ghaeilge an status atá tuillte aici i Leabharlann an Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Tá áit eile a cheapaim féin gur féidir spreagadh a thabhairt don phobal chun breis tábhachta a thabhairt don Ghaeilge. is é sin trí breis Ghaeilge a úsáid sna meáin chumarsáide, go háirithe sa raidió agus teilifís.  Cuireann sé brón ormsa agus ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta a laghad Gaeilge atá á úsáid ag na daoine seo.  Tá teilifís agus raidió ag gach aon teach sa <Col N="1351" /> tír seo beagnach agus is mór an trua nach ndéantar iarracht Gaeilge a úsáid orthu níos minicí agus níos lú cláracha ó Mheiriceá, Sasana agus áiteanna eile a úsáid. Bhí clár amháin a mheas mé a rinne a lán maitheasa don Ghaeilge agus do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, is é sin &ldquo;Gael Video&rdquo;.  Clár ab ea é seo a bhí bunaithe are shaol, teanga agus cultúr na Gaeltachta.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon tslí níos fearr ann chun an Ghaeilge agus cultúr na Gaeilge a leathadh ar fud na tíre ná trí scannáin atá bunaithe ar shaol na Gaeltachta a bheith le féiceáil ar an dteilifís go rialta.  Dá bhrí sin molaim go mba chóir dúinn anseo brú a chur ar RTE níos mó Gaeilge a úsáid agus an teanga Gaeilge a chur san áit atá tuillte aici ar scáileáin na teilifíse.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom a mholadh do Sheanadóirí má tá moltaí acu le déanamh chun feabhas a chur ar staid na Gaeilge i dtithe an Oireachtais in ainm Dé go ndéanfaidís iad.  Níl aon rud níos tábhachtaí, dar liomsa, ná go mbeadh atmaisféar na Gaeilge le tabhairt faoi deara i dTithe an Oireachtais agus táim cinnte má dheineann gach éinne iarracht dáiríre go n-éireoidh go geal linn.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa focal nó dhó a rá ar an dtuarascáil thábhachtach seo.  Molaim an tuarascáil agus molaim go háirithe na Seanadóirí agus na Teachtaí Dála a bhí páirteach sa chomhchoiste a scríobh an tuarascáil.  Tá sé an-tábhachtach dúinne ceist na Gaeilge a phlé ó am go chéile agus tugann an tuarascáil seo an seans sin dúinn inniu.</P>
      <P>Tá Gaeilge, ar a laghad beagáinín Gaeilge, ag furmhór na ndaoine i dTithe an Oireachtais.  Tá sé sin soiléir.  Tá, im thuairimse féin, Gaeilge ag furmhór mhuintir na tíre seo.  Is dóigh liom gurb í an abairt is tábhachtaí sa tuarascáil ná an abairt seo: &ldquo;Is teanga bheo í an Ghaeilge agus caithfear í a labhairt i dtreo is go mairfidh sí&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí an Seanadóir Rogers ag caint ar maidin agus an Ghaeilge atá aici tá sí chomh hiontach sin go bhfuil díomá ormsa &mdash; is Carmanach mé.  Rugadh is tógadh i Loch Garman mé.  Bhí ormsa an <Col N="1352" /> méid Gaeilge atá agam a fhoghlaim ar scoil.  Caithfidh mé a admháil nach bhfuil an caighdeán Gaeilge agam chomh maith agus d'fhéadfadh sí a bheith ach ní ceantar Gaeltachta Loch Garman cé go bhfuil an-suim ag muintir Loch Garman sa teanga agus i rudaí a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá plean ag Comhairle Chontae Loch Garman chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a fhorbairt i ngnáth-dhíospóireachtaí na comhairle sin.  Tá ar chumas na ndaoine atá ar an gcomhairle focal nó dhó a rá anois is arís i nGaeilge agus tugann an plean atá againne an seans sin dúinn uile.  Ba mhaith liom an plean sin a leathnú amach ar fud na tíre go léir.  Is dóigh liom féin go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach spreagadh de shaghas éigin a thabhairt dúinn chun an Ghaeilge atá againn a úsáid.  Measaim féin nach bhfuil an spreagadh sin ann anois.  Dúirt an Seanadóir Rogers dá mbeadh díospóireacht anseo agus dá n-úsáidfí an Ghaeilge ar ábhar tábhachtach, tá sé soiléir nach mbeadh an díospóireacht sin sna nuachtáin. Tá dualgas ar na nuachtáin agus ar mhuintir raidió agus muintir teilefíse na díospóireachtaí sin a chur ar an dteilifís nó ar an raidió nó sna nuachtáin.  Caithfimid an fhorbairt sin, an spreagadh sin a thabhairt go mbeadh spreagadh againne an Ghaeilge a úsáid sna díospóireachtaí anseo.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom gur mar sin atá an scéal i láthair na huaire.  Aontaím le furmhór na rudaí atá scríofa anseo.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach na gnáth-chomharthaí timpeall na háite seo a bheith i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla.  Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh atmaisféar Gaelach anseo, na gnáth-abairtí a úsáid, mar shampla &ldquo;Go raibh maith agat&rdquo;, comhartharí scríofa ar na doirsí agus mar sin de.  Tá súil agam gur leathnaigh an comhchoiste seo an obaír atá le déanamh acu agus go mbeidh an spreagadh againn go léir an chuid Gaeilge atá againn a úsáid.  Bhí mo chaighdeán féin i bhfad níos fearr cúpla bliain ó shin.  Tá sé beagnach caillte agam ó easpa úsáide.  Ba mhaith liomsa an Ghaeilge a úsáid níos mó ach seans a <Col N="1353" /> bheith agam agus tugann díospóireachtaí mar seo an seans dom anois.</P>
    <P>Tá sé an-tábhachtach an Ghaeilge a úsáid ní amháin ag caint ar ábhar an rúin seo ach i ngnáth-imeachtaí na tíre. Cibé ábhar atá a phlé againn tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh seans ag duine focal nó dhó den Ghaeilge a úsáid tríd an díospóireacht sin.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil an spreagadh sin ann anois.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil fonn ar fhormhór na ndaoine anseo an Ghaeilge a fhorbairt, go bhfuil an-suim acu inti agus tá súil agam go mbainfimid an aidhm seo amach.</P>

      <P>Tá an bunáiste céanna ag baint liomsa agus atá ag baint leis an Seanadóir Howlin mar tá áiteanna i Maigh Eo cosúil le Loch Garman agus cé go bhfuil mé im' chomharsa d'Aire na Gaeltachta, tá an Ghaeilge ar fheabhas aige agus níl ach beagáinín Gaeilge agam. Tá áiteacha i gContae Mhaigh Eo agus níl mórán teangmhála againn le cúrsaí Gaeilge nó leis an dteanga.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom aontú leis an rún agus fáiltím roimh an dtuarascáil.  Na comhaltaí atá ar an gcomhchoiste tá siad go maith agus tá suim faoi leith acu sa teanga.  &ldquo;Tus maith leath na hoibre&rdquo; agus cé go bhfuil an tuarascáil gearr &mdash; níl mórán leathanach inti &mdash; tá na moltaí ann agus tá sé sin an-tábhachtach ar fad.  Ar aon chuma tá siad praiticiúil.  Aontaím leis na tuairimí atá leagtha síos ann go bhfuil sé thar a bheith deacair don ghnáth dhuine suim a bheith acu in úsáid na Gaeilge nó leathadh na Gaeilge nuair is eol dóibh nach n-úsáidtear í sa Teach seo ach corr-uair agus corr-am.  Aontaím chomh maith leis an dtuairim gur teanga bheo í agus go gcaithfear í a labhairt i dtreo is go mairfidh sí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gan amhras, is é príomh-chuspóir an chomhchoiste ná na Baill agus chuile dhuine atá ag obair anseo a mhealladh chun a gcuid Gaeilge a úsáid agus, mar adúirt an Seanadóir Howlin, tá cumas maith Gaeilge ag cuid acu.  Níl aon duine anseo nach bhfuil roinnt Ghaeilge aige, nach bhfuil cúpla focal aige ach trí leisciúlacht nó chúthaileacht níl sí á h-úsáid againn.  Níl daoine á spreagadh agus níl an teanga á leathadh.  Is maith rún den <Col N="1354" /> tsaghas seo mar tugann sé seans dúinn é a phlé agus ár meon a scrúdú.  Ba mhaith liom na ceisteanna mar shuaitheantais, agus Riar na hOibre sa Teach a mholadh. Is léir dúinn go bhfuil an comhchoiste ag déanamh a ndíchill.  Tá siad ag déanamh sár-oibre.  Tá clár agus céimeanna leagtha síos agus leagtha amach acu agus tá dul ar aghaidh agus dul chun cinn maith déanta acu freisin.</P>
    <P>Tá sé deacair don Ghaeilge mar níl sí ag fáil cothrom na Féinne.  Tá sprionlaitheacht forleathan do sheirbhísí trí Ghaeilge.  Tá sé teipithe ar RTÉ a dhualgas i leith na Gaeilge a chomhlíonadh, ach is cúis áthais dúinn go bhfuil Cathaoirleach Bhord na Gaeilge, Seán Ó Tuama, sásta go bhfuil dul chun cinn go maith ag an bplean Gníomh don Ghaeilge a phléamar anseo an bhliain seo caite.</P>
    <P>I was reading a report recently in which references were made by Deputy Dinny McGinley that in the Gaeltacht now bilingualism is a fact of life and there is no question whatever about it that on every occasion we come to monitor the situation of the Irish language we can, in fact, record a receding of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. I do not necessarily think, as the Minister agreed with me on the previous occasion that we discussed the situation of the Irish language, that bilingualism is a bad thing or the fact that bilingualism is spreading in the Gaeltacht is a bad thing.  When you are living within a European community where you have a multilingual situation we have got to accept the fact of bilingualism.  Indeed, I would say that we have to encourage bilingualism because, peculiarly enough, it is an area where there is a gross deficiency in relation to our very make-up and that is our inability as a nation to cope with two, three or four languages.  It is one of the things that distinguish us particularly from our brethern within the EC that we have not been able to wrestle with the problem of having equal competence or equal efficiency in the usage of several languages or even two languages.  It is a sad reflection on us that after years of endeavour, after 60 years of intensive timetabling of the language, we have failed manifestly to get across to people <Col N="1355" /> the idea that they have the skills, the ability, the knowledge, they have the folklore and the vocabulary from their school days, but that they do not seem to have the necessary competence or confidence to use it.  I believe that there is a lot of latent language and latent Irish within this House; but, because of laziness on the one hand and reluctance or shyness on the other hand, people are unwilling or unable to use it or to have their Irish sampled by people who have a better knowledge of the language.</P>
    <P>Very often there are a number of the procedures of the House which are carried out bilingually that could be dispensed with.  It astounds me that we accept the fact that we say the prayer first in Irish and then in English.  Surely a prayer with a common sentiment, which is well known and which is something that reflects the attitudes and the general consensus of all of us should be something that would not necessitate a call for translation or instant translation.  I think the prayer as the opening procedure of the House should be done through Irish only.</P>
    <P>We have dwelt on the role of education time and time again.  I do not think there is any use whatever in blaming the teachers. The teachers do their job exceptionally well.  Teachers at all levels have done an enormous job in trying to cultivate and nurture the language.  The fact that we have not succeeded in extending the language into the general sphere of everyday activity or dialogue is no reflection on the schools, but it is a reflection on the manner in which the various components of the language are handed down by the Department of Education.  I have said time and time again that there is too much emphasis on grammar; there is too much emphasis on the technicalities of the language, and there is too much emphasis on perfection.  On a previous occasion when we were debating the Irish language here I alluded to the fact that when the English undertook the anglicisation of this country they did not worry about whether the initial, faltering steps were grammatically perfect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> Language is the vehicle of all communication and until such time as we get people using the vocabulary, until such time as we get it accepted as the norm and the medium for oral communication and until such time as we dispense with rigid attitudes in relation to grammar, particularly in relation to the marking system for examinations, I do think that we will make any sizable progress.</P>
    <P>I should like to see another look being given to the composition of Irish for the leaving certificate examination with a greater emphasis on oral Irish.  Perhaps we could have an all-oral leaving certificate, a leaving certificate where the greatest percentage of the marks are devoted towards oral competence.</P>
    <P>Senator Bríd Rogers made a very valuable point.  That is, that when you are talking about the practical usage of the Irish language in this House it is very difficult to motivate people to use the language here when they can expect scant recognition by way of Press coverage. God knows there has been enough reference to the receding role of the Seanad and enough recent attempts to undermine the status of the Seanad &mdash; in my opinion there have been unjustifiable remarks hurled in our direction.  We do not get fair play in relation to daily coverage of the proceedings here.  I would venture to suggest that the level of debate in this House is very often on a much higher plane than that debate that is ongoing at times in the other House.  If one reads the records of the debates one will find that you can very often get in this House a level of debate that transcends and supersedes the ordinary cut and thrust of political competition and that we get a more rational, open and objective analysis of the various items and legislative reports that are brought before both Houses.  I would venture to say that there is a lot of substance in what Senator Rogers says, that if, in fact, we do not get the necessary coverage for the proceedings that are carried on here in English, how can we motivate people to speak in Irish when there is a grave question mark over whether or not the people <Col N="1357" /> who are covering the proceedings of the House have the necessary knowledge of the language to give us the coverage we desire and need so badly.  After all, publicity and Press coverage is the oxygen of any politician and the oxygen of any political system.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that I am not a prophet of doom.  I have mentioned that the language in the Fíor Ghaeltacht has been receding; it has been giving way to bilingualism, but I do not share the view that it is lost.  I believe it is salvagable and I believe that until such time as we can stimulate the national pride and get the right attitude and get people thinking in a proper national perspective we will not save the language.  If we are practical about it, the practical usage of Irish does not motivate people. The obvious competition from French, German and other EC languages is going to pose a considerable threat and until such time as we can stimulate national pride &mdash; and that is the singular and great motivation &mdash; we will not save the language. There are times I despair as to whether the national pride is there or not when I see how we fail so miserably in relation to our litter campaign and our campaign to buy Irish etc. and I wonder if, in fact, the desire is there.</P>
    <P>Is é seo an tríú uair ó tháinig mise isteach sa Teach seo atá rún mar seo os ar gcomhair &mdash; an chaoi ina bhfuil an teanga dhúchais ag dul ar aghaidh.  Le fírinne níl a staid ag feabhsú.  Tá laghdú ar na Gaeilgeoirí sa Ghaeltacht agus níl an dúil chéanna ag an phobal í a labhairt mar a bhí.  Tá an tAire, Bord na Gaeilge agus Roinn na Gaeltachta ag déanamh a ndíchill.  Mar adúirt mé i mBéarla, tá na scoileanna ag déanamh sár-oibre agus níl siad ciontach san laghdú ach oiread. Le blianta anois is iomaí iarracht a rinne na scoileanna leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ach is cúis bhróin dóibh nár éirigh leo níos fearr.  Sílim gur sna bunscoileanna a chuirtear béim ar labhairt na Gaeilge ach sna meánscoileanna is ar scríobhneoireacht agus gramadach is mó a luíonn siad mar gheall ar na scrúduithe agus amannta cuireann an cruatan sin, <Col N="1358" /> cruatan an gramadaí agus cruatan na scríobhneoireachta gráin in ionad grá sna daltaí don teanga.</P>

      <P>Mar atá a fhios ag an Teach dúirt mise an cúpla focal a bhí le rá agam an tseachtain seo caite ach, mar sin féin, ba mhór an trua dá ligfinn an deis seo thart gan, ar a laghad, freagra a thabhairt ar na daoine a labhair anseo maidin inniu agus tá áthas orm búiochas a ghabháil do na daoine sin. Bhí rudaí le rá ag na Seanadóirí Rogers, Kelleher, Howlin agus Séamus Higgins agus seo rud a bhí le rá ag chuile dhuine acu &mdash; gur cheap siad nach raibh poiblíocht le fáil ó na meáin chumarsáide ar aon rud a dúirt siad anseo.  Is mór an trua é sin agus go deimhin, is mór an trua nach mbeadh suim ag meáin chumarsáide na tíre seo i bpoiblíocht a thabhairt faoi labhairt as Gaeilge, ní amháin ar chúrsaí Gaeilge agus ar cheisteanna na Gaeilge féin ach, go deimhin, ar chúrsaí ghinearálta, ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta, ar chúrsaí dlí nó cúrsaí sóisialta á bplé acu.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an tábhacht chéanna ag baint leis an méid atá le rá acu má deireann siad as Gaeilge é is dá n-abraidís i mBéarla é.  B'fhéidir gur ceist aistriúcháin láithreach atá de dhith sa Teach seo. Má sea, tig linn cur chuige sin agus rachaidh mé i dteagmháil leis na h-údaráis anseo féachaint céard is féidir a dhéanamh faoi.  Tá an Teach seo á dheisiú faoi láthair agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil an t-am ceart chun na moltaí seo a chur ós comhair na n-údarás agus beidh mé ag rá leo go raibh Seanadóirí anseo ag iarraidh áis mar seo a chur ar fáil don Seanad.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir a rá gur b'shin í an fhadhb mar tá áis aistriúcháin láithreach sa Dáil féin agus tá an tseirbhís sin ar fáil, ach mar sin féin níl an Ghaeilge á labhairt chomh minic agus ba cheart di a bheith. Tá polaiteoirí sa Dáil chomh maith agus atá sa Seanad agus tá mé cinnte dá mbeadh an phoiblíocht cheart á fáil ag polaiteoirí na Dála chomh maith le polaiteoirí an tSeanaid go mbeadh fonn i bhfad níos mó orthu usáid a bhaint as Gaeilge níos minicí ar chúrsaí ghinearálta atá a bplé sa Teach ó lá go lá.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sin ceann de na gearáin a tháinig <Col N="1359" /> treasna anseo agam maidin inniu agus seachtain sa lá inniu go raibh Seanadóirí faoin dtuairim nach bhfaighidís an phoiblíocht is dual dóibh ar ócáidí den tsaghas seo agus Gaeilge á labhairt acu.  Dúirt an Seanadóir Rogers chomh maith go raibh duine de Raidió na Gaeltachta sa Tuaisceart. Tá agus is maith liom a rá go bhfuil freastal á dhéanamh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ar Ghaeilgeoirí ar fud na tíre. Maidir leis na daoine atá ag dul le raidió agus le theilifís sa Tuaisceart le blianta anuas tá Gaeilge ar a mian ag chuile dhuine acu agus ba mhaith liom treaslú leo as ucht atá á dhénamh acu.  Tá an dá theangachas acu go pras agus níl aon fhadhb ansin ach, mar sin féin, is maith an rud go bhfuil Raidió na Gaeltachta féin sáite anois sa rud seo agus go bhfuil tuairisceoir acu ar bhun laethiúil más gá.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Kelleher nach raibh atmaisféar an Tí i gceart agus rinne an Seanadóir Howlin tagairt don rud céanna.  Maidir le h-aitmaisféar, níl an t-atmaisféar ceart le Gaeilge a úsáid.  Is dócha gur féidir linn é sin a rá ach níl an t-atmaisféar ceart taobh amuigh den Teach ach amháin sa Ghaeltacht mar a bhfuil an timpeallacht a bhaineann le h-úsáid na teanga.  Is muid féin a chruthaionn an t-atmaisféar agus má táimid sásta Gaeilge a labhairt anseo crothóimid an t-atmaisféar ceart le go mbeidh an Ghaeilge á úsáid i bhfad níos minicí.</P>
    <P>Ag éisteacht le Seanadóirí anseo an tseachtain seo caite agus arís maidin, inniu, ní fheicim aon chúis ar bith nach mbeadh i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge á h-úsáid mar chuile dhuine a labhair maidin inniu tá Gaeilge ar a mian acu.  Dúirt an Seanadóir Howlin chomh maith go raibh cineál díomá air go raibh air labhairt tar éis duine cosúil leis an Seanadóir Bríd Rogers.  Sin rud a chloisim go minic agus daoine ag cur a dtuairimí ar aghaidh, go bhfuil faitíos orthu, go bhfuil díomá nó náire orthu nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar chaighdeán comh h-ard agus atá ag daoine eile agus go mb'fhéidir go mbeadh daoine ag magadh futhu.  Ní dóigh liom go dtógfadh an Seanadóir Rogers orm é nuair a deirim go bhfuil Gaeilge iontach <Col N="1360" /> aici toisc gur tógadh le Gaeilge í.  Is cainteoir ó dhúchas í an Seanadóir Bríd Rogers agus ní féidir, cur i gcás fear as Loch Garman a chur i gcomparáid leis sin.  Ach ag éisteacht leis an Seanadóir Brendan Howlin, ní dóigh liom gur ceart dó aon imní nó náire a bheith air mar, chomh fada agus a fheicimse, cibé áit a fuair sé an Gaeilge tá an-Ghaeilge go deo aige.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Higgins an rud céanna, go raibh áiteanna i gContae Mhaigh Eo agus, go deimhin an chuid is mó de, nach gcloisfeá focal Gaeilge ó mhaidin go hoíche, ach mar sin féin tá Gaeilge ar a mhian aige féin mar a thaispeanann sé go minic sa Teach seo.  Nuair a bhíonn ceist á plé i nGaeilge, glacann sé páirt san díospóireacht.  Ní gá dó siúd, agus tá mé cinnte nach bhfuil, aon díomá nó náire nó imní a bheith air.  Tá sé ábalta seasamh agus labhairt go pras i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla agus go deimhin sa bhFraincis dá gcuirfí chuige é.  Sin ceist eile.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Seanadóir Higgins faoin dhátheangachas.  Bhain sé úsáid as dhá fhocal: Dúirt sé go raibh leisciúlacht nó cúthail orthu Gaeilge a labhairt b'fhéidir, meascán den dá theanga.  Sin rud amháin gur féidir a réiteach, ach maidir le cúthaileacht, sin focal gur bhain sé usáid as agus tá an ceart aige.  Tá daoine cúthaileach in úsáid na Gaeilge agus dúirt mise é seo go minic cheana.  Ceapaim gurb é an fáth atá leis sin ná go gceapann daoine go bhfuil &ldquo;éilitism&rdquo; de shaghas éigin ag baint le daoine a labhraíonn an Ghaeilge agus go mbíonn siad ag breathnú anuas ar dhaoine nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge go pras acu agus ceart ó thaobh na gramadaí de. Bhí sé sin ann agus is cuimhin liom na blianta ó shin nuair a dúirt mé go poiblí nach raibh aon mholadh ag dul do dhaoine cosúil leis sin.</P>
    <P>Má tá &ldquo;elitist&rdquo; ann ag breathnú anuas ar dhaoine atá ag déanamh i bhfad níos mó ó thaobh pearsanta de agus ag déanamh a ndíchill agus ag cur i bhfad níos mó isteach san méid atá acu, níl aon mholadh ag dul do dhuine Gaeilge a bheith go pras aige má tógadh le Gaeilge é, más ón Ghaeltacht é agus más í an Ghaeilge a theanga teaghlaigh.  Níl aon <Col N="1361" /> mholadh ag dul dó a bheith in ann Gaeilge mhaith a labhairt.  Ach duine ón Ghalltacht a shuígh síos agus a d'fhoghlaim an teanga mar dara theanga, sin duine go bhfuil moladh ag dul dó, fiú amháin muna bhfuil an Ghaeilge go pras aige.  Agus aontaím in iomlán leis an Seanadóir Higgins go raibh, san am a chuaigh thart go háirithe, an iomarca béime ar ghramadach agus ar phointí teicniciúla a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge agus gur chuir sé sin ísle brí agus díomá ar dhaoine a bhí ag déanamh an-iarracht go deo an Ghaeilge a labhaiart agus Gaeilge labhartha a bheith acu ach nach raibh siad in ann an ghramadach a láimhseáil.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go bhfuil an ceart aige, go mba cheart dúinn díriú ar scrúduithe nach mbeidh iontu ach Gaeilge labhartha amháin agus gan aon taobh scríbhinne iontu chor ar bith.  B'fhéidir go gcuirfeadh sé sin le dul chun chinn na Gaeilge.  Is rud é go mba cheart dúinn smaoineamh air agus triail a bhaint as b'fhéidir.</P>
    <P>Dúirt sé chomh maith i gcomhthéacs an EC agus i gcomhthéacs an Chomhmhairgaidh agus áiteanna eile, go bhfuil mórtas náisiúnta agus mórtas cine ag baint le bheith ábalta teangacha eile a fhoghlaim agus a labhairt, is é sin dhátheangachas nó trítheangachas a bheith agat, agus in áiteanna eile san Eoraip tá ceithretheangachas ar a laghad ag cuid de na daoine.</P>
    <P>Is oiléan muidne.  Tá deacrachtaí faoi leith againn agus sin é an fáth nach bhfuil an gnáth thraidisiún sin againn go bhfuilimid scartha amach ó Mór Roinn na hEorpa.  Feicimid daoine san Eilbhéis agus san Bheilg agus áiteanna eile mar sin, áiteanna go bhfuil an Ghearmáinis, an Fhraincis agus teangacha eile.  Tá siad ábalta trí no céithre theanga a fhoghlaim agus a úsáid.  Go bunúsach níl deis againne ach dhá theanga a fhoghlaim anseo agus níl a fhios agam cén fáth a bheadh leisce nó cúthail ar dhaoine a leithéid a dhéanamh.  O thaobh mórtas chine fiú amháin agus go deimhin i gcomhthéacs an Chomhmhargaidh, áit a chloiseann tú daoine ag baint úsáide as a dteanga féin, agus in amanna as mion teangacha, cosúil le muintir Luxembourg <Col N="1362" /> a chuala mise iad ag caint ina dteanga féin fiú amháin nach bhfuil litríocht ag baint leis, is mór an trua dúinn anseo a bhfuil teanga againn atá chomh hársa le stair na tíre féin, a bhfuil litríocht againn ó 1,300 bliain ó shin nach bhfuil an mórtas cine ionainn a chuirfeadh ar ár n-aire muidne agus a thabharfadh uchtacht na teanga ársa sin a fhoghlaim.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Seanadóir Higgins faoi na meáin chumarasáide ó thaobh polaiteora de, nach raibh agus nach mbíonn de gnáth poiblíocht le fáil ó na meáin chumarsáide má labhraíonn tú ar ábhar ar bith as Gaeilge.  Is mór an trua é.  Ag éisteacht le Seanadóirí le dhá lá tá súil agam go dtuigeann na meáin chumarsáide anois go bhfuil formhór mór de Chomhaltaí an Tí seo go bhfuil Gaeilge ar a mian acu, a bhfuil sásta í a labhairt ach an phoiblíocht a fháil as an úsáid a bhaineann siad as.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom arís tréaslú leis na Seanadóirí a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil a lán Seanadóirí eile nach bhfuair an deis toisc go bhfuil siad in áiteanna eile.  Leis an fhírinne a rá chuir caighdeán na Gaeilge a chuala mé anseo agus an méid daoine a bhí in ann an Ghaeilge a labhairt iontas agus bród orm toisc go raibh siad sásta teacht isteach anseo agus a dtuairimí a chur os comhair an phobail as Gaeilge. Dúirt an Seanadóir Higgins nach gá dúinn aon náire a bheith orainn as an dátheangachas agus mar a dúirt mé an tseachtain seo caite sin í an aidhm a bheadh agamsa agus is í an tuairim atá agam le fada, go dtí go mbeimid sa tír seo ábalta an dátheangachas a fhorbairt go dtí pointe gur féidir linn Gaeilge agus Béarla a úsáid go nádúrtha, mar a chualamar sa Teach seo inniu agus an lá deiridh agus go mbeimid in ann an t-athrú a dhéanamh go nádúrtha.  Níl aon big deal ag baint leis, cosúil le fear as an Ghearmáin ag labhairt Fraincise nó <i>vice versa</i>, nó ag labhairt Béarla mar a chloiseann tú go minic ar an Mhór Roinn agus é sin go nádurtha.  Braitheann sé ar an té a bhfuil tú ag caint leis.  Ach an rud seo a bheith ag caint Gaeilge le duine a bhfuil fhios agat nach dtuigeann an Ghaeilge, sin masla agus sin é an cineál élitism a labhraím faoi.  Ní dóigh liom gur cheart é sin. <Col N="1363" /> Braitheann sé ar cé leis a bhfuil tú ag caint, i d'aonar nó ag caint le grúpa ba cheart duit bheith ábalta agus ba cheart do d'éisteoirí a bheith ábalta glacadh leis go bhfuil an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla ann, agus go dtí go mbeimid in ann an dá theanga a úsáid go nádúrtha, sa gnáth shaol, táimid i dtrioblóid.</P>
    <P>Tá dea thoil agus grá don Ghaeilge ansin.  Tá sé sa Teach seo agus is againne atá sé an t-atmaisféar a chruthú agus, é sin déanta, an dea-shampla a thabhairt do na daoine amuigh ansin atá ag breathnú orainn agus ag rá: &ldquo;Ní féidir bheith ag súil go mbainimíd úsáid as an Ghaeilge muna bhfuil na daoine seo atá in ainm is a bheith ag rialadh na tíre, bídis sa Fhreasúra nó sa Rialtas, ag baint úsáid as an teanga.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh agus aontaíodh an cheist.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of Report No. 18 of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities: Processing and Marketing of Agricultural Products.</P>
      <P>This is a very important report and was treated as such by the joint committee who in the first instance charged their sub-committee on agricultural and fisheries matters with the task of preparing an in-depth report on this very important topic.  The joint committee in this report considered the efficiency of the Council regulation that is EC No. 355 of 1977, which was amended in 1984 by Regulation No. 1932 on the common measures to improve the conditions under which agricultural products are processed and marketed in view of criticisms which have been made regarding its operation in Ireland over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on the joint committee on agricultural and fisheries matters are indebted <Col N="1364" /> to our colleagues who undertook this examination.  They devoted a considerable amount of time to it and I want to compliment all of them on the excellence and the quality of this report which certainly pulls no punches.  In addition, the sub-committee had discussions with representatives of the Confederation of Irish Industry, Córas Beostoic agus Feola, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society Limited, the Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Agriculture. It also took into consideration written submissions from those bodies and also from the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and Údarás na Gaeltachta. We in the joint committee wish to thank all the bodies for their assistance and co-operation.</P>
    <P>Regulation No. 355 of 1977 provides grant aid from the European Agricultural and Guidance and Guarantee Fund towards the cost of capital investment projects which are aimed at improving structural efficiency in the processing and marketing of agricultural products, including fish, with a view to improving quality and presentation and thereby opening up new markets and increasing returns, which I suppose is what the entire modernisation of the agricultural industry and the CAP is about.  For the purpose of the regulation, a project means any development involving public, semi-public or private material investment relating to building or equipment; for rationalising or developing storage, market preparation, preservation treatment or processing of agricultural and fish products; improving marketing channels and economic feasibility of new processing techniques on an industrial scale and especially the development of new products, by-products and technologies; energy conservation or removing, recovering and recycling industrial residues or waste in relation to facilities for processing and marketing of agricultural products; harvesting equipment subject to certain conditions if it is an essential element of the project and does not reppresent more than 10 per cent of the total <Col N="1365" /> project.  The type of investments referred to were included in the regulations from 1 January 1985.</P>
    <P>While one would think that the country was familiar with the availability of FEOGA grants there are still considerable numbers of family-based enterprises who go to the trouble of modernising and who sometimes may seek IDA help but unless they ask specifically to have their project considered for FEOGA or EC assistance, the grants are not pushed on them.  I have always looked closely at the operation of the EC directives and of FEOGA in particular.  Our agencies, including the Department of Agriculture and the IDA do not see it as their job to press these services and aids on the ordinary individual or citizen of the State, as compared with the response and <i>modus operandi</i> of some European countries who could be described as being &ldquo;dab hands&rdquo; at milking the system.  For some peculiar reason, our public servants have a great respect for these European funds.  Greater efforts should be made to qualify ordinary Irish entrepreneurs for the 25 per cent FEOGA grant aid on top of the Irish grant, which makes all the difference in establishing a successful project.</P>
    <P>I will give a run down on the kind of regulations that people have to conform to when they get this aid.  To be eligible for FEOGA aid a project must be consistent with the aims and objectives of the EC Common Agricultural Policy. FEOGA funds are directed primarily towards projects which help to guide production in a direction sought by the Common Agricultural Policy, involve the development of new outlets for agricultural products; improve quality of presentation; make better use of by-products; help lighten the burden of intervention; shorten or improve marketing channels; rationalise the methods of processing and assessing products situated in regions which experience difficulty in adjusting to the consequences of the Common Agricultural Policy.  They must relate to agricultural and fish products which are listed in the original regulations of the <Col N="1366" /> Treaty.  However, from last year, in certain cases the commission may decide that projects involving the processing of an annexed product into non-annexed products may be considered for aid under the scheme provided that such products constitute a new important outlet and increase significantly the prospects for disposing of basic products at Community level.</P>
    <P>There was a slight but important change in the administration of FEOGA last year.  If people were to read a document two or three months old or if the new regulation, which is not readily available to the ordinary person, was not made available to them, they could miss that.  So, the message there is that people who have a development should be encouraged by the IDA and the Department of Agriculture to send in an application form and have it vetted.  In most cases the big problem is that we are not even applying and even those who apply do not kill themselves qualifying.</P>
    <P>The projects which qualify for grant aid must be designed to contribute to improving structural efficiency in the processing and marketing of agricultural and fish products.  There is plenty of room in Ireland for countless numbers of projects to qualify under that heading.  Projects should form part of an overall programme for a sector prepared by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry in relation to the fisheries sector.  It should have the approval of the member state which must contribute at least 5 per cent of the cost of the project.  A minimum national grant of 8 per cent, or 16 per cent where the projects are located in disadvantaged areas in the west of Ireland, is necessary to attract the maximum level of EC grant aid which may be provided, up to a maximum of 25 per cent in the eastern half of the country and up to 50 per cent in the disadvantaged area.</P>
    <P>I would like to put a point to the Minister. There is a great differential, amounting to 50 per cent grant level west of the Shannon, but in the last re-designation of disadvantaged areas there are a number of areas east of the Shannon that are <Col N="1367" /> being aided by this Government and by the European Community as being severely disadvantaged.  It is my contention that the projects in those disadvantaged areas should qualify for the maximum 50 per cent grant as well. Otherwise it makes a nonsense of the regulations.</P>
    <P>West of the Shannon was designated for industrial development purposes by the national Government in 1957 and has had the benefit of greater level of grants. From 1 February 1986 many areas, including the Sliabh Bloom region of Laois-Offaly, the lea marshy area in Laois, Carlow and Kilkenny and areas in Wicklow and Limerick have been included in the severely disadvantaged areas, an additional 400,000 acres.  I would like clarification today that those areas qualify for the higher rate of grant. That would make a tremendous difference in those areas by encouraging people to establish industries either specifically to process agricultural produce or to provide service industries for agriculture.</P>
    <P>In my experience of the past ten years the only people who can avail of grant aid, especially for the service sector for agriculture, have been the large co-ops. Many large co-ops are not as efficient as private industry is.  I do not think the ordinary person is getting the appropriate feed-back from the provision of large grants to the co-ops.  There has not been a significant improvement in the spin-off of jobs.  That is something we should look at, although I concede that grant-aid from FEOGA should not be considered as just job creating but should reflect the underlying desire to improve the efficiency of agriculture and agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, farm production projects involving modernisation or rationalisation or development of individual farms are not eligible for consideration under this scheme.  I find that rather confusing. A farmer with 200 cows who decides that instead of selling his milk to a co-op he will instal a small plant and make yoghourt or perhaps, provide school milk <Col N="1368" /> or some by-product of fresh milk, should qualify.  I was surprised that the joint committee found that individual farms are not eligible for consideration under the scheme.  This raises a question mark in my mind because I have had experience of an individual farm being grant-aided for just such a purpose.  The total amount of aid which can be approved in any one year is limited and decisions on whether or not grant aid is given are matters solely for the commission.  The commission makes decisions on applications twice yearly, in June and December. Applications have to be submitted to the EC before the end of December for consideration in June of the following year and before 30 April for consideration in December of the same year.  Over the years unsuccessful applications can be resubmitted or modified and they can get two run-throughs before being finally rejected.</P>
    <P>In this country all applications for aid under these regulations and all subsequent correspondence between the EC Commission and the applicant must be made through the Department of Agriculture. The Department of Agriculture are the grant-aiding agency in respect of only a small number of projects &mdash; those relating to potatoes, eggs and in some cases grain drying in storage.  All non fish projects have to be approved by the Department in order to qualify for grant under the regulation.  In the case of most projects this approval is given prior to a decision by the grant-aiding agency on a national grant.  Here again, there is room for greater co-operation between the Department of Agriculture and the IDA who are the the grant-aiding agency.  The joint committee have produced a table indicating the slow take-up of grant aid in this country.  There should be closer co-operation between the IDA and the Department of Agriculture.  Files move altogether too slowly.  The proof of the pudding is that practically every project which seeks FEOGA grant aid has to be covered by a bridging loan from the banks or the Industrial Credit Company or some other organisations.</P>
    <P>While the EC needs only two or three <Col N="1369" /> months to process these claims, our outfits here can drag them out for a year or a year and a half, or perhaps more. That is not good enough.  I do not say the blame lies entirely with the State but whether they are co-ops or individual firms, people who apply for grant aid should have the application fairly well vetted before it is even submitted.  In the West, in the industrially designated disadvantaged areas, there are county development officers and an office to facilitate people who wish to apply for grants. In the rest of the country there are similar officers, perhaps not with the same powers but performing the same function. We still call them county development officers.  Those officers could provide a service to ensure that applications should be full and complete going in.  If that is the case there should be no delay.</P>
    <P>I find fault with both the IDA and the Department of Agriculture who accept applications and just say: &ldquo;turn them down&rdquo;.  There should be a role here for education by the State; there should be an advisory service.  Field officers of both the IDA and the Department of Agriculture should be available to assist Irish applicants to qualify for the higher grant aid through FEOGA.  The result of a successful application is greater prosperity. It leads to more job opportunity.  It leads to higher exports and to a healthier balance of payments.  I maintain that more could be done by civil servants and by people working in the IDA.  It is difficult to make that criticism and at the same time to have it clearly understood that I want the role of these officers changed. I am not saying they are not doing an excellent job but, as I see it, they perceive their job as vetting the applications.  They should be in there helping applicants to fill in the forms just as you would assist an old age pensioner to fill in a form properly in order to ensure that he would qualify for the pension. The Italians, the French, and the Germans are efficient at doing these things. In other countries very few forms are filled in incorrectly, because they have developed a system which ensures better <Col N="1370" /> utilisation of this service.  The Industrial Development Authority handles the vast majority &mdash; the joint committee found as high as 90 per cent, of all FEOGA applications &mdash; and the balance are being handled by the Department, Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  Applications through the IDA are processed in the following manner.  When a draft application is received by the IDA, a copy is sent to the Department of Agriculture or, where appropriate, to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry. The IDA scrutinise the application and receive comments from the relevant Government Departments.  All suggestions for improvements or modifications of the application are then communicated to the company.  The IDA then prepare a project grant application for the board of IDA, using the FEOGA application as the base document and requesting further information, where appropriate. One cannot find fault with that <i>modus operandi</i> but there are three or four different agencies to be consulted there.</P>
    <P>My contention is that if a small amount of work was done in the beginning, that procedure of going to at least two Departments and going through a couple of semi-State organisations, could be shortened, so that there would be just one trip through.  It would cut out the long delays we have experienced.  It is not as if this was new.  This has been going on for more than 14 years.  We should be able to improve the way we handle these things.  No effort has been made to streamline the system.  I am convinced that the State needs a greater input into the actual compilation of the application. In any one year there are not that many applications.  It should be possible for the relevant Department or for the Industrial Development Authority to provide an extra few people who would fill that void.</P>
    <P>The applicant then submits five copies of the finished application.  The IDA provide confirmation of member states grant aid and forwards four copies of the application to the Department of Agriculture for transmission to Brussels.  The <Col N="1371" /> member state's opinion is provided by the appropriate Government Department.  The bottleneck seems to be in the initial examination where applications take many months too long. The FEOGA division in Brussels acknowledge a receipt of the application, thereby allowing the applicant to proceed with the project.</P>
    <P>IDA personnel travel to Brussels at least twice yearly to discuss the list of applications and to brief FEOGA officials on developments and priorities.  Successful applicants will submit claims for payment to the IDA.  Normally an applicant will only be allowed to claim the grant in three instalments, with the last application amounting to a minimum of 20 per cent of the total approved.  The IDA staff validate the grant claim, carry out an inspection of the relevant assets and transmit the claim to FEOGA for payment.</P>
    <P>In the years 1978 to 1984 grants amounting to £67.6 million were awarded to Irish firms in respect of 275 projects which have stimulated investment of approximately £200 million.  The yearly figures for grants awarded and drawn down were as follows: in 1978, £4.1 million of grants awarded and £2.6 million paid out; 1979, £4.1 million awarded, £2.1 million paid out; in 1980, £9.4 million awarded, £5.7 million paid out; in 1981, £12.2 million awarded, £7 million paid out.  In 1982, £10.9 million awarded, £5.7 million paid out; in 1983, £14.7 million awarded, £2.2 million paid out; in 1984, £12.2 million awarded, £100,000 paid out.  That is a total of £67 million in grants awarded and £25 million paid.  In this period, grants amounting to £2.9 million were either renounced or cancelled for various reasons, such as projects not being proceeded with or proceeded with on a reduced scale.</P>
    <P>Those moneys, we are told were not lost but were recycled and reallocated to other Irish firms.  The figures I have just read our highlights one of the main criticisms of Ireland's use of Regulation 355. A slow &ldquo;draw-down&rdquo; of grant-aid, which is one of the worst in Europe, lessens the <Col N="1372" /> value of grant-aid due to the ravages of inflation and ties up the funds which the joint committee feel could be more usefully allocated to other applicants.</P>
    <P>In their memorandum to the joint committee the Department of Agriculture identified some of the reasons for this situation.  Grants were cancelled or renounced in the case of 11 projects. However, five of the projects were resubmitted in subsequent years and were awarded grants.  Two other firms choose not to claim grants because they did not comply with the terms of the award.  Failure to carry out the full investment programme envisaged apparently happens in a large number of cases.  The main reason for the delay in proceeding with projects &mdash; and this is probably the most important factor &mdash; would appear to be changed economic and agricultural conditions, for example, the reduction in cattle numbers in 1980.  There was also the high cost of borrowing.  Some of the firms who were awarded grant aid subsequently experienced financial difficulties and a number went into receivership. Most of those were bought as ongoing concerns but implementation of the projects was delayed.  Most of the projects aided are large scale and require a number of years to complete.  It should be noted that firms have had five years in which to complete their projects, although I recall reading somewhere that that has been reduced to four years.  It is probable that some firms lodge projects well in advance of the expected date of implementation so that they can plan ahead in the knowledge that a grant will be available.  This is particularly the case where a FEOGA grant is crucial to the project.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission takes two to three months to process claims that do not give rise to queries.  Claims which are badly prepared can take much longer. Although the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Fisheries feel that the take-up of grants is not entirely satisfactory, they point out that there has been an improvement in recent years. For example, only 42 per cent of the grants awarded in 1979 were taken up <Col N="1373" /> three years later, while 56 per cent of the grants awarded in 1981 were taken up within three years.  The Department have assured the joint committee that the vast bulk of projects are being carried out, apart from the cancelled projects.  Only ten projects awarded grants in 1983 have not yet been started.  It should be noted that firms who do not commence work on projects within two years are liable to forfeit the grant unless adequate assurances that the project will be carried out are furnished.</P>
    <P>I have made most of the points that I wanted to make.  Over the past ten years or so, Ireland must have gained sufficient experience to improve the situation and to improve the national efficiency in benefiting from grant-aid.  I do not think it is sufficient for the Department to be satisfied with a take-up of 56 per cent of grants sanctioned over a three year period.  It is inefficient that any project unless, of course, the huge multi-million pound developments, should be dragged on for three, four, five or more years. If the application is designated as being carried out in phases then the grants should be paid accordingly.  Our national experience and record are altogether too low for a country which needs the maximum amount of grant aid.  Successive Ministers for Agriculture from all parties have fought hard and successfully to have Ireland's share of the FEOGA funds maximised.</P>
    <P>When we look at the record, we do not seem to have the capability of utilising and drawing down the funds that are at our disposal.  The slowness must be on the part of the IDA and the Department of Agriculture.  Even in projects which meet the criteria and are finished, most of the applicants are forced to take on bridging finance from the lending agencies, such as the banks or the Industrial Credit Corporation.  That shows a weakness in the entire system.  It takes from the efficiency and the real benefit of a grant if one has to pay 16 per cent or 18 per cent bridging finance on that grant.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice in one or two cases that banks foreclosed on the grant itself.  Not only that, but they pulled the <Col N="1374" /> plug irrespective of whether, after the payment of the grant, the particular project was deemed to be viable.  That is an abuse of the system.  It must be an acute embarrassment not only to the Department or to the IDA but certainly to FEOGA itself.  Steps must be taken to ensure that we do not have a repetition of that kind of development.  There is absolutely no reason why any grant cannot be paid in a maximum of six months after the completion of work.  If the certificate of completion is in before 30 April, it should be paid in the December tranche, or if it is in before the end of the year it should be paid in April. Therefore, the delay period for the payment after the work is completed should only be a matter of months. People are forced to wait for one and a half or two years.  It is important that the Minister should investigate such delays and would ask for the files where there is slow payment.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hegarty, on his new role because he fits into this particular function ideally with responsibility for food as well as his other portfolio.  He may very well be the key to improving the entire situation from here on.</P>
    <P>Greater effort should be made to promote the development of projects that cater for important substitution, especially in the food sector.  The trend nowadays is for specially prepared and cooked meats.  This market seems to be increasing. There is a place for it.  In supermarkets the percentage of prepared foods, whether meats or other foodstuffs, seems to be extremely high.  Therefore, there must be room for import substitution. I contend that most of those industries should qualify for FEOGA grant aid as well.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in his new capacity to take a very deep interest in this branch of agricultural development and food manufacturing.  Very few people who have moved into that area in the past number of years have got any State aid or encouragement.  The only people who reap the benefits are the VAT collectors <Col N="1375" /> and their colleagues.  While they are very necessary, there should be some agency which would give some sort of encouragement. The day is gone when we can sit back and expect some huge multinational to come in to provide jobs for us.  Therefore, I would hedge my bets on the industrial development in this country which will be carried on the backs, once again, of the family or the small entrepreneur. I would hope that it would be clearly the policy of the Department of agriculture and the semi-State organisations to facilitate in every way people who have ideas and who are prepared to put their own money into projects for development, either in the service or the processing sectors.  I hope this will be clearly spelled out.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment members of the Joint Committee for the excellence of this report and for the depth of study they have put into it and for the amount of very interesting statistics and material this report is highlighting, which is all very relevant.  The one underlying factor very clearly emerging from this work is that we are not the most efficient in the Community when it comes to availing of the grant aids that are provided under the Treaty of Rome for the development of our indigenous industries.  Great scope remains here.  Instead of our civil servants setting themselves up as judges of applications, they should have at least a section of their organisation which would be able to help people to apply in such a manner that the entire applications would go through with the minimum of delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hegarty, on the new responsibility which he has been given within the Department.  It is very important that he is here today, listening to the debate on this report.  I know he is a man with vast experience, both as a farmer and as a Deputy representing a rural constituency and also as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, and I am sure he will put the vast experience which <Col N="1376" /> he has gained over the years to very good use for the benefit of all of us.  Food is a very important industry nowadays.  It is important that somebody should have responsibility for the proper presentation and marketing of agricultural products.  I wish the Minister very well in his new responsibility.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that this report is coming here rather late in the day.  The report is dated 31 July, 1985 and it is now 13 March 1986.  Of course, things have changed very rapidly.  It is important that those reports should be discussed as soon as possible after their presentation.  There should not be a time lapse of eight or nine months and in some cases even longer, before those reports are brought to the House for discussion.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Joint Committee for the work they have put into this report and also all the agencies who have made their submissions and whose views are highly valued indeed.  Regulation No. 355 of 1977 has made a very important contribution to our food processing industry and the amending regulation No. 32 of 1984 has broadened and improved the content of the regulation in the right way.  This regulation, No. 355 of 1977, provides grant aid from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund which is known as FEOGA, towards the cost of capital investment projects which are aimed at improving structural efficiency in the processing and marketing of agricultural products, including fish, with a view to improving quality and presentation and thereby opening up new markets and increasing returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the years 1978 to 1984 grants amounting to £67.6 million were awarded to Irish firms in respect of 275 projects which have stimulated investment in agriculture of approximately £200 million. The yearly value of the figures of the grants has been given in this report.  We can see that from 1978 to 1984, as I have said, £67.6 million in grants were awarded of which £25.5 million has been paid out.  In this period also grants amounting to £2.9 million were either renounced or cancelled for various <Col N="1377" /> reasons.  The reasons were that projects were not proceeded with or were reduced in scale.  But, of course, these moneys were not lost, but were reallocated to other Irish firms.  The figures which I have given highlight one of the main criticisms of Ireland's use of this regulation.  This has been referred to by the Joint Committee and it is the slow drawing down of the grant aid which, I believe, is one of the worst in Europe &mdash; second only to Italy according to this report.  This slow draw down lessens the value of the grant aid due to the ravages of inflation and also ties up funds which could be more usefully allocated to other applicants.</P>
    <P>I understand there has been an improvement in the take-up of grants in recent years.  For example, only 42 per cent of the grants awarded in 1972 were taken up three years later, while 56 per cent of the grants awarded in 1981 were taken up within three years.  The vast bulk of the projects are being carried out. Apart from projects cancelled only ten projects awarded grants up to 1983 have not yet been started.  Of course, under the regulations firms have four years in which to complete their projects.  There is a fair amount of time there for firms which have applied for grants.  It gives them that breathing space in order to plan their projects and to get them off the ground.  As long as they do so inside four years they are eligible for the grants.</P>
    <P>The budget provision for 1985 amounts to 242.5 million ECU which represents an increase in the amount of funding available.  Of course, Ireland will get its fair share of this increase.  The higher level of grant aid for the disadvantaged areas is to be commended.  It is a desirable interaction between the common agricultural and social policies of the EC which should act in tandem to maintain the rural social fabric through off-farm processing and marketing employment.  In their submission to the Joint Commitee ICOS made the point that grant aid for the dairy sector, which had been ineligible since the 1 January 1984, should be restored. Indeed, I would agree with this recommendation because the dairy sector has been most efficient in drawing down grant <Col N="1378" /> aid awarded to it.  It also has been very successful in ensuring that the primary producer benefits from the projects, which is one of the fundamental aims of the regulations.</P>
    <P>I would also agree with the Department of Agriculture submission that Ireland should be treated as a special case because of the importance of the dairy industry to our economy and also the need to diversify away from intervention type products.  Indeed, we went through all this before last year on the debate on the super-levy.  Everybody interested in the welfare of the dairy industry was pointing out the importance of this industry to the economy and also, because of the huge stocks of butter and milk products in intervention, that we should be trying to diversify away from those intervention type products.</P>

      <P>I was discussing the importance of getting grants for the dairy industry under this scheme and recommending that the dairy sector, which has been ineligible for grants since January 1984, should be restored and be again acceptable for grant purposes.  I also discussed the importance of the dairy sector diversifying into other areas and the importance of Ireland being treated as a special case because of the significance of the dairy industry to our economy and the great need to diversify from intervention-type products because of the huge stocks that have grown up in intervention over the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note also in the report that the joint committee would favour the granting of member state grants to enable livestock marts to qualify for FEOGA grant aid, which can be up to 50 per cent in disadvantaged areas.  This would improve the quality and range of services provided by marts and also provide, where necessary, increased penning and extra sales rings. This would be very important particularly in the western region where you have large numbers of cattle being offered for sale at the marts that are available.  This <Col N="1379" /> causes a certain amount of hardship both to the livestock involved and, indeed, to the sellers and the buyers because of the long hours involved.  This is an area where we could avail of this type of grant to enable us to improve on that situation.  I hope the Department of Agriculture will pursue that point.  The grants could also be used to provide new marts along the western seaboard not previously serviced by livestock marts.  I think that would be very important for the farmers and for the people involved in that area.</P>
    <P>According to the report, the IDA work very closely with companies receiving aid and give them every assistance they require in formulating claims.  This is very important because the IDA are experienced in that area; they are capable of preparing plans and drawing up a proper applications for those companies and it is important that they advise them.  There is always a large number of applications on stream.  For example, in June 1985 the figure for projects seeking aid amounted to £28 million and these were chasing an actual grant approval figure of just £7 million.  This constant surplus of applications means that there is always a sufficient number of good level projects available to take up Ireland's grant application.  I think that is very good and it shows that agencies and companies are interested and are prepared to put in their applications and chance their luck even though there is only £7 million available and £28 million worth of applications are submitted.  It is better that way rather than not having sufficient applications before Brussels.  We must always understand Brussels has the final decision in these applications, not the Government here; Brussels has the final say.</P>
    <P>In unclaimed amounts we have a bad track record.  The amounts unclaimed seem to be around 24 per cent but this figure is reducing all the time and, of course, the IDA continue to monitor the companies involved.  I hope we will be reducing that figure still further.  There are many reasons why companies cannot reduce this figure and why they cannot <Col N="1380" /> proceed with projects.  They cannot proceed with projects due to changed economic and agricultural conditions and so on.  Naturally, in the early days of the scheme there were some teething problems and faulty applications gave rise to delays in many cases.  I am happy to see that the joint committee are now satisfied that our record is improving although much remains to be done and the committee are hopeful that we will soon be able to equal the performance of the more successful member states in this regard.  That is the way all of us want to see it going.  I am confident that our people here, the firms involved and the agencies such as the IDA and the Department of Agriculture, all the co-ops and so on involved in those applications will become more efficient in dealing with their applications and that we will get our fair share from this fund.</P>

      <P>I would like to compliment the committee on the production of this report.  It is a very comprehensive document raising as it does many aspects of the processing and marketing of agricultural products and related areas as well.  It is appropriate also that we should compliment the outside bodies who contributed so that this report could be compiled, the CII, CBF, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, the Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Agriculture.  With various oral and written submissions from these different bodies it was possible for the committee to put this report together. It deals with the extremely vital area of the agricultural scene at present and that is the processing and marketing of agricultural produce.  For too long we have seen agriculture as something that finished at the farm gate and too many farmers saw it in that light and, unfortunately, some still see it in that way.  It is, in my view, extremely urgent that at this time everybody concerned, whether those involved at self-employment production level, that is at farm level, or people indirectly or directly involved in the processing and marketing side should view the scene of agriculture in its totality <Col N="1381" /> taking production, procesing and marketing together.  It is only if enough emphasis is laid on marketing and enough attention is paid to the entire area of marketing that we are ever going to achieve the sort of results that are so much required in agriculture.  In this House in the past and in other places also the importance of the marketing side of the agricultural business has been stressed.  I believe that while we have made substantial progress with regard to centralised marketing in certain areas of agriculture &mdash; one great example being the marketing of dairy products through An Bord Bainne &mdash; there are vast areas where we have too much fragmentation, too many individual approaches by various bodies and agencies and as a result we are not getting the best advantage from the situation.</P>
      <P>Again on a general point with regard to marketing, I feel that in recent times we have seen intervention as a place to market agricultural produce rather than a place for surplus supplies.  It is very, very important that intervention for whatever product is not seen as anything else but a place for excesses, surpluses and the like.  If we approach marketing in that manner it will make a great difference.</P>
      <P>This report is very comprehensive.  It deals in great detail with the various proposals put forward by the different organisations involved, the farming organisations and others.  I suggest to anybody who has not had an opportunity to do so that they should read the report in depth because there is a lot of extremely useful information in it and it is an informative document and sets out the position very very clearly.  There are a few points in the document that could be very usefully emphasised.  For example, persons who are involved in the agribusiness are not always clear about eligibility for grant purposes.  That is set out quite clearly in that document and one could glean much from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy, as we have mostly perceived it up to now, has been something directly benefiting farmers.  There is the other extremely important dimension to it and that is the <Col N="1382" /> grant aid that it provides for off-farm projects, in other words, for the various areas of processing and marketing that are dealt with and catered for through the FEOGA grant scheme.  For that reason I believe, in fact, that it is very important that we as a nation should take full advantage and avail to the fullest degree possible of the grants that are available to us for the development of our processing and marketing sectors in conjunction with the various aids that our industry and agriculture will get through headage payments and other forms of grants from the EC.  For the project to qualify for a FEOGA grant it must be concerned, of course, with a building or with equipment for improving or developing storage, marketing preparation, preservation, treatment or processing of agricultural products or it may be concerned with improving marketing channels or providing a better knowledge of the facts relating to prices and markets.  This is not always fully realised or fully perceived by people.</P>
    <P>Due to certain surpluses within the EC at present, there are restrictions on the availability of grant aid for certain products notably in the dairying sector and, indeed, also there are possibilities and probabilities of certain changes that may take place in other sectors of over supply. As a general qualification all projects, no matter what they are, must help to improve the situation for the commodity concerned.  This must be proved by the applicant who must also show that the operations will be profitable and will have a lasting economic effect, while not distorting competition.  The selection of projects for investment by the guidance section of FEOGA is based on the basic principle that it must be viable, it must have a lasting effect and it will not be a once off operation.  Then there are various other criteria laid down.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the joint committee prsented us with a very in-depth document.  I do not intend to go through the various observations of the bodies that contributed to it but there are a few points I wish to refer to.  Before I do so there is one extremely important point <Col N="1383" /> which I should make in the context of marketing and, that is, that to my understanding ACOT, which is the body involved in the whole development of agriculture in this country, advising and assisting people in the development of the industry, does not have &mdash; with just one exception &mdash; any marketing specialists. There are five regions and there are approximatley eight specialists in each region.  The only area covered by marketing specialists is the area of horticulture which includes potatoes and general horticulture.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that ACOT, being the agency it is and having regard to its particular role in the development of agriculture, should have at least one marketing specialist in each of the regions throughout the country.  I believe that many of the personnel making up the service that ACOT provides are not market-orientated.  We must change that situation and make sure that the adviser going out to the farm has more of a marketing mentality than he now has.  At present the adviser going out to the farm generally speaking, is more production orientated and to a certain degree perhaps processing-orientated.  Orientation, shall we say, does not in many, many cases extend beyond that and I feel it is absolutely vital that we should have these marketing specialists who would bring about a change in that position.  I recognise that horticulture is being dealt with thus far but I do not think that is sufficient. I urge that point for the consideration of the Minister and I should like to think that it will be taken on board and that something will be done about it.</P>
    <P>The committee say in their report that the EC Regulations 355/77 have made a very vital contribution to the food processing industry and the amending Regulation 1932/84 has broadened and improved the content of the regulation in the right way.  Certain changes have been brought into effect and they are essentially on the following lines: the introduction of the possibility, in connection with projects for the processing of agricultural products, of granting aid for the purchase <Col N="1384" /> of certain equipment for the harvesting of basic products provided that such purchases are profitable to agricultural producers and the costs involved represent only a limited proportion of the investment under the projects concerned and also confirmation of the need to create new and additional outlets for agricultural products by placing particular emphasis on programmes and projects relating to new processing techiques, pilot projects for the development of new products and by products, and for energy-saving and recycling residues.  These are some of the vital matters touched on.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to the slow take-off of the grants.  It is disappointing that there has not been a greater take up of the grants.  The committee said that there are certain improvements in this area but yet we have a long way to go. Sometimes figures do not give a true picture, they can give a distorted image of what is happening.  More can be done if there is a greater rapidity with regard to the development of certain projects. People developing these projects are themselves often responsible for some of these delays.  We know that the IDA are working very closely with the various agencies involved and are trying to expedite the taking up of the various grants and make sure that they cover as many areas as possible.  We know from information the Minister gave to Dáil Éireann on 16 May 1985 that grants amounting to £87 million were awarded to Irish firms under the FEOGA grant scheme in relation to the processing and marketing of agricultural products Regulation 17/64 and 355/77 since 1973.  That is a substantial figure.  On that occasion the Minister also informed the other House that £42 million was taken up by Irish firms so far.  Grants amounting to £8 million had either been renounced or cancelled for various reasons and most of these had been reallocated to Irish firms.  That is extremely encouraging to know&mdash;while they had not been taken up they had been reallocated to other Irish firms.</P>
    <P>Claims for a further £7 million have been lodged recently with the IDA and the EC Commission and should be paid <Col N="1385" /> out shortly.  That left £30 million to be claimed.  There was a large proportion of this related to grants awarded in 1983 and 1984.  The Minister gave these figures in the other House on 16 May 1985; they show that there is a fair uptake in the agricultural sectors of FEOGA grants. There is a long way to go and the potential has not been fully realised.</P>
    <P>There is one specific area of grant which is very much in the minds of the owners and operators of livestock marts and that is the grant aid for livestock mart development.  The necessary prerequisite for qualifying for this grant is 8 per cent of the cost to be supplied by the national Exchequer.  In return, mart enterprises in the western or disadvantaged areas will receive a grant of up to 50 per cent while those outside the disadvantaged areas will receive grants of up to 25 per cent.  I would submit that it is very good business for us to make certain that that grant is not impeded, that it is promoted.  I am satisfied that it is presently being examined by the Department of Agriculture and in due course will be submitted to Brussels.  I believe that this will be of enormous help to the development of livestock marts and in so doing will contribute to the whole area of better hygiene, better control of disease and will have been extremely worth while.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that there are still some areas of the country not serviced by livestock marts.  The project in Cahirciveen in south-west Kerry will depend wholly and exclusively on whether grant aid is available or not.  I am satisfied from talking to various persons involved that in due course &mdash; not too long &mdash; the various steps will have been taken and that grant aid will be available for the development of a livestock mart in Cahirciveen which will cost approximately £220,000 or £230,000 and which can be grant-aided to the tune of 50 per cent, a very significant contribution.  There are other areas throughout the country that need this grant aid, not necessarily for the building of livestock marts but for the re-equipping of them, perhaps the replacing of them, their structures or whatever.  It is an area where aid is much <Col N="1386" /> needed.  Livestock marts are approximately 30 years in existence and could do with a certain amount of improving.  For that reason I hope that these grants will come on stream as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There are various areas where grants will apply.  We know that there has been an effort to extend grant aid for dairying even though in spite of present circumstances it may be very difficult to get this but one would like to think that it would be possible with certain conditions and for certain specific purposes.  That would lead one to the whole question of diversification of production whether it is in the dairying world or elsewhere.  If we can gear ourselves more correctly for the marketplace we can then get a better hearing for various proposals in Brussels. In the case of the various schemes for grant-aiding under the FEOGA scheme, it is not just a matter of the Government or the Department of Agriculture submitting proposals to Brussels and automatically getting approval.  It is scrutinised in very great depth at Brussels level and, unless the scheme can stand on its own two feet, it will not be grant aided. I am confident that the various schemes which are at present being prepared and will be presented in due course by the Department will meet with success.  It would make a great difference because there is nothing that our agricultural industry requires so violently &mdash; violently is the only way to express it &mdash; as finance.</P>
    <P>The agricultural industry is very much undercapitalised and any way that finance, in the form of grants or in the form of reasonably priced credit can be made available, it should be provided, because there is not a fraction of the money in agriculture in the way of capital investment that there ought to be.  We know that there are very positive restrictions on our advancing on the dairying front.  There are very positive restrictions on the horizon with regard to cereals. There are very positive restrictions, unfortunately, appearing on the horizon with regard to beef and sheep meat, the only other major area of production of field enterprise which has a good prospect at the moment but of those four major <Col N="1387" /> field operations it is of the least importance. Unfortunately, we are then left in the position in that, within the framework that exists for us and is available to us, we must get the best possible result, whether it is from dairying, beef, cereals, sheep or whatever else.  If we do not do that, we will not be in the market place at all.</P>
    <P>In the context of our membership of the European Economic Community it is essential that we are regarded in a different light from our other partners in Europe.  If not there is little hope for our economic survival within the framework of the EC.  There is no doubt that when we became a Member of the EC in 1972 we were clearly and positively of the view that we would have unrestricted, unlimited room for the development of our agricultural industry.  Unfortunately, in the first instance with regard to the superlevy of 1983, we have seen the brakes being applied and there are indications of further halting signs.  This, against the background that we joined the EC in the knowledge that our industry would be in severe hardship and was unlikely to be in a position to compete against the various other industrial countries.  We were prepared to a degree to make that sacrifice in the expectation that we would have unlimited potential in our main industry which is agriculture.</P>
    <P>Now, only 14 years later, practically all of our main agricultural enterprises are being put on quota or are threatened to be put on quota.  We must resist any question of quota imposition to the bitter end, to whatever extremes are necessary. We require a derogation in these various areas, whether it is milk, cereals or whatever else.  When we talk about marketing, it is appropriate to mention in regard to the proposed milk cessation scheme, which the EC are planning to implement in the very near future that we must use every influence, power and strength we can command to ensure that does not apply to us.  The proposition to take 3 per cent of our milk production away &mdash; the equivalent of approximately 37 million <Col N="1388" /> gallons &mdash; would be lunacy.  It would be very serious for us as a nation economically and socially because the whole dairying scene is based on farm families.  The farm family constitutes the basis of the whole milk supply industry.  For that reason, any erosion of the hard won superlevy concession we got a few years ago through the good efforts of the Minister, Deputy Deasy, the Ministers of State, Deputy Connaughton and Deputy Hegarty and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, with the help of the Taoiseach, would be very serious.  It would be very serious if we were to lose 3 per cent of that 4.6 per cent which we gained at that time.</P>
    <P>When one talks about percentages in this regard it is important to acknowledge that in 1983 we got a 4.6 per cent concession and we succeeded in having 1981 established as the base year for production as against 1983 which applied to all the other countries.  Taking into account that our production for 1983 was about 15 per cent higher than in 1981 effectively we gained an increase of 20 per cent.  One could ask was that not enough and what is there to complain about, but that was achieved against a background of great underdevelopment.  We were, comparatively speaking, a developing economy and we had a long distance to go and still have a long distance to go in order to develop our agriculture to anything like its full potential.  For that reason, no erosion in that direction can be tolerated.</P>
    <P>We talk a great deal about added value but, unfortunately, we have not done a great deal about it.  Added value in many of our commodities would provide much needed employment and would also help enormously in our balance of payments deficit.  Coupled with that, we must strive to have import substitution.  As far as we can we must produce whatever is possible here at home rather than relying on imports.  This is true in respect of animal feed and food for human consumption. It is hard to quantify figures precisely but one is talking about a sizeable percentage. With the figures at in excess of £800 million for total food imports more than a quarter of that could be replaced by diversification of production here at <Col N="1389" /> home and by producing precisely what the market-place wants, what the housewife wants.  Quite frankly, as I said at the commencement of my remarks, we must never forget in marketing, production or processing that at all times we must be conscious of what the housewife wants.</P>
    <P>We must start at the marketing end and do intensive and extensive market research, ascertaining to the fullest and to the correct degree what preceisely is required and then setting the strands in motion through the processing and production sectors to produce that product, whether is is food for consumption or whether it is some other item or product that is going to be purchased by the housewives whether it is in Dublin, Bonn, London or wherever.</P>
    <P>We must at all times make sure that we gear our whole situation for the market-place and produce to the market-place requirements rather than do it the other way around &mdash; producing products and then making vigorous attempts to sell them to people who have absolutely no interest in buying these products.  We should learn from bitter experience over the years that there is no way that you will sell something on a long term ongoing basis to people, whether it is in the home market or in the foreign markets, unless those people want that particular product. One example we can take is in Saudi Arabia where the McGuckian enterprise went out there and started producing different dairy products.  They ascertained as the time progressed that various products that they produced were not acceptable to the people who were buying them. They eventually geared their production to meet the needs of the customer.  That is the kind of thing that I advocate here. That is the kind of thing a lot of research must go into.</P>
    <P>I will stress again the point I made with regard to ACOT in the context of marketing specialists.  I would say to the Minister that it would be very beneficial to the whole effort of better marketing if we could have the appropriate number of specialists in ACOT, specialists in the marketing world.  I acknowledge very fully that we have specialists in the areas <Col N="1390" /> of horticulture and potatoes, but we do not have any specialists in the other areas. That is an area that would give fantastic results.  It would give this orientation towards marketing which I referred to earlier into the whole situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the committee on an excellent report.  I should like to pay tribute to the various industrial groups and farming organisations that contributed by way of discussion and otherwise to making this report possible. It is, in my view, a document that is well worth everybody's full and complete study.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief contribution.  I come from County Meath, an area which rightly has a reputation in agriculture and in farming.  In an agricultural country this is a very important report.  While it is an agricultural country, and I suppose will always retain that base, there are many factors which mitigate against farming, particularly the climate.  This is one aspect I feel it is very difficult to overcome and which will always be a problem.</P>
      <P>Last week this House discussed the report on the crisis in farming and paid tribute to the efforts of the Government to help in that regard.  The importance of farming was rightly realised by the people outside farming and was on other occasions too &mdash; I recall that in 1947 and 1948, when we had the bad harvest, people from the city came down on buses and lorries to help out.  Everybody understands the importance of farming.  With regard to that crisis last summer, I see farms being sold in County Meath which may not be directly attributed to the summer but it may have been the last straw that broke the camel's back.</P>
      <P>Various reports have told us that in 1928 the proportion of people employed in agriculture compared to the number in industry was 80:20.  This year 1986, it is the reverse, for every 20 in agriculture there are 80 in industry.  This is something that is unacceptable and I believe by incorporating the recommendation in reports such as these we will tend to correct that imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> I was impressed the last day here when Senator Quealy complimented my party on the recent report on horticultural development.  Even though the Minister later had some criticisms of that report, I felt that they were constructive.  I felt overall there was a general tendency, as there should be, to approach this in an all-party way.  I would have to endorse what Senator Hourigan has said with regard to the low base at which we started and plead for a special case.  There are 300 million people in the extended European Community.  It opens up other avenues for us.  Nevertheless, I feel that, having started from that low base, we still have this disadvantage.  I would agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Hourigan in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that farmers are the foundation in all these situations. They have the expertise, the commitment, the dedication.  They have everything that is necessary.  Without that foundation it is impossible to build an edifice.  More could be done in that regard to help the individual farmers at that level.  I understand that this EC directive does not help.</P>
    <P>I also see problems with regard to intensive farming which I believe is around the corner if not with us already. From the recent report on food and research, it seems that, with the advent of intensive farming and certainly with the development of intensive farming, we can do with far less land and I suppose fewer farmers.  In that sense it seems to me that, far from providing more employment in this area, we are moving into a phase where we will have less employment.  I feel at least it would be the creation of wealth which is of primary importance to the country.</P>
    <P>I would also like to say in passing that it seems to me that the co-operatives in this country have expanded very much in recent years.  I have no doubt that this expansion was planned and was necessary in modern times.  The importance of equity capital should be realised with regard to the co-operatives because borrowing charges are too high, money is <Col N="1392" /> too expensive.  When I say this, I am thinking of Bailieboro Co-Op which has problems.  I come from that area and it seems to me that in that situation equity capital is important, or the provision of finance in some other way rather than at the high interest rate which has to be paid at the moment.</P>
    <P>Research is very important for marketing. The position, heretofore, was that farmers produced willy-nilly.  They assumed that there would be a market.  As regards corn and other major crops there was always a market.  I gave details before of many instances, particularly in regard to horticulture, where a market was nonexistent when produce, such as cabbage, peas and tomatoes, were available.  There have always been gluts in the market at a time of high production.  Certainly, there is more required than production. Processing and marketing are of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>All of us in the Oireachtas received literature from Quinnsworth, Power Supermarkets Limited, pointing out steps they had taken in the recent past to improve the position with regard to the sale of Irish produce.  I think I am in order in complimenting that firm and, indeed all firms, individuals, and organisations, who have done anything in that regard. Sometimes the initial effort may not bring the success that is hoped for.  I hope all involved will persevere.  With regard to fresh vegetables that firm has made a great improvement.  For example, with regard to tomatoes the import dependence was reduced from 42 per cent to 29 per cent and for cauliflowers it was reduced from 41 per cent to 19 per cent. Only 2 per cent of potatoes sold were imported and carrots and onions showed no improvement.  The proportion of carrots and onions imported was 17 per cent and 100 per cent respectively.  It is very difficult to understand why it is necessary to import 100 per cent of onions.  With regard to cooking apples, the import level remained at 58 per cent, which seems very high.  In this area, there are many firms trying to improve the situation and they should be complimented and their efforts recognised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> With regard to report No. 18 on the processing and marketing of agricultural products, I should like to join with other Members in complimenting the committee. A number of Members from this House, seven in all, were on that committee and the report was signed by the Acting Chairperson, Senator Mary Robinson.  I would like to have seen in the report a synopsis of the regulation which is a fairly lengthy and complicated one.  I would have liked to have seen the committee include, in the space of a few paragraphs, the important aspects of the regulation.  However, they did that in various ways.</P>
    <P>In the conclusion to the report the Joint Committee, while acknowledging the benefits this country has received under the regulation, feel, nevertheless, that its full potential has not yet been exploited. It seems to me that this is an indictment of the Government.  While we hear criticisms of milking the system, nevertheless, there is an onus on the Government to ensure that we get 100 per cent of what we are entitled to.  This conclusion states, in my view, that we did not get that 100 per cent.  I suppose it is easy to lay blame but I am doing it in a constructive sense. It is very easy to point the finger.  I hope this report will ensure that the Government from now on will take every step and make every effort to see that we get our entitlements.  In fairness to the farmers and to everybody else this should be done.  In so far as we fail, the finger must be pointed clearly at the Government. I know there are procedures which applicants have to go through but it is the responsibility of the Government to bring all those details to the notice of firms and people who might qualify, to give them every opportunity and to help, where necessary, with the processing of applications.  The IDA deal with 90 per cent of these applications and do a wonderful job.  Like other Senators, it is only right that I should pay tribute to them and to the other organisations involved. However, when there is finance available at EC level we are certainly failing if we do not avail of it.</P>
    <P>Various views were put forward by a <Col N="1394" /> number of bodies and it would take a long time to put all of them across.  However, I should like to mention one of them, what is referred to in the report as the opposite to the CAP inspired approach, that of consumer oriented marketing.  The report says that whereas the CAP approach is not, in fact, market management but price management, such price management is totally directed to the price of the raw material to the primary producer with less attention given to the resultant price of the end product to the consumer.  While I would agree basically with that, I believe that the price of the end product is most important and by and large it is going to determine the success of any project.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters which we could develop and, perhaps, be critical of and make suggestions in regard to them.  This is a very good and comprehensive report, like all the other reports we have got.  Once again, I should like to pay tribute to those responsible for the report, not forgetting those who made contributions.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister in the near future will take cognisance of all these suggestions and do whatever is necessary to fall in line with the recommendations of the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have found this report to be extremely interesting and timely.  It deals with an EC Regulation that makes very considerable amounts of aid available twice each year to assist in improving the processing and marketing of our agricultural products. In 1985 the total amount of aid allocated to Irish food processing and marketing projects under the regulation amounted to £17.8 million.  This is a very considerable amount of aid.  It is vitally important that we have a sufficient number of good projects with the EC Commission for each half-yearly allocation so as to ensure that we obtain the full amount of aid available to us and that the aid goes to the most worthwhile projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the Joint Committee, I welcome the changes in the regulation which came <Col N="1395" /> into effect in 1985 removing the rigid application of its benfits to annex II products. I hope that we will have an adequate response to this change from the food processing sector itself in the form of projects for more down stream processing. This is extremely important not alone in the development of more sophisticated and consumer orientated processing but also in relieving pressure on the CAP at this juncture by greater diversification away from intervention commodities. With the constraints now on CAP expenditure the future development of our food processing must lie in this direction in the interests of both the processing and producer sectors.</P>
    <P>I am glad too to see that the persistent question of the low level of take-up of these grants by the Irish processing sector has been thoroughly examined in the report.  It is worth while noting that the real position in this regard is not nearly quite as bad as it has been portrayed and that it is also showing considerable improvement in the most recent years.</P>
    <P>I too share the hopes expressed in the report that the Commission will find itself able to accede to my Department's request to them to permit the admission of dairy projects under the regulation once again.  I believe we have made a good case to them for this and we await the outcome.</P>
    <P>In so far as the report refers to suggestions that Government administration in relation to the food processing sector should be more centralised, you will be aware no doubt that the Government have recently given me a special role to play as a focal point for the industry as between my own Department and the Department of Industry and Commerce. This measure is further evidence of the importance which the Government attach to the development of our food processing industry in the interests of the economy as a whole and in the interest of our farming community.  I look forward to performing this new role and will strive, with the help of and in consultation with the industry itself and the other <Col N="1396" /> bodies involved, to bring a new vitality and urgency to the work of developing this industry towards attaining in so far as possible its full potential.</P>
    <P>As to the position in relation to the grant aiding of livestock marts under the regulation, I can assure the House that this matter is under very active examination in my Department at the moment.  It is a prerequisite under this EC regulation that there must be member state investment in all projects before they can be considered for FEOGA aid.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald mentioned a number of points.  First, he noted the small family type enterprise which might not be aware of the grant aid available from FEOGA.  I find it difficult to understand this because obviously they go to the IDA and the IDA will put them in touch with FEOGA.  On the point of the lapse of time dealing with FEOGA requests, it is a pretty long drawn out process by its very nature and the House can be quite sure that delays in grants are not as real as was indicated.  In fact they are paid on a stage by stage basis and nothing could be fairer than that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the EC grants whether or not the 50 per cent higher rate of grants, are payable in the Shannon areas, the Commission say they would only consider this in the context of the review of the western package.  Our report has gone to the Commission and a formal submission will be made next week.  It is understood that the Commission are prepared to extend the 50 per cent grants to the newly designated western areas only.  This would include some eastern areas where they join western areas, that is, Westmeath, Galway and parts of Louth bordering Monaghan.  Isolated eastern areas which were mentioned by Senator McDonald would not be covered.</P>
    <P>On the food processing side of it, very briefly, points were made about imports. Of course, we are fully aware of the difficulties of import substitution when it comes to horticultural produce.  I must say, as somebody who has grown horticultural produce all my life, I have no difficulty in understanding the problem. <Col N="1397" /> While we hear a lot about our wonderful climate and the benign situation that we have for all the year round horticultural production, it is not as benign as that of some of our competitors.  That is the problem.  I happen to be in a fortunate area which is relatively frost free but I still have had crops of carrots wiped out due to inordinately heavy frost.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties that we have nowadays with regard to horticultural produce is that it has to be fresh.  In other words, the buyer looks for the leaves on it.  Long ago you would get away with storing carrots and other produce in turf mould.  Nowadays buyers look for something straight out of the ground, and I suppose they are entitled to it.  The House may be interested to know that, in conjunction with some vegetable importers, we are working on a few growers in the peninsula areas which are definitely frost free.  We have about 200 acres in the Ballyferriter area at the moment, producing potatoes, carrots and a few other crops, the idea being that there is enough of that land available to satisfy our needs, but it has to be in a particular area.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty that I am experiencing is that, apart from a few supermarkets in Dublin, our market is pitiably small. The danger of involving growers in growing willy-nilly is that existing growers might be wiped out of business.  This is something that has to be done in an orderly way.  We have decided, through the IFA, first of all to set up a potato co-operative with a limited number of growers.  At this stage they are even reluctant to take on too many new growers. With a limited number of growers they now have formed a marketing company with a major fruit importer and Sugar Company involvement.  I believe they will be setting up shop in Carlow for the assembling and packaging of potatoes mostly for the Dublin market.  We are doing something similar in the horticultural scene.  We have grant aided Mr. Colm Warren, Chairman of the IFA Horticultural Committee, in setting up a horticultural co-operative.  That co-operative has to start somewhere, starting small for the Dublin, Meath, Louth area.  They have <Col N="1398" /> agreed, in writing, to put a percentage of their produce into the co-operative.  At the moment, in the case of the potatoes the Department are subventing payment of the manager in the case of the horticultural co-operative, a marketing man.  All I can say at this stage is that it is progressing nicely.  There is nothing too exciting about it yet.</P>
    <P>We would hope that other growers would see the advantages of discipline. This is one of the things I find very difficult at times.  For instance, I get a crowd of people cribbing about potato imports. I ask them a simple question: are they members of the co-operative?  I find that they have not even joined the co-operative. I even ask them are they registered as growers.  We brought in a Bill last year to register all potato growers so that we would be able to keep an eye on what they were doing, to keep tabs on who they were, so that we could identify them if they had bad produce.  The response to advertising in the press and on the radio has been pretty dismal to date.  I make this point in the House, that any grower who is not registered and who will be offering his produce for sale in the coming seasons will be liable to severe penalties. He has been warned often enough.  Politicians on both sides of the House &mdash; it was no different when Senator Hussey was Minister &mdash; have to face the flak of these people.  We are giving them an opportunity to discipline themselves and we are begging them to avail of this opportunity. If we fail this time, I say quite frankly, and with respect to any boards we might set up, that any effort in future will be down the tubes because it was so hard to get this one going that I doubt if ever again this kind of thing could be attempted.</P>
    <P>What is encouraging, however, is that farmers by and large, despite a bad year in 1985, have not lost heart.  Anyone driving around the country at the moment will see fertilisation, liming, ploughing and tilling and that sort of thing.  Farmers have that entrepreneurial quality which is so necessary.  They are prepared to take chances.  For instance a group of farmers in the Cork area are prepared to grow <Col N="1399" /> flax.  That is a big gamble for them.  They are prepred to put their land and money at risk and take a gamble and they do not know if they will make a profit.  We are having some difficulties getting that launched but it is not the farmers fault.</P>
    <P>In my time as Minister there were two massive closures in my constituency at East Cork Foods and Erin Foods in Mallow and we had many problems getting the Midleton plant going.  The House will be glad to know that it is now making a small amount of money and is growing about 2,000 acres of crops.  We have finalised a company which will take over Erin Foods in Mallow and for the benefit of everybody, growers included, we will be growing the full range of crops in Mallow.  That is not the end of it; that is only the beginning.  There is a hard battle ahead for any type of horticultural produce even though we have some advantages this time in so far as two of the people involved in this company have entry both to the the Irish and the English markets.</P>
    <P>Our big weakness over the years was that Erin Foods did not have a real tie-in with the British supermarkets.  Whatever may be said about dairy products or meat products, certainly horticultural produce was a closed shop.  In a year of scarcity they bought everything you could produce. In a year of plenty you had to stack it at home.  When you consider that you are stacking tons of frozen products you realise the sort of costs involved.  General Costello's dream is getting a second chance and hopefully the scheme will expand as quickly as it did in the old days. We must not overlook the problems and difficulties.  Everybody will have to be prepared to row in to make it successful, workers, farmers and anybody involved in it.  We have something going for us that we did not have in the past.</P>
    <P>The Irish housewife is aware that, if she does not buy Irish produce, she is in some way jeopardising her husband's job.  We should cash in on that.  It is a food from Ireland campaign and most of the major supermarkets tell me that this is beginning to work and I believe that. <Col N="1400" /> As the Minister and other Senators mentioned, we should endeavour as far as feasible to supply the needs of Irish housewives on an all the year round basis. Where that is not feasible I would be totally happy to see products coming in here if the people want them.  I never worry about new products coming in from abroad if we can produce them here.  It gives the housewife an appetite for them and gives us a challenge to compete.  We crib about that expensive strip of water between here and the Continent, but it works both ways and maybe it could work to our advantage.</P>
    <P>We are working very hard on the processed food side.  Probably the biggest scandal in vegetable imports is potato chips.  That is the greatest challenge at the moment.  We are looking at two overseas processors and trying to encourage them through IDA grants and all the State aids conceivably possible to come here and set up a processing operation.  That is a must.  Two years ago we had great difficulty in convincing them that we could grow potatoes suitable for processing.  As a result of two years with ACOT and AFT and the Department and plots all over the country, we have satisfied them that we can grow the type of potato necessary for processing.  The ball is back in their court and we are annoying them on a daily basis to get on with it and I hope we will have good news on that in the near future.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one more point concerning horticulture.  The glasshouse industry is an area worth looking at and worthy of a lot more discussion.  In so far as natural gas could be made available at a cheaper rate, I commended that suggestion in the Fianna Fáil document but, unfortunately, it is not on, whether we like it or not.  The Dutch worked it for a number of years and they are before the courts now on that one.  With some success, we are now grant aiding solid fuel heating for all glasshouses.  The big advantage is that there will not be a gas line near most glasshouses as quite a lot of them are in the west and in the Kerry area and northern Border areas.  This grant is being taken up very substantially <Col N="1401" /> by glasshouse owners.  I would like to see the grant a little higher and I would also like to see grants for double planning. Basically that is a grant for insulating, which we do not have as yet.  I am convinced that this is one area where we could lengthen the season both at the beginning and at the end.</P>
    <P>Finally, I commend the House for their interest in this debate.  It is just as relevant now as it was when the report was produced, unlike the farm crisis.  It is very relevant at this time.  <i>Festina lente</i>.  We must proceed with caution when it comes to horticulture bearing in mind that we have a small market here and it is very difficult to get into markets abroad.  That is not to say we should not try.  We should never delude ourselves that we have a perfect climate for horticulture.  As I said earlier, last year some of my friends lost a lot of money due to heavy rainfall.  All their carrot crop split.  That is a problem that some of our competitors do not have.</P>

    <Title>Report of Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC&mdash;The Use of Hormones as Growth Promoters: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of Report No. 22 of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities: The Use of Hormones as Growth Promoters.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Joint Committee on the production of this report on the use of hormones as growth promoters.  As I said earlier, it might be a little out of date but I do not think that is important because the question of hormones is still very topical.  We know the situation as it now exists but for a few moments perhaps we could usefully reflect on what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report deals with the use as growth promoters of the natural hormones as they occur in nature as distinct from synthetically produced hormones.  We talk about oestradiol 17B, testosterone and <Col N="1402" /> progesterone and the artificial hormone trunbolone and zeranol.  There is, and the report makes it clear, a precise distinction between the two types of hormones, the natural hormones and the synthetic ones. It is true that hormones have had a rather checkered history since 1980.  At that time the EC Commission proposed a ban on all hormone substances.  However, some member states called for the substances to be authorised and in 1981 a scientific committee or group was established to report on the matter.  In the meantime, member states were allowed to retain their existing national measures while waiting on the report of the scientific group.  The scientific group reported that the natural hormones would not present any harmful effects to consumer health when used under appropriate conditions and that further investigation was needed on the artificial hormones and strict controls were essential.  In other words the scientific group stated positively that the natural hormones would not present any harmful effects to consumer health when used under appropriate conditions but that further investigation was needed with regard to the synthetic or artificially produced products.</P>
    <P>In June 1984, based on this scientific evidence, the Commission proposed that the natural hormones be allowed and that the artificial or synthetic hormones or substances be banned pending further information.  However, consumer pressure against the use of hormones mounted and in October 1985 the European Parliament passed a resolution that they be banned and on 30 October the Commission, in spite of the evidence of its scientific committees, which it had accepted as valid, reverted to its previous position and proposed a total ban.</P>
    <P>Approximately 2.5 million hormones implants are administered each year in this country.  They increase the weight of the animal; they improve the fat-lean ratio of the meat and the animals feed efficiency, in other words the animal eats a greater amount of food and utilises that food more efficiently and, therefore, <Col N="1403" /> there is a greater output of beef or whatever.</P>
    <P>It is now estimated that the value of the implants to the beef industry is approximately £40 million per annum. Some people would suggest that the figure is significantly higher, that it could be as much as double that figure but it is in any event at least £40 million annually. That is a very sizeable and significant slice of any sort of industry's margin.  Profits in the beef industry these days are fairly minimal.  A more appropriate word to use is a fair slice of the margins that exist and this margin in beef is narrowing very rapidly.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the economic or scientific arguments, consumer concern with regard to the use of hormones has grown very substantially in recent times and, indeed, continues to grow.  The Joint Committee have put forward the view that a controlled use of natural hormones will be in the best interest of the consumers and fears that a total ban will lead to widespread blackmarketeering as has been the experience of a number of European countries.  In other words, if one was to ban hormones <i>in toto</i>, it would lead to a very serious abuse, mischievous and indeed possibly dangerous abuse of the system.  With regard to that, the committee welcomed the recent introduction of certain measures that were envisaged in connection with the usage of hormones.</P>
    <P>Looking at the whole matter objectively, the Joint Committee feel that as a major beef exporter we have got to take account of the requirements of our customers. We have stated this earlier in the previous discussion which we have had in relation to our processing market generally. The Joint Committee are consistent in putting forward that point of view very positively and firmly in this report.</P>
    <P>Therefore, to be objective about it, a total ban is indeed now a very real possibility.  It was some time ago a real possibility.  It is only the United Kingdom that is opposing the measures in the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>If and when the ban is introduced there <Col N="1404" /> are certain long term advantages which might apply.  For example &mdash; this is important &mdash; Irish meat could build on its present quality image a market for a non-hormone treated product.  No beef would be hormone-free.  It is important that we turn to our advantage the fact that we do not have the availability of hormones for use and that we make a virtue of the fact that we cannot use hormones and that we sell our product as a non-treated product.  Linking this very clearly and closely with the whole concept of green Ireland and &ldquo;food from Ireland&rdquo;, <i>et cetera</i> we could give a great boost to our promotional efforts not alone in Europe but elsewhere where a consciousness and awareness of this very important subject is very strong.</P>
    <P>There is also the situation where a reduced use of hormones throughout the EC would have an effect on supplies and would reduce supplies and would bring a better market balance.  Hopefully, this would lead to higher prices for our beef and live animals.</P>
    <P>When the ban is introduced, it is vital that it be stringently enforced throughout the community.  I do not mean throughout this community of ours in Ireland but throughout the entire EC community. It should apply to imports from third countries.  If we do not approach it on that basis we will come badly out of the situation.  People could argue and debate this matter interminably but there is evidence which was submitted to the EC by a committee that was asked to investigate the matter that, administered under appropriate conditions, hormones were not injurious.  We have to face reality and recognise that the anti-hormone lobby throughout Europe and elsewhere has succeeded in their opposition to the use of hormones.  At the same time, we must be aware that there is a very significant amount that must now be made up in some other way to beef producers to counteract the massive losses that there are.  Greater efficiency through better breeds, better and greater margins hopefully in the whole industry will be essential because the sort of money that we are talking about, whether it is £40 million or <Col N="1405" /> £50 million, is very substantial.  There is no way that the beef industry at present can sustain that kind of loss unless there are compensating factors.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of any of us not in the first instance to very warmly congratulate the Joint Committee on such an excellent, in-depth document as they have produced here, and, indeed, also the various contributors to the Joint Committee who were very much appreciated by the committee.  The sub-committee had written an oral submission from the ICOS, ACOT the IFA and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries.  Written submissions were received from the Department of Agriculture, the Consumers Association of Ireland and the Irish Organic Farmers' and Growers' Association. There was also a submission from the ICMSA.  The committee expressed their appreciation to these bodies.</P>
    <P>I would also like to reflect, through the committee, our warm appreciation for the valuable input, which is outlined in the document, from these various organisations. I do not propose to go through them except to mention one or two views of the joint committee which are worthy of reference.</P>
    <P>As I said &mdash; and the committee state it here in their document &mdash; the hormones question has proved a very contentious issue and provoked strong reaction among producers and consumers.  In their consideration of this matter the Joint Committee felt that the protection of the consumer must be the first priority.  The question arises, however, as to how the interests of the consumer are best served.</P>
    <P>Reference is made to the question of natural hormones.  The committee could not accept that there was any valid argument for the banning of these substances. In fact, they occurred naturally in the animals and they were produced daily by the human body &mdash; as is shown in tables set out in the report &mdash; and are consumed daily in a variety of foodstuffs.  In fact, it is ironic that consumers in Germany, where the demand has been strong for a total ban on the use of hormones, actually have a higher intake of hormones than have their Irish counterparts.  This is <Col N="1406" /> explained by the fact that in Germany there is only 2 per cent approximately of the beef animals implanted with hormones. It is mostly bull beef that is consumed in Germany.  That explains why the human consumption of hormones is so much higher than it would be in a country like Ireland where we would have treated beef.</P>
    <P>Reference is made to appendix 2 which states that unimplanted bull beef, which is mainly consumed in Germany, can actually have a higher level of hormones than implanted steer beef which is the main category of beef eaten in Ireland. Bull beef in Germany has a higher hormonal content than the implanted steer in Ireland.  The artificial hormones are a diferent kettle of fish.  Reference is made to them by the committee.  They say that as regards artificial hormones, An Foras Talúntais have informed the committee that the available toxicological data indicates that they are of equivalent or less toxicity than the naturally occurring steroid hormones.  However, as long as the slightest doubt as to their absolute safety remains the joint committee felt that the substances should not be used. This is a very responsible attitude to them.  Once the slightest doubt at all is there, they felt that the substances should not be used.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that no evidence has been produced to show that the substances, when properly used, are harmful and, therefore, a ban is premature considering the low risk as against the economic benefits which can be obtained. The Joint Committee, however, would agree with the retort to this proposition that, as it is the consumer who takes the risk and the producer who obtains the benefit, it is not acceptable.  That is being very logical about it.  The committee's view is worthy of further mention.  They felt that the question of control is a key to the whole issue.  In that regard the committee welcomed the introduction of different regulations with regard to control. There are many other views expressed by the committee, but I do not intend to delay on them.</P>
    <P>The committee notwithstanding these <Col N="1407" /> various other arguments, points and positions held with regard to hormones, readily accept that in the final analysis the consumer will have the last word. No matter what scientific or economic arguments are advanced, if the consumer demands unimplanted meat, this wish must be catered for.  The strength of this consumer demand is obvious when one considers the resolutions which are set out here and the fact that the Commission moved from a position of allowing restricted use of natural hormones in June 1984, to proposing a complete ban on them in October 1985 in spite of the evidence of scientific committees which they had accepted as valid. A total ban is a real possibility in the near future.  The committee said that the Minister for Agriculture had stated that he is prepared to accept the ban if that is the wish of his colleagues in the Council. I will quote from a parliamentary reply from the Minister to a question raised in the Dáil on 26 November 1985, Volume 362, which stated:</P>
    <P>Ideally, any decision in this matter should be based on a scientific asessment of the effects of the use of the hormones.  However, this country as a major beef exporter must also take account of the views and requirements of our customers abroad if we wish to continue to export to them. In this connection it has been recognised that consumers in some member states have become increasingly concerned about the use of hormone implants in livestock production and that certain member states have in fact already prohibited their use.  This has serious implications for our trade with those countries even though there is at the present time no scientific evidence that the five types of hormones in use, particularly the three natural ones, have harmful effects on human health.</P>
    <P>The only country that stands against that position is the United Kingdom.  I believe that all the evidence&mdash; and there is another lengthy document prepared by <Col N="1408" /> An Foras Talúntais and its Grange Dunsinea Research Centre on the subject under discussion &mdash; reiterates and reaffirms much of what I have mentioned and what is contained in the report. Basically, it states that there is a massive amount of gain to the beef producer by the use of hormones.  This is very noticeable from the various trials that have been carried out on farms and in research conditions.  It also makes the point quite validly and clearly about the human preference. One could speak at great length on the economic advantages of using hormones but it is futile and irrelevant to do so at this time, apart from establishing clearly that producers of beef are going to be at a significant a loss by not being able to resort to hormonal use in the future.  There will be certain provision for therapeutic use of hormones and that will have limited value from a beef-producing point of view.  The consumers of Ireland, who are very important to us in the beef-producing world and the consumers in Britain and elsewhere, will in the future have beef that is not treated with hormones. Coupling that with the whole environmental aspect of this country and purity of our product, we can be extremely competitive.  On the Dublin market, on the London market, on the Tokyo market or any other market one likes to think about, we can justifably say that we have a product that is inferior to none.  We would have a very superior product.  One has to be responsible and state that the withdrawal of the use of natural hormones will mean a greater proportion of fat to lean in the meat.  It is going to change the fat-lean meat ratio. That is the choice and, as a nation, we are correct in giving the consumers what they want.  I would envisage a situation where, when society and the market are more enlightened, there could well be a tolerance of the use in the future of natural hormones.  It is evident that in the foreseeable future, the consumer wants beef that is not treated with hormones, either natural or synthetic.  That is the beef we must supply to those markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to <Col N="1409" /> record my thanks to the Chairman and members of the Joint Committee for the work they did in preparing this excellent report we are discussing here today.  I would also like to thank the various agencies who made the submissions, such as the IFA, the ICOS, AFT and all the other people who made submissions to the Joint Committee on the preparation of this very valuable report.</P>
      <P>For the past few years the hormones question has been discussed, particularly since 1980 when the commission introduced its initial proposals which provided for a ban on all hormonal substances, both natural and artificial.  The European Parliament, in 1981, declared that they were opposed to all hormones.  However, member states, such as Ireland and the United Kingdom, called for natural hormones to be authorised.  Since then, many proposals have been brought forward by the Commission and the European Parliament, recommending the banning of all hormones used for fattening animals, recommending the use of natural hormones under the veterinary control, while banning the artificial substances pending a further report from the scientific committees.  In April 1985 these proposals were amended to make it necessary to indicate on meat labelling whether the meat had been treated with hormones.  Again, on 30 October 1985, folowing the resolution passed by the European Parliament, the Commission reverted, more or less, to the 1981 position and proposed a complete ban on hormonal substances, the only exception being the use for therapeutic treatment of natural hormones under strict regulation and control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland the use of hormones has grown rapidly in recent years.  We see, according to the report, that approximately two-and-a-half-million implants are administered annually with artificial substances, accounting for 70 to 80 per cent of this figure.  Naturally, the use of hormones has a significant effect on animal performance and, consequently, on profits for the farmer.  It is estimated by An Foras Talúntais that the value to the beef industry is in the order of £40 million <Col N="1410" /> annually.  When one considers this, it is a very sizeable figure in what is going into the Irish economy from the beef industry. The use of hormones also improves the lean to fat ratio.  Increased leanness has been the demand from third countries such as the Middle East and North Africa.  It is also being demanded on the traditional United Kingdom and Continental markets.  A ban on the use of all hormones would certainly have a significant impact on the quality of our beef cattle.  If we wish to maintain the present fat-lean ratio of recent years it is likely that animals will have to be slaughtered at a younger age and at a lighter weight. Unless there is a increase in efficiency this will obviously reduce the margin from cattle production, a margin which is slight enough at present.</P>
    <P>The greater proportion of our production of beef comes from steers.  Since steers are the beef-producing animals which benefit most from the use of hormone implants, Ireland would suffer the greatest economic loss from a total ban. In West Germany only 2 per cent of beef production is derived from steers. Consequently, a ban on hormones will have very little effect there.</P>
    <P>However, having said all that, one must take into account the views of the consumer.  Here I agree with the joint committee that the protection of the consumer must be the first priority.  The Joint Committee cannot accept that natural hormones should be banned.  They occur naturally.  They are produced daily by the human body and, indeed, are consumed in a variety of foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>With regard to artificial hormones, there seems to be a doubt as to their absolute safety.  As long as that doubt remains the committee were right to disapprove of their use.  Regardless of the economic benefits accruing from their use I still believe that the consumer should not be asked to take that risk.</P>
    <P>The question of control will pay a key role in the whole issue.  For that reason there is the introduction of four separate regulations to tighten controls on the <Col N="1411" /> availability and use of antibiotics and hormones so as to ensure that these substances are used responsibly and to prevent as far as possible any detrimental residues getting into the food chain.  The introduction of those regulations is to be welcomed, because I believe that control is a key element in the whole process.</P>
    <P>The regulations that have been introduced were the Poisons (Control of Residues in Foods of Animal Origin Regulations), 1985.  This is designed to ensure that the veterinary products associated with residue problems are administered properly and that the appropriate withdrawal periods are observed.  These regulations declare hormones antibiotics and other anti-bacterial substances to be poisons for the purpose of the regulations and introduce controls on their use in food animals.  The second regulation is the Animal Remedies (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1985.  Again these regulations control the sale of animal remedies containing hormones, antibiotics and anti-bacterial substances. Their principal effect, in conjunction with section 5 and section 7 of the Animal Remedies Act, 1956, is to restrict the sale of such animal remedies to a registered pharmaceutical chemist, a registered druggist, or a registered dispensing chemist and druggist, in accordance with an individual prescription of a registered veterinary surgeon, or to a registered veterinary surgeon for animals which he is treating.  Mail-order sales, the sales from a travelling shop, vehicle or an automatic vending machine and door-to-door collection of orders are prohibited. The third one is the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935.  The fourth regulation there is the Agricultural Produce, Fresh Meat, Beef, Pork and Mutton Amendment Regulations, 1985.  These regulations amend the schedules of existing regulations to empower veterinary examiners to carry out ante and post-mortem examinations, to take samples, to test for residues or specified substances and to demand certificates or declarations from animal owners and/or their veterinary surgeons to show what substances, if any, <Col N="1412" /> had been administered to those animals during a period of time prior to presentation for slaughter, in order to establish if residues of a controlled substance are likely to be present in the edible parts of an animal.  A veterinary examiner may reject animals and carcasses where reasonable grounds exist for believing that detrimental residues are present. Those controls are very important.  If the regulations are carried out, a lot can be done to check the use of hormones and to make sure their use and administration is properly done, if it is necessary.</P>
    <P>As Senator Hourigan has said, we must take account at all times of the demands of the consumer because they are the people who are to be considered.  Even though the farmers might like to make a fast few pounds by the use of those hormones in their cattle, nevertheless if we cannot sell our meat or if we get the reputation of having meat for sale in foreign parts that is affected by or injected with those hormones, then the country at large is certainly not going to benefit.  We have a great opportunity here.  We have a very good reputation abroad as regards our meat.  We have established a very good market in Germany, France and many other countries for pre-packed meat.  We can still improve on that if we specialise in supplying a type of meat that is free of all those hormones.  If we get the name of producing that kind of meat abroad, then it will be to our advantage.  We should certainly capitalise on it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would again like to thank the Joint Committee for the work they did on this very important subject. I appreciate that we are only glancing over it here because very few of us are experts in this field.  It is something that we will have to learn more about in the near future.  It is important for the cattle industry.  It is important from an economic point of view.  It is also very important from the consumers' point of view.  We will have to educate ourselves more on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pretend to be an expert on agriculture but I do think there <Col N="1413" /> is a very important question at stake here for us as consumers and as producers of meat.  I would welcome the committee's report because it is very thorough and certainly to a person who is by no means a specialist, it is very clear, simple and easy to follow the lines of argument. Basically, there are, of course, as usual vested interests which are in conflict here.  Clearly the farmer would be worried about the impact that a total ban on the use of hormones would have on the production of meat and on the profits of the farmer.  The use of hormones helps beef production.  It helps the lean-fat ratio.  Therefore, it makes the exercise of beef farming more profitable.</P>
      <P>There is a discussion in the report of the scientific aspect.  One would have to accept that whereas there is not absolute proof of the dangers of the use of hormones, particularly in the use of natural hormones, and there does not seem to be any proof of that, neither is there absolute proof that it is not dangerous.  While that remains the case, the reality has got to be faced that people will make up their own minds and people usually tend to take the view that they would rather err on the safe side and, therefore, the effect on the consumer is likely to be that they will shy away from meats which they feel have been produced in this way.  Whatever about the interest of the farmer, the interest of the consumer has to be paramount. At the end of the day it would not be much use to us if we had a wealthy farming community at the expense of the health of the community.  I hasten to add that there is no definite proof of this, but there is always the fear of it.  We would be better to err on the right side.  We also have to remember that the wealthy farmers are also consumers?  There is an interest to the farmer as a consumer as well as from a farming and a profit point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general trend worldwide seems now to be towards fresh foods and towards doing away with all types of artificial ways of both growing food and raising livestock.  It is likely that the consumer at the end of the day will have the last word.  As in all industries, there <Col N="1414" /> is not much point in producing things for which there is no demand.  The demand is more likely in the future to be for hormone-free beef.  Therefore, I think it would be in the interest of the Irish farmer that there should be a concentration, as ACOT has recommended, on marketing Irish beef on the basis of the image of its freshness and naturalness, therefore creating that image for a market which clearly is there.  We have to take into account that in Germany and other places in Europe there is an image of Ireland as a green, fresh country where everything is natural.  We ought to be capitalising on that market rather than worrying about what may happen and trying to fight the ban.</P>
    <P>I note that Ireland and Britain would suffer most from a ban.  From reading this report, I come to the conclusion that it is more likely than not that there will be a complete ban in the future.  If that were to be the case &mdash; and since the stronger powers in the EC will not have a lot to lose from that, it makes it even more likely that there will be a ban &mdash; we should in the interest of the farmer, leaving aside the interest of the consumer, be proceeding on the basis of marketing an Irish quality product to meet the demand that will be clearly there in the future.  At the end of the day the consumer interest has to be the priority.</P>
    <P>If there is a question mark over the effect on health of the use of hormones and whilst there is no absolute proof that these are safe, the trend ought to be towards producing less beef but beef for a quality market.  That will be in the interest of both the farmer and the consumer. Then the farmer will not suffer from the ban if we have already established that type of image for Irish beef. When the ban comes we will then be able to meet the problem.  We ought to recognise the problem which will be presented to farmers in the case of a ban and try to deal with it now rather than try to fight the ban when it is imposed, trying to cope with it at a time when it may be too late.  As an inexpert person in the <Col N="1415" /> field of agriculture those are my views from reading this excellent report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief.  I came into the House without a copy of my report.  I read it completely and found it very informative. I would like to join with all the other Members in the House in congratulating the members of the committee.</P>
      <P>As Senator Hussey has said, very few of us are experts in this area.  I realise that the question of hormones is very important to the farming community and the cattle industry.  The report clearly brought out the points made by Senator Hourigan that hormones reduce the fat-meat relationship and the food-meat relationship is improved.  This is something which might be taken care of by the breeds of cattle that we have.</P>
      <P>The report clearly underlined that natural hormones are not harmful.  There are many people who think that drugs, hormones and all medicinal compounds should be administered under strict professional control.  I would subscribe to this.  Hormones got out of this control. While this may have resulted in savings and lower expense for the farmer, it is something I would not be totally happy about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report went to great pains to point out that there is an intake of natural hormones in many situations far in excess of what would be met with in the meat situation.  Nevertheless, the hormones are not neutralised by cooking.  One of the hormones mentioned, testosterone, was a component used in oral contraceptives and the high concentration of this hormone made it more or less dangerous. There was an element of danger attached to it and it got a lot of publicity some time ago.  People might be using contraceptives which would incorporate that hormone and might be using them in the right proportions which would not be dangerous, nevertheless, by using meat which would be subjected to this particular hormone they might bring about a situation where the concentration would be dangerous.  The customer is always <Col N="1416" /> right, as Members have said.  The mass of the people know what is right in spite of the &ldquo;hype&rdquo; in the media.</P>
    <P>Generally, people are subjected to pressures with regard to their choice as far as meat is concerned.  When one goes into a victualler's shop, there is lighting of a particular type which shows the meat to better advantage and makes it altogether more attractive.  While we would hope to arrive at a situation where meat would be the result of natural feeding, as Senator Hourigan has said, it is impossible to eliminate all chemical influences, for example, fertilisers, medicinal injections and administrations in all the different ways.  The Senator's point was brought out in the report and in the media with regard to clean meat from Ireland which is clean and green.  I suppose that while Ireland is still green but not as clean as we would like it &mdash; for those of us who go around the country &mdash; it is a concept we should keep to.</P>
    <P>Other Members mentioned that hormones will be used for therapeutic purposes and for breeding.  Members of the Oireachtas received literature from a new firm which has set up in this country to produce hormones.  There will be scope for it in those areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say, like other Members, that what we should do now is to get on the right road and it should not be a short term gain that we will look for but gain in the long term.  It is clearly shown that the consumer wants meat which is free from hormones.  The point was made in the media by those engaged in farming that it is a pity that at an early stage we did not keep on that road and pride ourselves on it and make the case that we were the one country, or one of these countries, which did not use hormones. We could have made this a great selling point.  From the consumers' point of view and also that of the farming community and agriculture as a whole, I think the proper course is to abide by the recommendations of the committee. Once again, I congratulate the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to welcome this report by the Joint Committee. The committee are to be congratulated on preparing a detailed, enlightened and well-balanced report on the use and effect of hormones.  It is obvious that they have delved deeply into this highly emotive issue which has been so much in the public eye in recent years. The wealth of material and information incorporated in the report and the practical conclusions reached are a credit to all concerned.</P>
      <P>As outlined by the committee, hormones and their use for growth promotion have received a lot of attention and publicity since the discovery of harmful residues in babyfood in Italy during 1980. In the light of this discovery the Commission banned those hormones which had been proven to be harmful and allowed the continued use of the three natural hormones and two which are produced artificially.  It was to ensure that use of the five authorised substances posed no threat to human health that a scientific committee was set up by the EC to examine their potential effects.  After much deliberation the committee concluded that, while it could not give firm assurances on the artificial hormones, responsible use of the three natural substances entailed no danger whatsoever to the consumer and their continued use should be permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our attitude at Council meetings on the subject was that the recommendations of the scientific committee should be accepted and that the continued use of the natural hormones should be incorporated in Community legislation to be applied equally in all member states. As you are aware however, under considerable &mdash; and often ill informed &mdash; pressure the subject was approached in a somewhat irrational manner.  This resulted in a decision to prohibit the use of all hormones except in an extremely restricted manner for therapeutic use. Much as we may regret this decision, as a country which exports 80 per cent of its beef output, we must accept it on the basis that, whether rightly or wrongly, consumers do not wish to buy meat from <Col N="1418" /> animals which have been treated with hormones.  After all, there is little point in producing meat, no matter how efficiently, if the consumer refuses to eat it.</P>
    <P>We had, of course, been aware for some time of the need to ensure responsible use of hormones and it was with this in mind that we introduced our own national controls in this area.  We intended that these controls would protect the consumer while allowing Irish farmers the continued benefit of use of the substances.  However, in the light of the council decision, the regulations will be extended to prohibit the use of growth promoting substances.</P>
    <P>We think that a number of issues must now be faced because of these developments. Effective measures will have to be enforced to ensure that the ban is implemented in all countries.  The consumers, having made their choice, must be given every guarantee that there will be no illegal use of hormones for growth promotion, that the development of a black market in these products will not arise and that, from January 1988 when the Directive becomes effective, the meat which they eat is derived from animals which have never been treated with growth implants.  It is in the interest of both consumers and producers alike that the Community controls are effectively applied to this end.  I must also make mention of those third countries which export livestock and meat to the EC. While there will, no doubt, be considerable opposition in GATT and elsewhere to any restrictions on imports because of the hormone ban, it is essential that Community producers are not placed at a trade disadvantage and that the same ban should apply equally to those third country imports.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity now for our exporters to develop additional markets abroad for our meat by promoting the image of quality, grass-fed beef produced without the aid of growth hormones. Indeed, I think we have this advantage over at least a number of our competitors: as yet we have not delved too deeply into the Holsteins in this country.  I still think we have a big advantage in so far <Col N="1419" /> as we have a very high quality animal. We have a very high quality calf, for starters.  That will prove certainly to our advantage when it comes to the marketplace. I am almost certain that our competitors using these extreme Holsteins will have great difficulty in converting them into any sort of beef without the use of drug promoters.  That in itself makes a great case for our Friesian breeders to look after what they have and not to be delving into the Holsteins which are readily available from overseas countries, but to stick with what basically has been an excellent source of raw material for our beef industry.</P>
    <P>The disadvantages accruing from the ban can be well offset also by improved marketing opportunities and this should be reflected back to the producer in better returns in due course.  It is also well to remember that our beef industry, as we saw &mdash; any of us who had the privilege to visit any of the food fairs abroad &mdash; is creaming off the top of the market, thanks to the vigorous people in the meat industry and thanks to the promotion of CBF.  Even the CBF emblem is grass and clover.  We promote that grass and clover image.  It could enhance our product very much if we were to go out tomorrow morning and say: &ldquo;We are now producing meat that is free of all hormones and indeed of all harmful substances&rdquo;.  The consumer is entitled to clean food.  Not only must it be clean but it must be seen to be clean.  That is equally important. The easiest way to get it across to media people and to anybody else is to be able to do as the vice-president of the IFA was in a position to do recently on a radio programme &mdash; to be quite clear and specific.  He was in a position to say &mdash; and it was wonderful to listen to him that morning, because it dispelled many doubts in the mind of Dublin housewives &mdash; that every morning every load of milk entering the Dublin dairies is tested for antibiotics.  It was wonderful to be in a position to make that statement and to reassure the housewife that the food she is eating is wholesome and pure.  She is <Col N="1420" /> entitled to that; God knows she is paying enough for it.</P>
    <P>One small point is this: you will not have wealthy farmers at the expense of consumers.  We depend entirely on the consumer; and, if they do not buy our product and buy a lot of it, we, too, are out of business.  From my own point of view, as somebody who has been farming for many years, I see no great hazards at all about this.  Once we are playing on a level pitch with everybody else, as long as nobody else has the advantage over us, we can compete freely in the European market.  One thing that does, however, worry me and worry me very much indeed, is the whole question of third countries.  I would insist that exactly the same regime prevails in third countries as prevails here.  I would insist that the same disciplines would be imposed, so that they would not have a very real advantage over us when it comes to the market place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  I would also like to welcome to the House the new Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  I am sure she has ancestors in west Limerick and she will probably have an interest in this scheme. I met people who made representations to me who claimed that they are related to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, was passed 34 schemes have been completed and five are in progress at present. Some are not completed and one of these is the Maigue drainage scheme.  In all, over 160 acres will have been influenced by drainage when these schemes are completed. The Maigue is in County Limerick and it is about 470 miles long.  We had drainage schemes previously in County Limerick.  I would like to compliment the <Col N="1421" /> Office of Public Works on the great work they have done in the Deel arterial scheme.  They ensured that, whilst the scheme benefited farmers and made land more fertile in that catchment area, the environment was not adversely affected by the drainage.  They ensured that fish life was not interfered with and that fishing could be carried on on the Deel.</P>
    <P>However, tributaries of that scheme were left undone and the Office of Public Works pulled out once they had completed their scheme.  Despite several efforts and despite numerous representations from TDs and myself, these tributaries were not included in the scheme and people are annoyed that, whilst other areas were completed and benefited, they feel they are victimised.  One area in that scheme, if I may elaborate, involves a long tributary going back to Kantoher and people around that area are disappointed that this tributary was not included originally and, regrettably, has not been done since.  I think I am correct in saying that the Minister's grandmother came from that side of the country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, great work has been done in the Maigue drainage scheme.  It commenced in 1973, nearly 13 years ago. Progress is slow and we would prefer it to be quicker but the work is so thorough that I suppose it means slow progress.  I believe there are a lot of tributaries and I am sure the Office of Public Works know all about the extra tributaries and extensions that it has been requested should be included in the scheme.  I believe some were approved lately. There was a scheme servicing Michael O'Donnell and others in Martinstown; Robert Allen and Michael Landers in Galbally were approved and a Mrs Bridget Rowe in Baggetstown.  There was also a scheme approved in Croom that would benefit Pat Quilty and Mark Kennedy and others.  Several representations have been made to me.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this scheme is to ensure that land will benefit from it and also to create employment which is very important. Redundancies have been effected since this scheme started and I understand there will be 50 more redundancies <Col N="1422" /> next Friday week.  I understand that between their redundancy and PRSI all the workers will lose is £7 a week.  I think this is false economy on the part of the Government because they will have to pay out all this money whereas if they were paying wages, with the deduction of tax and the employment provided it would definitely be more economical.  It would also serve to ensure that the land would be drained.  Originally 300 were employed and the figure was reduced to 250.  Now it will be reduced to around 180 by the 50 redundancies which will be effected in the near future.</P>
    <P>Representations were made to me about a stream which I think is not included at present but it is a stream going to the main Maigue river.  It would be referred to as C1 on the map and it is from Cooleen to Cappineelane.  It is a long tributary and definitely should be included to ensure that the Maigue drainage scheme will give 100 per cent benefit to the community in the catchment area. There is also another stream from Croom going into the main Maigue river, that is in C1; it is entering the Maigue river at the Rectory in Croom and serving many farms and a lot of low lying land in that area.  I am very interested in my own immediate area and have made several representations and I would like to thank the officials in the Office of Public Works for their sympathetic hearing and for being patient with me when I made representations. There is a tributary C1 43, serving William Ryan and others in Incha.  This is a small tributary which would not cost much and should be included.  There is another tributary off the same stream C1 43 serving P.J. Vaughan and another person.  The land in that area is low lying and these tributaries will have to be included in the scheme if these people are to benefit and if the scheme is to fulfil the purpose for which it is designed and that is to ensure the fertility of our land.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me in relation to the Maigue river.  I cannot understand why the OPW stopped <Col N="1423" /> at a place between Ballygrant and Millford in the Cork Limerick border at Bellisle Bridge.  They went as far as that and stopped there.  I understand the Maigue originated in County Cork although it was shown otherwise on the map.  From what I hear from people &mdash; and there are some good historians in the area and they have a good knowledge of geography &mdash; the Maigue originated in County Cork. The main Maigue river scheme would need to be continued on at least as far as Coon Bridge because there have been cases of serious flooding there.  Last November a woman had to be evacuated from her house and farm buildings because of a downpour and sudden flooding.  I am sure if this extension of the Maigue was continued back there it would ensure that there would be no recurrence of that flooding in the future. Cattle and young calves were in danger of being lost in that flood.</P>
    <P>There will always be a case to be made about finance and so on, but taking account of what it will cost the Exchequer in PRSI and redundancy money laying off people is false economy.  To include these schemes would not only maintain employment but would ensure that everyone would be happy in that area and the Maigue drainage scheme would fulfil the purpose it was designed for.</P>
    <P>There is another extension I should like to refer to.  I do not know if it was approved or not, but I was informed that it was not included in the original scheme. I am referring to a tributary, serial No. C85-454-806, serving William Heffernan and others in Raheennamadra, Knocklong.  I am sure other public representatives made representations to the Office of Public Works that other schemes should be included.  It is very important, whatever it costs, that arterial drainage in the Maigue scheme is completed and that every stream and tributary is included to ensure that it drains all the land and not 80 per cent or 90 per cent or even 99 per cent of it.</P>
    <P>This arterial drainage scheme is very important in the development of agricultural land.  I commend the Board of <Col N="1424" /> Works and successive Ministers for the work they have done in this area.  There should not be any slackening of that work at any time.  In the Maigue drainage scheme all tributaries should be included if local people are to get full benefit from the scheme.</P>
    <P>I was in the Deel catchment area and I saw the benefits that were derived from it.  I would like to see everyone, not 99 per cent of the farmers or the people, but everyone deriving benefit from these schemes.  As I have outlined already, there was disappointment that one stream was not included in the Deel scheme and as a result many farmers did not benefit.  I hope that when the scheme I am interested in is concluded, which I hope will be very soon, the Office of Public Works will continue the good work by going to the east of the county and continuing the Mulcaire drainage scheme which I am sure Senator Hourigan has an interest in.  I appeal to the Minister to include all these tributaries in the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I should like to support strongly the points expressed by Senator Kiely on the question of the early completion of the Maigue scheme.  I know, as he does, that the work that has been done is very beneficial to a large section of the countryside.  Other areas need the type of attention that Senator Kiely referred to.  Senator Kiely made reference to the Mulcaire river and its catchment area which adjoins the Maigue and one would like to think that under the general concept of arterial drainage that, rather than redundancies being envisaged at all, the Maigue river would be completed at the earliest date possible and, coinciding with that date of completion, there should be a commencement of the drainage of the Mulcaire river. This is a totally separate question but it does impinge very much on the matter on the Adjournment for the simple reason that it has been the understanding that once the Maigue river is completed work will then commence on the Mulcaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain amount of design work has <Col N="1425" /> been done with regard to the Mulcaire river, approximately 50 per cent, and it is a matter of completing the other 50 per cent design work, having it displayed and taking it from there.  There is, of course, a certain list of priorities.  This list which was drawn up back in the forties must now be very carefully examined to ascertain if it is the best listing.</P>
    <P>The review body that recently examined arterial drainage should have taken account of the type of area that Senator Kiely referred to, covered by the Maigue and Mulcaire rivers.  The land is extremely fertile but not very well drained. The main water courses should be kept clear of impediments that come their way.  Water should be allowed flow away so that people may do whatever field drainage is required.  In the Maigue catchment area a lot of field drainage has been done that otherwise could not have been remotely considered.  The same applies to the Mulcaire catchment area where we are talking about something like 165,000 acres of very fertile land.  On a cost benefit analysis there is no doubt in our minds, and I have been closely involved in promoting the Mulcaire drainage operation, that the benefits to the economy, apart from the benefits to the individual, will be enormous.  Arterial drainage, in my opinion, on good land is a good proposition, I have no doubt about that.  Perhaps in the past certain drainage operations did not necessarily give the best results and the land reverted back to its old state.  It would be very wrong to base a final opinion on that.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Senator Kiely for agreeing to let me say a few words about this.  As this is the first time I have spoken in the House while the Minister was present I want belatedly to congratulate her on her recent elevation to office and to wish her well in that office in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Having recently addressed this House on the subject of the drainage of the Hollymount river in County Mayo, I welcome this opportunity of speaking again on the important <Col N="1426" /> subject of arterial drainage.  I should like to start by thanking Senators Kiely and Hourigan for their good wishes to me on my appointment to office.  I should like to accept the compliments given to the OPW, particularly by Senator Kiely, on behalf of those concerned, for the work done to date on the Maigue river.</P>
      <P>The matter before the House relates to the Maigue catchment drainage scheme, which covers an area of some 265,000 acres in counties Limerick, Cork and Tipperary. Work on this scheme commenced in 1973 and is expected to be completed this summer.  The scheme, like all others carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, is a comprehensive one.  It involved drainage works to approximately 455 miles of channel, including about 24 miles of main river and a further 120 miles of major tributaries.  Reconstruction, underpinning, or other structural alterations were required to a total of 1,300 bridges or culverts, including about 300 public road and railway bridges or culverts.  A major amount of construction work also arose in connection with the replacement of fish weirs or croys, reconstruction of eel weirs, fish pass installations and various repairs and modifications to existing mill weirs.</P>
      <P>The scheme was designed to confer benefit on some 30,500 acres of agricultural land damaged by flooding or waterlogging and represents a very substantial investment of State funds.  Secondary benefits included the elimination or relief of flooding of public roads at several points throughout the catchment and at a number of towns and villages such as Adare, Croom and Bruree, which had been vulnerable to flooding for some time.  Another significant secondary benefit was the employment generated by the scheme in the area.  At peak level, a total of some 250 operatives were employed on the scheme.  However, the Maigue, like all drainage schemes, is a finite project and, as it winds down, employment levels are correspondingly reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I speak directly to the motion I should like to make a passing reference to the issue raised by Senator Hourigan <Col N="1427" /> about the Mulcaire river.  Planning of a scheme for the Mulcaire, which is included in the national arterial drainage programme, has been suspended pending the outcome of the review on arterial drainage.  This review is now with the Minister for Finance and will have to go to Government before any final decisions are made.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the Maigue scheme saw the introduction of a detailed cost-benefit analysis, designed to assess the efficacy, in economic terms, of drainage proposals.  Schemes undertaken before the commencement of the Maigue in 1973, were based on other, more rudimentary, forms of evaluation of their merits.  The introduction of cost-benefit analysis on the Maigue enabled the formulation of economic criteria which could readily be applied to drainage proposals. Certain areas of land within the catchment were omitted from the scheme where the amount of work, and the expenditure involved, were not commensurate with the benefit which would be conferred by drainage.  The application of cost-benefit criteria enabled an assessment to be made of the merits of proposals for the drainage of additional tributaries.  This process was applied at the Maigue.  The House will appreciate that there is not, nor has there ever been, any point in throwing money at drainage in an effort to solve each and every case of flooding or waterlogging of land.  The return must be sufficiently adequate to justify the expenditure.  The fact that EC aid, from the Regional Development Fund, was available for the latter stages of the scheme does not alter this undeniable requirement.  Indeed, the economic viability of the works was a prerequisite of the availability of EC funds for the project.</P>
    <P>Additional channels have, where economically warranted, been brought into the scheme.  By this process, channels serving the Maidstown and Ballynamuddagh areas near Kilmallock, Portboy near Herbertstown and Elton near Knocklong, County Limerick and many others have been incorporated in the scheme.  Other channels, such as those <Col N="1428" /> serving the Ballygrennan, Ballinlee and Ballingirlough areas near Bruff and Bottomstown near Hospital, County Limerick, have, on the same grounds, been ruled out.  A number are under consideration, including those serving areas at Incha, Ballyagran and Kilbreedy in County Limerick.  I am aware of Senator Kiely's special interest in these areas. Consideration of the channels involved was deferred until now so as to permit concentration of all the available resources on the original scheme works.</P>
    <P>I should add that proposals for additional drainage works at the Maigue must also be examined in the light of the overall review of arterial drainage, which has been carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works and submitted to the Minister for Finance, prior to its consideration by Government.  An important function of the review will be to enable the assessment of the merits of investment in arterial drainage, an assessment which, while highly desirable at all times, is doubly necessary in times when services and projects are competing for scarce financial resources.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would remind the House that my portfolio extends to matters affecting the environment, a subject which is, perhaps belatedly, attracting the increasing attention it so fully merits. In drawing up proposals for drainage of the Maigue, account was taken of environmental factors and I take this opportunity to assure Members that assessment of any proposals for additional drainage works in the catchment will take full account of environmental considerations.</P>
    <P>I will, as soon as possible, communicate to Senator Kiely the outcome of the deliberations on his proposals for additional works at the Maigue.</P>
