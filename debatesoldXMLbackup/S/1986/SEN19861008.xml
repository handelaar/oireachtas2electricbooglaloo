      <P>I have had notice from Senator Shane Ross regarding a motion which he wishes to move under Standing Order 29. I now call on Senator Ross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Seanad on a specified and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, the matter being the deepening crisis in the public finances as evidenced by last week's disastrous Exchequer return figures and the consequent immediate withdrawal of investors' confidence in the economy of the State.</P>
      <P>I move this motion partly because the Dáil, for its own reasons, is in recess. This is the only forum of the Oireachtas in which this motion can be moved and the crisis in the finances of the State can be discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I will. Before I do so I would like to say that the lack of confidence in the Government has been, without any doubt, demonstrated by the refusal of investors to lend Government money in the last week as a result of these figures. <Col N="202" /> As a result of these figures, the budget deficit and the crisis in the economy, nobody will lend money to the Government.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Cassidy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the building of a new <Col N="203" /> vocational education school in Castle-pollard.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Fitzsimons of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister of State with responsibility for the Arts to consider reversing the decision to introduce admission charges for the Treasury Gallery in the National Museum.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to review the speed limits on roads.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator FitzGerald of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to review the decision to close the Royal City of Dublin Hospital, Baggot Street; the Adelaide Hospital and the Meath Hospital.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator B. Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The widescale practice of requiring members of the travelling community to &ldquo;sign on&rdquo; at labour exchanges for social assistance at a fixed time.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Connor of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to have investigated (i) the failure of his Department to inspect the house of an applicant &mdash; details supplied &mdash; in Castlerea, County Roscommon for the home improvement grant, application for which was received in his Department on 9 May 1986 and (ii) the delay by his Department in providing a final inspection for the new house grant of an applicant &mdash; details supplied &mdash; in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, the request for which was made in March of this year.</P>
    <P>I regard the matter raised by Senators Cassidy, Fitzsimons, Daly, FitzGerald, <Col N="204" /> Ryan and Connor as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Cassidy's matter for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded. Senators Fitzsimons, Daly, FitzGerald, Ryan and Connor may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>We would like to know the Order of Business for tomorrow. Is it proposed to continue with the Control of Clinical Trials Bill, if not completed, and the Status of Children Bill tomorrow morning? If the Second Stages of these two Bills are completed today, what is the Order of Business for tomorrow? I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senators who try to raise matters of public urgency. I hope that in the future we will be able to organise ourselves so that matters of extreme urgency can be debated in the House under Standing Order 29. It should not be left to Ministers to decide whether motions can be taken under that Standing Order.</P>

      <P>I should like to respond to Senator Lanigan. It is anticipated that the Control of Clinical Trials Bill, 1986, will conclude this afternoon. We expect to continue with the Status of Children Bill, 1986, in the morning. After lunch tomorrow, we will take the report of the Joint Commitee on Women's Rights, the portrayal of women in the media, and the report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses, the insurance problems of small businesses.</P>

      <P>I would like to know when the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1986, will be proceeded with? It is important that this Bill should proceed in view of recent alarming events. In the light of the current situation which means that many issues are left in no-man's land, I am anxious that this Bill should be brought before the House and debated fully at the earliest possible date as a matter of urgency. Should time permit tomorrow, consideration should be given to proceeding on to this item in view of the urgency and the nature of the matter involved.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Acting Leader of the House has said about tomorrow's Order of Business, I understand that the Status of Children Bill is to be taken in the morning until lunch time.

      <P>I want to ask the Acting Leader of the House when it is proposed to take the Air Pollution Bill conjointly with Item No. 7, the debate on the report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on acid rain. It is essential that we debate these two points because of what happened during the summer at Chernobyl and what has been happening on an ongoing basis with the Nirex projects in England, with Sellafield and the latest very serious accident in the Atlantic involving the Russian submarine. Taking those two motions together is of the utmost and urgent importance.</P>

This one does and I am disappointed that it is not to be discussed in this House. I should like to ask you, a Chathaoirligh, to raise another matter. I see that there are a number of notices about on Adjournment Matters.

We were promised here for the last three years by this Coalition Government that we would have this Bill before us. We have been put off on various occasions by the Leader saying that he was going to the Minister.

      <P>That is in the present term. Senator McGuinness raised the question of the Order of Business for tomorrow. The Leader of the House is leaving time for the Status of Children Bill open-ended, so it is being allocated whatever time is necessary. If that Stage is concluded before lunch time tomorrow, we will then move on to Second Stage, possibly next week. Air pollution as raised by Senator Lanigan and the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation have been the subjects of two very important reports. We would hope to have them debated in the Seanad as early as possible. I would remind Senators that from our Order Paper there is quite a number of motions from the joint committee for discussion here and on Thursdays we hope to take as many of those as possible.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend spending very much time on this Bill though it is a Bill of major importance. Many people have been concerned for many years about the preparation of drugs and their availability on the market. It is essential that we have control over the means by which drugs are produced. Unfortunately, nobody has yet come up with the ideal solution to the many problems associated with the production of drugs. It would appear, essentially, that drugs are prepared and put on the market after testing, either on animals or on humans or, as happens in many cases, on both animals and humans. Unfortunately, when we have testing involving either animals or humans difficulties will arise and mistakes will be made. Sometimes these mistakes are made because of human error or because of insufficient testing in the area of ascertaining whether the recipient of the drug is a suitable subject for administration of the drug concerned.</P>
      <P>I am not familiar with the procedures that are adopted in other countries before drugs are tested on either animals or humans but I am aware that tests were carried out on animals at the general hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, so that the medical people might find out how death by instant heart attack occurs. I felt that the work that was being carried out on these animals was cruel and inhuman though inhuman may be a peculiar word to use when talking about trials being done on animals. I would not advocate such trials. Unfortunately, much publicity has been given to the control of trials on humans. In this country emphasis has been placed on this aspect of drug testing as a result of the unfortunate death in Dublin of a young man during clinical trials. To many it would seem that the controls over these trials were inadequate and that something has to be done to ensure that such incidents would not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of what sort of controls we bring in there is no precise way of controlling what might happen in the future. Nevertheless we have to try to bring in controls which may alleviate any <Col N="209" /> problem that may arise. Nobody would disagree with the need for control but it is the method by which the control is brought in which leaves some apprehension about this Bill.</P>
    <P>A volume of literature has been sent to everybody in this House in relation to this Bill. Some of the papers we received have been concerned with professional attitudes. Some deal with commercial attitudes and quite a number of people have been in touch with us in terms of social attitudes and social problems relating to people who become involved in the trials associated with the production of drugs. No satisfactory method has been found yet whereby drugs can be adequately tested unless they are tested on animals and humans. No matter what we do here, we are basically just trying to give effect to the best method of dealing with trials which will be conducted on humans.</P>
    <P>The problems associated with this Bill are many and a number of questions have to be asked. A major concern is that proven drugs are being treated exactly the same as previously unknown drugs. It is ridiculous that a drug which has already been proven but which is undergoing a test as to its suitability for other purposes must go through further tests under the same regime as the testing which would go on for drugs which have never been on the market before. Will the Minister have a look at that aspect because it is one which could cause great financial reprecussions within the drug trade.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to subject the new drugs to tests so stringent as to render them seriously out of line with all other EC countries. It is proposed to subject to a very strict regime proven or off patent drugs which have been available on prescription to the Irish patient for a minimum of 16 years, even though these drugs would have conformed with all the EC regulations, and passed the trials which have been conducted by the Food and Drug Administration Board in America.</P>
    <P>There is a native Irish industry which concentrates itself mainly on generic drugs, basically unproven drugs. It is the <Col N="210" /> stated policy of the Minister and the Department of Health to encourage generic prescriptions because of their cheapness and their benefit to the State, because they are used in an import substitution area. There could be major problems for the firms involved in the production of these drugs if an amendment is not made to this legislation. There are on average between 30 and 40 applications per year from the generic companies to the National Drugs Advisory Board and when they are passed, they get a certificate of free sale in the Republic. More importantly, this certificate conveys automatic free sale in every country outside the EC, EFTA, USA and Canada. Without these certificates our native industries could not export, which is 90 per cent of their business. The generic drug manufacturing companies suggest that if they were to get involved fully under the regime brought in by the Minister, each of these trials would cost in the region of £25,000, because of delays in getting into production due to the test procedures and so on. There is a fear amongst companies such as Antigen who have been here for some time that they would have to pay up to £25,000 to test and produce a drug which has already been fully tested and manufactured to stringent manufacturing standards.</P>
    <P>From the social point of view a lot of play has been made about the people who are going to be used as guinea pigs in these trials. It is suggested that 90 per cent of these people come from the underprivileged classes and only undertake these trials to supplement their very meagre incomes and that they are not suitable because they do not look at the reasoning behind the trials, do not look into the dangers associated with the trials and are not in any way capable of assimulating the information necessary to find out whether they are suitable condidates for the trials or indeed whether the trials could be of grave danger to them. Many of the people who would be tested in these clinical trials would be socially deprived. The fact of people being on social welfare or being socially <Col N="211" /> deprived does not mean they are not capable of assimilating information and therefore not suitable. Ninety per cent of people on unemployment assistance or on social welfare benefits would have a very good realisation of the difficulties and the dangers involved in these clinical trials. Some people getting involved in body contact sports and dangerous sports would have a lesser realisation of the dangers involved in these sports than do 90 per cent of the people who are involved in trials.</P>
    <P>There must be controls. The National Drugs Advisory Board were the controlling body for a number of years. They have issued the certificates and they have been applauded as being the experts in the area. I cannot see why they should be superseded by ethical committees which would be set up by the companies doing the trials. It would not be fair in a hurling match if one of the teams supplied the referee. It is unfair and unworkable for a company to set up an ethical committee to adjudicate on itself with the Minister coming in then as a final adjudicator. The National Drugs Advisory Board should give the certificates of competency to the drug so far as is possible. Neither the Minister nor his officials, unless the Minister sets up a new bureaucracy, would have the expertise in this matter. To give the Minister the sole responsibility will cause delays, and delays are costly when it comes to manufacturing. The companies who are manufacturing want to get their new products on line as fast as is possible and to wait for a busy Minister to give his signature to a new drug is flying in the face of reality. If it is not to delay matters, it means that we will have somebody in the Minister's office taking over the responsibility, because the Minister will just put his signature to things. It appears as if Mr. Flanagan in the Department is now in charge of everything that happens; he seems to be announcing hospitals. He says he is going to announce his new plans for health within the next five weeks.</P>

      <P>It is still the Minister's responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the Minister will not have the time to sign and to read the documentation necessary to control drugs, that he will pass it on to some committee or some individual because if he does not he will spend his time sitting down as a drugs advisory board and I would presume the Minister would have responsibilities other than that. The National Drugs Advisory Board are an excellent board and should be left with the responsibility in this matter. They do a very good job.</P>
      <P>Nobody has been able under any circumstances to criticise a drug which the National Drugs Advisory Board have passed as being fit for manufacture and for sale. There is in the medical profession a concern about the scope of this Bill which encompasses not alone new drugs but all established drugs in everyday medical practice, including those that can be bought without a prescription, normal food substances and vitamins. Not alone will ministerial permission be required for the payment of the fee for normal medical and dental student education in practical classes, but also for studies involving simple dietary changes. The Minister said these everyday drugs, normal food substances and vitamins are not brought within the ambit of this Bill, but nevertheless there are dietary preparations which can be very dangerous. Even though some of them are on the market and in normal day to day use, they are not under any control at present. Some of them are dangerous and some of them are not. There may be a problem in the area of vitamins. A distinction must be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said doctors who keep a note of the effects of particular drugs on particular patients will not come within the ambit of this Bill. There is within the medical profession an apprehension that that can happen. This would stop day to day monitoring by doctors in their surgeries. If this happens it will have to be replaced by something much more <Col N="213" /> expensive. Everybody involved in the manufacture of drugs appreciates the problems that could arise if they produce something that is not suitable for human consumption. Accidents have occurred over the years as a result of drugs available on the market which are extremely dangerous. This has caused major problems such as the thalidomide problem and a series of other problems. I am not suggesting that they were inadequately tested, but it was proven that side effects could occur and these side effects did not immediately come to the fore. You have to have controls. I do not think that there will ever be a 100 per cent success rate with these controls.</P>
    <P>Drug companies naturally want to safeguard their own employment and their own profitability. The only way they can do this is to produce drugs which are safe. Nobody can suggest that the drugs which are under test in Ireland or the manufacturing companies in the generic area have ever created any problems for the public or for people receiving particular drugs. If there is a commercial aspect to this, so what? Are we so anti-profit, anti-job and anti-business at present that we are prepared to take the chance of losing quite a number of very highly paid, highly skilled jobs? There is an element in this Bill which could cause that, not least of which are the new insurance regulations which it is intended to introduce. Anybody in business today who tries to get public liability or specific liability insurance on a limited basis will know the cost of that insurance. It is virtually impossible to get an open-ended insurance policy. Basically that is what will happen if we bring in the type of insurance envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A further safeguard in relation to persons undergoing drug experiments is provided in section 9. This requires that the person arranging for the conduct of a clinical trial must see to it that there is in force a policy of insurance, issued by an authorised insurer, which would be sufficient to provide appropriate compensation in the event of the participant suffering injury or loss. This is nonsense <Col N="214" /> because nobody could judge a participant's injury or loss as a result of trials taking place. The courts and the lawyers could make a fortune out of this during the next few years because anybody who is involved in clinical trials could, because of any medical problem he encountered after that, go to the courts and suggest that his problem was associated with the clinical trial. I cannot see how you can bring insurance into an area where anything else but chaos would exist. It would be a very expensive factor for the people involved in the clinical trials and could be the cause of their going out of business because they could not get the type of cover which the Minister seems to envisage in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how, within the industry, insurance could be funded. I cannot see that it could be bonded. I cannot see how it could be adequately dealt with because if you are talking about bonding in regard to building you take a specific proportion of the actual contract. When talking about the results of medical trials we will be in the same position as in the States where it is virtually impossible for doctors to practise any more because of the cost of their insurances. Many doctors in the States are &ldquo;going naked&rdquo; insurance wise. They are passing over their assets and end up with no assets so that if somebody takes an action against them they have nothing. That is happening on a very large scale. It is happening because nobody knows the limits to which somebody can be sued as a result of a medical accident or medical conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Bill is extremely broad. There are safeguards in it which would provide for the elimination of exploitation of people who would be inadequate in the sense of not being able to read the problems which might arise as a result of becoming involved in clinical trials. Nevertheless, the Bill is too broad in certain areas and too confining in other areas. If this Bill goes through as it is presently constituted it would have major repercussions. The repercussions would not be beneficial to the people who would be going for clinical trials, to the industry which is involved or to the Irish people. For that reason I <Col N="215" /> do not think we should continue with this Bill. It is badly drafted. It is ill conceived in the sense that it was conceived as a result of an incident. A lot more care should have been taken in the drafting of this Bill before it was presented to this House and we should think twice before passing it on to the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill. It is important that we have some controls on all clinical trials. When the Minister introduced Second Stage in this House in the summer the understanding was that his Second Stage speech would form the basis of discussions and response from the many different interested groups and professional bodies. By and large that has happened. The Bill has had considerable notice in the public press. It has been debated to a considerable extent by the health boards and other bodies. In general, many interested sectors of the public have expressed opinions on this Bill. I look forward to the Minister's reply to this Stage. It will set the pace as we go into Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to have controls on all clinical trials. But is it appropriate that the Minister and his Department should control and supervise these trials or that this work and the responsibility be entrusted to an appropriate expert committee such as the National Drugs Advisory Board? I listened with great interest to the debate last week and again today. I know that when this measure was introduced in the summer it did not really come as a surprise to many people here. I get the distinct impression that there were some professional bodies and individuals &mdash; the universities and consultants and professors in various medical colleges &mdash; who expressed disappointment that there had not been very full consultation on this issue. That is not a great issue at this point. The measure is getting a very full and open debate here in the Houses of the Oireachtas and all interested parties have had the opportunity to speak with Members of the House. I am sure that all the views have reached the Minister. I hope that the fears expressed by <Col N="216" /> the various professional people will be allayed by whatever amendments or changes the Minister may propose to this measure.</P>
    <P>I accept that there must be controls over new drugs but how far does this legislation go on all drugs on the market? Do licensed drugs and medicines come under the scope of this Bill? Senator Lanigan has raised many important questions which I had intended to raise. Some consultants have expressed fears as to their future liberty to treat their patients. I should like to specifically ask the Minister if the terms of this Bill relate in any way to the treatment of an ordinary patient in a hospital or is this Bill purely confined to academics or scientists who formally test absolutely new drugs on the market? It is important that there should be a very straight answer to this question. When patients do not respond to a course of treatment, for whatever purpose, does this Bill in any way inhibit a doctor or a consultant from introducing an alternative prescription or medication? I should like to know also if these regulations will inhibit the practice of medicine in our hospitals as we know it up to now.</P>
    <P>The various points raised during the debate so far shows that the professional people concerned fear this will greatly change the practice as it has been up to now. Section 9 on insurance is a new regulation which is causing not just apprehension but alarm among people who find it very difficult to continue to face the probability of being unable to get insurance cover to continue in their profession. This is one of the areas where prior consultation by the Department and the Minister would have allayed the fears of people whose situation will be greatly changed when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>It is important that the legislation in this area should be updated and the greatest possible protection given to all concerned. It is important that people who work in the medical profession, who work so hard to find new cures for modern illnesses, should not in any way be inhibited. While I accept that there must <Col N="217" /> be the greatest possible controls and constraints, there must be a happy medium whereby scientists, consultants and doctors can be assisted and their role and effort not made impossible. For that reason I should like to make this brief intervention now because it is very important to us on all sides of the House to hear the Minister's reply to this Second Stage debate. I am confident that the Minister, who has shown an aptitude for steering his Department in a very determined way, will meet many of the problems that some people now see as almost insurmountable.</P>
    <P>I was listening last week with great interest to Senator Robb who introduced quite a different tone to the debate. So, very much as a layman with very little experience of hospitalisation I wait with interest to see how this Bill stands after Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first of all to welcome very much the fact that this Bill is one of a series of Bills coming to the Seanad before the Dáil. As other speakers have said, I hope we in ths House can do justice to it. It is a Bill which in party-political terms is non-contentious, but in terms of vested interests outside the House, very contentious indeed. I hope this Bill, like other Bills such as the Archives Bill, will be amended in this House and will go to the Dáil in a different form which will give this House an important role in the Oireachtas which it has not had before.</P>
      <P>In prefacing my remarks on this Bill I should say I am sorry one of the strange facts of the composition of this House is that there is only one doctor in it. The other House has a large number of doctors in it. We had a contribution from Senator Robb last week. I do not know whether it is a good or a bad thing, but we cannot put any great expertise into the discussion of this Bill because of the lack of medical people in this House which is unfortunate but cannot be helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill like everybody else who has spoken. I recognise the motives of those who wanted a <Col N="218" /> Bill of this sort. I welcome their wish to protect healthy volunteers who are undertaking clinical trials because that is the motive behind the Bill. In practice, I am afraid I would agree with those speakers on this side, the Opposition side of this House, who find that the details of this Bill have turned out to be completely unacceptable. The Bill seems to be &mdash; although I am assured to the contrary by those who were involved in the drafting of it &mdash; a reaction to a particular tragedy known as the Rush case. That is what the public perception of it will be because there was enormous public disquiet as a result of that tragedy. That case certainly pointed to the need for statutory controls over clinical trials which we do not have at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am afraid this Bill is a devastating over-reaction to that Rush case. In their wish to protect healthy volunteers undergoing clinical trials, the Government &mdash; and those who drafted this Bill &mdash; have done a large amount of damage by obstructing medical progress. One only has to look at the vast number of submissions which Members of this House have already received from the medical profession, from research institutions, from the universities and from other interested bodies, all unanimously hostile to this Bill and worried about it, all welcoming the idea of protecting those who are undergoing clinical trials but feeling that this Bill in its present form will obstruct medical science and research in this country, although it was not intended to do that at any stage. That is why I hope it will go to the Dáil either amended or in a completely different form.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe what I have heard from many doctors. I would like to know what consultations the Department had with doctors on this. With whom did they have discussions? The submissions I have received would indicate that the consultations with the medical profession were very scanty. If there had been serious consultation with the medical profession there would not be the sort of irate, alarmed protestations which we are receiving at the moment from that profession. There probably was a certain <Col N="219" /> amount of hurry, a certain amount of rushed drafting of this Bill which has created a precarious and dangerous situation for medical progress in this country.</P>
    <P>The emphasis is rightly on the protection of those who are undertaking clinical trials but there is very little balance in the Bill. If it is to mean anything it has to be balanced or it ought to be withdrawn. The consequence of this Bill could well be, in obstructing medical research, the opposite to what its intention is. The consequence of obstructing medical research could well be that there will be more deaths in this country rather than less. The consequence could be that in trying to protect those who undergo clinical trials we actually obstruct medical progress and cause more deaths as a result.</P>
    <P>Drug testing is a very emotive subject. I listened last week to some of the speeches, including Senator Brendan Ryan's very good speech, which were antagonistic to the sort of drug testing which is going on in this country at the moment. He mentioned the sort of people who were often the objects of these clinical trials. It is regularly and often rightly said that it is the most vulnerable in society who are being subjected to these tests, that is, the poor, the homeless, the unemployed, the weak and the under-nourished. I think that is true. Without any doubt the majority of those who are undergoing these tests are from the under-privileged sections of our society. I went down recently, to the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, about which there has been a great deal of controversy, to see how that institute worked. First, I have no doubt as a layman that the standard of medicine, care and cleanliness was absolutely impeccable in that place. I also did a spot check by going down to interview some of those socalled volunteers for these clinical trials. That was extremely interesting, and it bears out some, but not all, of what Senator Brendan Ryan says. The majority of those to whom I talked were unemployed, but not all of them. I talked to about 12 people and ten of them were <Col N="220" /> unemployed. Two of them were doing it because they had time off for various reasons and they wanted to earn some money. Very few of them were in the slightest bit fearful about what was going to happen to them. Those going for the first time were apprehensive, as anybody would naturally be.</P>
    <P>I understand the criticisms of those who say that this is immoral because they are doing it for financial inducements &mdash; not for much financial inducement but because they are vulnerable, poor and need the money. Senator Ryan's very valid point was that they do not make a free choice because they are under financial pressure. That is true, although I am not sure that anybody ever makes a free choice about anything because he or she is under some pressure, but everybody who has spoken on this Bill has accepted that these tests are essential, that you cannot scrap them, that you must test drugs on human beings.</P>
    <P>If we are to condemn the system as it works at the moment at the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology or in any other of these institutes, as a society and a Government we will have to produce a different means of testing. We will have to put an obligation on certain human beings to subject themselves to these trials. Maybe, as was suggested to me when I went down there, every citizen should give three, four or five days of his or her life towards these clinical trials. Maybe citizens should have the same sort of obligations to this as they have to jury service. Maybe everybody should give a very short period, a few days of his or her life undergoing these clinical trials in order to benefit the rest of mankind. Maybe we should look at such a system, but let us not criticise the system which works at the moment unless we have a substitute. Those who go there may not like what they are doing, but they are doing it voluntarily. It is patronising to say that the unemployed cannot give true consent because they are under financial pressure or because they cannot read. In my experience there it was fully explained to them the tests they were going under, how long they would be there, <Col N="221" /> what the effects were likely to be and everything else that they asked. It is absurd to say that because they are underprivileged they do not understand and cannot give full consent. They may be under greater pressure, but it is highly patronising to say that they cannot give full consent. In my experience they know exactly what is happening to them. A calm assessment is what is needed. We should stand back and look at the system of clinical trials on human beings.</P>
    <P>To dispel some of the fears expressed, let me say that all of them are examined after they are discharged. This is important because many have felt that, although they do not suffer or very rarely suffer under the influence of these trials because they are receiving very close medical attention, may be they go off and suffer after-effects. That may or may not be true, but I know that following their discharge they are all assessed by an independent physician who is not in the pay of the clinic involved. They are safeguarded in that none of them is allowed to do more than three trials per year and if they reappear for a second or third trial or at any trial subsequent to their first they are thoroughly examined to see if there are any new medical reasons why they should not undergo this trial or whether there are nay after-effects from the last trial.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would be unwise to be hysterical about what is going on. It would be right to be careful, circumspect and vigilant, but I do not feel that these institutions which we are talking about are the sort of wicked ones that they are portrayed to be, the exploiters they are and have been portrayed as being by some Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Certainly they are making money, and that is a different matter. We must decide whether people should be allowed to make money out of clinical medicine, whether it is moral for pharmaceutical companies to pay large sums of money to doctors to find out the effects of certain medicines. If people can produce alternative methods to this House or anywhere else, let them say so and let us look at them, but at the moment that is <Col N="222" /> the system as it works and, to the best of my knowledge and, obviously, in the belief of most Members of this House and those who drafted the Bill, it is contributing to the saving of human lives in this country and abroad.</P>
    <P>Balance is lacking in certain places in the Bill, where medical research is being impeded at the expense of the medical profession in research. The first point in this has been touched on by other Senators regarding the ethics committees being set up. In several of the submissions I have received doctors are up in arms about the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of these ethics committees. According to this Bill <i>ad hoc</i> ethics committees should be set up for each trial. In not only my opinion but in everybody's opinion, this will lead to enormous and excessive delays. Every single trial will have to have a new ethics committee set up and they will have to discuss things and come up with a verdict. It will take time, it will impede medical progress and it will impede chemical trials. That is not satisfactory. That is clumsy and absurd. I do not see why this should be put in the Bill. I suspect that it is because of the Department's and the Minister's real concern about each test and their wish to monitor it, but I think that they will find (a) this is unnecessary and (b) it is obstructive.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister must give permission for each of these ethics committees to be set up. This appears crazy. For the Minister to examine the ethics committee and the trial and then to give permission will, of course, delay matters. What I would like to see put in the Bill, if the Bill is to stay at all in this form, is the criteria the Minister is going to use under section 7 (1) for saying yea or nay to these committees being set up.</P>
    <P>The other objection I have received to the ethics committee is a very strange one, that is the excessive influence which the applicant, the person carrying out the trial, will have on the composition of the ethics committee. This seems a very unfair and unbalanced way of setting up ethics committees. While on the one hand the Minister wants to set up impartial ethics committees with no vested <Col N="223" /> interests in the trial, independent ethics committees, it then appears, according to this Bill, that the applicant has the right to nominate the members of and the right to apply for changes in the ethics committee. It would be far more sensible if the ethics committee were to be nominated by a totally independent body &mdash; the Minister or people who have no vested interest in this trial. It seems absurd that the person who wants to carry out the trial is also nominating those who will say what he can and cannot do.</P>
    <P>One of the great disadvantages of this Bill is that ministerial power is too great. While I do not begrudge such power to this Minister for Health, who has been a very good Minister for Health in my view and who would not abuse it, in terms of precedent and in terms of the future, it is wrong to give statutory long term permanent ministerial power of this sort to anyone. If anything, we should try to reduce ministerial power rather than increase it, especially because the Minister will not have time, and he will not necessarily have the expertise, to judge when an ethics committee should be set up and when a trial should or should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>The best solution to this problem is that standing ethics committees should be set up in those institutions which would, in the normal course of events, be applying for permission to the Minister to do a clinical trial. These standing ethics committees should be set up in hospitals, research institutions, universities, etc, to judge every single individual trial as it appears in those particular institutions. This would mean there would be no delay. If, say, there was one such committee in Dublin University and in each individual hospital, then the individual doing the trial in that institution could immediately apply to the standing ethics committee which is there <i>in situ.</i> This would avoid the whole business of applying to the Minister, with the Minister watching the ethics committee being set up and then approving it. Goodness knows how long it will take for the trial to actually take place after that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> There has been a great deal of resentment about the fact that the National Drugs Advisory Board have been left out of the Bill. Instead of the function and the role being played by the National Drugs Advisory Board, most of these powers are handed to the Minister and indirectly to the Department. While the Minister said in his Second Stage speech in May &mdash; and I do not for one moment doubt his word &mdash; that it was his intention to consult with the NDAB, I do not think this is good enough, because it gives no statutory role to the NDAB. I believe the NDAB are a distinguished body who acquitted themselves extremely well in the past and should not have been treated in this fashion. The NDAB, on their record, deserves a statutory role. Whatever assurances the Minister gives us that he wishes to consult them on this &mdash; and I am sure they are given with the best of intent &mdash; we cannot make law on the basis of one Minister's assurances of consultation. The NDAB should be written into the Bill and should be given some of the powers which the Minister has taken on himself. They are the body who should consider the applications for clinical trials, not the Minister and indirectly the Department.</P>
    <P>The Bill could be amended, if it is not withdrawn, on this particular issue to specify what would justify a refusal by the Minister to allow a clinical trial, because in this Bill the Minister can refuse without giving any reason. The Bill could be amended to require the Minister to give reasons for his refusal. In other words, if he says no to a clinical trial then he must publicly state why so that the medical profession can know what the reasons are. The logical follow on to that is that an appeals body should be set up if this system is to continue as it stands in the Bill at the moment. In other words, when a refusal is made public, the Minister must be required to give his reasons and the applicant for a clinical trial can then appeal it to another body. Lastly, the Minister should spell out the criteria which ought to be used beforehand in deciding whether clinical trials are to be allowed. While the Bill is <Col N="225" /> too wide it is also too vague and gives too much power without any accountability. I hope there will be Government amendments rather than independent amendments to change this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The medical profession has been alarmed at the width of the Bill and the enormous depth to which the Minister casts his net in this Bill. Some interpretations are that it will take in all dietary studies, studies of medicines which are already on the market. I believe this was probably unintentional. It would be far too wide if those conducting clinical trials had to apply for permission to carry out tests on diets, on asprins, or on other pills which are already on the market. There does not appear to be &mdash; and this is very necessary &mdash; any distinction between new drugs, which will obviously have to be subject to the most stringent controls and drugs which are already well established and on the market. It is absurd that the drugs which are established and approved by the NDAB as harmless in many ways should have to go through the same process as those drugs which have not been established. I hope these problems will be dealt with on Committee Stage and that a distinction will be made between the two.</P>
    <P>The Bill appears to have been drafted for healthy people who are volunteering to test various drugs, not the sick who are the subject of clinical trials. It does not appear to cover those who are terminally ill or those who are ill with serious diseases. It appears to rule out many trials which are absolutely necessary not only for the sick but for the medical profession who want to find out how to relieve pain and suffering. In this sense we are completely out of line with international thinking and the laws in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The main objection to this Bill is the bureaucracy which would be involved and the obstruction to medical research which would result. Under this Bill the Minister is required to give permission &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; for a clinical trial. That is unacceptable to the medical <Col N="226" /> profession; it is unacceptable to the nursing profession; and it is unacceptable, I am sure, to those who are undergoing these clinical trials because &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; in the Bill means absolutely nothing. It means when the Minister feels like it. That could mean a week, a year, two years or five years, or the trial could be indefinitely delayed. The Bill should specify a fixed period for this permission to be given. I would like to see in this Bill a fixed timetable of stages with no vague periods leading to delays. Under this Bill the Minister should have to give permission within a certain time. The medical profession suggested 28 days but that may be too short. If there are too many applications it may be difficult for the Department to process them all within 28 days, but within a very short period of time it is not unreasonable to ask that this should happen. Otherwise they will be left in files, requests will sit on shelves and complicated applications will not be tackled. We should not give a Government or a Department and excuse or an out of this kind. If they are going to take on this responsibility &mdash; which I do not think they should have &mdash; they should be made to exercise it within a reasonable time. This Bill, while it gives them the responsibility, also gives them an out and they only have to exercise that responsibility when they feel like it. In reality the Bill gives them an out not to exercise that responsibility because &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; means that they can delay it for as long as they wish and they do not have to make any awkward decisions.</P>
    <P>There is no time limit on the Minister's approval of the timing of a clinical trial, of the composition of an ethics committee or the deliberations of the ethics committee. It is important, without putting a gun to their heads, without rushing this very serious business, that there should be a timetable. These trials are urgent, they are matters which are directed towards relieving pain and saving lives and it is important if this work is to be done that it should be done to a timetable.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the intention behind the Bill, it has serious drawbacks to the promotion of medical research and will <Col N="227" /> be a massive and major impediment to medical research. This is the belief of many doctors from whom I have received submissions. It is suitable only in protecting what are known as phase 1 volunteers, healthy volunteers on new drugs. However, it is unsuitable in its present form in regard to established drugs. It is unsuitable to those who are sick or terminally ill. It is totally unsuitable to medical school students where it is normal practice that trials should be carried out under strict supervision. It is totally unsuitable to dietary studies. It is the right idea, the right motivation, but it is so wide that it would be an impediment to medical research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like first of all to give a general welcome to the Bill as representing the embodiment of the principle which now seems to be established, that there should be public control of clinical trials. This seems now to be accepted by all parties and all interest groups, both inside and outside this House. I am sure when the matter is discussed in the other House that the same general welcome will be afforded to the Bill. Therefore, anything I have to say should be seen against the background that the Minister can be quite happy that we on this side of the House will give it our usual support, subject of course to the scrutiny of the legislation which is an essential part of the democratic process. In that regard I would like to repeat what I said on earlier occasions, that this Minister has been more willing than most to listen to reasoned arguments in this House and in the other House and to amend Bills where the case was shown to be significant and important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to home in on three aspects of the Bill, each of which has been dealt with at some length by other speakers. It is not my intention to go into those aspects of the Bill at any great length. In passing Second Stage of the Bill, as I have no doubt we will, it is well that the Minister should be placed on notice of our intention to pursue certain matters on Committee Stage. One of the purposes of <Col N="228" /> the Second Stage of any legislation is to afford the Minister the opportunity of taking the temperature of the various interest groups which are represented in this House and the political parties which overlap and are intertwined with those interest groups and which all together from the patchwork quilt which is Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>The first aspect of the Bill I would like to deal with is the decision-making process taken by the Minister and how this should fit into the overall structure of the Bill. The second aspect is the problems posed by the representations which we all have received concerning the structure of the ethics committee. The third aspect is the problem associated with the insurance requirements of the Bill. Other drafting points are more appropriate for Committee Stage. It would be helpful to Members if the Minister when replying dealt with the principal points made, so that in putting down amendments, or indeed not putting down amendments if we are satisfied with the Minister's reply, we would be afforded an early opportunity to examine the Minister's point of view on these matters.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill contain the proposals under which the Minister should be the person to whom applications will be made to undertake clinical trials and to whom responsibility will be given &mdash; whether it is after reasonable delay or as soon as practical is a matter which we can discuss on Committee Stage &mdash; to decide whether a clinical trial should proceed. I would like to contrast that with the section of the Minister's speech which was quoted by Senator Mullooly at column 102, Volume 114 of the Official Report of 2 October 1986:</P>
    <P>While formal approval will be a matter for the Minister, he will rely on the expert advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board in arriving at his decisions. It is the intention that all applications will be referred to the board for assessment and for recommendations as to any conditions which should be attached to his approval.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> That is right and proper. I am not concerned that the National Drugs Advisory Board is not referred to by name in the Bill but I would like to ask the Minister if that is a sensible procedure to adopt. Might it not be better for the Minister to build into this or other legislation a procedure whereby the National Drugs Advisory Board or some body of that kind would adopt a permanent overseeing role with regard to the reception and processing of applications subject, of course, to overall ministerial control and direction? I am not suggesting that the Minister should divest himself of the power which he proposes to take, that he should not have the power either to accede to or refuse a clinical trial but because the Minister has that power it does not mean that he cannot establish and pass on to a subsidiary body the day to day decisions which can be taken, retaining to himself the overall control. The Minister should give serious consideration to that compromise suggestion between those who believe that he should exercise total control and those who believe that the control should be exercised independently by a body such as the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised to ponder what happened over planning permissions. He will be well aware that originally a Minister got himself involved, as a result of the Planning Act, 1963, in the day to day planning decisions. The burden of that decision, in particualr the burden imposed by the courts in directing that the Minister, or his Parliamentary Secretary, had to personally consider each application, was that an obligation was imposed on the Minister which overwhelmed him politically and physically. Eventually, for that and other reasons, the Minister had to shift this responsibility to the Planning Appeals Board while retaining to himself certain rights and privileges to even overrule, direct or instruct in one way or another the Planning Appeals Board. The Minister for Health may find himself in the position where he will have to consider every application and in those circumstances I wonder if this is wise. I am not suggesting <Col N="230" /> that the Minister should not have the power to do so but I am suggesting that the Minister should seriously consider the establishment of an intermediate body to process the overwhelming number of applications which will be of a non-controversial nature. He should reserve to himself either items which are referred to him by that body or, alternatively, items which he thinks are important and should be taken away from that body so that he can consider them with the expert advice available to him in the Department. That is a point the Minister should give very serious consideration to.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the Minister that before Committee Stage he should look at the judgment in that case which related to the period of office of Minister Tully. I do not remember the individual case but it related to a ministerial decision. The effect of it was that the Minister was questioned in court and had to swear, as he did because it was true, that he considered the application. In those circumstances the Minister might address that problem and, even if he is satisfied that he does not have to personally examine each application, there is a very strong case to be made for the transferring to the National Drugs Advisory Board, or some such other board, the routine decisions which form an integral part of this worthwhile process.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to make to the Minister is one which has been referred to us by the various interest groups who have lobbied us in this regard. I welcome such representations. It is entirely appropriate that they should take place. I regret that many other interest groups are not as organised to present their point of view because it is only by hearing the point of view of those people who are involved on a day to day basis that we can arrive at a consensus of what is truly in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister in section 2 (1) proposes:</P>
    <P>A person who proposes to arrange for the conducting of a clinical trial shall apply to the Minister for permission...and every application...shall be accompanied by &mdash; (b) the names <Col N="231" /> and respective qualifications of the persons proposed as members of the ethics committee for the clinical trial.</P>
    <P>This has been assumed to mean by those interested and, indeed, by most Senators who contributed to this debate that ethics committees will be proposed on a one by one basis, that each person who wants to conduct a trial will propose their own ethics committee. The Minister may well say, and he may be right, that over a period of time certain people will acquire an expertise in this area and will be nominated frequently on committees of this type.</P>
    <P>Under section 7 where the Minister is satisfied that a proposed ethics committee is competent to consider the justification for a trial he shall give approval to the proposed committee. However, the power rests by and large with the person who proposes the names in the first instance. I realise that the Minister has the power to refuse but in the nature of applications of this kind the tenor and structure of the committee will to a large extent be determined by the original list sent to the Minister. The Minister will find it impractical to start ruling out as ineligible a substantial number of those people who are proposed for the ethics committees and on a realistic basis, the ethics committees will over a period of time be at the choosing of those who propose to conduct the clinical trial. It certainly will happen where a panel of people who have served previously on ethics committees is built up that the choosing of eligible people from that unofficial panel will become a matter for the person who proposes to conduct the clinical trial and the Minister, having previously approved each individual proposed, will find it difficult in that particular instance not to approve them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the structure of the committee, and the personnel of the committee, can be unfairly influenced by the person who proposes to conduct the clinical trial. The Minister is, of course, aware that suggestions have been made to the <Col N="232" /> effect that it would be more appropriate if a central and semi-permanent ethics committee or committees were established from which the Minister, or indeed the person who proposes to arrange the trial, may draw or, alternatively, that a body like the National Drugs Advisory Board should, in addition to being given the power as a matter of routine to approve of clinical trials, be given the power at the same time as so approving to approve of an ethics committee suitable for that trial. In that way a permanent ethics committee for each area of activity could be built up which would be independent of the interests involved in the proposed clinical trial.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a case to answer on that. I am not saying the Minister cannot answer the case but the case requires serious consideration. I would be very interested to hear the Minister's response to that second point.</P>
    <P>The third point to which I should like to refer is the question of insurance. This is not an easy problem to deal with. An attempt to deal with it is made by the Minister in section 9 where it states that:</P>
    <P>(1) A person shall not &mdash; (b) conduct a clinical trial,</P>
    <P>unless there is in force a policy of insurance... sufficient to enable that adequate funds are available to provide appropriate compensation for each participant who may suffer injury or loss as a result of the trial,</P>
    <P>Anybody who is injured will get compensation. What is proposed is a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; insurance. It is appropriate that there should be some insurance cover against negligence and that risk should be capable of being insured. I have some doubts, however, as to whether in certain cases to which I will refer it will be possible to arrange for a system of insurance on a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; basis. It may be possible that those organisations conducting the trial may be able to underwrite, not through a policy of insurance from their own resources, the no-fault element which the Minister feels is an essential part of the protection which those <Col N="233" /> involved should have. However, the Minister would not be satisfied with the underwriting by the institution, whether a health board, the College of Surgeons, a private clinic or any other institution of that kind to which a medical practitioner belongs. He is not satisfied that they should underwrite any claims which might arise in respect of the trials they conduct but he is insisting on a policy insurance to cover all risks, which might be a bit difficult.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred last week to the fact that from time to time treatments are devised of a fairly new or traumatic nature which, because of their uncertain outcome, are first &ldquo;tested&rdquo; on people whose prospects of success without that procedure are virtually nil. For that reason, the first people to receive heart transplants were probably those who least benefited from them, people who were at death's door. They were certainly going to die. They were taking very little risk with their life and were being presented with a possibility of life. It is only as expertise is built up in processes like that those at less risk are included in the trials.</P>
    <P>It probably applies, for example, in the area of cancer that tests of all kinds which could certainly have medical consequences, are tried at frequent intervals. It is right, if it is necessary to try new forms of chemotherapy, new treatments or to administer new drugs, that they should be tried on people who have the least chance of surviving without them. What prospect would there be for a policy of insurance in those cases? Would it be realistic to get a policy of insurance in respect of somebody who is literally at death's door, suffering from cancer, whose only prospect of survival is a treatment which has not yet been fully and completely tested for the general market? In those cases what would be necessary according to this Bill is a policy of insurance, not merely that the hospital or the doctor concerned would say that, if as a result of this treatment somebody, dies, their relatives will be compensated in an appropriate fashion. That would not be sufficient. It would be necessary <Col N="234" /> for a policy of insurance to be underwritten by an authorised insurer within the meaning of certain specified regulations and that this authorised insurer would guarantee to this person or to his or her relatives that if he or she dies as a result of this treatment then appropriate compensation will be paid on a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; basis. In such circumstances there would be no negligence attached to the administration of a drug.</P>
    <P>In these cases does the Minister really think it is right that because it could not be called anything else, such a trial, should be delayed until such time as a policy of insurance could be effected? I do not think that is reasonable or practicable and section 9 does not meet these problems. All my instincts as a lawyer are against &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; liability because &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; liability, while grand in theory, places less importance on the care of the person carrying out the operation or the action which gives rise to the possibility of damage. I am not satisfied that &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; insurance is in the long term interest of the people but if &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; cover is what is needed the Minister must address the problem of the kind outlined by me where a substance or preparation would be administered partly in order to help the person but also for the purpose of a clinical trial and not necessarily as a result of that trial. If the person dies and nobody can say for certain whether it was as a result of the trial how could a policy of insurance cover such an eventuality?</P>
    <P>They are the main points which I should like the Minister to address when he closes the debate on this Stage. There is, however, one small additional matter to which I should like to refer, the extraordinarily long title of the Bill, which is of the most detailed kind and gives rise to concerns. One would expect the long title of the Bill to say something like, &ldquo;a Bill entitled an Act to provide for clinical trials, etc.&rdquo; or something like that, a short title, but it goes into extraordinary details as follows:</P>
    <P>An Act to provide for control over the administration of one or more substances or preparations to persons for <Col N="235" /> the purpose of ascertaining the effects of the administration of such substances or preparations on those persons where such administration may have a medical or harmful effect...</P>
    <P>One of the controversies on Committee Stage will be whether the word &ldquo;medical&rdquo; should be included. If it is in the long title how will that affect our ability to amend the Bill? Will somebody say that, because the long title is so detailed, to change and omit the word &ldquo;medical&rdquo; where it occurs &mdash; and it occurs in section 5 (2) of the Bill &mdash; goes against the principle of the Bill as passed by the House on Second Stage? That is a matter for concern. The definition of the conduct of a clinical trial included in section 5 (2) should not have been put into the title of the Bill. Instead, the words &ldquo;clinical trial&rdquo; should have been put into the long title of the Bill so that the definition could be changed on Committee Stage. It is inappropriate that the long title of the Bill should contain something which is in itself used as a definition within the Bill. That is a technical matter which I bring to the attention of the Chair, because it is important to realise that in supporting the Second Stage of this Bill I am not necessarily supporting the conduct of a clinical trial as defined in section 5(2). Therefore, the inclusion of a substantial portion of that definition within the long title of the Bill should not be taken, certainly in my case, as giving approval to that particular definition of what a clinical trial is.</P>
    <P>That having been said, the constructive attitude shown by the Minister in introducing this legislation, the detailed examination which it has received on Second Stage by this House and which it will no doubt receive by this House on Committee and Report Stages, means that by the time it leaves this House and goes to the Dáil it should be a better Bill. I am hopeful that the consideration of the Committee Stage of this Bill can take place in the near future. I would not like <Col N="236" /> the Minister to leave his first term of office next October without having&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My contribution will be very brief because many of the areas I should like to deal with have already been covered and there is no point in going over the same ground again. Also, it is an area where considerable expertise is required, which I do not have. I recognise that it is an important Bill and I can extend to it the general welcome Senator O'Leary extended to it. I will have to stop short, like other Members on this side of the House, of a full and total welcome.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald commended the Minister on his aptitude in steering his Department in a very determined way. I have no doubt he intended that phrase as a tribute to the Minister. It could also be taken in a pejorative sense. I have no doubt that everybody appreciates the wholehearted characteristics of this Minister. They are evident in the dismantling of the health services, in the denuding the hospitals of facilities and equipment and in the drastic reduction in hospital space.</P>

      <P>What I am saying, and what has been said here not in so many words, is that the Minister does not know when to stop in any area. This Bill apparently has been produced without the necessary consultation. Indeed, much consultation would be necessary in this area. The Bill goes too far. It will impede rather than improve the situation in some areas. The point Senator Fallon made was that in many areas the Bill goes too far. Perhaps, in some areas it could go further and representations have been made in this regard. In essential areas the Bill goes too far. Nobody denies that there is a need for the legislation. In the representations that have been made to us by the experts this is clearly acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Experimentation, unfortunately, is necessary however distasteful it may be. The great strides made in the area of medicine and preventive medicine have been the result of experimentation. It is an emotive issue. This has been covered very thoroughly by Senator Fallon and by other Members of the House and I will not pursue that line. With regard to the title which has been dealt with in some detail by Senator O'Leary, substances and preparations are specifically covered so that it appears that ministerial approval for normal dietary studies will be essential. This is a mistake. The result will be bureaucracy, delays, frustration and unnecessary interference. Some Members on the other side of the House had reservations about the Bill. I have no doubt that it will be passed on Second Stage but we on this side will have a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tribute should be paid to the National Drugs Advisory Board for the work they have done and their unique expertise. Unfortunately, they are not <Col N="238" /> mentioned in the Bill. This is a mistake. Their role should be enchanced in keeping with the important work they have done and are doing rather than denigrated by omission from the Bill. As other Members have said, representations have been made to us in relation to this Bill as, indeed, for most Bills that pass through this House. I would like to refer very briefly to some of the bodies and individuals who have made representations to us. First of all, we had representations from Elan Corporation plc who have an address in Athlone and the following sets out the details about this firm. The information is supplied by Professor Joseph Masterson.</P>
    <P>In brief there are 140 people directly employed and 1,200 hotel bed nights annually are catered for by foreign visiting clients. Of course, the Irish airlines are used. In total, the mainly local contribution of this firm amounts to £6 million per annum. That is a very considerable sum. It is interesting to consider what they have to say. The company's economic achievements and considerable international reputation depend critically, they tell us, on timely, efficient and fastidious performance of studies at the company's clinic. Elan state categorically that their guidelines for the conduct of these investigations not only conform to those proposed in the Bill but also fulfil the requirements of the most demanding regulatory authorities worldwide. I would like to quote one paragraph in a letter from the chairman and chief executive officer. It is as follows:</P>
    <P>We can not accept without protest, the imposition of a bureaucratic superstructure, with all that this implies for delays and impaired efficiency on an essential scientific function which always operates to the highest standards. Any resulting impairment of Elan's ability to complete successfully in international markets will not merely stifle the continuing growth of the Company, but could force our existing international clients to relocate their custom to a more realistic scientific and economic climate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> Quite simply, we do not require any regulation over and above the expert and highly efficient monitoring service already provided by the National Drugs Advisory Board. The most positive and least expensive contribution the Department of Health could make to safe and efficient conduct of Clinical Trials in Ireland would be to provide the Board with adequate funds to continue and expand this work.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas I would like to quote from but I will leave it at that. The Minister might quite rightly say that this firm have a vested interest in this Bill and, of course, they have. I must admit that and, indeed, all those who make representations to us have vested interests. But we also received a very important statement from the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. This statement is signed by nine professors and the President of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The Minister must take note of what is contained in it, of which I would like to quote three short paragraphs. They are very important.</P>
    <P>As representatives of major academic institutions concerned with medical education, medical research and standards in medical practice, we have grave reservations with regard to the content, scope and operation of this proposed Bill which, if enacted, would have a serious determental effect on medical care and research in this country. Contrary to his statement to the Senate on 27th May, the Minister for Health has failed to formally consult the relevant medical bodies with regard to this legislation. We acknowledge that there is a generally accepted view that legislation is required for the control of clinical trials and this must protect subjects participating in research and also be conductive to continued medical progress. The Bill falls seriously short of these objectives.</P>
    <P>We are particularly concerned that the scope of this Bill which encompasses not alone new drugs but all established drugs in everyday medical <Col N="240" /> practice, including those that can be brought without a prescription, normal food substances and vitamins. Not alone will Ministerial permission be required (on the payment of a fee) for normal medical and dental students educational practical classes but also for studies involving simple dietary changes.</P>
    <P>We are of the opinion that a distinction must be made between drugs in routine clinical practice and new drugs that are not fully recognised for clinical use. In the case of the former a properly constituted ethics committee has both the remit and means of assessing all matters pertaining to such a study. Approval by the Minister for this purpose is expensive both in terms of time and money and will introduce unnecessary bureaucracy. On the other hand, with new drugs it is desirable that the Minister should have a role in vetting the proposals.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas in this statement that I would like to quote and indeed I could paraphrase. It would be important to do so, but I will refrain from it as it would be taking up the time of the House. I would simply say that other areas covered relate to the Bill being drafted assuming that all medical research involving drugs is commissioned by or is supported by the Pharmaceutical Society. Obviously, this is not so, as stated by the professors. There is a section on the ethics committee. There is a statement that the Bill in this respect runs counter to the ethos of current hospital and university ethics committees which review research protocols independently of the applicant. There are questions as to whether the Minister should be the final arbiter as to a particular trial taking place and that is developed in some detail. The statement goes on to tell us that this Bill is seriously out of line with legislation in this field in other western countries and may prevent Ireland from participating in much international research, such as that organised by the World Health Organisation. It deals with the forms of insurance demanded. Senator O'Leary has covered. <Col N="241" /> this aspect. The final short paragraph of the letter is as follows:</P>
    <P>Our institutions have a major commitment to legitimate and necessary medical research. We are concerned that the Bill, if enacted, will be a serious impediment to medical progress. We urge our legislators to take account of these matters and hope they would consider it appropriate to consult with those who have a legitimate concern for medical research and patient welfare. Such consultation should enhance the Bill so that the objective of protecting participants is achieved but in an environment in which much needed medical research can continue.</P>
    <P>We had representations also from the Social Policy Action Group and from the Simon Community. These I can deal with better on Committee Stage and I do not intend to go into them now. The charges made by these very important medical men are ones which must be considered by the Minister. Are they all out of step except the Minister? I accept what Senator O'Leary said, that the Minister when dealing with Bills in this House has always been reasonable. I hope that in this case he will continue that precedent and that he will be reasonable and will accede to the amendments we will seek to have included in the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I shall comment very briefly on what Senator Fitzsimons has just said about the charges made by the practitioners and by others. I would regard them as requests rather than charges, requests to make this a better Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is in accordance with the aims of the Progressive Democrats &mdash; to safeguard the rights of the individual and to protect and help the weak and deprived members of society. The Bill provides for a statutory system of controlling clinical trials which involve the testing of individual drugs and other substances to establish whether they may have a harmful medical effect. Under this Bill the Minister for Health has the authority to <Col N="242" /> revoke permission to undertake any of these clinical trials. He has established the ethics committee proposed by him and he and they will have to satisfy themselves that the proposed trial is justified under a number of headings; that the planning and organisation of the trial are right; that the qualifications and competence of the people conducting it are in order; that the criteria for the selection of participants are in order; that the arrangements for medical supervision of the participants are in order and that rewards to individuals taking part in the trials are adequate or in order as well.</P>
    <P>I would refer to section 8 of the Bill which provides for the consent to participation in clinical trials. It states that any consent shall not be valid unless the person so consenting is aware of the objectives of the trial and the types of drugs that are to be used. The person must also be aware of the risks and the after-effects of each trial.</P>
    <P>The section seeking to provide protection for individuals does nothing to stop a person finishing tests on one set of drugs and immediately starting clinical trials on another set of drugs. It is a known fact that the body contains traces of drugs for some considerable time. If traces of one drug are mixed up with a new drug it could be very deterimental to the individual taking part in the clinical trial. Chemical products taken on their own can be quite harmless but the interaction of two chemicals could be lethal. There should be a provision in the Bill to ensure that a person who has taken a series of clinical tests should be excluded from taking part in any other clinical trial for at least three months to allow the body to settle down and also to make certain that the trace elements of one drug will not be interchanged with another drug, as that could give rise to a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>The College of Physicians of Ireland stated that up to May of this year the Minister had not met the body to discuss this legislation. Will the Minister rectify this, because this statement should not be taken lightly. Consultation with this body is vital. They are concerned with <Col N="243" /> the scope of the Bill and say it covers not only new drugs but drugs which can at the moment be purchased without a prescription, and normal food substances and vitamins. They agree that a distinction has to be made between new drugs and routine clinical practice. They agree, that the Minister has a duty and a role in the vetting of new drugs. They think the present legislation will discourage research initiative with drugs in normal use. They also ask the Minister to give grounds on which clinical trials have been refused. This is a reasonable request.</P>
    <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board is a well known competent and independent body which has played a major role in drugs in Ireland. They should have played a pivotal role in this legislation but they do not appear to have played the role we would have expected them to play. The Minister should examine this and ensure that the National Drugs Advisory Board have a very important role in the execution of this Bill. The College of Physicians also say that the Bill is out of line with legislation in other western countries in the control of clinical trials and that it may prevent Ireland from participating in much international research, such as research organised by the World Health Organisation. The Minister should examine that major statement to see if what they are saying has any basis, and if it has, we should make sure that the World Health Organisation are not prevented from coming to this country. I ask the Minister to take these views on board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as a major step forward in clinical trials, and I hope, as Senator O'Leary said, that we will be around long enough to see it through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Bill. Over a period there has been considerable concern about the methods by which clinical trials are carried out here and there have been articles in the press stating that our ways of controlling these <Col N="244" /> trials are much looser than in other countries so that international drug companies use Ireland in a way which may not be desirable. There has also been concern about the way in which human beings are being used as experimental animals in the conduct of clinical trials. I am not suggesting that most of the bodies running these trials are doing anything wrong or undesirable but nevertheless it is important that we should have legislation like this.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased that the Minister in his introduction to the Bill on Second Stage stressed the fact that the interested participants in clinical trials were of such great importance, because this is the nub of the matter. If we are asking people to take part in clinical trials we must be very careful to look after their interests. This is especially so, because where people may be tempted to take part in clinical trials because there is a certain financial inducement for so doing, they tend to be the least protected people in society and the least well able to look after themselves. It is essential that our legislation and any regulations made under it should look after such people and ensure that they are not being exploited and that they are not offering themselves wrongly for clinical trials simply because they need the money and because they are offered financial inducements for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difference&mdash; and this has been stressed in a number of the submissions which we have received from various bodies which other Senators have referred to&mdash;between the kind of clinical trial that is carried out on otherwise healthy participants who are simply volunteers who come in off the street to be guinea pigs for clinical trials, and the kind of clinical trials that may be carried out in hospitals, not necessarily financed by drug companies, but carried out as part of medical research in hospitals and other medical institutions. Many of these may be trials which are carried out with the participation of patients, people who are suffering from a disease and who are made aware of the <Col N="245" /> possibility that a new drug or a fairly new drug may be of help to them. This is a rather different situation and not one where you are likely to get people being brought in as people on whom clinical trials can be carried out.</P>
    <P>I will comment briefly on parts of the Bill which can be raised again on Committee Stage. Section 2 of the Bill suggests that where a clinical trial is proposed to be carried out there are various matters which should be made clear when applying for permission to do so. This is an excellent section. Obviously this is something which should be done. Perhaps it is important that, among these various things which should be suggested, details of the method of recruitment of volunteers should be given. This is much more applicable in the case of the first stage trials of a drug on otherwise healthy persons. Perhaps, as well as the criteria to be used for the selection of participants, we might also include the way in which participants are to be recruited. There have been allegations that participants are being recruited by financial inducement out of homeless persons' hostels and various places like that. This is not a very desirable method of recruitment. When a body are applying to the Minister he should know how and where they are going about looking for the participants in their clinical trial. I am sure the Minister would agree with me that it is desirable that this should be controlled. I know this is the kind of thing the Minister is aiming at in the Bill but I feel it might be mentioned specifically.</P>
    <P>There is the question as to whether there should be any monetary inducement or reward for taking part in clinical trials involving otherwise healthy participants. This is rather a difficult question because one can say that, for instance, in this country we do not offer any financial inducement or reward for giving blood to the Blood Transfusion Service Board. This seems to be a much better way of doing it rather than, as in some other countries, where people are paid for giving their blood. This tends to give rise to people giving blood because they need the money. For that reason <Col N="246" /> they may conceal from the Blood Transfusion Service Board certain vital information such as whether they have ever suffered from infectious hepatitis or something of that sort which would make their blood unsafe.</P>
    <P>On the question of clinical trials, it might be ethically and ideally much better if volunteers were pure volunteers and were not offered any kind of financial inducement or reward, even though it is often described as being for expenses rather than an actual payment. Whether you call it expensess or payment it is a financial inducement. However, on a practical level, I am inclined to think that one might be very short of participants in these trials if one made a very hard and fast rule of this sort. Obviously there are no ill effects in giving a pint of blood. The Blood Transfusions Service Board are most meticulous in ensuring that they do not take blood from anyone who is likely to suffer ill effects thereby. One would be more doubtful about offering oneself for the trial of a drug. We may not be able to get away from the situation where some sort of financial inducement is offered, but it needs to be very carefully controlled. I hope that the framework of this Bill will enable it to be carefully controlled. I also hope the Minister and any further Ministers who are administering this legislation will be extremely careful in dealing with applications made to them under section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the other matters one might mention is the type of consent given under section 8 of the Bill which is the consent of the person who is going to take part in the clinical trial. The wording of the Bill is very helpful in insisting that the person consenting must be capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent. This will be of great assistance. I understand that in the past people have been offered consent forms to sign which an ordinary lay person going into a clinical trial would not necessarily understand. They would not necessarily know the scope of the consent they were giving. In addition, as many of the people who are taking part in these trials are perhaps less well educated <Col N="247" /> persons, it is essential that it be made quite clear to them what kind of consent they are giving.</P>
    <P>If I might make a parallel, over the years in the field of adoption law considerable complications arose both in statutory provisions and in court decisions about the nature of the consent given by a natural mother for the placing of her child for adoption. It is a much more difficult question than one might think. It is surprisingly hard to draft a form which is really comprehensible and which gets across exactly what you are consenting to. I recall, as a member of the Adoption Board, when we were actually drafting this sort of form. I am conscious of the difficulty in drafting it. Therefore, I ask the Minister to take particular notice of how these consents are to be drafted, what scope they have, how comprehensible they are and also control of the sort of person who is administering the form. If you have a consent form administered by people who are keen on getting persons to consent, they may go a little far in pushing them and in interpreting the form in a way favourable to them. I would like to see the form administered by someone of a fairly neutral character, perhaps someone who is involved with the ethics committee rather than the person who is actually keen to get the trial off the ground.</P>
    <P>There is also the possibility that one should build into a consent form a period of pause between the actual signing of consent and the beginning of the trial in order to allow the person a little time to change his mind. Even in a hire purchase agreement this kind of pause is allowed. A period is allowable for somebody to change his mind and say he does not want to enter into the agreement. In the case of something so vital as giving oneself for a medical experiment it would be no harm to have a statutory period of a few days in which the person could think about it and decide whether he really wants to continue with this consent or change his mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> All of the bodies who have made submissions to us mentioned the ethics committees. In particular, the people from the Royal College of Physicians, the Federated Voluntary Hospitals and the medical department of Trinity College would agree with the people on the other side such as Simon and the Committed Social Policy Action Group that it is very important that the ethics committee should not just be nominated by the people who are applying to carry out the trial. The ethics committee should be a stable body, not just appointed for this particular trial, but a body accumulating experience and consisting of people who are getting to know the field. It would, presumably, contain medical personnel who would have the expertise to understand and explain the kind of trial being carried out. It is also very important that it should contain lay personnel who would have a general, ordinary citizen's view of the matter. If one is to have a different committee appointed for each clinical trial these people will not have the opportunity to develop expertise and to learn. As anybody who has served on any sort of committee will know, one learns as one goes along and one discovers a great deal of the background to these trials as one accumulates experience.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the suggestion made by the federated hospitals and other bodies that there should be a more permanent ethics committee, as there is now in the hospital system with regard to trials, is a good suggestion. The Minister should consider this. I do not consider it a good idea that ethics committees be even nominated by the people who are going to carry out the test. I would prefer that these committees be either nominated by the Minister or by somebody who would be expert in the field, perhaps the National Drugs Advisory Board or one of these bodies that would be neutral in the field as it were. Again this is a matter which we could deal with in more detail on Committee Stage but it is an important one and one that the Minister should perhaps reconsider.</P>
    <P>Other Senators have mentioned the matter of insurance as it affects the <Col N="249" /> second kind of trials, the trials that require the participation of people who are already patients and who are already taking other forms of drugs. It has been suggested that there may very well be considerable difficulty in being able to get insurance to cover, say, a person who is suffering from a very severe form of cancer. This is a practical point which should be looked at again. I do not want to go into it at any length because it has been mentioned by other Senators. Obviously the insurance cover part is of extreme importance so far as the phase I trials are concerned where the otherwise healthy people volunteer to take part in clinical trials. I welcome this provision in the Bill in general terms but it may give rise to difficulties in the other sort of clinical trials which take place in hospitals as opposed to the trials of drugs which are financed by the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
    <P>There are the points, too, which other Senators have mentioned, for instance, that perhaps the definitions cover too wide an area so that the Bill would cover even established drugs which are freely available without prescription and dietary substances and various matters of this kind. For instance, if one was trying different diets for diabetics or something of that sort, this might not necessarily be the sort of clinical trial that the Minister wants to deal with in the Bill. A further look could be taken at this particular area.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other smaller points which I think would best fall to be dealt with on Committee Stage. I would finish by saying that I welcome the introduction of the Bill and the Minister's attitude and his wish to bring in this kind of legislation. I feel sure that he will go along with Senators in having another look at some of the sections on Committee Stage and perhaps bring back amendments on Report Stage which would improve the Bill while it is going through this House. It would be one of the best purposes of introducing this Bill in this House that we should be able to amend it in such a way that it will go to the other House as the most perfect possible Bill. That will perhaps hasten its <Col N="250" /> passage into law and make sure that these essential controls are introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Members of the House for their very comprehensive and thoughtful consideration of this Bill. They gave a fairly thorough airing of the different points of view which are held in relation to the conduct of clinical trials. I have taken very careful note of all of the contributions. When they have been considered fully in the few weeks ahead &mdash; before Committee Stage, I hope &mdash; I will come back to the House on Committee Stage with my detailed response to them. That will include, I can assure Senators, a number of amendments to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I was reluctant to have individual discussions with individual Senators outside of the ordinary process of the House because in relation to this Bill I have received a very large number of representations from a very large number of interests who are directly involved both in the monetary and manufacturing side of trials. Many of the representations, both from the professional and industrial sides, received by Senators have been in that framework. In that sense I was reluctant, coming into the general principles of the Bill, to engage in individual consultations. Certainly during the course of the preparation of Committee Stage I would be free to talk to Senators from all sides of the House on particular sections and the work of the Department will continue intensively in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is imperative that we have a degree of unanimity in the House about the Second Stage of the Bill. I would be very surprised if the Fianna Fáil Senators or any of the Independent Senators opposed the Second Stage of the Bill at this stage because it is absolutely in the public interest that there be a particular statutory framework for the conduct of clinical trials. I have no doubt whatever in that regard. There is not a great deal to go on by way of European or American legislative experience. A great deal of what happens is, to an extent, shrouded in a <Col N="251" /> veil of professional research. Of course the one thing which I have learned in my own tenure of office is that whenever anybody dares, presumes or attempts to in any way intervene or interfere in the area of professional research the hackles are up and the reaction tends to be massive. For example, to take section 2 of the Bill which has caused concern to a Member of the House, the proposer would be obliged to send to the Minister of the day the names and respective qualifications of the persons proposed as members of ethics committees for clinical trials. The Minister would have to give approval. It has been suggested by Members of the House that I should have a national panel for an ethics committee. Imagine what would be said if I had enshrined that in the Bill. Imagine the uproar about departmental interference, the uproar of professionals who would say that not in any circumstances would they participate in any clinical trial with this draconian all-embracing Minister of the day seeking to destroy their professional independence. This is part of the problem. This is why I very much resisted that particular concept of a central ethics committee nominated by the Department or indeed controlled by the Department. I wish to see a degree of flexibility in it even though it is true to say that the proposer as such has a considerable degree of latitude in bringing forward the names and qualifications of the members of the ethics committee. That is a major aspect of the Bill which I am prepared to discuss at considerable length with any Senator or any of the bodies concerned who wish to make further representations. I am very hopeful that the House will reach a general consensus for a framework. That is important.</P>
    <P>I sought in my introductory speech to point out strongly that the aim of the Bill was to provide for a legal system of control of trials which would ensure protection of participants, at the same time providing scope for the necessary fundamental research which is so important <Col N="252" /> before drugs may be licensed for general use. It is not my intention or that of the Department of Health to impose unnecessary restrictions or to interfere with the arrangements for the supervision of the trials which already represent adequate protection for all of those involved. It is not our intention to simply run a superstructural bureaucracy in the area. For example, Senator Robb made a rather thoughtful point in his customary balanced contribution. He brought out the point that legislation in this area among other things could help to temper the zeal of ambitious young doctors, for example, trying out new drugs. I quote Senator Robb deliberately because the only hope one has in this argument is to quote a member of the profession back to the profession and hope that one will not be clobbered in the process. Senator Robb gave a graphic description of holding up the cheque, of how he had been sought to volunteer, so to speak, to undertake that role.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that there seems to be unanimity about the general role of the National Drugs Advisory Board. The main reason I did not put the NDAB into the Bill as drafted earlier was that I thought it self-evident. For example, when making regulations relating to licensing of human medicine we do not mention in those regulations the NDAB because the board do this self-evident work, but if the House feels very strongly about this matter on Committee Stage or in our consultations and if it wishes to have a particular reference to the NDAB in a positive way, I will consider this matter and I will discuss with Members of the House how best that could be encompassed. However, it was never the intention that we should set up a major bureaucracy inside the Department of Health or that we should in any way diminish the role of the NDAB but I would stress that they are an advisory board. They only advise the Minister of the day, and as such we have had considerable difficulty in the drafting of this Bill in having devolved on the board greater statutory powers than they have under their existing establishment order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> Therefore we would have had to go down a totally different and very difficult road if we had to devolve statutory authority on what is in fact an advisory board, advisory to the Minister. In that framework we were reluctant to put it in, but I assure all parliamentary colleagues here that I will look very carefully now at the incorporation into the Bill of a reference to the NDAB subject to the views of the parliamentary draftsman who was of the view that the advisory board as a matter of general principle is not enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to confirm for Senator Robinson, Senator Ross and the other Senators who raised it that it is not intended that there be an <i>ad hoc</i> ethics committee for each trial. For example, a hospital which regularly carried out trials would be able to refer to the fact that its standing committee was the ethics committee for each trial applied for. As we know, it is in relation to hospital facilities that a considerable amount of the work is done. That is not always necessarily known to that extent at public level that it is done, but it is done. These hospitals have standing ethics committees, and the assurance I would seek from the facility or the hospital is that they be constituted on an impartial basis in accordance with guidelines recommended by the NDAB and, lest there be any difficulty in the Bill, I would be quite prepared to incorporate again a clarifying amendment which I hope will meet the reasoned observations made by Senators in that regard.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the question of section 7 (5) and the objections raised where applicants effectively are given, as alleged by Senators, a deployed authority to alter an ethics committee. Again, there must be flexibility here. One can set up an ethics committee and a member of an ethics committee can die. A clinical trial is a very expensive and time-consuming exercise, and the people who would run to me and demand that there should be a section in the Bill to enable the membership of an ethics committee to be changed would be the very professionals who would find themselves in dire straits <Col N="254" /> if legislation was not enacted which provided an ongoing basis for a situation in the middle of or towards the end of a trial where a member of an ethical committee had emigrated. Quite a number of them go around for professional work to different hospitals and institutes; they travel around a great deal, particularly at the beginning of their careers and very often at the end of their careers they go into more academic streams. Therefore, we must have flexibility. I will consider that when the Bill is reviewed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I want to say, though, that many of the representations I have received were what I would call reaction representations. One problem in this area which was very evident in legislation passing through the House here, on the Nurses Bill, the Dentists Bill, this Bill and much other legislation is that, perhaps for the first time in two or three decades, we are enacting legislation in relation to social policy particularly in the health area, and most professions have no experience of it at all. Very often the worst possible motives are attributed in line by line when one has to say that it is in there because of a contingency which could arise in the lifetime of legislation. Very often the parliamentary draftsman is very rigorous, correctly so, in ensuring that the legislation be so framed, but Senators know that in the House I have been entirely flexible and open to change and in that regard I assure the Senators that I will be taking a further very vigorous look at the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald was very &mdash; I will not use the word &ldquo;scathing&rdquo;&mdash; concerned about what he regarded as an undue development of centralism in the Department of Health and that that is reflected in the ethos behind this Bill. I assure him that the real problem in this Department is that until quite recently there has been no centralism whatever. We have so devolved everything now to the agencies that the system was practically out of control when I became Minister for Health. Are we suggesting seriously, particularly since the Senator referred to the fact that he was associated with a <Col N="255" /> number of voluntary hospitals, that, where one is dealing with public funds which to date total in terms of the Dublin voluntary hospitals alone a budget figure of £270 million in taxpayers' hard cash, where 15,500 people are employed in the 30 hospitals involved, the Department of Health should, without question, without monitoring, without any policy guidelines, hand over each week large sums of public money, and tell those hospitals to do what they will, to specialise in what they will, to develop what they will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have been spending £270 million in those hospitals and we are far from dismantling the system, as the Senator suggested earlier. When I came into office the figure was around £200 million, and it is rising well above the rate of inflation. There has been a reduction of about 3 per cent but in the past six months the saving in the price of oil could nearly get rid of that reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no bureaucratic Civil Service centralist grasping as was suggested by one Senator. There is no suggestion that that is the general culture prevailing for the introduction of this Bill. Senator Lanigan in particular mentioned the secretary's name but there is no question whatsoever that the Secretary of the Department of Health, either in relation to this Bill or to any other aspect of health policy, will do his own thing, or run the Department of Health without reference to the Minister for Health. As a matter of public policy, I encourage officers in <Col N="256" /> my Department, be they medical, administrative or professional, to go up front and declare themselves, but when they so do, their statements are cleared by the Minister of the day. That, I think, is desirable and absolutely necessary. Some public servants and some politicians find this extraordinary but I do not, because I believe in open Government, and in an open Civil Service and public service. I see nothing wrong with secretaries of Departments explaining to committees of the House, or to joint committees of the House, reasons for policy formation evolving in a particular way. Three Senators have made inferences in that regard. Senator McGlinchey made a particular reference at the annual conference of the Association of Health Boards in a perjorative way. I must rise in defence of the public servants in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the insurance provision proposed. I can see the point made by Senator O'Leary regarding the unfortunate person who may be suffering from terminal cancer who is offered the prospect of speculative therapy or surgery. My reaction is that this is essentially a matter of medical practice, essentially a matter of clinical practice, and not related to clinical trial as such. One can distinguish, and ethics committees can sharply distinguish, between the involvement of such persons in trials and final hopes relating to particular aspects of a particular illness and to what one might call, for want of a better phrase, conventional clinical trials. That distinction can be made, and is made, every day in medical work. I have no doubt that it will not undermine the essential purposes of the Bill. I hold the view that we must have an insurance cover in that regard. I will examine the <Col N="257" /> difficulties mentioned in relation to the section, and see if it can be amended in a way which will not interfere with the intention behind the section, which is to ensure that there will be adequate compensation for participants who may have been harmed by a trial. We are dealing with a multi-million pound industry, a very wealthy industry, which so far as I am concerned, can well afford to indemnify any particular risks suffered by individuals.</P>

      <P>I will come to that on Committee Stage. It is essential that this matter be considered. Some of the initial reactions to the Bill, for instance, that I was to become involved in the control of dietary studies and demonstrations are unreal. I would like to allay any fears in that regard and if necessary, I will introduce amendments. I confirm that these matters will not be contained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of work to be done on this Bill. I had the difficulty of having to say to the Government that we in the Republic of Ireland were engaged in a rather unique exercise as regards this legislation. There is no question of withdrawing the Bill at this stage. Senator Robinson made the point that it should not be withdrawn and substituted by a new draft. I will go through each line of the Bill, including the Heads of the Bill <Col N="258" /> and the Long Title, and take on board the points made here. I will consult with the interests concerned. In this country consultation is frequently regarded as an opportunity to obfuscate, or to send back to the Department or to professional groups and so on.</P>
    <P>One way to get legislation like this through the Oireachtas is to introduce it in the Seanad. I want to thank Senators Dooge and Ferris for their co-operation in having the Bill initiated in this House. In a few weeks we will sit down and go through it line by line. I will be accommodating and if any members of the professional organisations directly involved have any further representatives to make on it, I urge that they be sent in now as a matter of urgency. So far as I am concerned this debate has taken place in public. I have not visited any institutions of clinical research as a matter of public policy. I have tried to stand back, but I will meet some of the commercial interests directly involved. This legislation must be given priority.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senators for their very constructive contributions. We will deal with this Bill line by line. I have no doubt that this will be exceptionally beneficial legislation, which will be precise and without ambiguity. In the 1963 Planning Act, the 1976 Act and so on, I recall the manner in which office holders got themselves into enormous difficulty in relation to physical planning matters. In relation to this issue we have learned a great deal. We can learn from lessons of the past and bring in a Bill that will meet the wishes of the House while, at the same time, reflecting public interest in legislation of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as it seeks to remove a social injustice which has been allowed to survive in our society for far too long. There are some points I should like to make about the Bill and one concerns the proposal to abolish the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; and replace it with the word &ldquo;non-marital&rdquo;. If there is a need for the legislation to provide any distinction between children on the basis of the marital status of their parents, it does not mean it is necessary to replace an old offensive term with a new offensive term. Children are equal whatever the circumstances of their birth, and if it is necessary to provide a distinction it is the parents who should have labels attached to them rather than the children. All children should be described simply as children and if labels have to be attached somewhere they should be attached somewhere else other than on the children.</P>
      <P>In so far as the matter of legal entitlement to maintenance is concerned I am glad to see that the Bill proposes to equalise the maintenance entitlements of children without regard to the marital status of their parents. I am also pleased to see that section 17 seeks to ensure that the court should have regard to the financial and other responsibilities of each parent towards the spouse and other dependent children in assessing maintenance. Justice requires that, in so far as it is possible both parents should support their children or a child born outside marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases where parentage may be disputed I note the Bill provides that the <Col N="261" /> court may order blood tests only in certain circumstances. I am somewhat concerned, however, to find that there is no question of an adult being compelled to subject himself to a blood test. A court is free to draw whatever seems to be the proper inference from a failure to comply with a direction on blood tests but nevertheless it is not mandatory. Parentage is one of the most important questions which a court can decide and I am aware that a law relating to drunken driving, for instance, makes it mandatory for a person arrested to provide a blood sample or, alternatively, to be presumed to have committed an offence. If such a stringent requirement can be introduced in relation to a road traffic offence, I can see no reason why it should not be mandatory for a person to give a blood sample in a paternity case except in cases where there is a credible medical reason.</P>
    <P>The question of guardianship is one which will always cause great difficulties for all involved. We must try to ensure that our concern for the rights of one or other of the parents does not prevent us from doing justice to the child. To some extent, our approach depends on how we regard guardianship. Is it a right of the parent or of the child? I think it is a right of both parent and child but the child's interest should be paramount. From a parent's point of view rearing a child and making decisions, both big and small, are both a privilege and a responsibility. From the child's point of view guardianship offers the child the opportunity to be reared by a parent who cares about the child's welfare. Therefore, to deny a parent guardianship entitlements without regard to the child's welfare, and the child's interests, may in many cases be unjust to the child. In the Bill before us the natural father has no automatic guardianship rights. I would like the Minister if possible to confirm to me that this approach has been favoured solely because of concern for the child's rights.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to equalise the succession entitlements of children, regardless of the marital status of their parents and I welcome that provision wholeheartedly. If the child is a stranger to <Col N="262" /> his or her father, the choice was not the child's, but was that of one or other or both of the parents.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to mention some points of substance which the Minister might like to think about before Committee Stage. At present there is no time limit within which paternity has to be established. This may, perhaps, be the right approach as long as the alleged father is alive but, when he is dead, it can be argued that it would be unfair to permit paternity to be capable of being established for the first time.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that paternity be capable of being established on the balance of probabilities. If a man dies and after he is dead a woman claims he was the father of her child, how is the man's widow, practically speaking, to refute this claim? Often there will be no question of blood testing evidence unless such evidence was gathered during the father's life. Serious consideration should be given to limiting the time within which paternity may be established to the lifetime of the father unless grave and substantial reasons exist as to why that is not possible or practicable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as it travels a good distance along the road of removing discrimination against children born outside wedlock.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Hanafin in welcoming this Bill in so far as it is a statutory step along the road to abolishing the concept of illegitimacy and to try to achieve equality for all children in the eyes of the law. I stress the word &ldquo;step&rdquo; because this Bill is merely a link in a line of legislation going back to 1931 which has tended to improve the lot of the child born out of wedlock. It is interesting to read the title of the Bill, &ldquo;An Act to amend the law relating to the status of children and for that purpose to amend the law relating to legitimacy...&rdquo; The Bill is not entitled a Bill to abolish the concept of illegitimacy. This Bill moves a very substantial way along the road to achieving that objective and in so far as it does that I welcome it but it is <Col N="263" /> disappointing that it does not travel the full distance.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party played a very substantial role in society in bringing to light the problems of illegitimacy and indeed highlighting the need to abolish the concept of illegitimacy. As far back as January 1979 Young Fine Gael at their first national conference resolved that Fine Gael in Government would abolish the legal status of illegitimacy. As recently as April this year the Seventh National Conference of Young Fine Gael resolved:</P>
      <P>That this Conference reiterates young Fine Gael's support for the total abolition of the legal status of illegitimacy. Conference rejects any Bill that falls short of this principle and mandates the Law Reform Group to campaign for the necessary amendments to the Status of Children Bill to achieve this aim.</P>
      <P>Successive recent Fine Gael Ard-Fheiseanna have also given their support to the ideal that the concept of illegitimacy should be abolished. We were all very happy in 1982 when the Law Reform Commission, without resorting to the need, for specifically stated reasons, for producing a working paper, produced instead their very excellent report on illegitimacy. We were even happier when in 1983 the then Minister for Justice indicated that the Law Reform Commission report was receiving very serious consideration by the Government and that some of its principles would ultimately emerge in legislative form. We were happier still in 1985 when the draft Bill was published and are very happy to have the opportunity today to consider the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>It may be no harm at this stage to refer to the introductory chapter to the Law Reform Commission Report. Chapter 1.1 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years the law relating to illegitimacy of children has come under increasing criticism in public discussion. In this Report we analyse the <Col N="264" /> existing law and the law in other jurisdictions and we make proposals for reform. Our proposals are of a radical nature. However, we think that a law that denies substantial rights to innocent children needs radical reform. Reform of the law on this subject is clearly an issue on which there is likely to be debate and disagreement in public discussion.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise one word which was used twice in the first chapter of the Law Reform Commission Report, &mdash;&ldquo;radical&rdquo;. I regret that the Bill does not contain the kind of radical change called for by Young Fine Gael, by many people in society, the Churches, those in academic life, lawyers and people involved in social work. Those who talk about radical change are talking about the necessity for a bill of rights for children. There is nothing in this Bill which can be regarded as the basis of a bill of rights which will ensure equality of status for all children in the eyes of the law. If anything, in certain respects it confirms the existence of the concept of illegitimacy as set out in section 6 to which I will refer in a moment.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the point made by Senator Hanafin in referring to the interpretation section of the Bill in relation to the marital child and the non-marital child. The unfortunate non-marital child is described as a person who is not a marital child. In other words the unfortunate non-marital child is an illegitimate child by another name. Let us be straight about what we are talking about. It is simply going for a nicer tag which looks better in the consumer society within which we live. We are telling that unfortunate person that if they do not come within one of the categories specified in section 2(1) (a) and (b) of this Bill, they are a non-marital child &mdash; an illegitimate child by another name.</P>
    <P>The draftsman started off in the interpretation section with defining the difference between the marital child and the non-marital child. However, he soon forgot these new labels, these new descriptions, for the child born out of wedlock. The new section 1A of the 1931 <Col N="265" /> Act specified in section 6 of the Bill in relation to the legitimisation of the children of certain void marriages states:</P>
    <P>Subject to the other provisions of this section, the child of a void marriage shall be deemed to be the legitimate child of his parents...</P>
    <P>So we depart again from the phrase &ldquo;marital child&rdquo; to the &ldquo;legitimate child.&rdquo; The children within the confines of the new section 1A. who are not legitimate children are illegitimate children and in so far as they are illegitimate children this Bill, section 6 in particular, confirms in statutory form the concept of illegitimacy. That is something that makes me very unhappy.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; is used once again in section 26(4) of the Bill in referring to dispositions in favour of illegitimate children. In section 27, the draftsman must have woken up again because he refers to non-marital children. These two concepts have to be clearly spelled out because the overlapping between them is very considerable. Before the Bill leaves this House we must take certain steps to ensure that the labelling contained in the Bill and which sets certain types of children apart from other children is removed. My concern is to see that all children are the same and that the only label which can be applied to the offspring of two human beings is &ldquo;child&rdquo;. That should be our approach in this House. The Minister of State referred to other legislation, in particular the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, which is being repealed by this Bill. I am glad to see that she referred to the Legitimacy Act, 1931, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children Act, 1976. I mention these four Acts because in so far as the Minister of State referred to them, it can be said that she was seeing this Bill as another Bill in the succession of legislation simply to give rights to certain types of children but not, I think, as a Bill which attempts to abolish the concept we are talking about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> I have referred already to the fact that the object of the State and the object of us as legislators must be to remove discrimination from any particular type of child. The Minister of State stresses this in her speech. Our objective must also be more positive. It must be to ensure that all children are seen in an equal light. My concern about this Bill is that if enacted in the present form substantial differences will remain. For that reason I must be somewhat critical of the Bill as it stands. However, one must also comment on the fact, as we debate this Bill in the autumn of 1986, that we can do only so much by legislation. A lot more must be done in terms of changing public attitudes. It is salutory that we debate this Bill a few months after we debated a Bill to amend the Constitution which was subsequently put to the people and rejected by them. I would submit that the rejection of that Bill and the rejection of that constitutional amendment in measure must have the effect of placing many children in a more unfortunate situation in relation to their status than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>Our approach to single parents in the area of housing is not adequate. One only has to remember the unfortunate incident involving Athlone Urban District Council about 12 months ago. If one examines the record of other housing authorities, one will see that their recognition of the family not based on marriage is not very strong.</P>
    <P>Another point I will refer to in greater detail later is the question of property. When we talk about many of these issues we get totally bogged down in the whole concept of property and our approach to it. For that reason, I am amazed that Part V is headed, Property Rights. I hope that between now and Committee Stage the Minister of State will agree to at least amend that heading to read, succession rights. I submit that this part of the Bill deals with succession rights and not property rights.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill deals with the interpretation of sections 2 and 3. I have referred already to the evolution of these <Col N="267" /> two new concepts, the marital child and the non-marital child. I believe that these two words, as we are going to introduce them to our legislation, will create further distinctions between children. I would ask the Minister of State to examine this again &mdash; I am sure she has examined it already &mdash; to see if there is any possibility of removing these two descriptions from the Bill. So long as we have two different descriptions for children born under different circumstances we will have children of different kinds in a legal sense. I cannot agree with that.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with certain amendments of the Legitimacy Act, 1931. Again, speaking in the context of a situation where we can accept the concept of illegitimacy, I welcome this part of the Bill. It is very unfortunate that the status of children within the situation of voidable marriage can be altered where a decree of nullity is granted. The amendment suggested is a good one. It involves a change that has been called for for some time. In relation to void marriages the proposed amendment is good also. I am a little baffled at the restrictive nature of the section dealing with void marriages. The fact that parents must reasonably believe that the ceremony of marriage would result in a valid marriage seems unduly restrictive. If anything, it confirms in statutory form once again the status of illegitimacy. I would ask the Minister of State to look at that section between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with certain amendments to the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964. I would like to comment in particular on section 11. That is the section which allows the father of a non-marital child apply to a court to obtain an order appointing him as guardian. I disagree with the approach being adopted in this regard. I believe that the father of a non-marital child &mdash; I use the phrase even though I do not like it &mdash; should be automatically deemed the guardian of that child. That parents of all children should be the guardians of their children and guardianship should only be displaced by an order of the court. I do <Col N="268" /> not think it should take an order of a court to confer guardianship rights on a parent. A court should have greater power to remove guardianship rights from parents in circumstances where that parent should for good reasons not have those rights. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to look at this section between now and Committee Stage. I want to give her notice now that I will be putting down an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with the situation I am speaking of, if she decides that she should not think again about it.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with certain amendments to the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976. This part of the Bill must be considered with the repeal of the 1930 Act and the introduction of blood tests in determining parentage in civil proceedings. In so far as one considers those three matters I welcome very much the new provision. The 1930 Act which worked under certain circumstances was nevertheless unsatisfactory. The requirement of corroborative evidence was always a difficult requirement to satisfy. Changing the onus to the balance of propability principle is a good idea. In so far as the maintenance of a non-marital child is concerned I welcome the new provisions proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to Part V of the Bill which is the section headed Property Rights. As I said earlier, this section of the Bill should be headed succession rights. The issue we are talking about in this part of the Bill is the right to succeed to property. I believe that by heading this section, Property Rights, we are creating an unnecessary confusion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the principle contained in section 26 (1) which is as follows:</P>
    <P>In deducing any relationship for the purpose of any disposition (including a disposition creating an entailed estate) made after the commencement of this Part, the relationship between a person and his father and mother shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be determined irrespective of whether the father and mother are or have been <Col N="269" /> married to each other, and all other relationships shall be determined accordingly.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the draftsman on the wording used in that subsection. There is no mention there of marital or non-marital children. There is simply a mention of marriage. It is a section which sets out a principle and sets it out in very acceptable language. In so far as we can introduce that principle into our law, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the provision specified in section 29. This gives one the right to apply to the court to ensure that justice is done in determining the rights of marital children as against non-marital children in cases where a substantial input into developing property or into developing family interests may have been specified by a marital child. I welcome the whole idea that one can apply to the court for the purpose of ensuring that justice is done in relation to succession rights.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has always amazed me in relation to the Succession Act of 1965 is the different approach adopted by the Legislature at that time in relation to the rights of children who have been disinherited on the one hand and, on the other hand, the rights of a widow who has been disinherited. The question is whether one should have a legal right or whether one should have the right to apply to a court to ensure that justice is done. I believe that the latter is the preferred approach. In so far as this Bill extends that principle in a very subtle way and in a way that gets the balance of the interests of all parties just right, I welcome the approach and the Minister must be complimented in terms of developing that approach in a legislative sense.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill introduces the declaration of parentage concept. This is something which I presume exists in our law in a general sense already, but for which there is no particular statutory provision and in respect of which a statutory provision of a specific nature is necessary. I welcome that part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> Part VII of the Bill deals with blood tests. I referred to that already in relation to the 1930 Act and in relation to the maintenance provisions. This is a provision which to my mind is long overdue. In so far as the provision is introduced, it is introduced in the right way. It cannot affect the rights of any individual and yet gives a court the opportunity of drawing an inference from one's refusal to submit oneself to a blood test for these purposes. It is a good section and a good provision.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude my comments on this Bill by saying that it is about one essential concept and principle &mdash; the idea of illegitimacy or the idea of legitimacy. I believe that this Bill as it stands does not abolish that concept. I believe that as it stands this Bill in many ways confirms the existence of that concept within our legal system, but I also believe that this Bill, as the Minister in one way said in her Second Stage speech, must be seen as a measure that comes in a long line of legislation which certainly improves the position and, I suppose, the status of children born out of wedlock. In so far as the Bill does that, I welcome it but in so far as it does not remove the concept about which we have all spoken so frequently, I must express certain reservations. In so far as certain sections of the Bill appear to confirm that concept, I must express disappointment.</P>
    <P>The idea underlying this Bill must be seen in the light of other reforms which are necessary. I refer in particular to the need to provide an adequate family court structure in our society. If the Bill becomes law, if people are to avail of the provisions contained in this Bill, then there must be a physical structure. There must be adequate staff. There must be accommodation. There must be a simple procedure. There must be basically a forum within which the citizen can avail of the rights provided for by this Bill. In many circumstances that does not exist. All in all, I will conclude by welcoming the Bill in so far as it goes. It is, I believe, a Bill to which we can address ourselves more fully on Committee Stage, when I am sure many amendments will be put down.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I want to address my comments to what Senator Durcan has just described as the concept and principle of the Bill, that is, to place children born outside marriage on the same footing as children born within marriage. I welcome the Bill in the same way as Senator Durcan and Senator Hanafin have welcomed it and congratulate Senator Durcan on the way in which he has gone through this Bill, examined it and given a clear description of its provisions. I would echo his extreme disappointment in certain areas. I should like to concentrate on an area with which I am very much concerned. The Proclamation states categorically that we are to treat the children of this country equally. It did not distinguish between children born of married parents or children born of non-married parents; it talked of all the children of this country. The Bill proceeds in section 2 to create two obnoxious characters, those of the marital child and of the non-marital child. Some effort is made to say that the non-marital child is not synonymous with the illegitimate child, but so far as I am concerned &mdash; and so far as the public are concerned &mdash; the description of non-marital child would have the same connotation as that of an illegitimate child. There is no question but that it would have the same connotation in peoples' minds. Therefore, all references to non-marital children should be struck out of this Bill as they are an insult to children and attach unwelcomed labels to the innocent parties, who are the children.</P>
      <P>A further provision should be included in the Bill to the effect that the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; also means any child not included in the previous six categories, (a) to (f), inclusive. A child is a child and should not be labelled with such terms as legitimate, illegitimate, marital or non-marital because of the parents' discretion or indiscretions as regards their marriage contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with what Senator Durcan says. In relation to what we have just been through in the last referendum, there has to be a change in this country of people's attitudes towards children, <Col N="272" /> towards what we believe is the children's right for themselves. I applaud county councils, particularly my own urban council, in the way in which they have treated single parents, the way they have regarded them as a unit so far as housing is concerned and have gone out of their way to eliminate the stigma of the illegitimate child that has existed down through the ages. I ask the Minister to look at it again and to use the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;non-marital child&rdquo; in this Bill.</P>

    <Title>Civil Legal Aid: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Report of the Legal Aid Board 1983 and 1984; deplores the severe limitations of the Civil Legal Aid and Advice Scheme operated by the Board; and calls on the Minister for Justice immediately to review the Scheme in the light both of the Pringle report and of the Airey judgment by the European Court of Human Rights and to introduce legislation, establishing a comprehensive Scheme of civil legal aid.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Robinson.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this motion on the provision of an adequate <Col N="273" /> system of civil legal aid and advice last week I made the point that the nature of law itself reflected a set of power relations within any society. Indeed, the question might legitimately be asked as to whether the law might be amenable to egalitarianism in any sense. I said this reflects itself not only in the nature of law, but also in the character of the legal process. The legal process, if it is dealing with laws that are narrow and, for its practitioners, draws on those who are from a particular spectrum within the society, must inevitably be affected by such forms of participation. This generated a set of procedures which provided a source of mystification for the legal process. These three dimensions, if you like, constitute a distance between the access of the citizen and the law itself. That distance was by no means neutral because participating in however a lesser sense in formal citizenship rather than a citizenship of real equality, the citizen still looked to the law for the satisfaction of basic grievances. I said that if the structure of the law has the character I say, the absence of an adequate system of advice and assistance is to be deplored.</P>
      <P>The second point I made &mdash; and I am saying this by way of summary conscious of the fact that I have little time and that other speakers will be emphasising many of these points &mdash; is that it would be much better for us as a Legislature to choose to have a system of civil legal aid and advice rather than to have one forced upon us. Since our membership of the European Community, we are continually, faced with this choice. It is to be our response that, in a minimal way, we supply what we are forced to supply for the vindication of their new rights by citizens of the European Community, or should we supply services on the basis that their very supply was good in itself and in accordance with the logical provision of equal citizenship that made sense to ourselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I drew attention to the points and commentaries on the reports which are referred to in the text of the motion. We are indebted to Senator McGuinness and Senator Robinson for putting down this <Col N="274" /> motion and drawing our attention to the facts contained in the reports of the Legal Aid Board which spoke about the enormous delay in hearing cases and the effect of the changes in jurisdiction from the District Court to the Circuit Court. In particular I mentioned the implications for family cases awaiting a hearing. In all of this there is the whole question that should a system exist, so many people, would have benefited simply from advice. The point was made equally that legislation was necessary to establish the secure statutory basis of an adequate system of aid and advice. I mentioned that the professionals involved who had pioneered legal aid in this country &mdash; and I recall it being introduced &mdash; were by and large more progressive people who were conscious of a new mood of egalitarianism in Ireland at that time. Perhaps it is still there. It certainly was more accentuated at the time of the introduction of the system in the late sixties or early seventies when the debate was going on. They were younger professionals. If they gave their professional services in a very generous and a very concerned way, they are now entitled to the security of knowing that what they do will be formalised.</P>
    <P>The last point &mdash; and it is a point that had been made by speakers who spoke prior to myself and I simply added my voice to it &mdash; is that the very nature of an adequate civil legal aid and advice scheme is that it should encourage the carrying out of research, co-operation between the professionals who are involved in the inter-face of poverty and deprivation in our society. Indeed, the reality was that, with something that did not have a statutory basis and was insecure, not knowing whether it would exist from one year to another and inadequately provided even in a special sense, people had to put up notices saying they could take on the burden of no more cases.</P>
    <P>Therefore, finally, the whole burden of what I had to say is this. I had voiced a scepticism as to the very character of law itself but suggested that the failure to provide a comprehensive system of civil <Col N="275" /> legal aid and advice was an additional disincentive to citizens however remote they had been removed from the legal process. I said that equally therefore we would all benefit by the provision of this. It should be provided in a positive sense in such a way and in such an atmosphere that it would encourage the generation of new knowledge about the kind of cases that are being dealt with in the system as it exists at present. I thank the Senators who have put this motion on the Order Paper and I voice my support for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Legal aid is concerned with the provision of legal services for people who otherwise cannot afford to pay so that they will have access to justice. The report of the Legal Aid Board for 1983 and 1984 gives us important insights into how the present scheme of civil legal aid and advice is working out in practice. The present scheme introduced on an administrative basis in 1979 has not yet been put on a statutory footing. I support the view that the scheme should be placed on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The main problem as outlined in the board's report is that of funding. I acknowledge that there are constraints on the public finances and that there are many competing demands for scarce resources. We are talking here, however, about the provisions of legal aid for the poorest section of the community who need that aid in order to have access to justice. In the two year period 1983-84 some 11,000 people, we are told in the report, were provided with legal services. It is highly probable that thousands more have been denied those services due to a lack of resources. Indeed, we are told in the board's report that periodically during 1984 and 1985 it was necessary to discontinue taking on new clients. During these periods new emergency cases only were taken on and the emergency category itself could not at one stage be catered for by the Galway law centre. For obvious reasons, the Department of Justice keep a close eye on the cost of the civil legal aid scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to make two specific <Col N="276" /> suggestions for the reduction of costs under the scheme. From time to time solicitors from the law centres need to travel considerable distances for court appearances. Their presence in court may be required for a mere two minutes in order to secure an adjournment of a case. Consider then the cost of a solicitor from a law centre attending a court hearing for such a brief period. Such cases can and do arise. There is the cost of the travel involved, subsistence rates and, in particular, the solicitor concerned may be away from his office and therefore from his professional duties in the law centre for most of the day, thereby foregoing that amount of professional work which could be conducted if the solicitors were able to continue at their offices. I wish, therefore, to propose that in such instances cases be contracted out to local lawyers. I recognise the risk, as it were, of increased costs in that context. At present under the scheme there is no role for the private practitioner. I do not support the view that such contracting out would prove more costly than present arrangements. I feel that a local lawyer in the type of instance I have just described could provide a better, more important and a cheaper service for the client.</P>
    <P>My second suggestion for cost saving relates to the means test. I welcome the fact that a few months ago the Minister increased the upper eligibility limit for legal aid. The administration of the means test is a time consuming and costly process. My suggestion for change is as follows: if a means test has already been applied for, say, social welfare assistance or medical card eligibility why then, I ask, should a further means test be carried out to ascertain eligibility for legal aid? If the requirements for a means test were dropped in such cases the legal aid service would prove more human for the client and less costly for the State.</P>
    <P>With regard to matrimonial cases it is encouraging to note in the board's report that three out of four matrimonial cases in 1983 and 1984 were dealt with by the Legal Aid Board without court proceedings. The social and psychological effects on an individual going into court <Col N="277" /> cannot be underestimated. It is unpleasant enough for a person to litigate on an ordinary matter, for example, a claim for compensation, but to litigate over a family matter is perhaps one of the most emotionally painful experiences one could endure. Welcome as the high proportion of settlements is in matrimonial cases the Legal Aid Board report points out that the legal aid scheme is often used by clients of the scheme who should instead be using marriage counselling or conciliation services. The solicitors of the scheme normally refer suitable cases to a marriage counsellor where they consider that there is a prospect of reconciliation. The report makes the further important point that in cases where there is no prospect of reconciliation parties are anxious to find solutions to their difficulties and the solicitors find themselves engaging in mediation between parties for which they are not equipped by their training. This experience underlines the urgent need for a scheme of mediation. A very modest, though welcome beginning was recently made but I fear that funds provided for the recent pilot scheme for mediation will prove entirely inadequate to the task.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties facing the legal aid scheme the results are impressive in the circumstances. The real losers are the thousands of people who need legal aid but are denied it. The Government through relatively modest additional funding could ensure that access to justice is provided to those thousands, often poor people, who urgently need it and deserve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand the concerns that have led the proposers of the motion to put it forward I would like to make it clear that I do not share their alarmist note nor do I accept that there is anything to deplore about the operation of the scheme. Last Wednesday evening Senator Robinson, in an <i>obiter dictum</i>, suggested that she could not find a stronger word. My belief is that it is far too strong a word for the motion that is <Col N="278" /> before us. I would suggest, on the contrary, to Senators McGuinness and Robinson that on a balanced and objective reading the report of the Legal Aid Board for 1983 and 1984 does not warrant such a negative reaction. Nor can I accept that the difficulties the board are experiencing in meeting the demands for their services are related in any meaningful way to the 1977 Pringle report on civil legal aid and advice or that the judgement of the European Court of Human Rights in the Airey case of 1979 is relevant to this matter.</P>
      <P>Among the positive aspects of the board's report is the board's acknowledgment of the recent contribution from the Government to the extension of their services. That was the decision to allocate moneys to the board under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984, to enable them to establish new law centres in Tralee, Athlone and Tallaght and an additional centre in Cork. The board saw this development as the most welcome news received by them in recent years. They have expressed their gratitude to the Minister for Justice for securing this badly needed expansion of service at a time when resources necessary for the development of social services generally are very scarce. I might add, in case there is any confusion on the matter, that I am glad to have been the inheritor of my predecessor's good sense in that particular matter and indeed to have participated in a different capacity in making that decision.</P>
      <P>To bring the House up to date on the question of resources, I can report that the centres at Athlone and Tralee are already open. I had the pleasure of formally opening the centre in Athlone. The centre at Tallaght is expected to open early in the new year &mdash; the delay there, which I regret, is due to planning permission difficulties encountered by the board. The extra centre in Cork has been operating since November 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This development marks the first expansion of the board's services to new locations since the scheme started to operate in 1980. It brings the total number of full time centres operated by <Col N="279" /> the board to 12. The board also operate part time clinic services at 13 other locations around the country, and the current expansion of full-time centres is expected to enable the board to extend their part time services also. I understand that the board hope to open some additional part time centres before the end of the year. Persons who wish to avail of the board's services may do so at any of the locations where the board provide services and applicants are not under any restriction relating to residence or to geographical considerations.</P>
    <P>The board went on to say in their report that even with the expansion from the funds of suitors provisions, they will still be quite some distance from their goal of achieving a nationwide legal aid service. I will return to that matter in a moment.</P>
    <P>The board also welcomed the initiative taken by the Minister of State with the responsibility for family law reform, Deputy Fennell, in setting up a steering committee to prepare a pilot scheme for conciliation. That pilot scheme was launched in July of this year for a three year period. It seems to me to be premature on Senator Hillary's part to forecast that funding will not be adequate. The board explained how the legal aid scheme can benefit from such a service as a result of the high proportion of cases, particularly in the family law area, which could and should be resolved without recourse to litigation. In this connection the board made a very telling point, which has important implications for policy, when they said that the legal aid scheme was frequently used by people who should be using other services instead, such as marriage counselling or conciliation services, a point taken up by Senator Eoin Ryan in his contribution to the debate. We should be conscious of the fact that we cannot oblige people to forego their right to litigation if that is the course they choose.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested before now that we are a very litigious nation, that we have a greater propensity than others to regard litigation as a first rather than a <Col N="280" /> final option and to ignore other possibilities for settling disputes. Apart from those quoted by the board, there are many examples of this outside the area of family law, for example in the important area of personal injuries litigation. It is fair to interpret the board's remarks as a warning of the need to ensure that such expansion of legal aid as does take place reflects a genuine demand for essential legal services for people who cannot afford to pay for such services themselves, and have no alternative but to seek a legal solution to their problems.</P>
    <P>It would be fair to say that the main difficulties that the Legal Aid Board referred to in their report for 1983 and 1984 were the need for further expansion of services, which they see as the central problem &mdash; various Senators repeated this view &mdash; the high proportion of applicants deemed ineligible for services under the means test limits then obtaining, and the need to put the scheme on a statutory basis. I would like to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>The question of further expansion depends entirely on the availability of additional public financial resources. The board clearly recognise this. When it was decided to allocate moneys to the Legal Aid Board from the Funds of Suitors to establish the four law centres to which I referred earlier, the Government announced also their intention that some further law centres would be established in 1986 and 1987 &mdash; if sufficient moneys remained in the dormant accounts, after the various other commitments that arise under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984, had been met. My predecessor made it clear, in public statements on this matter, that the final allocation for legal aid would depend on the eventual cost of constructing the new childrens' court in Dublin, which is one of the projects being financed under the legislation. The other factor on which the availability of funds depends is the accrual of interest on the funds before they are all drawn down under the legislation.</P>
    <P>A contract for the children's court was placed last April. It will cost more than had been estimated originally. At the <Col N="281" /> same time, although they are a blessing for hard pressed borrowers, falling interest rates have had an adverse effect on the yield from the investments in the dormant accounts. There are occasions when it must be recognised that by doing good we may also be doing evil. I see Senator Ross finds that to be a particularly perspicacious remark, and no doubt he may have more to say about that in another debate.</P>
    <P>As a result, there is still a considerable degree of uncertainty as to the amounts that may be available from the Funds of Suitors to finance further expansion of civil legal aid services beyond the four law centres that are going ahead already. That uncertainty is likely to persist for some months yet. I hope that the position will become clear by the end of the year and that the board will be enabled to expand their services further as soon as financial circumstances permit. The House, and in particular the proposers of the motion, may be assured that to the extent that my previous functions have given me any insight into the possibilities of making funds available for these kinds of purposes, those insights will be used to the full.</P>
    <P>The tight constraints on public financial resources now and in the foreseeable future have important implications for policy in relation to the further development of our civil legal aid services over the short and medium term. They impose on us a clear obligation to use the limited resources available in the most cost effective way so as to optimise the benefits to the community. During the debate we have heard calls for fundamental changes in the scheme, calls to expand the service to cover appearances before tribunals, to cover test cases, to cover education as to legal rights, social welfare matters and community development. There have also been demands to include the services of private practitioners within the scheme so as to provide for a choice of solicitor.</P>
    <P>Such demands are not new. Aside altogether from the policy issues which they raise &mdash; and they are many &mdash; I am convinced that the proper way to develop our civil legal aid services is through the <Col N="282" /> systematic expansion of the existing civil legal aid scheme until the services provided by the Legal Aid Board can be said to be readily available on a nationwide basis. Until that has been achieved, I do not believe there will be any real scope for a major extension of the provisions of the scheme. Unfortunately in this area, as in so many others, we must crawl before we walk and there are a great many leaps which we might like to take that cannot be taken until we are steady enough on our feet to begin to run. That is a simple matter of resource availability, as was pointed out by Senator Eoin Ryan in his contribution to this debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan criticised the scheme as being too bureaucratic and thinks too much is being spent on administration. This has been said before, but the simple fact of the matter is that the administrative work involved in the scheme arises mainly from the implementation of the recommendations which the Pringle committee made in relation to such matters as the means testing of applications, eligibility criteria, procedures for application and grant of legal aid and advice, and to other matters. We have now established a sound administrative base for the scheme. The current expansion is being achieved without any significant increase in the board's headquarters costs. I am given to understand that the board feel that any additional resources that can be provided can be channelled directly towards the provision of extra services at law centres and part time &ldquo;clinics&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting in this connection that during the two-year period 1983 and 1984 the board provided services to over 11,000 people at a total cost of about £2.8 million &mdash; an average cost per case of £250. The board said in their report that these figures actually understate their case load and that the average case costs are even lower. By contrast the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown &mdash; indeed in the section of their report which Senator Robinson used to attack the scheme &mdash; reported that the legal costs involved in taking an average family case to a hearing in the Circuit Court or High <Col N="283" /> Court could be in the region of £1,000 to £2,500.</P>
    <P>Since publication of the board's report, I have approved a substantial increase in the means test limits which apply under the scheme with effect from 29 May last. When this matter was debated on the Adjournment of the House on 1 May I mentioned that I had proposals to revise the means test provisions. Subsequently I approved an increase in the eligibility limit from £3,500 to £5,500 disposable income per annum &mdash; an increase of 57 per cent. This should bring about a very large increase in eligibility for service under this scheme, and further improvements which I approved affecting social welfare recipients mean that all such applicants should receive services which may include legal representation in cases all the way to the Supreme Court &mdash; for a nominal contribution of £15. That contribution may, of course, be waived in hardship cases. The present means test limits compare very favourably with the limits which apply to civil legal aid services in Britain and Northern Ireland and mean, in practice, that a married person earning a gross income of about £13,000 and having a spouse and three children to support and with normal financial commitments will qualify for services.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan asked if statistics were available to show the effect on applications of the recent increase in the means test provisions. The board have informed me that in the four month period before the new limits came into operation the number of new applicants who were refused services under the scheme on grounds of financial ineligibility represented 20.7 per cent of all such applicants in that period. In the four month period up to the 30 September 1986, following the revision, the corresponding figure was 4.2 per cent. I am prepared to believe that the two may not represent a complete change in the trend, but I think the figures are, nevertheless, indicative of the effect of widening the eligibility criteria.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan was very critical of the means test provision in the <Col N="284" /> scheme, and went on to suggest that any means tested service for the poor would be a poor service. I admired the elegance and the punchiness of the phrase, but I disagree with the substance of it. I wonder how he can say that and support a motion calling on me to review the scheme in the light of the Pringle report. Senator Brendan Ryan must be aware that the means test provisions in the scheme are modelled precisely on the framework recommended by the Pringle committee, and that the committee concluded that they had no alternative but to recommend a special means test. That was because of their central recommendation that the new service should not be restricted to applicants in the weakest economic class, for example, social welfare recipients, who could afford to pay little or nothing towards the cost of legal aid and advice, but should apply also to people who are better off and who could afford to contribute a reasonable proportion of that cost from their own resources. A means test based on &ldquo;disposable&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;gross&rdquo; income was recommended by the committee in order to achieve more equity. I draw Senator Hillery's attention also to that portion of the recommendations in the Pringle report.</P>
    <P>I would think that Senator Brendan Ryan's reference to a &ldquo;poor scheme&rdquo; is particularly out of place. Whatever difficulties may have arisen with the scheme, I have never heard anything but the highest of praise for the professionalism that has come to be associated with the staff who are providing that particularly important social service.</P>
    <P>The motion mentions legislation. Legislation to put the civil legal aid scheme on a statutory basis is overdue and the board have asked me to give priority to his matter. The reason it has not been possible to introduce the necessary legislation is the fact that a number of other urgent legislative commitments needed priority attention in my Department in recent years. As far as this scheme is concerned, the absence of legislation was not an impediment to the provision of service to the public <Col N="285" /> or to the board's independence. I would not accept the contention that the fact that it has operated on a non-statutory basis has been a source of uncertainty or instability in the scheme up to now. I am glad to say, however, that recently I was able to inform the chairman of the board that work has commenced in my Department on preparing the necessary legislation, and I expect progress to be made on that front fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>The legislation will place the existing scheme on a statutory basis. While I will be prepared to consider some changes in the scheme which might be recommended in the light of experience of its operation so far, I have already indicated that I do not believe there is scope for any fundamental change in the policy underlying the scheme. I am satisfied that the existing scheme meets the essential needs of people who cannot afford to pay for legal services and that the main task now is to continue the recent expansion of the scheme through the provision of more law centres in line with the board's request as soon as resources permit.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson takes the view that an effective civil legal aid scheme should be able to identify areas of need. By that I understand her to mean that the examination of the type and range of cases coming through the scheme should, in some instances, lead to the conclusion that there is a deficiency in law or administrative practice. I take that point. I can, in fact, tell the House that, even since February last, I have had occasion to initiate action partly as a result of situations revealed by inspection of the cases coming through the civil legal aid system. I do not wish to be more specific now, since I am preparing proposals to put to Government, but I want to assure the House that I am aware of this aspect of the system.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also suggested that we should broaden our view of the scheme, in order to make each centre a means of access to education in relation to law and rights, a focus for community activity in these areas and a means of access to power in the community &mdash; in <Col N="286" /> the context of knowledge being power. I disagree with that view. The function of civil legal aid is to provide people who would otherwise be unable to afford it with a means of vindicating their rights under the Constitution and the law. We may, in the process, learn of or identify deficiencies in the law, but it is not part of the function of the apparatus of the State to move into areas which are properly the concern of political movements. I think Senator Robinson will agree, on reflection, that State-sponsored political movements are to be mistrusted and will remember many cases in which she has strongly and cogently voiced her opposition to such movements.</P>
    <P>Returning to the text of the motion, I must say that this is not the first time the scheme has been criticised in terms which would imply that the recommendations of the Pringle committee were not followed when the terms of the scheme were decided. The plain fact is that the provisions of the scheme reflect, generally, the recommendations made by that committee. In some important respects the scheme which was introduced in 1979 was more ambitious in scope and eligibility than the committee anticipated in their report. To give one example, the committee anticipated that it might be necessary to introduce a more limited, interim scheme first but, in the event, the scheme introduced was based on the committee's blueprint for a comprehensive scheme, though subject to specific exceptions.</P>
    <P>There are some important differences, and some of the committee's recommendations were not followed, for example, in relation to the non-inclusion of private practitioner services in the scheme and the exclusion of certain cases from the scope of the scheme. But these questions were decided by the Government of the day on grounds of policy, and that is the prerogative of Government. I see no convincing reason for reviewing them again at this stage. I hasten to point out that it is neither a criticism of nor slight on an advisory committee when some of their recommendations are not followed in subsequent Government decisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> In the matter of the involvement of private practitioners in providing civil legal aid, it is interesting to note that in Britain, where the civil legal aid and advice schemes have operated exclusively through the private profession, fundamental changes are being proposed, involving initially, the recruitment of salaried solicitors operating from legal advice centres to replace the existing legal advice scheme. There is considerable debate in Britain in this general area, much of it provoked by the escalating cost of the existing private practitioner service.</P>
    <P>The motion mentions the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Airey case. Senator Robinson and other Senators said the introduction of the civil legal aid scheme was a response by the then Government to that judgment. This is not the first occasion when a Minister for Justice felt called upon to put the record straight in this connection. The facts of the matter are that, following on earlier commitments, the Government of the day announced in May 1979 that they had approved the main features of a scheme of civil legal aid and advice and undertook to introduce a detailed scheme by the end of that year. The decision of the European Court was delivered in October 1979 and the detailed scheme was published in December 1979.</P>
    <P>In their October 1979 judgment, that court did not decide that Ireland was in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights because a scheme of civil legal aid did not exist here at that time. What the court decided was that violations of certain articles of the European Convention had occurred because the applicant who had taken the case did not enjoy an effective right of access to the High Court to seek a particular remedy. Legal aid as such was not the issue and in fact the court had already ruled that there is no direct right to legal aid under or by virtue of the provisions of the convention.</P>
    <P>The court did indicate that a scheme of civil legal aid is one way to facilitate effective access to justice, but it is not the <Col N="288" /> only way. Simplification of court procedures and increased jurisdiction for the lower courts are other ways. We opted for a legal aid scheme as being justified in its own right and as being something in respect of which there was already a commitment.</P>
    <P>As regards the complementary approach to improving access to justice by simplifying procedures and court reform the Courts Act, 1981, effected considerable increases in the jurisdiction of the lower courts, including jurisdiction in family law matters. It is very interesting to note that this legislation has had a dramatic impact on the work of the Legal Aid Board in regard to family law cases. The board give statistics on this matter in their report. They show that the proportion of family law cases pursued by the board in the District Court has risen from 49 per cent in 1981 to 72 per cent in 1984 as a direct result of that legislation. They also report that the number of High Court proceedings fell from a peak of 381 in 1981 to 71 in 1984. From these figures it is clear that considerable progress has been made in recent years in improving access to justice by reform of the legal system.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson mentioned the same trend, but in the context of a need for a family law court or tribunal. The House will remember that the statement of the Government's intentions with regard to marriage, separation and divorce mentioned a number of proposals relating to a family court. That matter is currently under examination in my Department with a view to proceeding along the lines set out in that statement of intention.</P>
    <P>I hope I have said enough in my contribution to convince Senators that, despite the present difficult financial climate, the civil legal aid scheme is being expanded gradually to new areas, and that the problems which the board mention in their report have been, or are being, dealt with.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I shall continue to do all I can to advance the further development of the board's services under the existing very valuable civil legal aid scheme. But for reasons <Col N="289" /> which I have outlined I cannot accept that there is a need to review the present scheme as proposed in the motion, beyond the commitments I have given and, accordingly, I must repeat what I said at the beginning of my remarks, which is to the effect that the language of the motion is, in my view, exaggerated.</P>

Táim cinnte go bhfuil tús an-mhaith déanta againn agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an córas seo ag dul ar aghaidh go sásúil sna blianta atá rómhainn.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's attitude towards this question and I am quite sure he will deal with the problems that are there and which I do not want to go into because I see no great advantage in discussing whether the body is non-statutory or statutory. So far as I am concerned, the people who deserve to get protection get that protection. It makes no difference to them whether it is a statutory body or a non-statutory body.</P>
      <P>I have some personal experience from helping people who came to me and I found in general that the scheme was quite satisfactory. We have a centre in Carlow but there is one difficulty in that the solicitor who comes to help there travels 50 miles. Like the previous speaker, I wonder if there could be savings if that solicitor had not to travel that distance and if one of our local men got the job of advising at the centre and dealing with the cases. Obviously an excessive amount of travelling does not help. The person concerned is tired, he spends a lot of time on the road. If he were in his own office he could deal with problems more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one problem that arose in one particular case. As far as I could see, it was not so much the man's income that <Col N="290" /> was taken into account when they assessed whether he was entitled to free legal aid. The fact that he owned a piece of equipment seemed to convince them that he was well off. It is like people who are unemployed: they may have a very nice house and the social welfare officer may say to them: &ldquo;You have lovely furniture in this house&rdquo;. Unfortunately this is often bought before people run short of cash. There is no great point in telling them that they look very comfortable and that they have great furniture. They cannot eat it, neither can people sell what they have in order to come below the legal aid limit.</P>
    <P>The question of marriage problems getting priority is a reality of our time. At the same time with new regulations coming I hope that the backlog of marriage problems will ease and that people who have other problems will be dealt with. Whatever else happens, we should not cause people to suffer through the lack of a legal defence because they cannot afford to pay for it. We should make sure that we do everything possible to help. I realise it is not possible to have everything perfect. We cannot provide enough money for many of these services but we should make every effort possible to protect those who may not be able to protect themselves. As I said, I am not one bit fussed what we call this body that is set up so long as it does the job. The figure has been given of 11,000 cases dealt with at a cost of £2.8 million. If we spent £2.8 million and helped to protect innocent people it is money well spent. I would have no great worries about spending money for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate my university colleague, Senator McGuinness, for putting down this motion which I think is well overdue, as has been admitted by successive governments. The reason this motion is important is that the denial of civil legal aid is a denial of justice. It is a denial of what is really a basic human civil right in this country. That is why it is important and that continues to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the commitment from the <Col N="291" /> Minister in that he will push to have it extended as quickly as possible. I understand fully the difficulties he faces. I would like to just issue one word of caution on a motion of this sort. We are all concerned about the underprivileged, about the civil rights of the poor, and of those who cannot afford lawyers. However, motions come to this House without costings. I tried to raise earlier today the position of the public finances which are very critical. While I do not quarrel with this motion for one moment, I think that the motions on the Order Paper of this House tend to call for public expenditure without saying where it is coming from. Even though this motion is morally right and it is morally right that the civil legal aid scheme should be extended, there is an obligation on us if we are doing this to say, &ldquo;Yes, but there are enormous financial constraints on the Exchequer.&rdquo; The reason this is being delayed is not through any dragging of feet by successive Ministers but really through natural clumsy bureaucracy and, secondly, because there really is not very much money in the Exchequer. One should be sympathetic to that point of view even if one does not accept it. We shall have to accept that point ourselves.</P>
    <P>Although this scheme has been promised since 1979 or 1980, it should be acknowledged that the situation has improved a great deal and that we are moving in the right direction. Although legal aid has not reached the sort of status of health and education to which services everyone has a right the situation has improved. I welcome the attitude of the Minister and I welcome the motion.</P>

      <P>Perhaps like Nelson on a famous occasion the Chair might develop a blind eye now and again, and use his discretion. There are a number of points I would like to make about the legal aid scheme in itself and also I wish to reply to some of the remarks made by the Minister has a commitment to providing Minister has a commitment to providing a reasonable civil legal aid scheme. I am sorry he feels that the word &ldquo;deplore&rdquo; is so overcritical and alarmist. I do not think that the word &ldquo;deplore&rdquo; is really quite as strong a word as he seems to consider it. Perhaps he is being a little oversensitive about it. If one is going to criticise a scheme for its deficiencies, one must use some sort of word to describe it and Senator Robinson and I felt that the word deplore was a reasonable word to use.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he does not understand why we related to the Airey judgment and to the Pringle scheme in the way we have. Briefly, I should just say that in a sense his own speech carries the seeds of why we have used this particular way of referring to it. He refers to the judgment of the European Court in the Airey case, in a sense to say that a commitment to the scheme was made in May 1979 and the judgment did not come out until October 1979. In the case of the European Court it is usually fairly clear what way things are moving some considerable time before the actual judgment issues. I remember very clearly the period of time that led up to the setting up of the legal aid scheme because I was involved in the then FLAC system. It appeared at the time that it was a combination of the pressure put on by FLAC and public opinion and the events leading up to the Airey judgment and the Pringle report which led to the establishment of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has said, the Airey case was basically about an effective right of access to justice. This is precisely why we have suggested that the present scheme is, to some extent, to be <Col N="293" /> deplored. We do not feel it genuinely gives an effective right of access to the courts because it has such considerable limitations, some of which I will deal with later. It is not a question of saying that a civil legal aid scheme is the only way to give an effective right of access to the courts. I agree with the Minister that there are other ways although I disagree with him when he said that the change of jurisdiction under the Courts Act, 1981, was a good way of giving an effective right of access to the courts. My practical experience of the kind of justice that one gets access to as a result of the Courts Act, 1981, makes me feel that this is not an effective way of meeting the Airey judgment. Nevertheless, I do not think the present limited scheme gives what one would describe as an effective right of access.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred several times to the Pringle report and said the scheme as introduced did go along with that report. He criticised my colleague, Senator Robinson, for saying that the kind of law centre we have should be broadened to take in things like education in legal rights and so on but I must point out to the Minister that the Pringle report stated:</P>
    <P>We consider that centres should not be limited to legal advice and aid activities. The staff of the centres should be free to take part, within reason, in any activities which would be consistent with the aim of providing what we have defined as a comprehensive legal aid and advice service for the community. They should, therefore, for example, be free to assist in organising programmes of education on legal rights etc. This type of activity will be quite important if they are to make progress in identifying hidden need. A degree of flexibility and imagination on the part of those who are responsible for legal aid services at administrative and political levels will be called for if centres are to develop as institutions which people in underprivileged areas can accept and trust.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that that is precisely what Senator Robinson was talking <Col N="294" /> about and precisely what the Minister is telling us he not only cannot do but does not even want to do. He is wrong in suggesting that the present legal aid scheme is really going along with the Pringle report when it leaves out this important area. It is noticeable that the Coolock Law Centre, the only law centre outside the civil legal aid scheme, has continued to try within the most appalling financial limitations, financial limitations which are much worse and more uncertain than the financial limitations of the Legal Aid Board centres, to provide precisely this kind of service, this interlocking with the community, this provision of self-help groups, education in legal rights and so on, which are desperately important to those who have not the kind of educational background, know-how and so on the ordinary person who can afford to employ a private solicitor has. Therefore, the scheme does not fulfil what was suggested in the Pringle report, even if one only took this particular area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the Legal Aid Board acknowledged that the news that they would have new centres in Tralee, Athlone, Tallaght and so on was most welcome. Of course it was most welcome news but, perhaps, it was most welcome because there was so little welcome news up to then about an expansion of the scheme. It is acknowledged in the chairman's foreword to the 1983-84 report that this is the first major expansion of the scheme. Bearing in mind what was hoped for when the scheme started in 1980, this is a very small expansion and, even with the limited type of law centres we have, we are still a very long way from providing a countrywide service.</P>
    <P>It is true that there are certain cases which are better dealt with by mediation or conciliation and, of course, both private solicitors and Legal Aid Board solicitors are dealing with such cases now but there will always be cases which require some sort of legal decision. Quite often in those cases, even where most things could be decided by mediation, there may very well be need for legal <Col N="295" /> aid and advice in regard to somewhat complex property issues which are really not particularly well dealt with by mediation services.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that we are a litigious people. That may or may not be true, but it is undoubtedly true on practical experience that there are certain people who want their day in court, as lawyers put it, who want the opportunity to have their say and have a judge decide rather than simply working through some kind of conciliation and mediation service. Those would be included in the Minister's phrase, &ldquo;those who genuinely need legal services&rdquo;. The Minister said we must crawl before we can walk, and that is a reasonable way of putting things except that our crawl has been so slow in the years since the Legal Aid Board scheme was set on foot that it could practically be thought of as a snail's pace or for a long time having been completely stationary rather than even crawling forward. The hope that we would ever reach the stage of being able to walk is very far off if the rate of crawling we have had up to now is anything to judge by.</P>
    <P>It a little unfair of the Minister to say that, because the average cost of a legal aid case under the board is £250, or perhaps lower, and that the marriage breakdown committee said that the average cost of a case which goes to a full hearing in the Circuit or High Court is £1,000 to £2,000, we are getting good value for our money. That is a bit distorted because the average cost takes into account all the cases that do not go to court, all the cases where separation agreements are drawn up and so on. If one did this costing in a private solicitor's office one would certainly find that the average cost per case is far lower than the average cost of a case which goes to a full court hearing. The figure given in the marriage breakdown committee's report was one for a case which goes to a full court hearing. I suggest that if one looked at the figures of the Legal Aid Board for the average cost of a case that goes to a full hearing, it may well be rather less than that for a <Col N="296" /> private solicitor. That in part is due to the fact that a scheme was arranged between the Legal Aid Board and the Bar Council whereby, as a contribution to the community, counsel would act for the Legal Aid Board at a scale of fees which worked out at roughly half what one would be paid for an ordinary case with a private solicitor.</P>
    <P>I know lawyers are constantly criticised for being money grabbing above all but, the Legal Aid Board are helped to run their affairs economically by the fact that they are getting counsel's services for far less than a private solicitor would get them for. One of the complaints I would make about this in the scheme is that the Legal Aid Board send down to their solicitors from their bureaucracy, as it were, a decision that, say, ten hours or eight hours of counsels' time, or whatever, is to be allocated to a particular case and woe betide the counsel who finds that the case takes longer than the allocated number of hours. One could get into terrible trouble if a case goes on a bit longer than the Legal Aid Board think it should but is one supposed to stand up in court and say, &ldquo;I am very sorry, your Lordship, but as my eight hours allocated by the Legal Aid Board have now run out I must withdraw from this case and my client will appear for himself or herself.&rdquo; In many of these ways the legal aid scheme works in an overly bureaucratic fashion and not enough scope is allowed to the solicitors to make decisions.</P>
    <P>These are decisions of a legal nature which can be made about the length of a case and whether a person has a good case to defend. From time to time within the Legal Aid Board scheme the board or a committee of the board or in some cases an official of the board as set out in Part IV of the board's scheme in section (4) (2) will determine whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for granting a certificate on whether a person has a good case to defend or a good case to make. It would be a great deal better if the solicitors employed in the board, the people dealing with the clients, the people with the <Col N="297" /> legal qualifications and also the qualification of being experienced in the type of legal case which is dealt with all the time by the Legal Aid Board law centres should have freedom to decide in this area.</P>
    <P>I recall one case where a woman who was basically illiterate was the respondent in a nullity action. Nullity actions are very complex even in the pleadings and in the various ways in which they are dealt with in the High Court. They cannot be dealt with in any court but the High Court. This lady, whose husband had got legal aid to bring the petition, sought legal aid from another law centre to defend the petition. She was acknowledging the fact that the marriage had not been consummated but nevertheless there were a number of issues arising from it that needed to be dealt with in the case.</P>
    <P>The fact that parties agree that a marriage has not been consummated does not provide the grounds for a nullity decree and it is the duty of the court to find out a great deal more about it. I do not have time to go into detail about it but nevertheless this lady was refused legal aid by a decision of the board because she acknowledged that the marriage had not been consummated. She appeared in the Master's court unaided and unable to cope with the sort of situation that one comes up against in court. A well disposed solicitor and counsel took on her case for nothing. She got legal aid but not through the board. This kind of decision as to who should get legal aid on account of the kind of case they have to defend or the kind of case they have to make would be best taken by the solicitors within the scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the solicitors who work the scheme and I am in absolute agreement with the Minister when he referred to the staff of the law centres. My experience, and it is extensive experience of the work of the solicitors within the Legal Aid Board, is that they are providing, within limitations of the scheme, an excellent service and there are first-class solicitors working in the family law area. The board and the <Col N="298" /> scheme could place more reliance on their abilities to decide who should get legal aid and who should not get it, as against the means test.</P>

      <P>Very well. Thank you very much for assisting me in this way. I have just one minute to finish. As far as the legal aid scheme is concerned I return to the necessity to base it on a statutory provision. While the Minister and some of the other speakers may have <Col N="299" /> felt that this made little difference, that is not the view of the chairman of the Legal Aid Board. I go along with Mr. Fennelly in suggesting that it is essential that there should be a statutory basis for the scheme. If we are to go on improving access to justice, we need a broader type of scheme to look into the kind of areas to which the Pringle report referred in the passage I quoted. While I acknowledge that there have been improvements in the scheme &mdash; I welcome the lifting of the means test ceiling &mdash; we still have a very long way to go and I would like our crawling to take on a bit of speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for not being here at the commencement of the debate. I had to visit somebody in hospital, but I have read the Minister's contribution and I welcome the opportunity which the House has afforded me of making some further points to support and perhaps elaborate on some of the points which Senator McGuinness made in response to the Minister's contribution.</P>
      <P>I wish to begin with the points that I emphasised in my own contribution initially and that is the necessity for legislation. I am glad that the Minister concedes that necessity; indeed I do not think the need for legislation has at any point been denied. It is sad that he has put openly on the record of this House that frankly it did not have any priority and that is why we have not had it although it was promised from early 1980, the scheme having been introduced in 1979. That, more eloquently than anything that Senator McGuinness or myself could say, is part of the problem, that this important area does not have the kind of priority with successive Governments that we would like it to see. It is extremely important that the scheme should have a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take away from this debate a sense of the importance of introducing legislative proposals in the matter at the earliest opportunity. It is also part of that debate on the importance and priority to be given to civil legal aid <Col N="300" /> that we understand what we are talking about. Senator Brendan Ryan's speech was a very thoughtful contribution by a non-lawyer. He went back to the basics of what we are talking about, the need for provision of legal services in the same open way that we provide medical services. That is really what we are talking about. People assume quite rightly that they are entitled to medical services even if they cannot afford to pay for them and that is what society has sought to create. There may be some problems but the principle of that is conceded.</P>
    <P>In the legal area we have not got to that stage. Access to legal aid is extremely limited and narrow. There is no access to discussing &mdash; as you might discuss with your GP &mdash; whether you need specific further legal aid or remedies. It is all done in a kind of clinical, narrow way which does not mean that people will genuinely have access to legal services of a preventive sort, at a stage where the problem is still one that might well be helped by good legal advice, good, common sense advice combined with legal knowledge of the particular framework which could head off a worse situation. That is true in the family law area, in relation to property and to contractual problems; it is true right across the board. None of that exists.</P>
    <P>To the very limited extent that we provide law centres for people, they have to travel to a law centre where they do not have any choice of solicitor or any prior relationship with that solicitor and they get <i>ad hoc</i> advice on their problem which is identified in the context of a visit for that purpose. That does not help to redress the imbalance in very many communities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I come back to the emphasis I placed on the need for greater education about the law and legal rights so that people are aware in the areas of social welfare, employment law and family law of the relevance of law to those problems and of the potential of law in helping them to cope with some of the difficulties they encounter. We do not cater for any of that whole area. It is in the context of the Minister's commitment now to give legal <Col N="301" /> aid some priority and to bring forward proposals for legislation that I urge him to think again about some of the values which those of us who are familiar on the ground with the scheme are urging on him. We urge him to look more closely at the importance of access to legal services in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a concern on the part of the Legal Aid Board or of officials in his Department that if the scheme was more available and more accessible to people that they might use it in a context where they need other services such as medical, psychiatric, or conciliation services. Like the Minister, I would expressly welcome the pilot scheme to promote conciliation as a way of resolving a great many problems in the area of family law. I hope to see further developments and expansion of the conciliation scheme and, indeed, of family tribunals linked to conciliation services. I would say that far from the accessibility of legal services, meaning that they will be somehow overused by people who do not need them, the ideal would be that people would have access to legal services and then have less need to fall back on psychiatric services, medical services, marriage counselling &mdash; services at the stage when the matter has gone too far for steps to be taken which might be constructive. Therefore, the real argument for rethinking our approach to the provision of legal services and ensuring the accessibility of legal services is in fact one which can reduce public expenditure and reduce the need for greater expansion in other services of the State.</P>
    <P>I have necessarily concentrated my brief reply on the response of the Minister because one of the primary purposes of having a debate in this House is to have the Minister present, as he has been, and, in particular, to make a contribution in relation to the provision of legal services. As an overall comment, I would have to say I find this a depressing contribution because it has not budged on the underlying values and because it sees the provision of access to legal aid as being a few more law centres using the funds of suitors. It is important that we have more <Col N="302" /> law centres but it is absolutely fundamental that as a society we understand the need for greater access, and greater confidence among the public to avail of access, to legal services. Again, I would refer to the comments of a number of Senators when they talked about how intimidating the law is and what an intimidating atmosphere we have in our courts. All of these are matters of deep concern to us and they reflect again on our approach to law and to the provision of legal services.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister and his advisers will be influenced by this debate and by what has been said on all sides of the House in emphasising the importance of a comprehensive legal aid scheme but also in emphasising the importance of a genuine access to confidence in availability of legal services and of remedies in our courts which at present is not the case. At present it is still the case if you can pay for it, you will get it all right. If you cannot pay for it, you are on the hazard, you may or may not get through the treadmill of the means test of the law centre, you may or may not be near enough to a law centre. When you get to the law centre you may or may not get enough time there to spell out the complicated nature of your problem and you may or may not be aided from then on. It is still a system that we cannot be happy in. I stand over the word &ldquo;deplore&rdquo; in the motion. I think it is quite a modest word in all the circumstances. Those working the scheme would agree with Senator McGuinness and me that the word is a proper one with which to frame a motion of this kind.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter this evening and also to thank the Minister of State for agreeing to come into the House to make a reply. However, I must say how disappointed I am that my fellow county colleague, the Minister for Education, could not be present to show his care for the children and students of Westmeath and, in particular, that part of north Westmeath which is an area that is probably&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cassidy, I would prefer that you would not dwell on the absence of the Minister for Education when you have a Minister of State present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of extreme importance at home. That was the frame of mind I was in because I took a similar <Col N="304" /> motion here two years ago when we had a Minister from a different part of the country. The Minister and I come from the same country.</P>
      <P>However, I should like to plead the cause of the people and students of north Westmeath who are anxious to have a new vocational school erected in Castlepollard. The present vocational school in Castlepollard was built in the thirties and was intended at that time to accommodate about 60 students. The original building was of mass concrete with a flat roof and consisted of a kitchen cum science room and one classroom. Almost from the beginning there have been major problems with that flat roof. This building has had to be added to on a number of occasions as student numbers increased. It now consists of three classrooms and seven prefabs. In 1983, it was necessary to convert a Nissen hut in order to provide two more small rooms. One of these rooms is at present being used as a classroom and the other as a staff room. In 1984, three secondhand prefabs were required in order to provide more accommodation. We now find that in October 1986 we have seven rooms, all of which are prefabs. It is a shame that this situation has to exist in Ireland in 1986. There are three rooms which were built in 1937, each measuring 55 metres. The fourth room was built in 1978 and is used as a woodwork room. It measures 72 metres. The fifth room measures 100 metres and was built in 1965. The remaining classrooms are all prefabs, some of them dating back to 1973, while others were purchased second-hand.</P>
      <P>There is no need to point out the short life span of prefab classrooms. To present this school, which was upgraded from intermediate certificate to leaving certificate last year with three secondhand prefabs is a scandal. This is the only secondary school in the entire north-west Meath area from Mullingar to Cavan, from Oldcastle to Kells and down to Granard. It is a very important school as far as the people of north-west Meath are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February of 1985 the Westmeath <Col N="305" /> Vocational Education Committee wrote to the Department and later a deputation, of which I was a member, met officials of the Minister's Department and informed him of the serious overcrowded conditions that existed in the school. Since then, space is at a premium and numbers are steadily increasing. At present there are 177 students in the school and, with enrolments increasing every year, it is envisaged that there will be 200 students within the next two years. On the school's present site there is very little room for further development. Apart from the school buildings not being adequate, another very important matter is the lack of playground facilities. The school's upgrading has caused an increase of 20 per cent in student numbers. The nearest playground is three-quarters of a mile away and belongs to the Castlepollard hurling club.</P>
    <P>I would like to place on record the great credit due to the teachers and pupils for the high standard achieved in their examinations and also to congratulate them on the magnificent performance in two recent years, in particular, on winning the Leinster hurling championship and going to the final last year &mdash; but being defeated &mdash; despite the lack of playground facilities. I call on the Minister to purchase a new site and to make an announcement to the House that, while there will be a problem in the short term, it will not continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Like many areas, Castlepollard is a developing area and it cannot be developed without the necessary facilities, one of these being a school which can cater for the minimum of 250 students up to leaving certificate standard. With the present constraints, north-west Meath cannot develop to its full potential. An educational study and an archaeological study have been done in this area. In the past two years there has been agreement that a serious problem exists which needs the solution to which I have referred here tonight.</P>
    <P>In the past four months since the change of Ministers, the Westmeath VEC asked for a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Cooney who kindly met us <Col N="306" /> four months ago in Mullingar. We told him, among other matters, of the serious situation that existed in relation to Castlepollard. At that time he gave us an assurance that he would look fully into the situation. Since them we have heard absolutely nothing from the Minister and I fail to see why it has taken so long in a case as serious and as important as this. Something should be done to encourage the expansion of student attendance numbers at Castlepollard vocational school.</P>
    <P>There are 200 people to be accommodated on 1.7 acres which includes the entire school, car parking facilities, toilets and everything that goes with the school. It is just not on. Two-thirds of the pupils use transport, whether bus or car, within a radius of ten miles to 12 miles. At lunch time, with the bad weather of the past two years, students have not been going into the town and there is pressure on whatever minimal playing facilities exist. These at present measure 92 yards by 30 yards. If you put 20 students into that, you will have 150 students standing around with absolutely nothing to do.</P>
    <P>I am putting it to the Minister that the students of north-west Meath are as entitled to educational and sports facilities as students of any large town. North-west Meath is a very scattered area and is in a sensitive situation politically in that it is divided into two different constituencies. We are in a kind of no man's land. I am the only Oireachtas representative from that area and am concerned about the situation in Castlepollard because it is the town in which I was born and reared. I should like to see the same facilities being extended to the people of that area as are extended to other areas.</P>
    <P>According to statistics, 48 per cent of students come from Longford-Westmeath and 52 per cent come from the Meath-Westmeath constituency. It is a fairly even divide. There are two sites available to the VEC committee at agricultural prices. That committee on three occasions took a unanimous decision in <Col N="307" /> relation to this matter when the Department sent down three different proposals for an extension to the school. We set up a subcommittee which met on four different occasions and invited the entire committee to a meeting in Castlepollard to inspect the school. The committee representing all political persuasions were unanimous in their decision that nothing but a new school would fulfil the requirements in that area.</P>
    <P>The Department, in their wisdom, for some unknown reason were prepared to invest heavily in 1.7 acres with no playground facilities whatsoever, against the best advice of the VEC committee on three occasions. We cannot understand the situation. No students, parents or teachers are doing more for vocational education than those I represent in north west Meath. It is for these reasons that I ask the Minister to look again at the situation. When we put it to the Department four years ago to upgrade the school from intermediate certificate to leaving certificate standard, we guaranteed at that time a minimum increase of 20 per cent of students. Because travelling costs are so enormous and because it costs a minimum of £1,000 in fees alone for boarding school, people would have to send their children to the nearest school where the standard was equal. That is the position in Castlepollard. If we have the same facilities &mdash; and times are not easy &mdash; naturally we will attract up to 250 students to that school within the next three years.</P>
    <P>The results of examinations this year stood up to those of the best boarding schools in the area. At the end of the day, as parents we all want to see results, and the results that school is producing are as good as anywhere else in the area. I make the case on behalf of Castlepollard school that the Minister should purchase a site. The sites are there; they are fully developed and have all the different services: electricity, water, telephones near the town to be availed of at a very low cost. It is for those reasons that I make this case here tonight.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo chomhghairdeas a ghlacadh leatsa as ucht do pháirt sa lá stairiúil seo sa Seanad, agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal léis an obair as seo amach. First, I might clarify for the Senator that while the Minister for Education is naturally interested in developments in his native counties, responsibility for the building programme is vested in me as Minister of State. That is why I am here to answer his query.</P>
      <P>My Department are fully aware of the needs of the vocational school in Castlepollard and have sanctioned a large extension of 1,003m² to that school to enable it to cater for 200 pupils overall. The question of the provision of permanent accommodation at Castlepollard vocational school has been under consideration for some time in the context of the second level educational needs in the area as a whole. One of the factors of concern in this review has been that while the school is likely to increase in enrolment from its present level of 170 to 200 pupils or so within the next decade, subsequently there could be a marked decline in enrolment. It is considered that there is no possibility of this school ever achieving a level of enrolment high enough to enable it to provide a curriculum ideal in terms of range and depth at junior and senior cycles.</P>
      <P>However, two further factors had to be taken into account. First, the school is the only second level one in the Castlepollard centre and secondly, the nearest post-primary centres are about 10 miles away. We have examined in great detail the further development at Castlepollard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the context of these circumstances, and in spite of the limitations of curriculum spread that follows from the restricted enrolment potential, that my Department have decided to proceed with the development of the school to <Col N="309" /> provide 200 permanent places in due course.</P>

      <P>My Department have given a lot of consideration to the options for the provision of the new school accommodation and specifically to the question as to whether it should be provided by way of a new school on a new site or by means of modernisation of an extension to the existing permanent buildings.</P>
      <P>In order to determine the best solution, technical advisers from the building unit inspected the existing school buildings. It was established that the four permanent existing teaching spaces could be retained and upgraded where necessary to form the nucleus of the future school complex. The Westmeath Vocational Education Committee were requested to have their design teams for the school carry out a feasibility study on the existing buildings to show the implications of the proposed development at this centre. A report submitted to my Department by the design teams' architects recommended a number of development options utilising the four existing permanent classrooms in this school. The consultant's report confirmed the view that the existing building need not be abandoned. Following on this, the vocational education committee have now been requested to submit cost implications for the options outlined. These costings are currently awaited in my Department. On receipt of the costs, my Department will deal with the processing of the school project, as quickly as possible.</P>

    <P>The Department are very aware of the restricted nature of the school site. The school is situated on the edge of the town on a 1.75 acre site. Although the site can accommodate the new development, the consultant's report adverts to the possibility of acquiring adjacent land. <Col N="310" /> The vocational education committee have been requested to investigate that possibility. A site of about three acres would be the norm for a new greenfield school of 200 pupils so that the minimum requirement of desired additional site area is not very great.</P>
    <P>The proposed extension which will replace the existing unsatisfactory temporary prefabricated structures will provide general classrooms, a science laboratory, woodwork room, home economics room, general purposes physical education area, library and ancillary accommodation. The estimated cost of the new extension is £700,000.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve effective monitoring and control in the planning of school building projects, and so meet school building needs at the most economical level possible, well defined procedures have to be followed. These procedures have been developed in response to the demands for the provision of suitable buildings in accordance with carefully worked-out space requirements.</P>
    <P>High standards of school design, cost control and effective administration have to be adhered to in order to ensure that the programme of educational building in every case will provide facilities which will serve their purpose well and represent good value for money.</P>
    <P>In line with this general approach also the Department have of necessity, a firm policy that existing satisfactory school buildings must be retained wherever it is economically justified. This policy is applied to all school building projects throughout the country. We have to husband our financial resources and utilise them in the most economic manner consistent with providing a good standard of facilities to which all our children are entitled. In the circumstances, my Department must proceed on the basis that the existing buildings and site at Castlepollard are to be incorporated as part of the modernised and enlarged school premises to be provided. We would not be justified in the light of the expert advice available in abandoning the <Col N="311" /> existing building. The vocational education committee and their design team submitted options relevant to the retention and modernisation of the existing permanent structures which can be retained in use.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I repeat that the Department are fully aware of the accommodation conditions at this school. When agreement has been reached with the County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee on the accommodation <Col N="312" /> arrangements, the Department will then initiate architectural planning of the school as soon as possible. I assure the Seanad and everyone else involved that there will not be any undue delay or restriction and with the co-operation of the vocational education committee and their design team this school will be planned as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 October 1986.</P>
