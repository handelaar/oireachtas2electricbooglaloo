      <P>I have notice from Senator Jack Fitzsimons, that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women 1972 and the Joint Committee on Women's Rights First Report, 1984, the need for the Minister for the Environment to issue a general policy directive under the Planning Acts to provide that a general precondition for the granting of planning permissions for housing schemes shall be the provision of creche or day nurseries.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jimmy Deenihan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Education to sanction proposals for (i) the new school, Scoil Mhiceasmainn, Tralee, Co. Kerry, and (ii) the extension of Coolard National School, Listowel, Co. Kerry.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> The need to extend the Maigue Drainage Scheme, Co. Limerick, to tributaries which have not yet been approved of by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Fitzsimons's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Deenihan and Kiely may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 in that order.  It is proposed to suspend the sitting from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. for tea.  It is proposed to take No. 8 from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  As has already been agreed by the Whips, if Government legislation has been started before 5.30 p.m. and not completed, we will continue with that from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.  I would like to advise the House that the Social Welfare Bill, which is being circulated and which is at present before the other House, must become law before a certain period of time elapses. It is proposed to take Second Stage next Wednesday, 19 March, and to take Committee Stage on Tuesday, 25 March.  It is our intention to sit in Holy Week on Tuesday, 25 March, and possibly Wednesday, but not on Holy Thursday.</P>

I requested through the normal channels over three months ago that something be done but I do not accept that it is being done.  I regret to have to say this to the House.  It is a privilege I had in this House from the first day.  No civil servant in this House has a right to take such a privilege away from me.  I say this without any fear or favour.

      <P>It is a matter which should properly be dealt with by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but it is an <Col N="1194" /> important matter for us as well.  All of us should defend the rights of public representatives. We should have the facility that has always been afforded to us.  I intend to pursue it actively, now that Senator Killilea has brought it to my attention that he has been refused the facility.  I think nobody, except for the regulations, would preclude us from exercising that privilege.  At least, we should be notified by some authorised officer if a decision was made to implement regulations that we were unaware of.  I promise Senators Killilea and Lynch that I shall try to further the cause in the interest of all of us.  It is appropriate that we should have this facility.  Certainly, we have never abused it, to my knowledge, and therefore it should not be withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann confirms the following Order, as made by the Minister for Finance on 5th February, 1986:</P>
      <P>New Coinage (Twenty Pence) Order, 1986,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order was laid before Seanad Éireann on 11th February, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This order made under section 3 (5) (a) and section 4 (2) (a) of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, provides the necessary statutory basis for the issue of a 20p coin. The order was made on 5 February 1986 by my predecessor, Deputy Alan Dukes but it will not come into effect until it has been confirmed by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the coinage consists of three coins in bronze (½p, 1p, 2p) and three silver-coloured cupro-nickel coins (5p, 10p, 50p).  By modern international standards <Col N="1195" /> all are quite big and heavy, particularly in the higher denominations.  With the decline in the value of money since 1969 more of the high denomination coins are required for many transactions.  Since 1975 the number of 10p pieces in circulation has gone up 135 per cent and the number of 50p pieces by 218 per cent.  At the end of 1985 there were approximately 40 million 50p coins, over 186 million 10p pieces and nearly 150 million 5p coins in circulation.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Central Bank of providing these coins has risen appreciably and generally the volume and weight of coins in circulation is causing considerable inconvenience to traders, to business institutions and to the public in general. This is contrary to the purpose of coinage which is intended to facilitate the public as means of exchange in the many small transactions that are an essential part of daily life.</P>
    <P>The provision of a comparatively small and light coin between the 10p and 50p denominations would ease matters by reducing the number of heavy coins in circulation.  The possible introduction of a 20p or a 25p coin was mentioned in this House in 1982 by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ray MacSharry.  In August 1984 a public announcement was issued to the effect that the Government had decided in principle on the introduction of a 20p coin.</P>
    <P>The final choice of a 20p rather than a 25p coin was based on research carried out by my Department and the Central Bank.  A survey of Government Departments and Offices as well as interest groups, both private and commercial, had already been undertaken in 1982. This revealed overwhelming support for a 20p coin as opposed to a 25p coin. Other technical studies showed that a 20p piece would take more 10p coins out of circulation.</P>
    <P>Consideration was also given to which denomination would best fit into the decimal series.  This is largely a matter of opinion and, internationally, practice varies.  Amongst our EC partners only three member states (Denmark, the <Col N="1196" /> Netherlands and Spain) use a 25 unit coin.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of section 3 (5) (a) and section 4 (2) (a) of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, the Minister for Finance may provide coins in any denomination, in addition to those already specified in the First Schedule to the Act.  He may also provide coins in metals other than cupro-nickel. The Coinage Order which is before the House at present provides for the issue of a 20p coin, to be 8.47 grams in weight and composed of a metal alloy containing 79 per cent copper, 20 per cent zinc and 1 per cent nickel.  The order also determines the remedy, which is the maximum variation from the standard weight and standard composition which may be allowed in respect of the coin.</P>
    <P>The copper-zinc-nickel alloy will give the coin a distinctive yellow colour.  The use of this alloy instead of cupro-nickel will also reduce the cost of production by about 25 per cent.  The edge will be finished in alternating arcs of plain and milled surface.  This edging is not used on any Irish or UK coins at present and should, therefore facilitate identification of the new coin by the blind and handicapped.</P>
    <P>Traditionally the size and weight of a coin are related to its value.  It is directly proportional in the case of the bronze coins and between the 5p and 10p.  Proportionality could not be maintained in the case of the 50p but it is the largest and heaviest coin in the series.  It is, however, so close to the 10p in size and weight that it would not be feasible to introduce a coin of intermediate value with the traditional value to size and weight relationship.  It has been decided, therefore, to make a start towards a lighter coinage by making the 20p coin comparatively small and light.  It is proposed that the coin should be round, 27 millimetres in diameter and 2 millimetres thick.  It will, therefore, be larger than the present bronze 2p coin and heavier than both the 2p and the 5p, while being almost 3 grams lighter than the 10p piece.</P>
    <P>These dimensions, which I have outlined, as well as the design of the new coin, which I will describe shortly, are <Col N="1197" /> to be prescribed by Regulations under sections 3 (6) and 4 (5) of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969.  As soon as the Coinage Order how before the Seanad has been confirmed by both Houses, I propose to make these regulations.</P>
    <P>The design proposed for the obverse of the coin is the same as that on the obverse of all our existing coins, that is the harp with the inscription Éire and the date of the year.  The design proposed for the reverse side is a horse and the inscription 20p.  The horse is the Irish hunter which figured on the pre-decimal half-crown designed by the late Percy Metcalfe, a coin some of us will remember as being particularly attractive.</P>
    <P>It was decided that the reverse motif should be taken from one of the coins withdrawn on decimalisation, so as not to introduce a third design theme into our coinage.  It was also considered that the expense and delay of a design competition would not be justified for one coin. The Metcalfe designs have been generally popular and acclaimed both at home and abroad.  The designs withdrawn on decimalisation were the pig, the hen, the hare, the hound and the horse.  The Arts Council were consulted on the selection and adaptation of one of these for the new coin and recommended the horse. This recommendation was accepted by the Government.  The council have had an opportunity to examine samples of the coin and have expressed a unanimity of view on the excellence of the design.</P>
    <P>The coins will be manufactured and issued by the Central Bank who will bear the costs.  The Bank plan to mint between 30 and 50 million pieces initially and have indicated that this will take about six months from the completion of the statutory procedures.  I expect that the coin will be ready for issue in October.  This will allow the public to become familar with the coin before the busy Christmas shopping season.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to make known to you my intention, in the near future, to make an order under section 12 (1) of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, calling in the halfpenny. Because of the decline in the value of <Col N="1198" /> money since this coin was introduced, its purchasing power is now virtually insignificant. Indeed, the ½p coin now costs more money to produce than its face value. Much of the latest point-of-sale equipment, such as cash registers, makes no provision for this denomination of coin and manufacturers of such equipment as well as traders have expressed their dissatisfaction with the continued circulation of the ½p.  The National Prices Commission was consulted and saw no objection to the demonetisation of the coin on the basis of a survey the commission itself had carried out.</P>
    <P>The proposed order will call in ½p coins from 1 January 1987.  The coins will then cease to have legal tender status and will be progressively withdrawn from circulation. The Central Bank will continue, of course, to give value for quantities of the coin after the effective date of the order.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to discuss some other points in relation to the coinage.  The survey of Government Departments and Offices and representative groups undertaken in 1982, which I mentioned earlier showed some support in the country for the issue of a £1 coin and serious consideration will be given to that matter following the issue of the 20p coin.  A £1 coin would require amending legislation.  At the moment the £1 can only be issued as a legal tender note.</P>
    <P>Another question that arises is that of providing smaller, lighter coins in the long run.  The dimensions of many of our coins could be reduced.  It might be desirable to produce 10p and 5p coins in the same alloy as the 20p and to reintroduce the old value to size and weight relationship by a reduction in size.  The bronze coins need not necessarily be altered from their present shape or form. Consideration could be given, however, to varying their metallic composition so as to reduce the cost of their production.</P>
    <P>Obviously such changes need careful consideration and planning before final decisions are taken.  If they are pursued consideration would need to be given to changing the design motifs on the coins. The Metcalfe designs have served us well for many years and I think the reappearance <Col N="1199" /> of a horse on the 20p coin is a fresh reminder of their enduring quality.  A complete redesign, however, which would reintroduce a consistent design theme throughout the series, may merit further consideration.  It would be necessary to consult with the Arts Council about whether a design committee should be set up, as in 1928, or a design competition held or indeed both.  Our main concern, if we were to embark on such an operation, must be to maintain the very high standards set in 1928 by Senator Yeats and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>If I might depart from my script briefly, my own personal preference would be to revert to the Metcalfe designs.  I feel that they were a particularly distinctive series of designs that were memorable and more memorable than the designs that we have substituted for them in respect of the halfpenny, the penny and twopenny coins at the moment, which are rather complicated Celtic.  Admittedly, they may be extracts from the Book of Kells, which should make me reluctant to suggest their disappearance.  I am not sure about that, but I feel that the Metcalfe coins in particular were ones that people could easily remember and would be recognised internationally as being Irish coins.  That is my preference.  It is no harm that I should express it at this point in the debate so that others can express either support or otherwise for what I have said.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to touch, briefly on the matter of numismatic coins &mdash; coins designed for the collectors' market. The only commemorative coin issued to date was the Pearse ten shilling piece struck in silver in 1966.  Other suitable opportunities may arise in the future. Indeed, if capacity should become available in the Central Bank Mint it could be put to the production of special coins, either specimens of the circulating coinage of numismatic quality or commemorative coins in respect of appropriate occasions or figures.  The matter is one for longer term consideration.  We would all wish to see such coins produced <Col N="1200" /> at home rather than abroad and the Central Bank Mint will be working to capacity for some time to come.</P>
    <P>To return to the order which is before the House, I believe the 20p coin is a handsome one, is worthy of the national coinage and I hope all Senators will welcome its arrival.  I therefore commend the order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is abolishing the halfpenny, which is still officially in use.  There is a point he did not mention; the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses recommended its abolition in a report in 1985.  I am alarmed that since 1975 the number of 10p pieces in circulation has gone up by 135 per cent and the number of 50p pieces by 218 per cent.  Being in the bar business myself, I know there is a significant rise in the use of 10p coins. When I see the Minister for Justice in the House, I want to suggest that one of the reasons for the huge increase in the usage of 10p coins and 50p coins is the simple fact &mdash; and a sad fact &mdash; that they are being used in poker machines right across the country, most of them are operating illegally.  In most pubs &mdash; not in mine, I can assure you &mdash; these poker machines are being packed with 10p coins and 50p coins, money that should be used to support the household in many cases.  I take the opportunity to mention, when I see the Minister for Justice here, that I hope there will be some legislation so that he can curtail this illegal activity.  The fact that we have to introduce a 20p coin does bring home to us the stark reality of the high cost of living we are experiencing at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the old half-crown, which had a lovely design.  Sometimes it was referred to as the half dollar and was at one time equal in value to the half dollar &mdash; five shillings would equal a dollar.  Since decimalisation came into operation the value of money seems to have become less and less.  The 20p coin the Minister mentioned will just buy three boxes of matches.  At the time of decimalisation, when the halfpenny was introduced, it would buy a box of matches <Col N="1201" />&mdash; a box of matches was a penny halfpenny or tuppence at that particular time.  If we want to go back and mention the price of the pint today, I would say the average pint costs £1.30p.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A pint in Oldcastle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is good value there.  If you told somebody the price was £1.65, you would hear of the number of people who would say that they worked for a week for the price of a pint today.  It certainly depicts the rising cost of living.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister did take into consideration the type of edging the coins should have for easy identification by blind people and the handicapped.</P>
      <P>The Government are considering a one pound coin.  I would have a word of warning on that.  There was a one pound coin introduced in England and many people coming home during the summer season spent these coins in pubs, etc.  I never lodged any of them; I do not know where they went to.  If we are going to have people's pockets weighted down with coins of every description &mdash; 1p which will probably go; 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p &mdash; we should think very deeply before we mint a one pound coin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not favour it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that I do not favour it, but I would think about it.  It can be very awkward for people in business.  Any change in the ordinary system of handling money is very difficult from a businessman's point of view to cope with. There is a fast turnover of money in confectionery shops and pubs and it is very hard to adapt.  To introduce the coin on the eve of Christmas would be serious and mistakes would occur.  Therefore, it is good to introduce it much earlier on. It is hard to adapt to changes in currency. It is very handy to put a one pound note in your wallet, even though it may not be worth a lot today.  I do not know how the Exchequer manages with regard to replacements.  I suppose it does not cost very much.  The last legal tender seemed <Col N="1202" /> to be made out of poor quality paper and there is a lot of damaged legal tender about.  The British five pound note seems to be made out of better quality paper than the Irish one, so there is a problem there.  For the business community to adapt to any change in coinage or currency takes some time.  I merely sound a warning note about being too hasty in introducing a one pound coin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>May I start by congratulating the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Finance and also by wishing his immediate predecessor well.  I would suggest to Minister Bruton to take a trip to Cahir.  There is a man with a shop in Cahir who refused to join the new decimalisation system and all of his produce is marked in old money.  I pass that shop twice a week on average, and the more I see it the more I am convinced that the greatest rip-off of all time resulted from changing the coinage, and I think the Minister is about to do it again.  Going back to Senator Lynch's comments, if, for instance, you went to a greengrocer in the era before decimalisation and the greengrocer said &ldquo;I will give you an apple for ten bob&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I will give you a bar of chocolate for 12 shillings&rdquo;, you would think he was &ldquo;nuts&rdquo;.  But the reality is that decimalisation has ripped off thousands of people.  Under the guise of changing currency people were subjected to fairly vicious price increases. That was the reality immediately after decimalisation.  The Minister is going to call in the halfpenny.  I think he will be calling in the 10p in about two year's time.  What will happen is that people with machines will start changing the 5p. I can see the telephone people already rubbing their hands with glee, dropping the 15p and going for the easy 20p coin, thereby securing quite a massive increase in their fees.  It will all be done on the basis that it is much easier, handier and that the coin is lighter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so sure that the need to facilitate business and the people's handling of such business is the criterion here.  The Minister spoke about the cost to the Central <Col N="1203" /> Bank of providing these coins.  Is it a cost-saving exercise?  Will it be done at the expense of the ordinary punter?  While 20p is not a lot of money, it is quite significant to people on social welfare, such as pensioners.  I am very concerned, unless this particular introduction is monitored first on the semi-State sector, that it will inevitably lead to price increases. I would like to hear from the Minister whether he has any plans to ensure that neither State companies nor private companies will be allowed to take advantage of the rationale of it being easier to manage by raising their prices to suit the 20p coin.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of making it easy for blind people to identify the coin.  The throw-away remark about the £1 coin is a real flier, because that is really going to take people on a train ride to inflation. My experience of the £1 coin in an English restaurant is that you are inclined to leave it on the plate because it has no value.  If you are leaving a tip of some description it takes quite a while to realise that you had better check the coinage.  It is illegal for people using the changing coinage to increase prices substantially. Once we bring in a £1 coin then the next unit of currency that has any real value is the £5 note.  It is a problem that people will reach the stage of feeling that £1 is valueless.  I honestly believe that the decimalisation of coinage certainly led to people being ripped off in lots of areas. The same thing will happen with the £1. I would caution the Minister about consultation, because if he consults business he is unlikely to get a favourable reply. If we held a referendum on it we would probably get a very different reply.  I would not welcome the introduction of a £1 coin.  I do not know what the experience has been in England but my instinct tells me that the next unit of currency on which people would automatically place value would be the £5.</P>
    <P>I, obviously, am going to vote for the new coinage because I am on the right side of the House.  I have grave reservations about it.  I suspect, as I said, that the third paragraph of the Minister's <Col N="1204" /> speech is the real reason why we are bringing in this coin and why he wants to bring back the horse.  I just hope that the horse is the only thing that is going to be ridden in this transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Follow that, as you may say after Senator Magner's speech. In a sense with regard to the introduction of the 20p coin, some of what I might have been going to say has been said by the Minister.  I was coming into this House to say what a good idea it would be to restore the horse.  Now I find that we are going to restore the horse and also to praise the Metcalfe designs.  I find that the Minister is in agreement with me in thinking that the Metcalfe designs were extremely good designs and that we would do no harm to go back to them.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that it is almost exactly 60 years ago to the day that Senator Yeats was speaking on this matter in the Seanad.  It was 3 March 1926 when he made his first contribution on the Second Stage of the Coinage Bill.  He pointed out when the Government of the day was setting out to appoint a committee to design the coinage, that the design of stamps, coins and so on might be described as the silent ambassadors of national taste.  This was a very good phrase to describe them.  The Senator praised the idea of introducing a committee to design the coinage.  He hoped that the coinage to be designed would be such that even the most humble citizen would be proud of it.  The coinage that emerged in the period between 1926 and 1928, when the committee sat and when the coinage was designed, was, indeed, such that the most humble citizen could be proud of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was good to see at the time that the Master of the Royal Mint in London referred to the scheme of setting up a commission to design the coinage as being a scheme so admirable that it might serve as a model for any government embarking on the difficult task of obtaining designs for a new coinage.  I do think Senator Yeats then and the Minister now are right in feeling that the design of our coinage is an important thing and that it is an ambassador of national taste.  Our <Col N="1205" /> coinage should be distinctive, beautiful and something that everyone will recognise as being Irish.  I am delighted to hear that the horse, which was once on the half-crown, is coming back, although I suppose a whole generation of people who have grown up, like my own children, can scarcely remember the half-crown and the horse.  It will be no harm to bring it back to them.</P>
    <P>With regard to whether we should have these coins, I, because of commuting to a certain extent between Northern Ireland and here, have become accustomed to the idea of having 20p coins and £1 coins. I share to a certain extent Senator Magner's feelings about the £1 coin.  Once a sum of money becomes a coin you begin to think, this is small change, and whereas we all know that single pounds disappear very rapidly, they seem to disappear even more rapidly when they are seen as small change.  We should take a little bit of thought before changing from having the £1 note to the £1 coin.  There is a psychological gap between what you pay out in coinage and what you pay out in notes. Certainly, the idea of having the £5 note as the bottom level of notes seems to me to recognise the ravages of inflation even more than we already have.  I would hesitate before bringing in this one pound coin.  I find that the one pound coins that I use in Belfast tend to be assumed in my purse, with pennies and half-pennies, as of very little value.  With regard to the 20p coin, it probably will serve a useful function.  Certainly, the withdrawal of the halfpenny will do no harm as it seems to be of no value.  In many ways it is quite inconvenient.</P>
    <P>Something that I think should be recognised as praiseworthy in this country and in certain other countries is that we have change in coinage available all the time. I am sure many other Senators, like myself, have had the experience of being in countries where when you come to a check-out in a supermarket or whatever, they do not have the change but give little packages of matches or some other token instead of coins in change.  It is admirable that in this country in all our retail outlets we do have proper change.  This is something <Col N="1206" /> that our retailers should be praised for.  They keep their system going in the proper way.  They use proper coinage rather than offering a small token instead of change.  The 20p coin will probably serve a useful purpose.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to welcome the horse back again.  I would certainly support the Minister in his praise of the Metcalfe designs and his wish to see them coming back again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridRodgers" hpid="Mrs. Rogers Mrs. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make just a few remarks about the changes in coinage. We in the North have been living with these changes for some time, and therefore, I speak from experience.  With regard to the proposed design of the new 20p, I am glad to note that it is going to be bigger than the 2p because the 20p English coin we use in the North is smaller than the 5p and, therefore, has caused a lot of confusion, particularly for old people.  It seems such a small silver coin that they confuse it with the 5p and also it is quite easy to lose because it gives the impression of being of little value in comparison to the 5p.</P>
      <P>I would welcome also the idea of a lighter coinage.  Senator Magner talked about inflation and I could not not agree with him more when he talks about what decimalisation did.  I speak as someone who goes out and does the weekly shopping. We have to face the reality that inflation has been with us since I was a child and having been reared in a public house I remember my grandfather talking about the time when a glass of whiskey was only 4p in old money.  I can remember when one could get a half glass of whiskey for 1s. 10d. which is probably less than 10p at the moment.  Inflation is a fact of life.  If we do not allow for it in the coinage, we will end up bringing barrels of coins with us.  It is better to change the coinage and make it lighter. Incidentally, I heard on the radio today that inflation may be down to zero per cent in the next year.  Of course, I would welcome that.  However, the reality is that people do not want a lot of heavy coins in their purses or in their pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> It would be a good idea to change to lighter coinage.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has given consideration to the blind.  With new coins coming in, it is confusing for old people but in particular blind people. It is useful to take into account the touching of the coin, thus allowing blind people to know what it is.</P>
    <P>On the £1 coin, I would like to tell the Minister that the general impression is that it has been a disaster in the North. Firstly, people do not like it and it is not popular.  I would agree with what Senator McGuinness has said that it almost becomes small change.  It also creates problems in the purse or in the pocket.  I note now that some enterprising manufacturers have brought out a £1 container for men which is flat and has holes in it.  The idea, of course, was that men kept losing these little coins which were like buttons.  It is a bad idea because it is small and heavy and easy to lose.  It certainly makes a hole in the pocket in the physical sense.  I think the paper pound was a much better idea.  Perhaps it would be worth considering bringing in a two pound note which would be a halfway house.  There is too large a gap between the one pound and the five pound note.  Therefore, the smallest note one would have would be five pounds and one would end up with a collection of coins in change and very few paper notes.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Metcalfe designs, I too am delighted to see the horse back. I remember as a child thinking that the coins were beautiful.  They were very distinctive.  I do not think any other country had that type of design with the animal on it.  It was distinctively Irish.  It was a simple design and meaningful to people. People relate to the animal on the coin. Whereas the more intricate Celtic design may be beautiful in its own way, I think the other was much more simple, attractive and distinctive.  I would like to see it brought back in any new coins in the future.  If the £1 coin eventually becomes a necessity, let it not be designed like the English £1 coin because it is a disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few general remarks to make.  The order, as the Minister has said, provides the necessary statutory basis for the issue of a 20p coin. I have no strong feelings one way or the other about that.  I am sure most people would feel the same.  I accept that the Minister believes there is a need for this coin.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to coins shows the big change in the country from when I was a young boy.  I can recall, at that time, that frugal and provident people trying to save usually used a small linen bag.  In most cases it was a turnip seed bag.  A small piece of string was attached at the top of the bag where they saved their coins.  At that time, if I saw a person with a bag containing 20 or 30 coins I would think he was fairly wealthy.  Now if that bag were full, it would not amount to very much.</P>
      <P>With regard to design which the Minister has mentioned, I would like to compliment him on that.  The design of a coin is very important, certainly in the national sense.  The Book of Kells is very fitting book from which to get designs.  I hope that the designs would not be copied directly but used as inspiration.  If design is to mean anything it must be something on-going in which there is life.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Book of Kells, I have appealed on many occasions that we should get a section of this book back in Kells for display.  Indeed, it would solve our tourist problem.  The Minister is in a very strong position to make a case for this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Design is most important for coins and stamps.  It would seem to me that the proper course to take would be to have a design competition so that a suitable, modern design could be chosen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned the horse and the importance of the Irish hunter. I, too, congratulate the Minister on using this emblem.  The horse which has meant so much to Ireland is not displayed as it should be.  For example, in the UK the <Col N="1209" /> horse is used on ceremonial occasions and for policing work.  This could be done here in the same way.  Certainly, in the context of design it is very appropriate that the horse should be used.</P>
    <P>I would again suggest to the Minister that he pick a horse from recent times. What better horse could he pick than Cairn Rouge?</P>

      <P>Maybe after this week Dawn Run would be suitable as well. One horse at a time certainly.  I compliment the Minister in this area as well. With regard to the halfpenny coins, I agree fully that these should be withdrawn from circulation.  I see even 1p coins thrown on the footpath and nobody bothers to pick them up.  With the one pound coin I would possibly share the reservations of the other Members.  However, in the UK the one pound coin is very popular.  Of course, as other Members have said, we had the half-crown coin previously and we had the ten shilling note, and these have gone.  I suppose we may reach a stage where coins will not be necessary.  It may be hard to visualise that time, but I suppose in public telephone kiosks and in other areas some other provision will be made. I suppose this will also make obsolete the requirement of the side pocket on our slacks.  This is something that many people would not cry about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, I want to refer to the specification in the order &mdash; 79 per cent copper, 20 per cent zinc and 1 per cent nickel &mdash; with the standard weight of each coin 8.47 grammes.  These are really very fine limits.  There is another requirement of <Col N="1210" /> the maximum variation.  While this is necessary, I can never envisage a situation where somebody will actually go to the trouble of seeing whether the coins comply with this requirement.  I agree that it is necessary.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I accept that the coin is necessary.  I congratulate the Minister on the priority he has given to the design and to the emblems, which are of importance to Ireland.  I would ask him to have a look again at the points I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Seanad for their constructive and welcoming debate. References have been made to the ravages of inflation as far as our coinage is concerned.  I would like to say to the House that it is my expectation that we would have inflation this year at around 3 per cent.  Next year we could be down to 1 per cent inflation.  That certainly means that we have eradicated to a great measure out of the system the problem of inflation.  It is one of the great achievements of the Government and, in particular, of my predecessor, Deputy Alan Dukes, that he and the Government and the other actors in the economic sphere have been successful in bringing inflation down to this level.  We can look forward to 3 per cent this year and 1 per cent in the following year.  That is something which is quite unprecedented in our recent history and puts much of the debate that we have been having here about coinage into proper context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also has relevance for many of the current disputes which are going on in respect of pay and other matters.  People should consider the rates on offer and compare them with the prospective, as distinct from the historic, rates of inflation. This may suggest that the offers that are being considered are a good deal more generous than perhaps people really understand.  People have become used to rates of inflation a good deal higher than those in prospect in the immediate future in this country.  I hope that people will bear what I said in mind in judging their reaction to the current <Col N="1211" /> events.  I will not be more specific than that.</P>
    <P>I am interested in a number of the points that were made about the difficulty in introducing a one pound coin.  The problem is that the pound note has become itself small change; and paper is not suitable for small change, because paper has to be reused and reused, as does small change.  Having small change in the form of paper, rather than in the form of metal, means that the pound has become rather grubby, because it is not being resubmitted to the bank in takings at the end of the week.  It is being retained in circulation and it is deteriorating each time it is used.  That is the reason people are thinking about a one pound coin. Senator Magner's point would make greater sense in a period of high inflation where decimalisation was introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be most foolhardy anticipation for you or anyone else to make.  In current circumstances the problem is one that can be approached rationally on its merits rather in the fear of inflation, because we have virtually got inflation out of the system now.</P>
      <P>Senator Rodgers referred to the need for a two pound note.  Just as we are introducing a 20p coin, that would seem to make some sense.  There is no decision about going over to a one pound coin.  It is something to be looked at further.  I hope I have not missed any of the other points that I should refer to.</P>
      <P>The reasons for getting rid of the halfpenny are not just ones of cost, although admittedly it did cost more to produce than it was worth.  The main reason was that it just was not being used. The consumer was deciding the position by simply not using the coin.  That meant it did not make much sense to retain it. It was not being used.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order:</P>
      <P>Winter Time Order, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>This order complies with the EC Third Council Directive on summer time arrangements concerning the harmonisation of the summer time period throughout EC member states.  It is the third order of this type.  The previous ones were the Winter Time Order, 1981, and the Winter Time Order, 1982, which the House approved on 11 March 1981 and 9 March 1983, respectively.</P>
      <P>The principal effect of the order is that the summer time period will begin two weeks later in 1986 and one week later in 1987 and 1988 than prescribed in the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 (No. 17 of 1971).  A minor consequence of the order will be that the time of change from winter time to summer time, and <i>vice versa</i>, will be 1 o'clock in the morning Greenwich mean time rather than 2 o'clock as provided for in the 1971 Act.</P>
      <P>The order was approved in the Dáil yesterday.  If this House approves it also, which I earnestly hope it will, It means that we will have a similar period of summer time in 1986, 1987 and 1988 as we have had for the past five years, that is from the last Sunday in March to the fourth Sunday in October.  The actual summer time periods will be</P>
      <P>30 March 1986 to 26 October 1986;</P>
      <P>29 March 1987 to 25 October 1987 and</P>
      <P>27 March 1988 to 23 October 1988.</P>
      <P>The reasoning behind this order, and the two previous similar ones, is that the Commission considers that the harmonisation of the summer time period would help the efficiency of transport, communications, commerce and contacts generally between member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions with a view to the standardisation of the &ldquo;summer time&rdquo; period have been going on for many <Col N="1213" /> years.  There are several problems, including of course the fact that natural time in the United Kingdom and here is substantially different from that of the continental member states.  In the long term the commission would prefer that all member states share a common date for the beginning and ending of summer time.  However, due to the success the commission has had with harmonisation to date it is prepared to continue as an experiment for a further three years the same system which operated in 1983, 1984 and 1985.  This, in effect, means that the summer time period will end one month earlier in the continental member states that in the United Kingdom and Ireland, that is, on the last Sunday in September instead of the fourth Sunday in October.</P>
    <P>This is a very favourable arrangement from our point of view as we have always favoured the longest possible summer time period and the public, when consulted about the provisions of the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971, were in favour of having our period of summer time synchronised with that in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I recommend the order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record, I support the Minister and give approval to this order.  There is a history attached to the reasons for the change in time.  I heard a programme on the radio which was very interesting.  People asked should it be reversed &mdash; that we have winter time in the summer period.  There are arguments for both.  When it all boils down to the finer points, the system that has been in operation is the proper one, especially for commercial and industrial reasons.  In approving the order we are conforming with other member states of the EC.  It is part of the ongoing process of becoming more and more in line with our European partners and being aligned to them in their way of thinking and in times.  For transport and communication it is very vital that this is done and the time schedule the Minister has outlined <Col N="1214" /> seems to be fairly reasonable and I certainly will approve it.  As I said, there is very interesting history &mdash; I am not going to give it here &mdash; but various experiments were tried out down through the years between Ireland and England for a change in times and it would not work. What we have now seems to work.  I hope this order will make it even better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that we have at last reached the Committee Stage of the Chester Beatty Library Bill, 1985.  We had a first-class Second Stage here in this House under the Minister's predecessor and, indeed, I welcome the Minister here this afternoon.  This is a small Bill; others would have wished to have seen greater substance in it, but certainly as it applies to the Chester Beatty Library it will give legal authority to allow a lot of necessary work to proceed in that building to enhance it and to make it a more fitting museum for the stunning collection of treasures which it houses and, indeed, enhance it as a place for Irish people and so many tourists to go to study these oriental artifacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the conclusion of the Second Stage it was suggested that we might have the Committee Stage of this Bill out at the Chester Beatty Library.  Many of us felt that this was a most novel suggestion and one well worth pursuing.  I am a little bit disappointed that it was not possible for us to do that.  I wonder, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, if you could indicate to us why it was not possible, because we in this House may very soon be looking for a new home.  Indeed, there has been talk that, in view of the length of the work involved in renovating this building, we may have to consider sitting elsewhere. For that reason also it would have been an interesting experiment to have taken <Col N="1215" /> the Committee Stage of this Bill elsewhere. I do not know, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, if you can make a statement as to why we were not able to take up the suggestion of Senator Dooge and conduct the Committee Stage in the Chester Beatty Library.  I would be very interested to hear why it was not possible to do that.</P>
    <P>In my Second Stage speech I paid tribute to the staff of the Chester Beatty Library, who were extremely helpful in getting me material for my Second Stage speech.  It has subsequently come to my attention that much of the material which they gave to me has in fact been the work of Brian Kennedy who has worked with the Chester Beatty Library and I am very pleased that so many Senators enjoyed the speech that I made.  Some of them recommended that it should be published as a separate pamphlet.  I would echo those sentiments.  I was very pleased to be able to use this material and would pay tribute ot Brian Kennedy for all the work and research that he has done.</P>
    <P>We have some amendments down for Committee Stage of this Bill.  They have been but down by Senator Fitzsimons.  It will be interesting to hear him propose these amendments.  For the moment I will await to see what he has to say about them.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;having regard to the safety, proper preservation and spatial requirements of the important library collection therein and the working conditions for staff; and to ensure that the Chester Beatty Library will be enabled to play a full part in the cultural and educational life of this country&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, although in a sense I am disappointed that we did not have Deputy Joe Bermingham back because on the last occasion I felt he was somewhat ebullient and bellicose &mdash; and perhaps rightly so &mdash; with regard to this.  I felt he was inviting me to interject.  I felt, too, that he was justified in doing so because I had said that the Bill was stop-gap legislation. I did not mean that in any derogatory sense.  I said that I welcomed the Bill and felt that it was for a specific purpose and it was on those lines that I said it was stop-gap legislation.  However, Deputy Bermingham was well on top of the occasion and I also wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important Bill.  In one sense also I should say that what Deputy Bermingham was saying was, &ldquo;Look, after all those years we have produced this Bill to do something about the Chester Beatty Library and now when we have done that Members are nit-picking about it&rdquo;.  It was not in that sense that I was being critical of the Bill.  I felt that this is a very important collection and every Member of the House who contributed <Col N="1217" /> stated that and emphasised that.  So, I think that is agreed.  By any standard, by the highest international standard, it is a very important collection and therefore it deserves special attention.</P>
    <P>Section 2 states:</P>
    <P>The Commissioners may, with the consent of the Minister and upon and subject to such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Commissioners and the trustees, carry out, or cause to be carried out on their behalf, such work as, in the opinion of the Commissioners, is necessary or expedient for the maintenance, upkeep, repair, renovation and improvement of the premises.</P>
    <P>My big objection to that is that the views of different people will obviously be different. What might be acceptable to one would be unacceptable to another.  In this situation where we have this collection, we must realise the importance of the ambience of the collection, the temperature, the humidity, the storage, the display &mdash; every aspect is of importance. Here, by and large, we have an old building, certainly a building that would be outdated by any modern standards.  Even the new building does not have, in my view, proper insulation in the walls, the roof or the floors, Even on this aspect people can differ.  I recall one occasion when I was involved as an expert witness in a case, in which capacity I act from time to time, a very eminent authority stated under oath that he would not regard a slated roof that had 5 per cent of the slates loose or defective as unacceptable. I would reject a roof if one slate were damaged or out of place.  Having regard to modern requirements, to the requirements of building regulations in regard to fire escapes, the extra space that would be involved, the fact that space is at a premium, that strict control of humidity and of temperature is most important, that air conditioning is acceptable &mdash; having regard to all that, I do not think it would be possible to provide air conditioning or other necessary facilities in these old buildings without considerable <Col N="1218" /> renovation and insulation.</P>
    <P>What I am really saying is that we want a base line, a datum line, some independent line that we can compare against, because we are not talking of a simple building.  In respect of a modern dwellinghouse there are very strict mandatory standards of insulation.  The building regulations will impose extra strain on the buildings.</P>
    <P>We must have regard to the importance of this collection and what it means to the nation.  We must have regard to the type of buildings that are necessary to do justice to that collection.  The section as it is at the moment does not provide the necessary baseline.  An official who would be in charge of that department in the Office of Public Works might quite easily come to the view that the building is quite satisfactory, while perhaps the curator or the people who are in charge of that collection would feel that it would be totally unsuitable.  My amendment says:</P>
    <P>having regard to the safety, proper preservation and spatial requirements of the important library collection therein and the working conditions for staff; and to ensure that the Chester Beatty Library will be enabled to play a full part in the cultural and educational life of this country.</P>
    <P>All these things should be taken into consideration, as they would improve the Bill and give it the strength and the phrasing whereby anybody who would be considering the situation would be able to come to the conclusion: &ldquo;This building is suitable&rdquo;; &ldquo;This building is not suitable&rdquo; or &ldquo;Certain works would have to be done to make this building suitable&rdquo;.  My amendment, which is a simple amendment, if adopted, would improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Fitzsimons's amendment.  I would like to start by welcoming the Minister of State here.  I am glad to see her appearing in this House and I hope that she will go on to have a fruitful relationship with us.  I hope that you will forgive me, a Leas-Chathaoirligh <Col N="1219" /> if I say, having been unfortunately absent for the Second Stage of this Bill, how glad I am so see this Bill coming into the Seanad in the first place and thus perhaps helping to offset the things that have been said recently about the usefulness of this Chamber which I think are very much based on what people may read in the papers and very little on what they might discover if they actually read the debates of this House.</P>
      <P>It is symbolic in a sense that this Bill should have been introduced in this House because it is a Bill to do with the cultural life of the country.  This House has played a very large part in encouraging the cultural life of the country.  The Bill does show that as a State and as a Government appreciation is given to the enormous gift which Chester Beatty gave to this country in presenting his collection, which is a most wonderful collection of manuscripts and other artefacts, to Ireland.  I am delighted to see that steps are being taken to provide moneys to help to house and preserve this collection.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzsimons is right in suggesting that we could go a little beyond the section in the Bill which talks of the maintenance, upkeep, repair, renovation and improvement of the premises.  While renovation and improvement are included, to specify that the necessity is for the safety and the proper preservation and spatial requirements of this collection is a good idea and certainly I would support the spirit behind Senator Fitzsimons' amendment.  It is important not alone that this collection should be preserved and properly housed but that it should have the widest possible publicity so that many people would be encouraged to go and see the wonderful collection of artefacts, manuscripts and so on that are there in the Chester Beatty Library, and that they should be set out in the best possible surroundings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a brief word on this amendment put down by Senator Fitzsimons.  Perhaps there is <Col N="1220" /> something that suggests that the limitations of this Bill have not been recognised. I would wish to see unlimited funding being given to the Chester Beatty Library so enthusiastic am I about it and, indeed, about the priceless collection of manuscripts and artefacts which it houses.  The facts are, as I understand them, that some £50,000 was spent by the trustees and that this Bill just allows us to give this money back to them.  I would be glad if the Minister, when she is responding to this amendment, would perhaps clarify that.  My understanding was that this money had already been spent and that this measure, which is a very simple one, is merely designed to reimburse, and that while we might wish this Bill to go a lot further and to encompass a larger range of improvements and greater and better facilities in the library which I recognise are needed, in fact, the Bill is of narrower dimensions and does not, in my understanding, allow us to do what I suppose is the point of the amendment which has been put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in a Second Stage speech when one of the Senators talked of the necessity from time to time to move artefacts and manuscripts for the purpose of special exhibitions from one building to another and that very often these priceless objects have to be carried on a tray and perhaps someone runs beside the tray and the person carrying it with an umbrella or perhaps there is a simple cover put over the tray to protect the objects.  That is not good enough. There should be linkages between one building and another which would obviate the danger of destruction of these materials by the elements.  Particularly in today's difficult situation, security must be kept in mind.  Perhaps all of that is covered by the improvements of the premises which are talked about in the Bill. While we might like to see so much of what is included in the amendment, it is really up to the trustees to design their programmes for the improvement of the library and then to make their case, so that the funding will come on stream.  I <Col N="1221" /> would seek clarification from the Minister when she responds to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept Senator Bulbulia's interpretation.  I may not be correct in this.  While I understand that in section 3 it does make provision to make repayment of the £50,000 which has already been spent from 18 October 1984, nevertheless I understand the Bill to relate to any other work that has to be carried out to leave this building in a satisfactory condition.  Therefore, on that account, if I am correct, Senator Bulbulia might feel like withdrawing those reservations, seeing that the Bill, as I understand it, does not relate solely to that money which has already been spent but also makes provision for the carrying out of any works which are necessary in the future.  This is the area I am interested in.  When it refers to the opinions of the commissioners that, in my view, would be the opinion of someone in charge, who would be influenced to some extent by Government policy, who would be influenced by the amount of money that might be available and who would have many other pressures to deal with as well as the actual requirements of the building itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I felt, as Senator Bulbulia has said, that since it was the first Bill of its kind in relation to further improvements of the Chester Beatty Library, a more comprehensive Bill should have been introduced.  But, dealing strictly with the Bill we have before us, my interpretation is that it does make provision to carry out these works but that it leaves too much to the opinions and the decisions of the commissioners. An independent and fair minded individual who would examine the buildings should be able to say they are satisfactory or they are not satisfactory in relation to some specific requirements.  I am trying, in this amendment, to spell out the requirements which would be considered reasonable with a building of this kind, with a collection of this kind, a unique collection which, looking forward to the <Col N="1222" /> future, will hopefully be extended.  I am asking the Minister to incorporate the amendment in the Bill and it will certainly result in an improved Bill.</P>

      <P>They are a very important body.  The Bill gives them the power.  I would accept that, if the Government fail to give them proper funding or direction, they might have problems.  However, I would think that is one of the last things in the world the Office of Public Works would want is to say they did not want to do something because they did not have the price of it.  All of us have known the value of their work in the past, particularly in the area of important buildings and monuments belonging to the State. <Col N="1223" /> Their work is second to none in this area and I would want to defend what they have done in the past.  Admittedly, we complain about how slow they are in doing it; but the price to pay for slowness is thoroughness.  If you are going to do something like repairs or maintenance to the Chester Beatty Library it must be done with the kind of care, attention and thoroughness that we as legislators, would require.  I will let the Minister decide if the amendment is necessary or otherwise, but I must defend the Office of Public Works for the quality of the work they have always carried out in the past in respect of anything we have given them authority to do.  Theirs is a very special area of authority in that they cover all building programmes of the nation.  It is important to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia mentioned a specific reallocation of money to them and that is right.  This Bill also gives the power to the Minister for Finance to reimburse the trustees for money already expended. That is not an issue, because it is something that needs to be done because they have carried out works.  Because of the importance of this building it is important that in future a specific Government agency such as the Office of the Public Works, would be responsible, legally and constitutionally, to do that work.  That is as I understand the Bill.  Perhaps that is Senator Fitzsimons' view also.  I would just like to put that on the record.</P>

      <P>I admire greatly anything that Senator Ferris says in this House, but I resent to some extent when he lectures me on being critical of the Office of Public Works.  I feel I have a better understanding of the Office of Public Works than Senator Ferris has.  I worked in it for almost five years.  I know how hard they work.  I know the difficult job they have to do and I am familiar with the pressures which they have.  I am certainly not critical in that sense.  I know they do their work well.  I would not be one who would be critical of the Office of Public Works.  I have never seen anything <Col N="1224" /> while I worked there that I would be critical of.  They were all brilliant civil servants who did their work well.  When a file comes before any officer in the Office of Public Works there are pressures. That officer has his own ideas, but there are other people who would have an input to the file.  To say that the final decision of the commissioners in the Office of Public Works would be the correct decision in all cases is something I would not accept unless there were some proviso that the curator or whoever would be in charge of the trustees or whoever would be in charge of the Chester Beatty Library would have some input or could appeal against the decision or that they would be consulted and that in some way approval would be necessary from them in all cases.  We are dealing here with a Bill concerning a very important collection.  It is very unlikely that the next Bill will come before the House within the next ten years.  This is an important Bill.  We have an opportunity of dealing with this now.  It is a very short Bill.  We have an opportunity now of giving it a datum line in some way.  If it is not done in the way I suggest and if the Minister introduces it in some other way, I will be satisfied.  Some means should be provided of appealing against the opinions of the commissioners where those opinions would not coincide with the requirements of those in charge of the Chester Beatty Library.  I think it is very reasonable.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to support the view of Senators that this debate is of great benefit in highlighting and raising consciousness generally of the marvellous gift of Chester Beatty to our nation.  I would also like to commend the contributors in the <Col N="1225" /> Seanad on Second Stage for their excellent contributions and to thank those Senators who extended good wishes to me today on my new appointment.  In a short few weeks this is my third visit to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I particularly would like to thank Senator Fitzsimons for the interest he has shown in the Bill as evidenced by the two amendments put down by him.  While I will be opposing the two amendments I would like to emphasise that I appreciate and share the sentiments which underlie them.  However, because of the absolute necessity for legislation to be couched in precise and readily definable terms, the sections should stand as they are.  In this context, I should commence by emphasising the separate objectives in sections 2 and 3 in the Bill.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach mentioned earlier, I will refer to both amendments together.</P>
      <P>Section 2 sets out the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to carrying out works of any nature at the library premises.  The section is self-explanatory to a large extent.  The wording gives just regard to the importance of the collection in the library.  The very fact that the commissioners may:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;with the consent of the Minister and upon and subject to such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Commissioners and the trustees&rdquo;</P>
      <P>indicates there must be agreement between both bodies on the terms and conditions of any work.  That sentence should allay any fears Senator Fitzsimons may have in relation to this aspect as mentioned in his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 enables the Minister for Finance to recoup to the trustees of the library cost already incurred on certain works to the premises before this Bill comes into effect.  These works already undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works and paid for by the trustees include roof repairs and security measures. The amount involved is approximately £50,000.  I have examined in detail <Col N="1226" /> the Senator's amendments and I am satisfied as far as his section 2 amendment is concerned that while not improving on the section shown on the printed Bill it would instead introduce problems of uncertainty and ambiguity in legal interpretation. The section 3 amendment is linked with the section 2 amendment. Both sections of the Bill as I have already explained cater for separate objectives. Linking the two amendments together would, I am satisfied, confound the objectives and undermine the legality of the sections in the printed Bill.</P>
    <P>I might point out for Senator Bulbulia's information that section 2 would look after her reservations and cater quite adequately for the doubts she expressed earlier.</P>
    <P>In response to a few other points made, I would like to say that the Office of Public Works will undertake any major capital project which would be sponsored by the Minister of State for Arts and Culture on behalf of the library trustees. Any final decision on major capital expenditure will rest with the Government of the day.  The Office of Public Works will do any work on an agency basis so sanctioned.  I would like to reiterate the views expressed that the quality of the work of OPW should never be questioned.  You may be forgiven for some doubt as to the length of time some work takes to get under way but I can stand over the public monuments throughout the country and in Dublin are testament to the quality of their work. The OPW have vast experience in dealing with problems similar to those of the Chester Beatty Library: I draw your attention to the National Museum and Gallery and the many others that are around.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be in total agreement with the Minister of State that it would be very hard to be critical of the actual work carried out because, as I stated before, I have been involved in many projects and I know that only the best is good enough.  No words of mine would be sufficient to pay tribute; that is <Col N="1227" /> not in question.  I accept what the Minister has said.  Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>Such work as, in the opinion of the Commissioners, is necessary or expedient for the maintenance, upkeep, repair, renovation and improvement of the premises.</P>
      <P>What I am saying is this.  If there is a hole in the roof and water is pouring down, we would all accept that that needs attention. That is obvious.  If there is a serious crack which may be a structural problem, that needs attention.  But what I am talking about is with regard to an extension to the premises which may be necessary; with regard to the space that would be taken up to comply with the building regulations regarding safety, the means of escape in the case of a fire &mdash; there is going to be a considerable loss of space; with regard to the temperature of the building.  Are they provided for in this section and in the Bill?  With regard to the control of humidity, is that provided for?  It may well be regarded as improvement. Regarding the ambience and the proper control of the situation inside the building and with regard to the provision of access to the buildings from one to another, Senator Bulbulia has mentioned that at present items are carried from one building to another in the open.  Deputy Bermingham stated that provision would be made for connections between the buildings.  I accept that but with regard to the other areas, the humidity, the temperature, the lighting, the daylighting which is most important because, as the Senator has pointed out, this must be controlled, are all these covered in the section?  If the Minister says they are, I will be quite satisfied.</P>

      <P>I can only reiterate to Senator Fitzsimons that in effect section 2 will allow for any capital project with the consent of the Minister of State and sponsored by the Government of the day. Initially the matter will be discussed between the commissioners and the trustees. Finally, money can only be spent, not only in this area but in any aspect, <Col N="1228" /> with the consent of the Government.  The Minister of State for Arts and Culture will be responsible for ensuring the sponsorship of any work deemed absolutely necessary or deemed necessary at all. The provisions in section 2 cover your requirements without any guarantees; money will still have to be provided by Government on each and every issue as it arises.  The matter as stated is sufficient to carry out what the Senator has in mind.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister a question?  There is a general annoyance about fares.  It would be wrong of me to say that people do not ask the questions that they should ask.  Sometimes flights come from London to Cork which are not always full.  That is quite understandable but at the same time people say to me that Aer Lingus are not prepared to accept people on the conditions of the lower fare.  In other words, Aer Lingus hold a number of seats at the enormous charge of £240.  There is another fare of £109, provided you book two weeks in advance. Should they not be considered, because on the day when the plane may be only half full, there are people on stand-by prepared to take a low fare.  We are not <Col N="1229" /> giving the initiative or certainly not motivating people to use our air transport systems because of the high cost.  The Minister, like other Ministers, has given many arguments why Aer Lingus can charge so high for such a short flight in comparison to other flights to other areas up and down Great Britain and for that matter to other parts of Ireland.  Yet throughout the week planes fly in and out of Cork to and from London half empty. Are we considering any means of filling the planes?  Let me give an example. Other airlines we have given a licence to, and which use much smaller aircraft, flying from Cork to Cardiff, from where one has a three-hour train journey to London, charge a fare of only £110.  That plane is always full.  Let us be realistic.  If you are charged £110 to get to one city from where you can get a train to London, taking another three hours, you will do so rather than pay the double fare to Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus must see the light and say: &ldquo;If we are not going to charge £110 or £120, surely there can be a compromise to fill the aircraft&rdquo;.  That is the argument that I am trying to make. Should we not have a first priority to giving a proper service.  Many people say to me that they are quite prepared to fly on other aircraft out of Cork to another city in Britain and then take a three-hour train journey for a much lesser cost.  It is about £110.  At the same time they are prepared to take five to seven hours to get to London rather than go by Aer Lingus for £240.  There are times when the plane could be filled up quite easily at a lesser price.</P>

      <P>It is standard worldwide practice for a scheduled airline to submit their tariffs for approval by the State which they serve. This legislation we are now passing enables the Minister to require, on foot of a notice of writing, the written submission by airlines and the particulars of any tariff or proposal in advance of its implementation.  What the Senator is referring to is the possibility of a two-tier system within the one aircraft flying in at <Col N="1230" /> that time.  The possibility is there, but he has to get approval for it in the ordinary way as required by this legislation.  If a package of that nature is submitted by an airline then it is a matter for the Minister to see whether this conforms with the various rules and regulations.  The facility for it exists within the present legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very well aware that the airlines are commercial bodies and are naturally anxious to maximise their own commercial advantage and to negate as much as possible the disadvantages. Nothing can be more disadvantageous than an empty seat. Sometimes it is difficult for the lay person to understand the suggestion you put forward. What they have to do is take the other users into consideration.  If you take the much talked of high-profile return flight between London and Amsterdam, which is £45, what has happened there is that certain sections within the plane are partitioned off, so that you have a two-tier system within the one flight.</P>
      <P>I certainly would be delighted to convey the Senator's comments to our airlines and ask them for their comments and to put forward his suggestions for their consideration.</P>

      <P>I mentioned on Second Stage the problems we have in relation to tourism interests with particular reference to the cost of a flight from London to Dublin or Cork.  There is a huge discrepancy.  Is the main cost factor in the take-off or at the landing stage where so much fuel is absorbed and money wasted?  If we relate the price of a flight from Dublin to London with a flight from London to New York or Boston there is a huge discrepancy.  Compared with the £45 flight from London to Amsterdam, which the Minister mentioned, the fee quoted for the flight from Dublin to London seems to be ridiculous. <Col N="1231" /> It is common practice for people to drive to Belfast and take a flight to London.  It is much cheaper.  It is much cheaper for three people to travel by boat to England and take a train to their destination than it is for a single fare flight from Dublin to London.  That is the point of principle we are discussing in this amendment, which I support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, to get back to the earlier points by the Cork Senator, I am happy to advise him and all Senators that some Apex fares from Cork to London in 1986 are being reduced by 8 per cent.  This agreement happened in the last week.  As regards the Dublin-London flight, which invariably comes up, I will deal with it at length on Report Stage. There has been an EC Commission study in recent times which shows that less than 40 per cent of the cost of any particular flight is within the complete control of the airlines.  Having said that, it is a fact that Senators on Second Stage expressed reservations and concern on the cost of the flight from Dublin to London.  In the course of the reply I pointed out that the Minister in recent times had authorised a Dublin-Luton flight, which could be regarded as a Dublin-London flight, to Ryan Air for £99.  Certainly, this is going to be watched very closely to see how the airline will fare regarding capacity, the use of this route and how they will fare as far as the economics of running this particular flight are concerned.</P>
      <P>I also mentioned that in recent times I met Mr. Spicer, the UK Minister for Aviation, where we inaugurated talks on a bilateral basis on the liberalisation of air transport between our countries. Officials will be meeting within the next week or two on that particular aspect.  In the past I have noted all that has been said on the Dublin-London flight.  This again has been referred to by Senator Lynch.  I would have an obligation to refer this matter also to Aer Lingus, who are, of course, the main carriers on this route, and to give them the observations and wisdom of the Members of this House on this aspect.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, the Minister mentioned the Apex fare, which is much cheaper.  Apart from the tourism aspect, this flight is totally unsuitable for the business sector.  To avail of the lower fare one must sacrifice their weekend.  Most business people &mdash; I am talking about retailers, publicans and hoteliers &mdash; main business transactions take place at the weekend.  The pubs are empty for most of the time during midweek. But on Saturday and Sunday nights any businessman who wants to stay in business must be there to supervise his staff.  The Apex fare flight is out as far as this section of the community are concerned as one has to stay overnight on the Saturday and come back on the Sunday.  It is totally unsuitable and that is one of the reasons why it is not being availed of.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the conditions attaching to the Apex fare flight. Coming back to the famous London-Amsterdam flight, apparently the trick is to find anyone who has succeeded in fulfilling all the conditions by which one can get there and back again, because it is totally surrounded by a very restrictive conditions.  I understand that one cannot book at the airport; you have to book at some downtown office.  One has to repeat the booking on the far side coming back. I agree that the Apex flights are very restricted.  I agree they are very restrictive, I am able to tell the Senator that the Ryan Air flight for £99, which I just mentioned, is totally unrestricted.  It is possible to book on that and it is not confined as are the Apex flights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the fact that this service is now going to be a reality.  However, what concerns me is that we are going to have an unrestricted Ryan Air fare of £99 side by side with an Aer Lingus/BA fare of £204.  If one is required to go to London at short notice, there is little doubt that the slight inconvenience of arriving at Luton and making one's way to London will not put <Col N="1233" /> anybody off using the £99 fare.  Therefore, there should be little problem so far as load capacity is concerned.  I would like the Minister to clarify if he is satisfied that Ryan Air, particularly at Dublin Airport, will receive full co-operation in the administration and operation of the service? I say this having in mind that when a previous application came from another airline problems arose with regard to the sharing of the booking computer and other airport services.  I am inviting the Minister to put on the record that the difficulties that apparently arose in relation to that application will not now apply to Ryan Air and that there will be no difficulties encountered by that airline at Dublin Airport in relation to computer bookings or services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Senator on that matter.  Ryan Air will be self-handling, as the technical terms goes.  In other words, it will be handling its own procedures at Dublin Airport.  This statement will obviously allay some of the fears being expressed by the Senator.  At the Luton end, I imagine they will have a handler on a commercial basis and obviously will demand a proper and appropriate service from it.  Naturally, I would be keen to see that all facilities would be provided in the ordinary commercial sense.  One of the important facts for the airline is that it will be self-handling, as the technical term goes.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an <Col N="1234" /> enabling measure which when enacted will permit the establishment of free ports generally in the State.  While the Bill does not, therefore, deal with any specific location, its primary purpose is to permit of the establishment of a free port at Ringaskiddy, County Cork.  There are no plans to establish any other free ports for the moment.  May I say Senators will find it very interesting legislation, with very considerable possibilities for the future. I am indeed privileged to have the opportunity of bringing it to this House.</P>
      <P>The principal provisions of the Bill are:</P>
      <P>Section 2, which enables the Minister for Communications by order to establish or vary the limits of a free port;</P>
      <P>Section 3, which enables the Minister by order to designate persons to control and manage a free port;</P>
      <P>Section 4, which enables the Minister to grant licences authorising the carrying on of businesses within a free port;</P>
      <P>Section 10, which adapts the law relating to customs duties in its application to a free port; and</P>
      <P>Section 12, which enables the Minister for Finance to make regulations providing, <i>inter alia</i>, for the necessary customs controls and procedures to apply to a free port.</P>
      <P>The origins of this Bill lie in the deliberations of the Task Force on Employment in the Cork Area, which made a number of recommendations in 1984 designed to stimulate economic activity and employment in the Cork region.  Among the recommendations was that a free port be established at Ringaskiddy.  I will return presently to the arrangements that might be applied to that location, but first I want to indicate the nature and extent of the benefits which it is proposed would be conferred on businesses setting up in a free port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial benefits will derive from deferred liability for customs duties and VAT.  In the case of customs duties, the Bill provides that non-European Community goods imported into a free port will only become liable for customs duties <Col N="1235" /> if and when they are subsequently placed on the Community market.  This is the effect of section 10 of the Bill.  Goods originating in the European Community, of course, are in free circulation and are not subject to customs duties on arrival in the State in any event.  The benefit of this concession to the cash flow of a particular business will depend, of course, on the nature and extent of that business.  An indication of the degree of potential benefit is that the average rate of customs duty is of the order of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The proposed VAT reliefs are not provided for in the Bill.  They will be the subject of separate regulations to be made by the Revenue Commissioners under the VAT Act.  The main thrust of the regulations will be as follows.  First, a business operating within a free port would be able to import, without payment of VAT, materials, machinery etc. for use in the free port in connection with processing or manufacturing there. Secondly, VAT would be charged at the zero rate on goods supplied within the free port itself.  Thirdly, goods entering the rest of the State from the free port would come under the internal VAT system if the subject of a sale, which would normally be the case, and would not then incur import VAT.</P>
    <P>Under these arrangements finished consumer goods would not qualify for relief from VAT on importation into a free port nor in general would any other goods imported for resale.  As I have said, however, relief would apply to all materials, components, plant or machinery imported for use by a manufacturing or processing concern within a free port. This is the correct approach, I believe, since the purpose of the concessions is to stimulate economic activity and therefore employment within the free port and not simply to divert normal trade from elsewhere in the State.  The purpose is to stimulate this extra activity.  It is not a question of diverting something which is happening in one place and putting it into another but of generating employment and extra economic activity</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> Apart from these financial benefits, a free port will also afford some less tangible but nonetheless real and valuable advantages, namely, a concentration of facilities and infrastructure leading to economies of scale, a more secure environment and simplification of customs procedures and documentation. These I expect to be attractive to small firms and to firms which might not otherwise become involved in re-export trade.</P>
    <P>I envisage that the initial area to be designated as a free port at Ringaskiddy will be comparatively small.  Cork Harbour Commissioners have proposed the designation of a 30 acre site of theirs at Ringaskiddy, which is beside the car ferry terminal and near the deepwater berth which will be completed later this year. The commissioners have proposed that they should develop this site in conjunction with private interests.  Another possibility would be the provision and development of a site elsewhere in the area by private interests.</P>
    <P>The designated area can be extended by order made under section 2 of the Bill when enacted as the need arises.  I envisage the provision of infrastructure being phased in in line with the development of activity in the free port.  I might mention that additional areas do not have to be contiguous with the area designated at the outset &mdash; for example, a separate area could be designated to cater for servicing needs of offshore drilling activity.</P>
    <P>As regards the day-to-day management and control of the Ringaskiddy free port, I am considering a number of options.  One of these would involve a joint venture between Cork Harbour Commissioners and private sector partners and this would tie in with use of the commissioners' site to which I have already referred.  Private investors, of course, would expect to earn a return on their capital by providing accommodation and facilities in the free port to businesses establishing operations there. Cork Harbour Commissioners are &ldquo;testing the market&rdquo; as it were.  They have invited potential investors in the free port to submit proposals on the basis of the joint venture approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> The commissioners have invited submissions to be made to them on or before 21 March 1986.  I expect that the commissioners will have evaluated all such submissions sometime after Easter and that they will then put a comprehensive proposal to the Department.  This is one way of achieving the sort of local involvement I see as being essential to the success of the free port at Ringaskiddy.  Lest I be accused of showing favouritism to the commissioners, I would like to assure the House that I am prepared to consider any proposals for management and operation of the free port at Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>The designation of a person or persons to operate and manage the free port is just one step towards commencing activity in the free port.  Such activity will be subject to the licencing provision of section 4 of the Bill.  While full details have to be finalised, the intention is that the operator-Manager of the free port will have a significant role when applications for licences are being considered and evaluated by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am aware that free ports in the UK have been slow to develop and that there have been criticisms that the customs regime is too rigid.  Here, as in the UK, the free port will be subject to the criteria laid down in EC directives.  These are very firm and very definite in most respects.  We must remember that to a large extent a free port here is a free zone within a larger customs zone, the European Community.  The regime in Ireland must, by virtue of our membership of the EC, be much the same as that applying to the free ports in the UK. Like the free ports in the UK, I do not expect the free port at Ringaskiddy to become an overnight success.  With vigorous marketing by the operators I am confident that firms will be attracted to set up in the free port over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the Government's concern in legislating to provide free ports here is to generate additional economic activity.  If the free port simply diverts economic activity from elsewhere in the State the concept <Col N="1238" /> will have failed.  I would also like to point out that the Government have no desire that a free port should be used as a warehousing centre in which imports can be stored pending release for consumption on the home market.  If that were to be the case, the free port benefit would merely serve to subsidise the importation of goods and the end result would be to increase the competitive position of imports <i>vis-a-vis</i> goods produced at home.  As I have said already, what we wish to achieve is additional economic activity.  It is in the light of these factors that applications for licences to carry on activity within the free port will be considered.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning that there does exist already a number of mechanisms through which firms can suspend payment of customs duties.  The inward processing regime exists for non-Community goods.  Firms who export a substantial part of their production outside the European Economic Community usually qualify for this regime.  A firm which does not at present qualify for inward processing could, if it set up in the free port, qualify for an inward processing type regime and thereby achieve deferment of payment of customs duty.</P>
    <P>I am proceeding with this enabling measure now while the options for the particular arrangements as regards development and management of the Ringaskiddy free port are being investigated precisely so as to lend impetus to that investigation.  The Minister for Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and I will proceed, on enactment of the Bill, to make the necessary orders and regulations as quickly as possible to bring the Ringaskiddy Free Port into being.  Work on the necessary orders and regulations is proceeding.</P>
    <P>In the course of my earlier remarks I mentioned the new deepwater berth being provided at Ringaskiddy.  The cost of the berth is being met from a State grant of almost £10 million.  When the berth is completed next August, it will be capable of accommodating vessels of up to 60,000 tons deadweight.  It will, therefore, <Col N="1239" /> be the largest common user berth in the State.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the IDA have a fully-serviced 1,000-acre portside estate at Ringaskiddy.  This site and the port at Ringaskiddy, together with industrial estates at Churchfield, Hollyhill and Togher in Cork, have been designated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as areas which qualify for higher IDA grants than are generally made available. The Government have funded the cost of new infrastructure in the area.  This includes substantial processed water supplies, effluent disposal and road improvements. With the completion of the deepwater berth and the setting up of the free port the Ringaskiddy area will, I trust, prove to be a major centre for industrial activity in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>The acid test for the Ringaskiddy Free Port will be whether the area initially designated will require to be extended in a few years' time to cope with the scale of activity.  Having regard to the extent and scale of the State-financed facilities and assistance for new industry in the Ringaskiddy area, however, I am optimistic that the free port will indeed pass this test.  While the free port at Ringaskiddy will not be a panacea for the economic problems of the Cork area, it will, I am confident, be a stimulus for additional economic activity with proper development and marketing.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party to oppose the Bill but rather to have a free and open discussion on the principles of the Bill.  First, I think a little advertising touch was lost by the Minister for State and indeed the Department in naming the Bill the Free Ports Bill.  They could have put on an addendum such as the &ldquo;Duty Free Ports Bill&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Tax Free Ports Bill&rdquo; or some attractive name rather than simply the Free Ports Bill.  We have fallen into the usual trap that everything the British do has to be done by us in exactly the same way.  I am sorry that we have not used a touch of flamboyance and gone a little <Col N="1240" /> further to examine opportunities which were offered to people in similar situations to ourselves.  I will deal with that matter as I go along.</P>
      <P>In this country we have the finest entrepreneurs in Europe.  Only last week the Minister, or perhaps it was the Minister of State, commended the entrepreneurs of the Galway small industries section and said we had &ldquo;an unparalled programme&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that Irish people are very quick to grab any opportunity that comes not alone at home but in many countries throughout the world.  We have seen Irish people going abroad very poor and coming home as very wealthy people on account of this ability.  On that account I am sorry that the Bill got strangled in red tape.  When I say that I do not mean it as a personal reflection on the Minister for State.  But I get annoyed when I see sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 8 (3) of the Bill where the Government of the day, who are responsible for this legislation, have really entangled us in a mess of red tape.  Every breath that is drawn into the body of this particular project is stifled with the need for consent from the Minister. It will be tied up completely in red tape, because the bureaucracy of the Department has taken absolute and total control over the functions of this new project.  I am not saying that they should not have a say.  What I am saying is that they should have a say within the realm of responsibility they have.  After all, there is no question or doubt that the Government will be making a major investment; and for that investment they should have control, but not to the extent that they have grabbed control.  I thought that the Cork Port and Docks Board, for example &mdash; if there is such a thing &mdash; should have an input into this.  The local IDA should have an input and so should Córas Tráchtála and the county development team.  A very fine team exists in County Cork.  There are many other organs of society in Cork, such as the Chamber of Commerce.  In my opinion, they should have some input.  The project should be attractive, rather than have the <Col N="1241" /> dullness of the Department over everything.</P>
    <P>I thought we should have experimented slightly with the title.  Instead of copying everything British, we should have looked around.  I will give an instance and Senator Cregan, who is here, knows what I am talking about. The latest free port that I know of that has been put into operation is in Northern Cyprus.  There is a taboo by this Government over the last few years in respect of anything in Northern Cyprus.  Many Governments throughout Europe believe that the people living in that part of the island should not be allowed to breathe fresh air.  However, they are a community living under the same sun and the same breeze as the rest of us and they have to live.  They have provided a fine example of the free port idea, where they have private industry, the public sector, the private sector and the Government working together and giving a magnificent performance. This part of the island was a population of about 240,000 people, a little more perhaps than Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  That is a free port which has gone from strength to strength. Wisely &mdash; and I commend the Minister for the same idea &mdash; it is not allowed as a storage place for imports but it is used as a trans-shipment area and it has reaped a great reward.  It is used for industrial development where they do not have the raw materials, as we do not have them in certain cases, and items are brought in and manufactured.  Employment is given and the goods re-exported.  This is a wonderful project which was introduced against the wishes of many Governments in Europe.  It is a very viable free port and it is also a duty free port.  It is an example of a small project similar to what is being done in Cork.  Arklow is another suitable case and I could not leave out the west of Ireland: there are several places &mdash; Sligo would be one, Galway could be another, the Shannon Estuary could be another and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not forget.  I am talking in particular of Ringaskiddy because it is built.  It is something that could develop, and perhaps it could develop in smaller units rather than in larger ones.  I would like to claim at this stage that it is not a development solely for Cork.  There may be other regions where a similar facility could be provided. God help anybody who tries to do so because section 2 of the Bill states that &ldquo;the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce may by order declare that...&rdquo; I just want to comment on this point to add force to my contention that bureaucracy has really wrapped itself around this idea to the extent that it may not be workable.  Section 3 of the Bill says that each free port established under the Act shall be under the control and management of such person or persons as may be designated by order by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I spent a while close to Government from 1979 to 1981. My recollection of the Department of Finance is one that, I am sure, many former Ministers of State, the present Minister of State and many Ministers share, that it was a kind of gestapo camp &mdash; you had to get in first, try to get what you wanted and try to come out safe.  I cannot see how the Ringaskiddy scheme is going to work because they will have to get the blessing of that Department for everything they do.  I shall have amendments down for the next Stage asking the Minister to reconsider this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 4, the Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, grant or refuse to grant to any person a licence authorising the carrying on within the free port of any <Col N="1243" /> trade, business or manufacture.  That is totalitarian in the extreme.  No other person has a say here obviously, except the Minister with the consent of the other two Ministers.  I think that must be changed. I do not think it is workable, or can be workable, and for the sake of the Bill and the thought that goes into it something must be done about it.</P>
    <P>Take the application for a licence, for example.  Any person may apply to the Minister for a licence.  Every application shall be in writing and must be sent to the Secretary of the Department of Communications, Dublin.  It must specify the trade, business or manufacture to which the applicant desires the licence to relate and be accompanied by such information as the Minister may require.  That is an unending request.  The Minister could require further and further information. It will go on and go on and go on.  I am a realist in what I am saying.</P>
    <P>To be quite frank about it, if I had read the Bill with more care when it was first circulated I would actually be opposing it on Second Stage, because I believe it is not a Bill appropriate to the project in Ringaskiddy or anywhere in this country where a free port might be taken up. Under section 6 the Minister, after consultation with the other two Ministers, may attach to the licence such conditions as he thinks proper.  It is too totalitarian. Also, I see that anybody who does not comply with the conditions attached to the licence shall, in addition to any other penalty to which he may be liable, be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable to a summary conviction of a fine not exceeding £500.  The trouble about this is that the Minister is the judge and the jury.  I do not see any part of the Bill where there is the right of recourse to the law.  If it is written into it, let me hear in what sections of the Bill it is.  If for example, any industry became competitive with an industry at home or abroad in a way the Minister or his staff might think improper, they can actually say to those involved: &ldquo;You are breaking the terms of your licence&rdquo;.  I do not see any protection under normal State law <Col N="1244" /> for any man to appeal against revocation of licence except to the Minister, the man that took it off him in the first instance. What is the point?  It is a case of the court in hell and the devil the judge.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I think we have gone wrong.  Would it not have been a far better system if a board of directors was set up in Cork, where there was a management structure, and input by the port and docks board, where there was an input by the IDA, who are, after all, putting in a lot of money into that area for development of land.  The county council and the corporation, I am sure, are giving adequate funds.</P>
    <P>I feel certain that the county development team would have many fine ideas for smaller units.  Would it not be far better if, for example, they were brought together with a ministerial appointee on the board with four representatives or three, two or ten or whatever it might be?  Would it not be far better if it had got the local input into it instead of this, &ldquo;The Minister has the right&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Minister has not the right&rdquo;.  That is exactly what we are talking about.  I just give that as an example to outline my objections to it.  The idea in itself is good, but in fact the proposals in the Bill leave a lot to be desired.  It is far too totalitarian.</P>
    <P>The carrying on of trade, business or manufacture within the free port are again totally subject to the licence, which in the first instance was granted by the Minister.  Subject to such conditions as the Revenue Commissioners may impose, non-Community goods brought into the port shall be exempt from import duties and shall continue to be exempt from such duties for as long as the goods remain within the free port.  Non-Community goods in a free port may be subject to loading, unloading, transhipment or storage.  That is the part of it I like.  Therein lies an opportunity for a profit-making unit within the free port itself.  I have given an example of where I have seen that at work, and that was in Northern Cyprus, where a trans-shipment programme was brought in.  It is working well.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay too long, because <Col N="1245" /> there are other speakers to follow. Generally, we are not opposing the Bill. We have great reservations in regard to the authoritarianism of the Bill in giving to the Minister all the power he wishes. To give such powers to one Minister is bad enough but to involve two more, including the Minister for Finance, is certainly, in my opinion, putting the project into reverse.  There will be heels worn walking up and down to those Departments trying to get answers.  Well we know it, and let us be factual.  Many people will say that it is their job to examine everything and they do that job in a very fine way.  Sometimes their aggressiveness in their job stops you from being progressive.  Not only is the consent of the Minister for Communications required, but also that of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I feel that that is going to dampen the whole project.  I would ask the Minister to re-examine the Bill and eliminate some of these provisos.  I know he understands what I am trying to say.</P>
    <P>We have an example of an &ldquo;inland free port&rdquo; at the moment in the new airport in Knock, where the major meat processing company in the country had the courage to say that, strictly for commercial reasons, they are giving thought to the building of a huge complex to store cold meat and to export a planeload per day, seven planes per week, from Knock Airport. I do not know what Minister Nealon might like to say about the idea of a free port, but certainly something should be done.  I do not know if the exports from Cork Airport in any given month is as much as Halal states that they will export out of Knock Airport in a week.  In fairness, they must be given a chance.</P>
    <P>I say that as an aside because I believe that the free port idea is basically built around Ringaskiddy.  However, it is no harm for this House to note that there are other ideas for freeports, and I am suggesting one now.  I am sure Minister Nealon, being a West of Ireland man, realises that the statement made during the week was a very responsible one.  He knows that the company I am speaking <Col N="1246" /> about are very reliable, a very strong company and a very viable company. They are an example to meat processors throughout the world.  The amount of downstream processing meat they carry out is almost incredible.  There is nothing left to process when they are finished with the carcass.  That is something we encourage.  Look at the employment it gives.  That is really what we are talking about.  In his reply, or at a later stage, the Minister might give some thought to the idea of having a fresh look at this situation to see if anything could be done. In saying that I do not want to take away from the Ringaskiddy project or the freeport, if we are talking about sea shipping. The idea of this Bill is very welcome, but the manner in which it is presented to us is, to me, rather shocking.  It is something I am rather against.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Cork Senator, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The origins of the Bill lie in the deliberations of the Task Force on Employment in the Cork Area, which made a number of recommendations in 1984, designed to stimulate economic activity and employment in the Cork region.  We are all aware that unemployment struck Cork very severely over the past three years, especially with the closure of Ford's, Dunlop's and the Verolme dockyard.  These companies between them employed in excess of 2,000 people. When they closed they affected a number of service industries depending on them, which resulted in tremendous hardship for the Cork area.  Among the recommendations of the task force was that a free port be established at Ringaskiddy, this task force was made up of representatives of Cork County Council, Cork Harbour Commissioners, Cork Corporation and the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment them on these recommendations. A Cork Senator does not have to ask why Ringaskiddy was chosen. The facilities in Ringaskiddy do not exist anywhere else in the country and, as such, are a national asset.  Tremendous investment has been put into the IDA scheme there over the past number of years and <Col N="1247" /> Cork County Council have spent approximately £47 million.  This expenditure has been used in bringing Ringaskiddy up to the standards necessary for the anticipated traffic in to and out of the area. The land bank in the possession of the IDA amounts to 1,000 acres and there are options for further land acquisitions there also.  The largest quantity of processed water provided anywhere in the country is also laid on.  Effluent disposal facilities exist and a deep water berth is in the course of construction, costing approximately £10 million.  It is necessary therefore, that we would complement the facilities that exist there by having a free port.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also told us that the Cork area has special privileges in that special IDA grants have already been given to it.  He has stated that these grants will apply to the free port area as well as to the other two estates, Togher and Hollyhill.  The Government have funded, at huge costs, the improving of infrastructure in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill gives the Minister power to establish or vary the limits of the free port area.  I hope the success of this free port will prove that this area is inadequate, which at the moment stands at approximately 30 acres.  I am sure that the Minister will increase the size of the site when necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 3 enables the Minister, by order, to designate people to control and manage the free port.  We recently discussed the National Development Corporation Bill in this House and one of the guarantees by the Minister then was that the composition of that board would have to be people of the highest calibre in order for it to succeed.  I am sure the same criterion will apply here and that the people controlling this area will have a sound track record and will ensure that, in the final analysis, the decisions to be taken will be based on what is best for the commercial viability and future of the port.</P>
    <P>At the outset we should be clear in our minds that the purpose of a free port is to stimulate economic activity and create <Col N="1248" /> employment in the region.  The very fact that a port is established in a particular area means that a range of benefits is conferred on business setting up in such ports.  The financial benefits will derive from deferred liabilities for customs duties and VAT.  In the case of customs duties the Bill provides that the non-European Community goods imported into a free port will become liable for customs duty only if and when they are subsequently placed on the community market.  Goods originating in the European Community, of course, are in free circulation and are not subject to customs duties on arrival in the State in any event. The benefit of this concession to the cash flow of a business will depend on the nature and extent of that business.  An indication of the degree of potential benefit is that the average rate of customs duty is of the order of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State stated in his introductory remarks that there are no proposals in this Bill for VAT reliefs but that they would be the subject of several regulations to be made by the Revenue Commissioners under the VAT Act.  I understand that the main thrust of the regulations will be as follows: First, a business operating within a free port will be able to import without payment of VAT materials, machinery and so on for use in the free port in connection with processing or manufacturing there. Secondly, VAT will be charged at a zero-rate on goods supplied within the free port.  Thirdly, goods entering the rest of the State from the free port would come under the internal VAT system if the subject of a sale, which would normally be the case, and would not then incur import VAT.</P>
    <P>I understand that under these arrangements finished consumer goods would not qualify for relief from VAT on importation into a free port, nor in general would any other goods imported for re-sale. Relief would apply to all materials, components, plant or machinery imported for use by manufacturing or processing concerns within a free port.  We are advised that this is the correct approach since, as I have already said, the purpose of the <Col N="1249" /> concessions is to stimulate economic activity and, therefore, employment within the free port and not simply to divert normal trade from elsewhere in the State.  It is well to remember that a free port will also afford some less tangible but nonetheless real and valuable advantages apart from the financial benefits I have already mentioned, advantages such as a concentration of facilities and infrastructure, leading to economies of scale, a more secure environment, simplification of customs procedures and documentation, which of course would be extremely attractive to small firms and firms which might not otherwise become involved in the re-export trade.</P>
    <P>There are more than 400 free ports throughout the world at present.  It is believed that about 20 per cent of world trade takes place through them.  Most of this growth in trade through free ports is taking place in less developed and developing economies where they have been a spectacular success.  It can be said that the most successful free port in the world is in Miami, which is the biggest privately-owned venture in the world.  The most important aspect is, of course, its location, because it can deal with the United States, Central and Southern America and Europe.  It has a unique position geographically for this kind of development. It has the added attraction of a large cargo airport beside it, the port being the third largest container terminal on the east coast of the United States. The United Kingdom has already designated six areas where they hope to establish successful free ports.  These are at Belfast, Birmingham, Liverpool, Cardiff, Prestwick and Southampton.  The British Government, while giving every encouragement for their success, have given also an ultimatum that the ports should develop within a five-year period. Reports to date indicate that Liverpool and, in particular, Southampton are the most successful.</P>
    <P>There is a lesson to be learned from this in that from the start it is obvious that Southampton and Liverpool enjoyed natural advantages over the other centres. <Col N="1250" /> This is an important point and it is one that should be at the forefront of our thinking in this area.  Ringaskiddy, as a free port, should be supported.  Every effort should be made to ensure its success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the other speakers, welcome the Bill.  We, in the Republic of Ireland, recognised before the British that there was a need for free zones and free ports.  In March 1983 we stated that we should consider Ringaskiddy and Cork as a free zone and free port area.</P>
      <P>I have reservations on the Bill.  There is an enormous amount of legislation involved which concerns many ministerial offices.  Before I mooted the idea of a free port in Cork, I investigated the situation elsewhere, for example, to find out what exactly free ports mean, what they can do for an area and for a country. Our rules are very stringent as regards initiative and transport facilities.  Our customs and tax rules are stringent.  I have seen situations elsewhere where, because of the facilities being given in a free zone&mdash;I emphasise free zone, rather than free port because there is a definition of a zoned area and a port facility&mdash;enormous investment has been created.  Other Senators have already mentioned this.</P>
      <P>I envisage this facility in the Cork area. The Cork area needs it.  The amount of old heavy industry that has been lost in Cork over the last few years has had a disastrous effect on the city and county. Because of the direct and indirect service that had been provided to those industries there is in the region of 10,000 to 12,000 fewer people working.  This is not good for a city like Cork.  The idea of a free port was pushed in order to generate confidence and initiative in the area.  I am happy to say that, despite arguments made at parliamentary level in the early months of 1983, the Government were prepared to consider it and it was recommended through a task report in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Killilea, I must state that we are not going far enough on this.  Are we showing enough initiative?  Are we being too negative?  Are we motivating people properly?  There is no reason why <Col N="1251" /> we should not be considering free ports if they are going to create employment. We badly need it in all areas.  The Government recognise that there is a need for a free zone and free port facilities in Cork.</P>
    <P>The definition of a free port in the Bill is not broad enough.  We are naive and small-minded.  Since I mooted the idea of a free port in 1983 I have checked out other areas.  In the Bill, there is a strong emphasis on the European Economic Community.  I appreciate this but the fact of the matter is that the vast majority of free ports set up in Europe were there well before the EC was created.  For example, Hamburg is a city which has a massive free zone.  It is in the region of seven miles long and two miles wide. There are no problems there.  If we tell the people in Hamburg that because of EC rulings they cannot now have it, what answer would we get?  We have to be realistic about this.  What argument can we put to the people, not alone in Cork but in other areas?  Can we say that because of EC rulings we cannot do this and we cannot do that?  Hamburg can do what they like and other countries in the main part of Europe.  This is not good enough for me.  If we are going to create a situation whereby we are giving the impression that there is a free zone in Ringaskiddy with many restrictions and that because of EC rulings we cannot do such and such, this will not work.</P>
    <P>I have examined this whole question in other areas outside of the EC.  I should like to quote from a booklet about income tax exemption in a free zone which says that the salaries of persons working within the free zone are not subject to income taxes.  People working within these zones do not pay taxes.</P>

      <P>To give an example, Turkey applied for membership of the EC in 1974 and were being considered in 1964, long before Ireland.  The facts are that these people see the advantage. There are four areas in Turkey the size of Castlebar that have free zones and free port facilities.  This is an example of what these people are prepared to do to get people in to create employment, and not to take things from them, but to give the initiative to the people in the oil business to work.  We may not get taxes from it but we do not have to pay the people who work there.  The facts are that the investments are the incentives.  Investors may bring into the free zone any inputs they require from foreign locations without being subject to any taxes, duties or tolls.  It is stated in the Bill that the Government may consider the idea of no taxes, or may consider the idea of no duties.  We are not committed to saying that we are not going to charge taxes; we must be committed.  We must tell the people to go in there and create jobs, and leave it at that.  This is the incentive that we must give to the people.  We have countries like Japan and the United States selling their goods in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I envisaged, and still do, the idea that if we are going to put into the lower area of Ringaskiddy an amount of about £112 million, what will be the investment in infrastructure by the State and Europe when the deepwater berth is finished, we must have tonnage to the amount of 70,000 tonnes.  We should have ships never seen in Ireland before.  What are we going to do about it &mdash; create a bird sanctuary?  What is it going to be?  Are we going to give the initiative to people to come in and say &ldquo;fit it up, but we don't want to know about you but we want people working&rdquo;?  To get people working is the first priority in my mind.  I am not saying that it will be a miracle.  I am not under any allusion, but I believe that there is an advantage there and there is no way anybody in the EC that already has the same advantages can say to me that I cannot benefit, because that is illegal.  How can anybody else in the EC say to us: &ldquo;You cannot do that in Ireland <Col N="1253" /> because we already have it in Hamburg&rdquo;? These are the facts.  We are going to invest money in proper infrastructure.  I am not saying that Ringaskiddy should not have been created.  I do not want to see it as a bird sanctuary.  People have already asked us to build something in Ringaskiddy for them and when it was there they pulled out.  Nobody questioned them on it but it was the B + I. These are the people and they have another £36 million about which they do not want to talk.</P>
    <P>I see a situation here, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, in which we must give every advantage.  I do not want one Minister's Department questioning another Department about whether or not we can do this or that.  We must do it.  Nobody must have any say if we get anything moving down here.  Imagine what the IDA are spending at the moment to get anybody to set up an industry.  Over the past three or four years, off the east coast of Ireland, we have people who are interested in the oil industry and the rig situation. A situation was created whereby all the equipment that was provided for all the rigs on our east coast never came near our land.  It was cheaper for these people to send heavy shipping up and down the Irish Sea to get to Aberdeen so that they could carry that stuff from Aberdeen right down to the rigs.  It was cheaper for them to do that than to get heavier ships to bring it into our ports.  It could not be put on land and taken off again because it was costing too much. How ridiculous can we be?  These people could not put the equipment on board in any part of Ireland, whether it be Waterford, Rosslare or Cork.  The amount of work that was created in Great Britain for servicing off our coast was unbelievable, as was the amount of money that was spent.  We must create a free zone. Ships must be able to land goods there and take them out again.  This creates work &mdash; lifting, handling and reloading. There is retransportation.  The service provides for it.  The Bill recognises the idea of a free port, but it certainly does not legislate at this stage for the type of free port.  It does not say what type of <Col N="1254" /> people can come in.  Could one imagine every advantage being given here to people to come in and create a situation such as that in Turkey?  I did not want to mention that country.  People might not like the idea of it because they&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The IDA have made an impression, locally, in our area.  There is recognition from a national and local point of view of the potential of Cork city and county.  Cork is an old heavy industry area.  Cork port has been working for the last 300 years.  A great deal of work was carried out in our port area.  All of a sudden there was rapid deterioration.  It is just dying a death.  That is a fact.  All of a sudden we have created this position and now there is new light.  There is new motivation in people.  We will have a look at the situation in another few years, that is not good enough.  Can we imagine the heavy tonnage that is going into Western Europe?  Can we imagine the tonnage that is going into Rotterdam?  Can we bring about a situation where we might stop about 10 per cent of it from going there because it is held there too long? Maybe a 70,000 tonne ship, rather than going further, would pull into Cork, discharge, and redistribute from Cork, because there is a free zone area there. A shipper might feel he could drop off and get smaller ships to go into smaller harbours.  That is why I am talking about free zone areas.  Could we handle the total distribution of Japanese cars from Ireland to feed Europe?  Could anybody envisage that or do you think it can happen?  Why not?  Why could we not be the main distributors for Japanese cars in the total area of Europe?  It can be done, <Col N="1255" /> if we give the incentive.  The country is idle so we have the room to do it.  We can redistribute from Ireland.  It need not be from Cork but we have another free zone on the east coast.  After all Great Britain are doing it in Belfast.  They are doing it, and maybe they see the light from there.  That is the type of selling we should be doing.  This is what we should be saying to people who want to set up in our country.  We should point out the advantages they have not got elsewhere, particularly in port areas.  The advantage that we have here is not in other countries. The advantage is a fast turn around with heavy tonnage.  There is no way that a heavy tonnage ship can be held up.</P>

    <Title>Oireachtas and Judicial Pensions: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann, mindful of the constant exhortations of successive Governments for pay restraint from all sections of the population, calls on the Government to introduce legislation to ensure that neither the President nor any member of the Judiciary nor any member of the Oireachtas, nor any member of the European Parliament, receives a pension by virtue of having held office, either as Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the Dáil, or as Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad or as a member of the Government or Minister of State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Ross.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion presents considerable difficulty for some Members of the House who are conscious of the public mood in relation to the payment of pensions to Members of the Oireachtas and others who hold office in respect of periods of time when they held previous and nore exalted office.  It would be foolhardy not to accept that there is a general <Col N="1256" /> feeling in the country that this creature of legislation which was introduced as a result of an independent review procedure has outlived its usefulness and that a re-examination of the provisions of the appropriate legislation would be proper. However, it is also important to point out that we are not being asked in this motion to decide on the principles of pensions. That is not what this motion is about.  This motion is about a very specific proposal calling upon the Government to introduce legislation to ensure that neither the President &mdash; they are not talking about future Presidents or past Presidents but the present President &mdash; nor any member of the Judiciary, nor any Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, nor any member of the European Parliament shall receive a pension by virtue of having held office in the series of offices which are listed.</P>
      <P>Seanad Éireann and, indeed, the Government lack the capacity to pass such legislation.  I do not think it is feasible; I do not think it is possible or constitutional. It is a denial of the rights of those people who already have those pensions to suggest that legislation should be introduced to do away with them.  I will deal with the principle later, a principle with which I have considerable sympathy and I think that certain things should be done along those lines but to suggest that the President of the country at the present time and members of the Judiciary and other Members of the Oireachtas at present in receipt of pensions should have these pensions taken from them, is beyond the capacity of this House and is merely gallery play, is merely an attempt by the mover of the motion and his seconder to get certain political kudos for suggesting this reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the position of a Member of this House or the other House who has held ministerial office or a person who has held ministerial office and is now a judge.  If you pass legislation denying them the continuation of the pension which they at present enjoy, does anyone in this House seriously think that that is incapable of being challenged.  Do you think you can just take away a person's <Col N="1257" /> pension and take away the rights they have accumulated as a result of a contract between them and the State?  Do you think you can do that just by an act of the Oireachtas?  That is totally unrealistic and it shows the shallowness of the knowledge of those people who put down the motion on the one hand or else their lack of principle in putting down a motion which they must have known on mature examination was so seriously and substantially flawed.  How can you expect us to take seriously a motion which suggests that rights which people have already accumulated should be taken from them?</P>
    <P>The very important reforms in this area which are necessary are being held back by this kind of pandering to the baser instincts of publicity and the baser instincts of the general feeling that is abroad about politicians.  If we are not going to base our opposition to these matters on logic and reason and common sense then I think we are going to do a disservice to the cause which we espouse, the cause of bringing some rationality into this situation.  For that reason I could not support in any way this motion because by doing so I am putting some responsibility on the Government and on this House and expressing it as the view of this House that in some way I can pass legislation to remove a statutory pension entitlement which somebody has. Imagine the person going into court and saying, &ldquo;I was a practising barrister or I was an accountant or I was a solicitor or I was working in a trade union in the mid-1970s or the mid-1960s and I was offered a position as a Minister of a Government and one of the conditions on which I was offered that job was that after a certain number of years I would get a pension. So I gave up my job as a trade union official or as a solicitor or as a barrister or as a university lecturer and I fulfilled my duties to the best of my ability as a minister and now 15 or 20 years later a part of the agreement, which as far as I was concerned was a very important part, that I would have financial security in the future has been changed by an Act of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  Such an attempt at legislating <Col N="1258" /> would not survive a constitutional challenge for more than ten minutes.  It is only hypocrisy for us to consider the suggestion seriously.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad among the general public that there are circumstances in which pensions accrue to people who are in ministerial office which are incorrect.  I am in favour of a reform in that area.  I do not see much sense in a person of 27, 28 years or 29 years of age being appointed a Minister of State and after three years acquiring a right to a pension as a result of that period of time.  I have no objection to whatever rights are acquired being delayed for an appropriate period of time.</P>
    <P>However, we should not restrict the matter to that narrow field.  If we are going to look at the matter in that way we would also have to give some serious consideration to those people who are drawing other pensions from the public service area and who acquire membership of either of the two Houses.  In those cases some adjustment of their pension might be appropriate in certain circumstances. For example, if a person was working in the ESB for quite a considerable length of time and acquired pension rights, and if rather late in their life they acquired membership of one or other House of the Oireachtas, in those circumstances an appropriate adjustment to their pension arrangements might also be appropriate in the review which we would undertake as a result of that.</P>
    <P>What is necessary is a much wider review than just merely membership of Houses of the Oireachtas and ministerial pensions.  There is a good point to be made in that no person should be entitled to draw more than one pension from what is ultimately the public purse except in so far as one of those pensions is of a reduced kind that represents an increment of a pension rather than a pension in its own right.  There are certain important things to be done along that line.  I hope the Minister will be able to help us in that regard.  A much wider review of the whole area of pensions is necessary than merely seeking to use a sledge hammer to crack a nut and trying to pretend that <Col N="1259" /> by passing resolutions like this we can abolish the deeds of misdeeds of the last 40 years since these ministerial pensions were first introduced.</P>
    <P>We should express our views in debate but I would ask my fellow Senators not seriously to consider passing this resolution. I regret that we did not on an all-party basis get together and amend the resolution in such a way as would reflect properly the widely held view that, on the one hand, we have to have adequate pensions for those people who are there and, on the other hand, that there are circumstances in which pensions should not accrue at such an early age or queues of pensions should not be payable. Because an amendment, regrettably is not before the House, we have to judge the motion on the pure content of the motion itself.  As I have already pointed out, in my view the motion as drafted fails adequately to deal with the problem of the transitional phase.  The failure to do that is fatal to the motion.  As a result, I could not support it if it is put to a vote here this evening.  I will be forced, because of the high regard I have for my responsibilities as a Member of Seanad Éireann, to vote against the motion, which I consider is trying to impose on the Seanad and on the Government an illegal responsibility, one which could not be done under our present constitutional arrangements.  I ask the House to consider and to express our view with regard to the question of pensions.</P>
    <P>The motion states:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, mindful of the constant exhortations of successive Governments for pay restraint from all sections of the population, calls on the Government to introduce legislation to ensure that neither the President nor any member of the Judiciary nor any member of the Oireachtas, nor any member of the European Parliament, receives a pension by virtue of having held office, either as Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the Dáil, <Col N="1260" /> or as Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad or as a member of the Government or Minister of State.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the fact that that is not limited to future holders of the office but seeks to include in its language the present holders of the office of President and members of the Judiciary, Members of the Oireachtas who have previously held the other posts which are referred to in a second portion of the motion, is a fatal flaw in this motion and I would request and recommend to the House that it would be rejected.</P>

      <P>I overheard a radio programme in which Senator Ross was interviewed.  He said something to the effect that it would get the Fianna Fáil Members to stand up and give their views.  It seemed to me that he was talking in the rural terms of &ldquo;smoking them out&rdquo;. I resented that.  It has never been any problem for me in this House to stand up and give my views.  They may not have been very impressive or convincing and I am not all that enthusiastic about entering into discussion on this motion.  Nevertheless, I have never found any problem about giving my views.  I do not think I have ever been behind in giving my views one way or another.</P>
      <P>In this country we are very good at stone-walling and knocking.  We are very good at criticising.  It is very easy to be critical.  There is no harm, in passing, to refer to another radio programme I heard where Deputy Hugh Coveney referred to this House as &ldquo;a farce&rdquo;.  I thought it was rather an extraordinary statement, a bland statement without any following argument.  It would not be my view of this House.  I resent that as well.  Overall in this area I feel that there is a general approach of shooting from the hips&mdash;Roy Rogers, two guns blazing, bang bang into the target and then riding off into the sunset.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is that <Col N="1261" /> aspect to it.  I do not deny that it is a very serious area, a sensitive area.  Questions are being asked and questions should be answered, not in terms of a very short debate as we have here in this House but by going into the whole matter in depth. That is necessary to do justice to a motion of this kind.</P>
      <P>The Members who tabled this motion are getting on a popular bandwagon.  I am not saying that that was the particular reason for tabling it.  There is this criticism of pensions and there is this criticism of the Seanad.  For my part and the way it will affect me, I feel like the people who fought and died for Ireland in the early part of the century.  Who were the people who fought and died for Ireland? Many of them were labourers and people who were not even regarded as labourers who had nothing to fight for.  The history books tell us they fought and died for their country, the country that the landlords exploited and that the wealthy people exploited.  In defending this I am defending something that will never affect me.  I could say, perhaps not very elegantly, it is no skin off my nose.</P>
      <P>I would like to make reference to one area which Senator Killilea intended to raise.  Of course, time was a problem and he did not get the opportunity.  This is with regard to other public representatives such as county councillors.  All Members of this House know that county councillors, by and large, are full time. They are committed people and for attendance at meetings they get a pittance. It is practically a full time occupation. They do not get any refund for postage or phones, which they should.  I, and I am sure other Members of the House, have been approached to make a case from them.  I am sure every Member would agree with that case to acknowledge the important work that county councillors, urban councillors and all public representatives are doing, in a tangible way by giving them an allowance for phone calls and postage which they do not receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criticism of county councillors is carried on weekly in the media.  This is in particular with regard to councillors who <Col N="1262" /> go abroad to seminars which are referred to as junkets.  I have attended one seminar abroad, some in Ireland, many of them at my own expense.</P>
    <P>The five year development plan is a decision of the elected representatives. To be able to make a meaningful contribution and not to be inlooking, it is only right that public representatives should get the opportunity of going abroad to see what is happening in other countries, so that when they come back they can make a meaningful contribution.  I am quite sure that every Member of the House would agree with me on that point.</P>
    <P>When we talk about public representatives, there are working TDs and working Senators.  I can stand up and say that I try to play my part and that the people who voted for me and put me here need not hold their heads.  I may not be very elegant but I make an honest attempt to do what I am supposed to do and to contribute as I should.</P>
    <P>Some mornings I get up at 6 o'clock to work at whatever contribution I make when this House is sitting.  My contribution may not reflect that.  The question I would ask is, if I have to do that for a rather unimportant role, what has a hardworking TD or a Minister to do?  What time have they to give to their work? What time do they go to bed at?  What time do they get up?  I do not envy their task.  While we may not agree, by and large, with Ministers and Ministers of State, nevertheless, I would have to say that in my experience that they are able people.  While I would criticise them in various ways, I do not take that from them.  We must remember that many Members of this House, and I am sure also of the other House, would be losing business by coming here.  I have lost business, which cannot be made up for. Everybody else who has a business or a profession has lost out in some way. There was a very wise man who lived close to my home when I was a young boy who had many quaint phrases.  One of his phrases was: &ldquo;He who by the plough must live himself must either lead or drive&rdquo;.  It is very important.  People coming to a business place want to see <Col N="1263" /> the boss.  I want to make the case that in that way we lose out.  There are no increments as far as a Deputy or Senator is concerned.  In every other area of public service there are increments.  A new Member coming into this House will get the same remuneration as one who has been a Member for 25 years.</P>
    <P>If we are to carry this motion to its logical conclusion, we could say, why not get rid of the Presidency?  We would save money.  Why not go that far?  I would not go with the motion at all for the reasons I have given.  At present, there is some resentment against working wives.  We could go into that area.  I have never subscribed to that notion.  In the present situation it is very important where people are concerned to pay their mortgage, even though we are in very difficult circumstances regarding employment. Nevertheless, people who have talents should not be denied the opportunity of developing them.</P>
    <P>Pensions were brought in when there was no other method whereby people who had worked for a long time could be remunerated and there were no increments. We want to continue to have able Ministers and able people representing us.  The question should be examined in the area of reform.  I would have no qualms about that.  We must not try to cure cancer by removing a pimple; we must start at the bottom and work through the whole system, consider the type of work people do, the home life, the disruptions, how individuals suffer, how their families suffer, and bearing in mind that this is something which will never be compensated for.  Their children suffer.  Then, of course, there are callers all the time, even when one is sitting down to tea or dinner and they will not understand if one does not respond.  All these things should be taken into consideration. There is the work that a Deputy has to do.  It may be in a five-seat or a four-seat or three-seat constituency. The question is asked, should there be a single-seat constituency.  A case has been made for this.  All this should be examined. This would be important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> I would like to have statistics and to see the situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> the UK, although what is right in the UK or any other country might not be best for us.  I would like to know what tax these people pay, what amount is deducted from their income by way of tax?  It is very important to know that.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Leary rightly said, the people concerned in the motion took up their positions on the promise and the expectation that they would get this pension. They made many sacrifices to do that.  It would be wrong in that case to promise something and then to change the law and take it away.</P>
    <P>I realise there is a concern for equity. I would be totally in favour of that taking the changes that have occurred since 1937 into consideration when the first report on this question was brought forward.  It is important that we have and keep the best brains.  It is essential that we make conditions attractive for these people.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is not any great time to go into it in depth.  A serious motion like this should give us all an opportunity of researching the situation and going into it in depth.  In conclusion, may I give a short quotation from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Wednesday, 25 September 1985:</P>
      <P>The ministerial pension system was introduced in 1938 on the recommendation of the Shanley report.  It noted that Ministers were obliged to cease other employments and that many persons of calibre might &mdash; without this perk &mdash; turn down office on the grounds that it might interfere with their other sources of income.</P>
      <P>Further on it states, in regard to the Devlin report of 1972:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> It agrees with submissions from parliamentarians that under a special convention they must drop other forms of remuneration &ldquo;incompatible with the discharge of ministerial duties&rdquo; on taking office and that this can pretty well scuttle many a lucrative sideline.</P>
    <P>It also makes the point that Ministers hold office literally at the pleasure of the Taoiseach.  In one way I would put a question mark after that and perhaps in other ways I would agree with that.  I would just say that in passing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>They also hold office, as they do their seats, at the pleasure of the electorate, so there is no security of tenure as in some other employments. Then of course, there is the problem of a TD or a Senator not getting elected.  I agree that a question has to be asked. There is a necessity for an in-depth investigation and perhaps a committee to go into this matter to give us an opportunity again in this House to discuss it but where we will not have the constraints of the time limit.</P>

      <P>We have had so far a very interesting and very searching debate on this motion.  It is fair to say that the contributions of the Senators who spoke were of a very high quality.  The fact that the motion has been debated in such an open and objective way will, I think, help to dispel some of the feelings of public doubt and mistrust which may surround the general topic of the remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At certain points, the debate has touched upon various aspects of the terms and conditions applying to Senators. However, I propose to concentrate my remarks primarily on the specific subject of the motion.  A motion of this kind poses an obvious difficulty not just for myself as an office holder but for all Members of the Oireachtas who could be <Col N="1266" /> affected by its terms.  That however is a difficulty which must be faced.</P>
    <P>I think it might help if I were to recall the history leading up to the present situation which the motion in the names of Senators Ross and Ryan is trying to change.  The pension arrangements for holders of ministerial and parliamentary offices are provided for under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, as amended by subsequent legislation. The 1938 legislation was enacted following consideration of the recommendations of a committee of inquiry into ministerial and other salaries, etc., under the chairmanship of Dr. John Shanley.</P>
    <P>The Shanley Committee recommended the introduction of ministerial pensions on the grounds that any person who:</P>
    <P>attains Ministerial rank is obliged to cut himself adrift more or less completely from his former occupation or profession. If his tenure of office becomes protracted it may be extremely difficult for him on retirement to take up the threads of his former business.  The severance from his former means of livelihood will often be irremediable and he will be left with no assurance whatever as to the future, although his high position, unlike that attained in other walks of life, is due to concentration on matters concerned with the public interest and public affairs. Experience has shown that the sacrifices involved in taking office as a Minister have been such that unless some remedy be found many persons who might otherwise have been attracted to a political career and whose services would have been most useful to the nation in that sphere may be deterred from accepting office unless provision is made to ensure that their future position is safe-guarded. Another consideration that arises is the desirability of retaining ex-Ministers in political life, as their knowledge of affairs and experience of administration <Col N="1267" /> must be of great value to the community in the examination and criticism of legislative proposals in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is worthy to note that, while the Shanley Committee recommended that ministerial pensions should be abated where the person concerned was receiving other remuneration or pension, they specifically recommended that a parliamentary allowance as Deputy or Senator should not give rise to abatement.</P>
    <P>On foot of this recommendation the 1938 legislation which followed the committee's report provided for the exclusion of parliamentary allowances from reckoning under the abatement rules.  However, that legislation &mdash; specifically, section 23 of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938 &mdash; provided that ministerial pensions should be abated, on a sliding scale, where the holder received payments other than parliamentary allowances from public funds.</P>
    <P>These abatement provisions were later abolished under the terms of the Pensions Abatement Act, 1965.  That Act was of general application to the public service as a whole, not just to Members of the Oireachtas.  Up to that time a public service pensioner would normally have his pension abated if he or she were re-employed anywhere in the public service and if the total of pension plus the new salary exceeded the amount of the retirement salary suitably up-dated.</P>
    <P>The 1965 Act limited the application of abatement to cases where the pensioner was re-employed in the same service as that from which he or she had retired.  The philosophy behind the Act would appear to have been that pensions should normally be regarded as having been earned by past service and should, therefore, be abated only where the pensioner was re-employed in the service from which he or she had retired.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it will now be found that in, say, the Civil Service, a number of posts are held by retired Army personnel and gardaí and these continue to draw their full pension in addition to their Civil <Col N="1268" /> Service salary.  Members will no doubt be aware from their own experience of similar cases of that type in other parts of the public sector, whether it concerns pensioners from the local authority service, health or educational areas or the various State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>I have recalled these details, first, to show how the situation which the motion seeks to change has arisen and, second, to bring out the fact that the full exclusion of parliamentary allowances from reckoning as regards ministerial pensions has been in operation since the inception of the ministerial pension system 47 years ago.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, on two occasions &mdash; in their 1972 and 1979 reports &mdash; the members of the independent Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector have examined the remuneration of parliamentary office holders and on both occasions have said that they had regard to the superannuation provisions for office holders in making recommendations on their remuneration.</P>
    <P>The foregoing are all factors which should be taken into account in considering the arguments advanced by the proposers of the present motion.  The matter is clearly a complex one.  On the one hand there are the points made by the proposers of the motion.  I do not need to repeat then all here.  They were made with considerable force and need careful consideration.  Particularly important in my opinion &mdash; and also in that of most of the Senators who have contributed to this debate &mdash; is the way in which the public views the pay and conditions of Deputies and Senators since this can have a substantial effect on the esteem in which our democratic institutions are held. Undoubtedly Members of the Oireachtas must, in dealing with a matter of this kind affecting themselves, be conscious of the degree of restraint which the community as a whole is being asked to exercise at present.  But in this regard it is fair to remember that, on quite a number of occasions in the not so distant past, parliamentarians found themselves lagging seriously behind in national wage rounds <Col N="1269" /> and then having to face criticism when they were eventually brought in line.</P>
    <P>However, the position now is that since the enactment of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary and Judicial Offices (Amendment) Act, 1983 the pay of parliamentarians has been directly linked to the pay of civil servants.  The arrangement now is that any general pay round applied to Civil Service salaries is automatically applied also to the remuneration of parliamentarians and members of the Judiciary.  In these circumstances, as has been pointed out in the debate, appeals by Government for restraint have direct implications for the pay of parliamentarians.  This fact appears to have been ignored by Senator Ross in his opening speech.</P>
    <P>I would like at this point to refer briefly to the dual mandate, which was particularly mentioned by Senators Ross and Dooge.  As Senators are aware, this matter is before the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  The wording of the resolutions of both the Dáil and Seanad asked the joint committee to examine the question of dual membership and to consider the relations between Irish representatives in the European Assembly and Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>When all the arguments in favour of the motion have been made, there are, as will be evident from the debate, many factors which have to be taken into account on the other side.  The Oireachtas must, if it is to retain a healthy democratic character, be able to attract people of high quality and ability from all walks of life.  It should not become the preserve of the rich &mdash; as Senator Dooge said, we do not want to go back to the days when party leaders were chosen on the basis of their private means. Those thinking of entering public life have to consider the damage that may be done to their business or profession if they have to cut themselves off from it to a large extent for a period of years.  They have to take into account the uncertainties <Col N="1270" /> of political life and the lack of assurances about the future.  The difficulty of picking up again the threads of a career or business after a long absence is something they must weigh carefully.  These and similar points were made and developed in some detail by Senators Dooge, Killilea, Ferris and Eoin Ryan.  Certain legal aspects were argued by Senator O'Leary and these of course also need to be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>Given such conflicting factors it is essential, in the Government's view, that the subject of the motion be dealt with on as objective a basis as possible.  The issues involved are of direct concern to all Members of the Oireachtas.  In fairness to them and to the public it is desirable that there should be an independent and objective examination of the matter before a final decision is taken.  As far as possible we should try to avoid being judge and jury in our own case.</P>
    <P>In this connection Senators may be aware that in the course of the recent public service pay negotiations the staff side raised the question of making a further general reference to the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.</P>
    <P>The review body has functioned for many years as a standing body whose purpose has been to advise the Government on the general level of remuneration of the Judiciary, higher civil servants, higher local authority and health body officers, chief executives of State-sponsored bodies and other high-level staff, as well as on the remuneration of office holders and the allowances of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It has always consisted of persons of the highest standing in the community who would be generally accepted as having no commitments in respect of, or significant affiliations with, any of the groups coming within its remit.  It has usually comprised a member drawn from private business, an accountant and a private individual such as a professional person or a farmer, together with two nominees of the Labour Court who facilitate <Col N="1271" /> consistency with pay developments generally.</P>
    <P>Members of the group, apart from the Labour Court nominees, have included such well-known individuals as Dr. Liam St. J. Devlin, Mr. Joseph Charleton, accountant; the late Mr. Jimmy O'Keeffe, then president of the ICMSA; and Mr. Frank Hardy, former president of the Federated Union of Employers. Their wide remit, extending across the public service, their broad experience and the carefully researched nature of their reports have given their recommendations particular authority and weight.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the review body made special studies in 1972 and 1979 of the position of office holders and Oireachtas Members.  These studies covered the historical and the then current arrangements applying to such aspects as the payment of income tax and surtax on salaries and allowances, the travelling and subsistence facilities allowed, the overnight allowances and other benefits, and the superannuation arrangements applicable.  Thus, a great body of factual information is available in this area on which previous assessments were based and which can readily be brought up-to-date for the purpose of a further review.</P>
    <P>In response to the question from the staff side to which I referred a moment ago, an undertaking in regard to a general reference to the review body was included in the pay proposals at present being considered by public service groups.  Such a reference would, in accordance with practice, cover parliamentarians as well as higher public servants generally.  The reference would facilitate consideration of a number of aspects of parliamentarians' pay and pensions which have been mentioned during this debate.</P>
    <P>The Government intend that when such general reference is being made, the review body will be asked specifically to consider the whole question of parliamentary office holders' pensions.  The Government consider that this is the fairest and most positive way in which to <Col N="1272" /> balance the interests of the Oireachtas as a whole, individual Members and the general public and taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The approach I have outlined is one which I suggest is reasonable and sensible.  It will allow the issue to be discussed in a totally dispassionate manner free from hysteria and emotion. It will enable the facts to be fully established and the fiction to be discarded.  It will result in recommendations made in a completely independent and objective fashion.</P>
    <P>This is, I believe, the best way to deal with this complex and sensitive issue.  In these circumstances, I suggest that the motion before the House as presently framed should not be supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to facilitate you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, in order to allow as many people as possible to contribute. It is important that we have as broad a cross-section of views expressed on this issue as possible.  Unlike some previous speakers, I welcome the motion in that it does afford the various Members of the House the opportunity to discuss an issue which undoubtedly is relevant to public discussion.  Whether we like it or not, the whole area of remuneration, of salaries and pensions for Members of these Houses is something that has captured the public's imagination and is a matter of public debate.  It impinges both on the regard that the public have for each of us as parliamentarians and ultimately the democratic institutions of the State.  I welcome the opportunity, too, because it affords me the opportunity to re-echo the sentiments of the leader of the Labour group in the Seanad, Senator Ferris, who last week put the Labour Party perspective clearly on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion has not emerged at the whim of an individual; it has been an ongoing discussion.  From the Labour Party perspective, at our annual conference in May 1985 we had a very long <Col N="1273" /> debate on this matter.  Strong views were expressed and a resolution was carried that would in large measure agree with the sentiments encompassed in the motion before the House tonight.  Acting on that resolution the Parliamentary Labour Party in the intervening period have discussed it.  Representatives of the Parliamentary Party on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have brought before it the views of the Labour Party and the need, as we saw it, for change in this regard.  Unfortunately, the Labour Party's efforts in this regard did not receive broad support and came to nought.</P>
    <P>It is therefore relevant to examine exactly what procedure can next be taken to advance what is obviously a serious anomaly and to establish a mechanism to allay public disquiet, which is real and genuine.  I would like to state that the Labour Party intend to formulate a Bill to do that, and to address, as the Minister has stated, not only the narrow confines of the categories of people mentioned in the motion before the House tonight but the broad spectrum of public servants and the many anomalies that exist in relation to them including, but not exclusively dealing with, Members of these Houses who receive pensions while maintaining employment in the public service.  The preparation and ground work for that comprehensive legislation within the Labour Party is under way.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary, in his contribution earlier, talked of the shallowness of knowledge of the movers of the resolution. I acknowledge, as the Labour Party do, that the implications of change in this area are very broad and there will obviously be constitutional difficulties which will have to be addressed.  People have contractual undertakings which will have to be looked at and preserved, so it is not going to be easy to legislate for the provisions and the sentiments encompassed in the resolution.  That should not deter us from speaking about it.  The Labour Party Bill will be a long time in formulation.  Let us not pretend it is an easy issue.  It will be many months before we can have a satisfactory piece of legislation <Col N="1274" /> that will address this problem.</P>
    <P>The movers of the motion talked of the different categories of Members.  I found that of certain interest.  As Members we all receive the same salary.  Senator Killilea last week referred to that.  He, who has served for 17 years, and I, serving for the first time, receive the same salary. There is no increment.  That is something that should be addressed.  There is a broad spectrum of issues that are at stake. The remuneration for a full time Senator with no other income whatsoever, like myself, is not something that we could exactly write home about.  There is a valid case for looking at parliamentary incomes on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people have a considerable external supplement which obviously puts them into a certain privileged category.  The movers of the motion also referred to the average industrial wage and I, for one, would be very happy if that was the criterion used to estimate the remuneration for serving Members. If we were given the average industrial wage for a 40 hour week and the hours we work above that calculated at overtime rates&mdash;normal time and a half or double time for Sundays and holidays&mdash;most Members in this House who take their duty seriously would have a very reasonable return for their efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are fundamental principles involved in this issue.  They impinge on things like public perception: public perception of each of us, public perception of these Houses, public perception of the way the Government do business.  We must not be seen to use that phrase, as was used last week, &ldquo;to feather our own nests&rdquo;.  We must not use the Minister's phrase &ldquo;to be judge and jury in our own cases&rdquo; where we set our own salary levels and award ourselves privileges that are not awarded to the general citizenry. There is also a fundamental point of leadership. It is a fair point to say that people do expect example from these Houses. God knows, much has been said about the difficult times that are in it and the <Col N="1275" /> need for restraint and moderation and all these words that are barbed in terms of pay negotiations.  We have a responsibility to answer the call of public disquiet and to address ourselves to the obvious disquiet that exists whether we like it or not.</P>
    <P>In my view, despite what many Senators and the Minister, quoting from the original legislation, have stated it is a unique and distinct privilege to serve as a Minister.  I honestly do not believe that giving up opportunities or surrendering future opportunities to earn money will prevent people of calibre from taking up office.  The remuneration for office holders is fair and reasonable.  There is a anomaly where there is a pension paid to somebody after three years service while still in full time employment in the public sector in these Houses.  There is an obvious anomaly there that should, in my view, be addressed.  I have not heard a reasonable answer to that public disquiet voiced around the country.  The people who make it to high office either as a Minister of State, as a Cabinet Minister, as Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad or as Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil or as Uachtarán na hÉireann are not motivated by gain because their calibre is of such merit that they would make it in any field of endeavour.  The people who obviously have put self-interest aside to serve the public should not have the whole status of their position impugned by unnecessary anomalies that exist within the pension system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the review and the Minister's comments in that regard.  I welcome the fact that there is a discussion in this House tonight on the whole area of remuneration for serving and former Members of these Houses.  I confidently expect that the legislation the Labour Party are currently putting together, which will be carefully researched and analysed with the constitutional provisions, will in the end result in fairness to all concerned and ally the public disquiet that is real and genuine and which we have an obligation to address.</P>

      <P>I intend to speak very briefly on this motion because many other Senators have dealt fairly fully with the issue which are raised.  I understand that there are a number of Senators who wish to speak in the debate before my colleague Senator Ross replies.  It is very interesting, in view of the remarks that have been made in the last week to the effect that this House is a farce and should be abolished, that this motion has sparked off such a wide-ranging, understanding and sensible debate on this subject which has not been run along party lines or in a party political fashion. One of the duties which the Independent Members of this House have, is to put before the House motions of this type which can be dealt with in this way.  I have been struck by the quality of the contributions which have been made by both sides of the House and how they have looked at the whole area of remuneration for public service through the parliament rather than simply the one issue of people drawing pensions while serving in other capacities.  Those who are trying to abolish this House are moving too fast and should look at what has been said in this debate on an issue which does seem to cause considerable public disquiet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I talk about public disquiet I do feel, with Senator Fitzsimons, that sometimes there can be too much public disquiet about a thing like this.  In some ways we can be a terrible nation of begrudgers rather than going out and working, in doing and achieving something for ourselves.  It is great fun to sit back and say &ldquo;there is X, Y or Z.  Look at him, he is a member of the European Parliament.  He is getting a pension&rdquo;. There may be anomalies and there may be wrong things about this situation but it is not such an enormous issue that people should create a great amount of public disquiet about it as opposed to trying to do something positive about our economic situation and so on.  However, it is an area that needs to be looked at and I welcome the Minister's attitude in that, rather than rejecting the motion which has been put forward, he shows <Col N="1277" /> sufficient openness to refer the matter to the review group and see what can be done to iron out the anomalies which exist at present.  This motion exists in the background of the whole question about how one finances parliament, how one attracts people of the highest calibre both to be Members of the Houses and Ministers in the Government.  While, as Senator Howlin has said, people do not necessarily seek to become Government Ministers for gain &mdash; indeed if people were looking solely for gain, politics is not the career they would follow nevertheless, even though they are not primarily seeking financial gain, that is no reason for saying that people who enter political life should be financially punished for doing and for saying that they should expect to live on a pittance.  We must look at parliamentary salaries, pensions and so on in this light; and, if we want to attract people of reasonably high calibre and the best sort of people in the country to be Members of either Houses or Ministers in the Government, we must be prepared to finance this.  While we want to iron out certain anomalies that exist at the moment, we should not lose sight of the importance of proper remuneration for parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to give a certain amount of financial security to someone who takes on a full-time commitment such as being a Government Minister and gives up another career.  Such a full-time commitment is a very insecure position, where one may lose that position at any moment.  It is interesting that in other countries in Europe, when parliamentarians lose their seats or lose office, there is something which one might describe as the equivalent of the redundancy money which is paid to persons who lose their jobs in other fields of life.  If one loses one's seat and cannot immediately return to a reasonable remunerative profession there should be some kind of interim payment that would enable one to settle back into private life.  That, too, is something the review group could look at. It can be a very difficult situation for someone who is totally dependent on a parliamentary salary and loses it overnight <Col N="1278" /> to get back into ordinary private earning.</P>
    <P>The motion highlights a situation which has caused public disquiet.  I do not think it is quite so simple as just getting rid of this pension situation.  There are a number of other issues in regard to remuneration for this form of public service which needs to be looked at.  Therefore, while I support Senator Ross's right to bring this motion before the House and I am grateful for the fact that it has sparked so much debate, I would also welcome the idea that the whole situation be reviewed, as suggested by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister I felt that he had come to the kernel of the matter in two of his paragraphs.  The first was the one in which he emphasised the way in which the public perceive pay and pensions for Deputies and Senators.  He went on to say:</P>
      <P>This can have a substantial effect on the esteem in which our democratic institutions are held.</P>
      <P>This is undoubtedly so and was never more so than at this time.  Further on, the Minister mentions the review body, which he states will specifically consider the whole question of parliamentary office holders' pensions.  If we wait as long as we have waited for marriage reform to come to some conclusion through these Houses and the committees which have been set up to study it, we will wait a very long time before anyone's pension is altered here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go any further I would agree with Senators who have said that there are many anomalies that need to be looked at and that the whole area needs to be studied in depth in relation to what is going on in the country and in relation to what is right for Deputies and Senators. Straightaway, I would say that I think it is utterly wrong that a nominated Senator such as myself, without constituency duties, should even be considered as appropriate for a pension.  I understand that, were I in this House for long enough, I would be eligible for a pension. I cannot speak for Senator Rogers, but I <Col N="1279" /> certainly can say I believe, with the state of this country at this time, that is wrong. There is one example of something that needs to be looked at and studied by this committee.  If I were to feel that the review body is not to sit and study this very quickly and to come up with some very quick answers, then I would vote for this motion in order to stimulate more public concern and debate about it.  But I am not convinced that the motion is correctly worded for what I would like to see take place and I have yet to feel insufficient confidence in what the Minister has said to believe that there will not be adequate review.</P>
    <P>There was some debate on the last day we discussed this between people who entered politics for idealistic reasons and those who entered to do the hard day-to-day slog.  We heard points being made in favour of each.  Let me say here and now that in this island there is a political party that has refused any remuneration for carrying on service to its constituencies, because on principle it refused to go into an assembly with which it did not agree. Of course, I speak of the SDLP.  Do not let us forget that politicians, particularly in times of crises, if they are going to give leadership, if they are going to stand for principle, must also be prepared to make sacrifice.  Not all of us are as willing as the SDLP to make that type of sacrifice. It is something that needs to be mentioned and I do not think it has been mentioned in this debate before.</P>
    <P>Let us now very briefly look at the problem of the Senator and the Deputy. Points have been made about the enormous amount of constituency work which they have to do, the early hours at which they get up, the hard nights of slog, the clinics that are held.  Certainly, that is so. I have been most impressed since coming here by how much pressure is put on a Senator and a Deputy in his local constituency for survival.  The question I would ask is: how much of this work is actually relevant to the needs of the people at this time where they live?  There are county councillors and there are local councillors.  I wonder if we need to have <Col N="1280" /> in every constituency local councillors, county councillors, TDs from various parties, and even competition within the parties, and, on top of that, Senators whizzing around seeking to give service in the clientalistic way in which it is given in the hope of re-election the next time around.  Before we get too worked up about the amount of work that is undoubtedly done, let us, in that context, again express concern for the pressures put on the TD and Senator and his family, the psychological pressures he has to cope with, the economic pressures, particularly if he fails to be re-elected.  Let us ask the question: have we structured our political system to give the best service in relation to the talents available and the numbers of people involved, to bring about a better society?</P>
    <P>Some of us are in a much better position than others.  I am a fulltime consultant surgeon.  I do not do private practice and therefore I can challenge Senator Shane Ross to a means test. You only have to write to the Northern Area Board to find out what my salary is, you can add to it what I get from the Seanad and you can subtract whatever I have to pay for locums and days of holiday for any excursions to Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There are too many figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Too many figures.  Well, you are quite at liberty to find out.  I feel that there has been too much secrecy about salaries in this country.  If we are talking about giving examples, then the people, particularly those who would mount a motion such as this, should have their total situation exposed to public gaze.  Having said that, I would then make a suggestion to the Minister.  Our salaries are so worked out that you get one-eightieth of the average of the last three years, earnings for each year served.  Why not make it one-eightieth of the best three years' earnings for the number of years served and give the pension on that basis so that it would be fair and would not result in a situation where a young, talented man of 30 years comes <Col N="1281" /> in and serves three to five years as Minister and then he can rest on his laurels and get a pension until he has reached his three score and ten, whereas a hardworking, old cart-horse at the age of 62 years gets a ministerial office for his last three years.  Do you say his service is only worth a pension for the rest of his life compared with a man who has rested on his laurels since he was aged 30 years and reaped the rewards of early service?</P>
      <P>It is similar to a situation in general practice in the United Kingdom where the GP can retire and spend one day out of business and go back into the same practice as a locum and earn his salary plus his pension.  He is better off rather than worse off than he was before.  It is an outrage in my profession.  It is similar to the situation which existed until recently in the medical profession in the United Kingdom where there were secret merit awards given out to consultant A, B or C.  The whole thing was shrouded in secrecy and everyone who got one was sworn to secrecy.  It is not dissimilar to the situation that I have seen in which a prominent member of my profession charges £100 for attending at a High Court action, will probably charge at least £50 for the report and yet will refuse to stand on the picket line at the hospital gate when the domestic staff are looking for a small increase in their weekly wage packets.  There is a fantastic amount of hypocrisy in relation to pensions and salaries. This is why I would welcome an indepth inquiry not only into this, but into the whole area of payments.  When I travelled by train, I received £20; when I travelled by plane, I received £50.  When because of emergencies in the hospital &mdash; a man almost died last summer &mdash; I began to travel by car and I received £150.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  I am totally against the motion.  First of all it is not properly worded.  The independent Senators who submitted the motion are the best qualified to do so as most of them will never qualify for a pension.  Their tenure in the Seanad is short lived.  Since I came to Seanad Éireann I have never seen any of the independent Senators qualifying for any pension.</P>
      <P>There is no public disquiet in relation to pensions: the only public disquiet there is is coming from the media.  This is a contributory pension scheme, to which Members have contributed.  Members of the House will not qualify for the contributory pension scheme unless they have been here as a Senator or a TD for eight years.  This is the reason why I refer to the independent Senators.  The pension will not be index-linked until the Member has spent 12 years in the House. In order to qualify for a maximum pension, a Member has to be here about 26 years.  In political life there is constant uncertainty in being a Senator, a TD or a Minister.  For this reason a politician may be out of a job whenever the Dáil is dissolved.  This has happened many prominent and able men that had devoted their time down through the years to giving a democratic service to the public. County councillors give a full service in local government for no pay or pension at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment on Senator Killilea's contribution this morning on <Col N="1283" /> the Order of Business.  A Senator is not entitled to send a telegram from this House no matter what urgency it may demand; neither is he entitled to make a telephone call.  Recently Senators received telephone bills.  A Member coming into the House for the first day gets the same salary as a Member that has served here for 20 or 25 years.  There is no increments for service.  Surely seniority, experience and service should be the criteria for salary?  This is the case in the public and private sectors.  There is an imbalance.  I would welcome a review of this whole area.  I would welcome the Devlin Review Body to look into the anomalies in both Houses of the Oireachtas regarding salaries and pensions. We are not in line with the rest of the public sector and State agencies.  This is not the proper way to do this.</P>
    <P>Over the last two or three years public representatives have been harassed by the press in relation to pay.  One would imagine that we were not giving a service to the people.  The degrading headlines in the press are tantamount to doing away with the Seanad and bringing down the standards of public representatives. There are Members in this House and in the Lower House that would be better off if they had never seen the gates of Leinster House in any field of activity that they would pursue.  Public representatives give a 12-hour day, seven-day week service to the people.</P>
    <P>I could speak at length on this subject, but in fairness to Senator Ross I will not take up any more of his time.  I will be voting against this motion if there is a vote.  I make no apologies for doing so. This motion should not have come before the House.  I hope the press publish some of the facts that have come out in this debate and the public will realise that there are two sides to this question.  I think that the debates in this House are of a very high level but we get very little media coverage for the amount of work we put into the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that I gave up some time to listen to Senator O'Toole's <Col N="1284" /> speech because I welcome the stance which has been taken on this side of the House in this debate.  I welcome it more than I welcome the stance which has been taken by the Fine Gael Party.  Senator Killilea last week and Senator O'Toole today have stood up and said quite straightforwardly that they oppose this motion.  They have every right to oppose this motion and they have every right to make that case.  I admire them for saying so and for saying so in public.  There is a case to be made against it.  I do not believe it, but there is a case to be made.  There is also a case to be made for the fact that politicians are held in low esteem by the public for all the wrong reasons and it is our own fault and this motion contributes to that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Fianna Fáil attitude in that they are prepared to stand up and say that.  I do not welcome the attitude which has been taken by some members of the Government towards this motion. I resent it enormously.  Senator O'Leary made a very peculiar speech indeed in which he said that the wording was wrong.  There were two things wrong with it.  One was the wording.  What was wrong with the wording was that it was retrospective. Well, it is open to Senator O'Leary and his party at any time to amend the wording of this motion.  They did not bother to do it and the reason, I suggest, is that they could not carry the party with them on this issue.  It could have been amended at any stage and I do not know why it was not but I am extremely cynical about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary criticised this motion also because he said those who were putting it forward were doing so for a cheap headline.  I make no apology whatsoever to anybody in this House for tackling an issue which is of public interest and of public concern.  I do it because nobody else and no party in this House ever tackles these issues because they are too sensitive for them.  When I raised the issue of extradition in this House I was told I was headline-seeking.  Nobody else would touch it.  When I raised the issue of divorce in this House twice or three times, I was told I was headline-seeking. <Col N="1285" /> Certainly, I welcome the publicity that I get from this and from divorce and from other sensitive issues.  The reason why the Government do not like it is that it makes them feel uncomfortable.  They have to take a stand on an issue they would rather bury.  I am sorry to have to say, though I liked the tenour and the moderation of the Minister's speech, that I do not accept what he says about referring this to a review body.</P>
    <P>I am tired of issues like this being referred to all-party committees or review bodies.  This Government, whether we like it or not, was elected to govern and this Government was elected to take a stance on issues like this and not to avoid them.  I am sorry to hear that this is going to a review body.  I am sorry that the Government cannot take a stand in principle on this.  We do not know when the review body is going to report. We do not know if the review body is going to take a stance in principle on it.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Government could not have put down their own amendment because everybody in this debate has said that there is a need for it.  Everybody has in some sense welcomed it.  Everybody has acknowledged that there is a need for a review of the whole spectrum of Oireachtas salaries, Ministers' salaries and Ministers' pensions. Everybody on the Government side has admitted this.  Many said that it should have been wider.  It was open to the Government to put down an amendment to broaden the debate.  The debate was specific because it is about a specific principle.  It appears that we are going to be asked to refer this to a review body.  I do not accept this and the principle is this: whether those in political life should be paid pensions when they are still drawing money from the State and while they are still in political life; in other words whether they should be getting pensions while they are still being paid by the State for being active in politics.  It is as simple as that.  That is what the public disquiet is about.  The public disquiet is about what they see&mdash;politicians paying themselves <Col N="1286" /> twice&mdash;politicians getting preferential treatment over other people and politicians being utterly hypocritical by asking people to pull in their belts, to accept wage restraints and yet, at the same time, allowing politicians to be privileged because they have some God-given right to do this.</P>
    <P>I do not accept this review either, because it should have happened a long time ago.  Independent Senators are continually raising issues like this which, towards the end of this Government's life, is being referred to a review body.  I welcome the Labour Party's decision to introduce a Bill to this effect.  But I think it is a bit late in the day for them as well. The Labour Party have been in Government for four years.  They could have put down this Bill on day one.  They could have had it ready for Government, but they did not.</P>

      <P>To return to the Bill, I would like to compliment the Minister on his few words before we discussed the Bill on the question of options, and the question of particular areas as regards a free zone.  I am glad that he is at least recognising that within the Ringaskiddy, or for that matter the ports area of Cork, there is an opportunity to create a sub-area <Col N="1290" /> for a free zone.  In other words, we should not be seen to be saying that just because we are recognising there may be a 30 acre site considered in the Ringaskiddy area, we should not consider an option of having a sub-area as a free zone within another area of the harbour.  We have an upper harbour in Cork, that is the Tivoli area.  We should consider the authority who are involved and the recommendations that were put before us by the Task Force Report who are asking that we should consider the idea of a sub-area within the Tivoli area.  I do not think the Minister is being negative. He is being very helpful as regards this idea.  We can create a compound area which can be sealed off and recognised as a free zone sub-area of the upper area, that would give the option of the free zone facility to people who are already using the port.</P>
      <P>Section 12 enables the Minister to make regulations providing for the necessary customs, controls and procedures to apply to a free port.  We had this before the break and I emphasised quite strongly that I do not think we are being free enough.  Like other Senators who have already spoken I do not like the idea of getting so many people in so many Departments involved.  The Minister agreed with the point that we do not want to take business that is already there from other ports.  What we are trying to do is to create new business.  In the procedures that are coming before us within the Bill, I do not think we are going to do that, unless we recognise that we must be seen to be more broadminded in our attitude to the Bill.  I would ask the Departments and the Minister involved to note the amount of tonnage that is passing Ireland on its way to Europe from the United States or Japan.  How do we create the opportunities to take some of that tonnage? As I mentioned before the break, even if we were to take 5 per cent of the tonnage from Rotterdam, 2 per cent from Hamburg and a certain percentage from other ports, the opportunities to the Ringaskiddy free zone would be enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations are not before us.  The <Col N="1291" /> Bill only explains in detail what a free port means but at the same time the regulations must be very far reaching. They have to give opportunities to the people and the authority involved.  The Minister spoke about the particular authority which I would be hoping would form the Cork Harbour Board.  I know the Minister requested that if we had anybody in particular in mind, to mention them.  I do not want to be seen to be pushing for one particular group or the other but there are people who are a long time involved in bondage clearance in the Cork area who, I hope, would be given the opportunity.  I understand they have already made submissions to relevant Departments about getting involved.  We have been speaking to these people on and off about the free port.  They recognise the potential and the opportunities that are there for the Cork area and the country generally.</P>
    <P>Over £100 million has been spent on the infrastructure.  Not all the money came from Irish pockets.  We got moneys from the EC because of the capital investment. From the other side of the city into the Ringaskiddy area we have water flowing at the rate of about 20 million gallons a day.  We invested about £74 million in the Ringaskiddy area to provide the water for the facilities in that area.  There is the idea of a tunnel being considered to come from one side of the water to the other.  Perhaps we should have the tunnel or something else to carry us from one side of the water to the other. I am not saying that we should have done this but we should have done something. We invested so much and now come up with a Bill which does not reflect the total investment that has already gone into the Ringaskiddy or the Cork ports area.  Cork has lost 10,000 to 12,000 jobs indirectly because of cuts in services being made in our dockyards, Fords, Dunlop and Irish Steel.  We should not be giving the impression that the Bill is not going to create many jobs when, in actual fact, free port zones in other countries have created enormous potential.  I have already mentioned Hamburg.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> Suppose we get oil off our coasts and it is due to be brought in, the facilities that will be needed on the eastern side of this island to service these rigs can create a situation like that in Hamburg where there is one factory&mdash;Swarfega&mdash;a hand cleaning unit supplying the whole world from a free zone from a raw material of oil.  I do not envisage anything as big as the plant in Hamburg.  It is a quarter of a mile long and 300 yards wide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The raw material which Swarfega is made from comes from an oil product.  This is all I am interested in.  If we have a situation off our coast which can provide more employment to the people of the country, I am all in favour of it.  I am not saying that everything will happen in the Ringaskiddy area.  We should give the initiative but the Bill is not doing this.  The Bill is too narrow and negative and involves more than one Department.  There is no reason why one Minister cannot have total control.  The Minister involved has indicated by his brief, the opportunities that are there and those that can be created for other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some sections which will need amendment.  This is the first Free Port Bill that we are putting before the country.  It is a golden opportunity for us as a people to say that we are prepared to broaden.  We are not prepared to say that we must get everything coming into the country.  If the Bill is going to provide <Col N="1293" /> something for us and give us more jobs, we are prepared to say &ldquo;go ahead&rdquo;.  I am not saying that we should give a totally free hand.  This will not happen.  We will have control.  At the same time, let us not stifle an opportunity that we had not seen before.</P>
    <P>I come to the initiatives that have been created in other countries, for instance, the question of exports from the mainland. If we have people setting up business or some type of industry within the free zone and getting the raw material from Ireland they should get the same benefits as we give to those who are exporting to other countries.  The person who purchases the raw material should purchase at the export rate because a situation is being created that has not been there before.  For instance, timber is going out of the country.  We are selling food to other countries but I see no reason why we cannot set up a food processing industry in the free zone and give every benefit possible to the person who wants to process it.</P>
    <P>Income tax exemption is mentioned here.  Areas in other countries are giving that exemption.  The people who are employed in the free zones should get income tax exemption.  It does not mean that they will get more wages.  It means that they do not pay tax in this country. The one thing that it does is to bring these people into work and we do not have to pay social welfare or dole.  At the moment, we are spending £7 million a day on social welfare.</P>
    <P>There are a few points I welcome in the Bill.  The harbour board in Cork have brought about swift rationalisation in the docks.  They have brought about a situation in which the tonnage in Cork has increased enormously over the last three or four years.  I would like to congratulate them on it.  At the same time, they have brought about a situation in which fewer people are working.  I have to readily admit that in present circumstances we have to recognise that there is a question of rationalisation in the technology involved in loading and unloading.  At the same time Cork is ready for the opportunity <Col N="1294" /> to avail of the Free Port Bill.</P>
    <P>The people of Cork put much work into the Task Force Report and the recognition of the free zone.  They should now get the opportunity of saying: &ldquo;this is what we want to do about it&rdquo;.  Under the Bill could the local authority schemes be implemented?  I see no reason why the Minister could not enable the local harbour board and other people in the private sector to work together.  We could have a broadminded attitude and have a local board running the free zone.  There could be a ministerial representative on it.  I am always in favour of that.  I see no reason why they, like other semi-State bodies cannot conduct their own business. Why should they, at every hand's turn, be coming back to the Minister for a decision?  If there is an area in Cork, the Minister will have his &ldquo;hawks&rdquo; representing him at local level.</P>
    <P>What will a free port cost?  The infrastructure is already provided.  The amount of money that is being spent in that area means that it is going to cost much more to implement the full scheme, once the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>The most important part of the scheme is to sell the notion of a free port.  We will not sell it with a Bill like this before us because it is too stringent.  Straightaway if you go to market that, and bring people to a zoned area, such as Ringaskiddy, to see the conditions obtaining there, they will not be interested, not in comparison with other countries.  Other countries give exemption of profits from income tax and corporation taxes.  Are we prepared to consider that?  The free zones origin profits of these entities, operating within the free zone are not subject to either income or corporation taxes and duties, nor will their accounts within the free zone be merged for tax or any other purposes with their accounts within the country.</P>
    <P>There may be people who want to come in here and say, &ldquo;We do not want any questions&rdquo;.  I am certainly not totally right wing but I do see prevailing in our country now the urgency of providing jobs, the urgency of giving the impression to the people that we are prepared to <Col N="1295" /> broaden out to provide work.  That is my top priority.  Nothing else counts for me. I could not care less if I never get a penny from the people within the zoned area as long as I get people working and being paid a fair wage.  We had an opportunity of achieving that.  I really would like to give that opportunity and I do not see it within the Bill.  We had not decided what VAT to charge, if there is any VAT charge.  The Minister is not saying there will be a VAT charge, but he is not saying that there will not.  For the Department of Finance to say there will be discussions between the Departments of Communications, Industry and Finance to set up a zone in the low harbour in Cork, or for that matter, in any other area, whether it be an airport or the other side of the country, is just not good enough in my view.  We must be more broadminded and say we have to create the opportunities. I have mentioned the question of tonnage that is passing Ireland to go to other countries.  For the first time ever we can take heavy tonnage ships that we were not able to take before.  We have not really recognised the amount of tonnage that has gone to other European ports. Let me just give one example again.  For the first time ever, next July or August there will be in the low harbour in Cork an opportunity for ships to the amount of nearly 70,000 tonnes to come into the low harbour to unload.  Has the House any idea of the amount of work that is involved in that or of the opportunities provided by the free zone?  We have to be seen to be selling.</P>
    <P>There is no way that I will allow a Bill to go through this House, to be passed and then to be put on a shelf or given to some authority to do what they like at a nice easy pace for the next ten years.  It is not on.  There are opportunities and I will be pushing the people involved in the harbour board and other people involved in the marketing board of the local region in the Cork area to make sure that we market this right.  This is an opportunity of opportunities.  We are not to let it go.</P>
    <P>For instance, consider the number of <Col N="1296" /> cars that come from Japan into our ports. There are ships coming in with about 600 or 700 cars at a time.  Could we envisage ships coming in with 5,000 cars?  Could we envisage ships coming in to re-export to other countries, to Britain, if we are good enough?  If we are good enough as a people, we should be able to say we are quite prepared to store and we are quite prepared to trans-ship to other countries in Europe.  Then the heavy tonnage ships that are coming into the low harbour with plenty of depth and with up to 70,000 tonnes, could turn around at a very fast pace.  A 70,000 ton ship going into Rotterdam is delayed for probably two weeks or longer, passing the first island, Ireland, to get to Europe.  She can pull into Ireland. She can unload and she can get back again.  We can trans-ship with smaller ships from our island.  We should be making no apologies to anybody for that because it is work.  That is the main point.  We should provide the facility and we are doing that.  We have put over £110 million into this dock and it is now suggested that it will be a bird sanctuary. I will not allow it to be created into a bird sanctuary.  The opportunities available, if the Bill is broadened, are golden but the marketing of it is important.  Unfortunately, if you were looking for a local pass for a person aged over 65 years of age, Central Government has to hear about it.  Slowly but surely all that should be changed.  We are changing but not fast enough.</P>
    <P>The proposed VAT reliefs are not provided for in the Bill.  They will be the subject of separate regulations to be made by the Revenue Commissioners under the VAT Act.  This is just an example. It is referred to in the Minister's statement.  If we have not made up our minds as a Government and as a country to say that we have a free port facility, then we might as well forget it.  I envisaged when I pushed this first, giving every opportunity possible to people coming into this zoned area to do what they like, when they like, as long as they are providing work, as long as they provide facilities that we did not have before.  I do not want it to be seen as taking from other <Col N="1297" /> ports.  There are opportunities.  I cannot sufficiently emphasise the importance of broadmindedness.  The Bill does not show that and I am annoyed.  I am surprised that in the Lower House that was not emphasised.  I am surprised that in the Lower House there were no amendments. This House is debating the Bill more fully and is much more cautious in regard to it because it provides an opportunity that was not available previously.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about the Community Market.  I read in the Community Market:</P>
    <P>In the case of customs duty the Bill provides that non-European Community goods imported into a free port will only become liable to customs duty if and when they are subsequently placed on the Community market &mdash; the effects of Section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill tells us that we must build regulations into the Bill because they are the regulations of the EC generally.  That is all very fine in theory.  Might I say in passing that Britain has created six free ports and there was certainly no mention of free ports in Britain before 1983.  There could be clarification of that but I am almost certain that they were not thinking of the question of a free port before 1983. They did have free ports set up in early 1985.  This free port was recommended as early as 1983 and it is now 1986, three years later.  That is typical of the way we work in this country.  We do not avail of opportunity or advantage.  We are slow and naive.  We do not work fast enough and Britain has now created, mainly on the west coast, free port facilities.  There is one in Liverpool which I understand is doing quite well, and there is one in Belfast.  The reason for that as anybody with commonsense will realise is that they see the opportunity of heavy tonnage coming from the west and going through the Irish Sea to get into Europe.  That is what I am talking about.  They see the advantages of it and they are trying to create the opportunity to avail of it, but we are before them, we are given a golden opportunity and we should make <Col N="1298" /> no apologies to the EC, and certainly not to Britain or to anybody else.  Is Hamburg apologising to anybody?  They are within the EC regulations.  They had their free ports well before we went into the EC. Could you imagine going to the people of Hamburg now saying &ldquo;You cannot do this and you cannot do that&rdquo;?  What answer would you get?  We have a very high unemployment rate and we have an opportunity of taking advantage of something without injuring anybody else, the opportunity to have heavy tonnage coming into Ireland to unload and redistribute. That is what we should consider.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the question of servicing oil and gas rigs.  A situation was created over the last three or four years where nothing was landed as regards oil rigs or the servicing of them because of VAT at point of entry.  People who were working out of the mainland of Ireland were servicing oil rigs from ships coming direct from Aberdeen.  The tonnage is enormous, but it was more profitable to have ships going to Aberdeen to load and unload and to come back to the oil rigs because of VAT at point of entry.  The free port at Cork should eliminate that. Where people are now getting an opportunity of using very heavy tonnage in a free zone area in Cork, I do not want the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Communications or the Minister for Industry saying to them, &ldquo;You cannot do this or you cannot do that&rdquo;.  Imagine the volume of work that can be created in servicing and installing oil rigs off the east coast.  If we did strike oil, imagine the benefits of a free zone area in Cork, where by people could operate here exempt from taxes and duties.  I see opportunities for people who want to set up industry in Cork or other free zones. I welcome free zone.  If industry is to be served within the free zone every opportunity and facility must be provided.  I would even go so far as to say, as other people are saying, that the employers should be told they need not collect income tax from their employees.  That is done indirectly in social employment schemes.  A person gets so much but we create a situation where as little as possible <Col N="1299" /> is taken from him in order to encourage initiative.  Every facility must be provided for people involved in a free zone.</P>
    <P>On the question of free trade zones, let us get a comparison as against other areas which are not within the EC.  At the investment stage there is exemption from taxes, duties and tolls; investors may bring into the free zones any inputs they require from foreign locations without being subject to taxes, duties or tolls.  In a case where investors elect to obtain necessary inputs from a host country, they will be able to obtain such inputs at attractive prices due to the fact that such goods entering the free zone will be treated as exports from that relevant country.  The opportunity to bring about the same situation here is provided by the Bill.  The Bill does not provide the opportunities that are provided in other countries, where by raw material that is purchased in the country can be purchased at attractive prices due to the fact that such goods entering the free zone will be treated as exports from the country. Investors will also be able to benefit from any additional incentives that Ministers may deem to be appropriate.  In other words, if these people are prepared to make a suggestion to the Minister and if he deems it appropriate, he is prepared to adopt it.  That is not in our Bill.</P>
    <P>I readily admit that because I am from the Cork area and motivated the Bill in 1983 I might be emotional about it.  At the same time, I say there is an opportunity to create something that we do not have already.  Cork has lost a great deal.  Cork is always willing and was always willing to try to do better.  It is doing that in steel; it is doing that in computerisation and high technology.  Over the last three or four years Cork has lost many jobs.  I admit that other areas have lost jobs. Consider the undermining of the work force in Cork.  It is a good work force. There are work forces and there are good work forces but this is a work force that never knew what it was to be without a week's wages.  I meet a lot of people whom I never thought to see walking <Col N="1300" /> around from Monday until the next Sunday.</P>
    <P>I will continue on the line I was taking as regards the undermining of old industries in Cork and why I feel this Bill is very appropriate to Cork and to the region generally.  People have said that they see it as having relevance, but not great relevance.  I see it differently.  I hope I am not wrong.  If we are not seen in this House to give the motivation and incentive, other people will not be interested. The job loss in Cork is in the region of 10,000 to 12,000 with in the last three years.  There are other areas that are at the same level of unemployment&mdash;20 to 22 per cent, but these are farming areas. Cork was a very heavy industrial area.</P>
    <P>Consider what it is like to have a dockyard that four years ago employed about 1,400 people now lying completely idle. The wages of the 1,400 directly involved benefited 4,000 people.  The engineering, electrical and other sectors providing services to the dockyard represented enormous financial benefit to the area.  The transport sector has been lost.  We did not rationalise fast enough or did not do the right thing at the right time.  There was need for far more rationalisation.</P>
    <P>That is why I am cautious and why I am so confident that because of what happened in Cork over the last few years people will not be slap-happy or half-committed or take a devil-may-care attitude towards this free zone.  The opposite prevails at this time.  In the public or private sector in the Cork region there is a commitment to work it in a proper constructive and rationalised way.  Cork has learned as a work force and as a people the greatest lesson of all time.  We lost a heavy industry in Fords that we thought we would never lose.  Little did we think that we would see people coming into Cork spending £25½ million to eliminate 800 workers.  It happened.  I would have preferred that they would have rationalised down to 500 or 400 and spent £10 million on the other 400.  Cost proportions, energy costs, maybe labour costs and indeed, management had to be questioned.</P>
    <P>The proof is in the pudding.  It is now <Col N="1301" /> a bird sanctuary.  Next door there is a factory that was making up to 25,000 tyres a week and, indeed, what they were asked to make they made.  The work force gave a commitment, up to 30,000 tyres a week, and still lost the plant.  It is not nice.  It is not easy.  I certainly did not like the idea.  Between the two of them over £33 million was spent to eliminate work forces.  I would have preferred to have £20 million to £25 million put into productive lines and the rest spent on rationalisation of the work force.</P>
    <P>Because of our cost proportions and energy charges there is no way that we could build a ship in competition with other countries.  Whether it was worth it or not worth it is another question.  It is a fact of life in the Cork area.  We lost it. I do not care who is to blame.  I do not want to see that happen again.  In Irish Steel a workforce of 900 workers fell to 500.  A few months ago it nearly closed because of £1.2 million.  The Government came up with £1.2 million for a rationalisation programme.  They spent £1.2 million in eliminating 115 workers, going from 615 to 500 workers.  That is what they wanted to do, at a cost of £1.2 million on a rationalisation programme on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Unions and management had big arguments. Personal and, indeed, very abusive remarks were made of Ministers, Deputies and Senators, particularly by people in trade unions and by people in the workforce.  That was in the October-November period.  The workforce got something like £500,000 from the EC. On average they got £15,000 each &mdash; not a great amount of money.  I would prefer to have them working.  Within a very short period of eliminating 115 workers the same plant employed an extra 40 people in October-November.  A commitment was given for another £24 million by central Government.  The 115 workers went at a cost of £1.7 million between EC and Irish money.  Not more than ten to 12 weeks after these people walked out the door another 40 were employed.  I venture to say that while some were walking out others were <Col N="1302" /> coming in for interview.  That is not good management.</P>
    <P>How can anybody suggest that I should not question taxpayers' money being spent in the month of October for the elimination of 115 workers while early in January 40 extra workers are brought in? None of the 115 that went out came back. None of them was in any hurry back. How can management explain that to me?  The reply that I got was that there was an extra order.</P>
    <P>The last time we discussed the question of steel in this House was last April and the Minister, Deputy John Bruton, at the time got a commitment from the EC of an extra 0.2 per cent of extra tonnage for Irish Steel.  I understand that that is the extra order.  Is it to be suggested that nobody heard of Irish Steel before last November or October?  I do not envisage this continuing.  I do not believe that we should eliminate 115 at a cost of £1.7 million to bring in another 40.  That is not my thinking.  It is certainly not the impression that people should be given if we are to create a new situation within the free zone.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill with deep reservations. I will be questioning sections and I would hope that within the next two days, in discussing the Bill, we will be less negative and more broadminded.  If that impression is not given here it will not be given outside the House.  A great deal is expected of this House and the other House.  We are supposed to provide the initiative and the motivation.  Let us cut out the dilly-dallying between one Department and another because it will not pay.  We will be passed by.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say in passing, before I say what I have to say, that listening to Senator Cregan lament the restrictions European Community membership is imposing on us, I only wish he had joined with us in the days of 1973 when many of us felt that we were taking the wrong decision.  I have good reason to suspect ever since that the greater part of the real benefits of EC membership could have accrued to us, as distinct from the <Col N="1303" /> passing benefit to agriculture which is rapidly being withdrawn, by staying out enabling us to follow different strategies. Perhaps I would not agree with him, but the freedom to follow different strategies would have been far greater.</P>
      <P>I probably am fortunate, being Cork based, that I can say this without any immediate threat to my political future. I see no benefit in the whole idea of a free port.  I see no benefit in the strategy. The idea of moving towards zones of lower and lower taxation, of lower and lower regulation, of lower and lower control is a step by us out of the community of the industrialised world and back into the community of the Third World, the Third World which is forced into positions of concession after concession to attract increasingly avaricious international investment which requires less and less taxation and less and less regulation. What will happen, for instance, in our free port if in ten or 20 years' time the equivalent of our current day Fords and Dunlops say they cannot afford to stay here anymore because some other country can do it cheaper?  What regulations will then be asked to be removed?</P>

      <P>We will have further regulations.  We will have the environmental regulations being questioned because other countries are prepared to put up with dirty water.  We will have safety regulations being questioned. There are people already writing learned articles in journals like <i>Business and Finance</i> on the questionable nature of safety, environmental and other regulations, the implication being that in other countries these regulations have produced greater growth and investment.  I happen to believe that there is absolutely no conflict between high levels of industrial growth and high levels of environmental protection. There are many countries in Europe who have demonstrated it, but they have not done it by relying on taxation as an incentive to attract foreign investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we need in this country has been prescribed.  I am going to refer not to <Col N="1304" /> some sort of radical left wing document but to the <i>Newsletter</i> of the Confederation of Irish Industry for a strategy.  We need a strategy for wealth creation and for wealth that is retained within this country.  I have my own view about that strategy.  My view would be that of a socialist relying on a central role for the State and the State to be a vehicle for innovation.  I will leave that aside because I do not want to get involved in an ideological argy-bargy about this.  I want to contrast what was recommended to us in the area of industrial development, because at the core of industrial development is our capacity to innovate, to identify and to develop new products which are relevant to the markets of the late 20th century.  Our capacity for innovation will not be related to the number of free port areas we develop which attract in passing foreign enterprise because it happens to be temporarily more attractive to be here than elsewhere.  It will rely on a number of other things.  It will rely on our acceptance of the fact that by the standards of the Western world we have a particularly poor record in the area of innovation, even in the areas where we have some expertise.</P>
    <P>I will quote from the <i>Newsletter</i> of the Confederation of Irish Industry.  They say it is an accurate summary.  If it is not, I am sure any inaccuracies contained in it will not be leaning in my ideological direction.  We can reliably accept that it is not inaccurate in the sense of being too left wing a summary.  It states:</P>
    <P>In terms of innovative orientation Ireland is currently ranked in the bottom quartile of industrialised countries.</P>
    <P>That is the core of our problem.  The bedrock of the problem of industrial development in this country is the fact that we are poorly rated and are poor in the most fundamental of all areas, the area of innovation.  What factors did the OECD identify as causing that?  Firstly:</P>
    <P>A lack of specific technological skills and of a general awareness of new technologies in Irish firms.</P>
    <P>Nothing to do with levels of taxation, <Col N="1305" /> nothing to do with levels of incentives, nothing to do with deregulation, but a lack of a basic awareness of new technologies. It goes on, and this is not something most Irish industrialists like to hear:</P>
    <P>The production of undifferentiated, low technology products sold at a low price, instead of products based on quality, new technology and exclusive design...</P>
    <P>There is nothing in a strategy of low taxation, free ports etc. which will encourage companies to get involved in high technology and highly innovative industrial development.</P>
    <P>Thirdly:</P>
    <P>Exclusive orientation to relatively small, unsophisticated Irish and/or traditional British markets.</P>
    <P>Fourthly:</P>
    <P>The absence of larger progressive indigenous firms which would provide a strong technological and industrial background for smaller companies.</P>
    <P>Fifthly:</P>
    <P>Problems of communication and lack of acceptance of the need for technological change by management and workers.</P>
    <P>Sixthly, and I quote it, whatever my own views, as it is part of the package of commentary:</P>
    <P>Lack of opportunity for private individuals to make profit partly because of heavy personal and capital gains taxes, and therefore lack of development and venture capital, a general lack of understanding of innovation and entrepreneurship, of a strong innovative culture within firms and in Irish society generally.</P>
    <P>That is not my prescription or analysis of why this country lacks the tradition of innovation and entrepreneurial innovation. It is the prescription of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development.  That seems to contain the strands of a strategy for real industrial development as distinct from a spurious industrial development based on attracting <Col N="1306" /> in that part of a passing world trade which our capacity to underprice other people will enable us to do.</P>
    <P>I must say, speaking as a Cork resident, that I find the decision by the Government to reduce grant aid to the National Micro Electronics Application Centre far more threatening to the future of industrial development in this country because of the philosophy it reflects rather than any argument about the degree of freedom from taxation that will be available within the free port it is intended to set up in Cork.  The fact that one of the major centres for innovation is having some of its funds withdrawn is a far more serious matter than whether or not we have sufficient freedom in an area like the free port in Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>Why I object to this free port concept is because what has been done over a considerable number of years in Cork harbour is that the State &mdash; the community and the taxpayer &mdash; have assembled large areas of land, have invested heavily in the infrastructure and have developed a port facility.  Now we propose to put that on the market effectively at minimum benefit to the State in order to entice in a limited number of jobs which will be arguably of low skill and low learning quality.  The absence or presence of VAT and the absence or presence of a limited degree of customs charges on crude raw materials would not be a disincentive where you have high added value in the final product.  We are effectively going to be doing the sort of thing Senator Cregan suggested, which is enticing in people like Japanese car manufacturers to offload cars from large vessels in Cork and then transhipped by smaller vessels to the European market.  That, by definition, is low skill, low quality activity and not the strategy to develop an industrial infrastructure and industrial base.  At the core of an industrial strategy is not the creation of jobs and the creation of work, but the creation of wealth.</P>
    <P>The difference I identify between Left and Right is (a) about how you create wealth and (b) about who controls that wealth and what priorities are there for the use of the wealth that is so created. <Col N="1307" /> You cannot create wealth in a community if all of the corporate and industrial structures which are set up are to be exempted from all forms of taxation and are therefore going to be in a position to move freely into and out of the country with the only benefit being a limited number of jobs, in the sort of strategy that is envisaged in free port ideas of low skill jobs.  I do not see it as a strategy for development.</P>
    <P>I want to elaborate on what would be a strategy for development and identify how much the OECD's strategy for innovation, which is the core of development, is in contrast with the free port concept.  I would say this, because it is part of the package.  One of the fundamental things the OECD identifies is a considerable withdrawal of the State from the area of entreprenurial activity. I do not like that, but they do say it. Within a strategy of a mixed economy there are a number of other things they mention.  They emphasise the need for supportive investment in brains rather than in fixed assets.  I quote from the Confederation of Irish Industry <i>Newsletter</i>, volume 44, No. 7, December 1985. This quotation is at variance with one of the most loudly preached messages in Irish politics and Irish economics:</P>
    <P>Modern development relies more and more on investment in &lsquo;brains&rsquo;. Price is no longer a dominant factor in international markets.  Advanced firms in the high technology area invest in research and development, marketing, training and software as much as in buildings, equipment and machinery.</P>
    <P>Ireland should, as a key element in its development strategy, move towards knowledge intensive industries while focussing on the factors most relevant to her needs and capabilities. The Irish innovation strategy should concentrate on: applying new technology; developing market intelligence; continually upgrading the labour force; enriching management capabilities and emphasising product and service quality improvement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> That is the sort of strategy that I would envisage to develop large scale, indigenous, high technology industries.  I see no great role for free ports in that sort of a strategy.  A free port is effectively a free port where there are concessions in areas of customs duty and VAT etc. and is an investment in equipment and in things, whereas the identified stragety I would support is an investment in brains.  That means an investment in ideas and encouraging research and development, product modification, product improvement, marketing strategies, market research etc., all of which are effectively investment in brains.  What we are doing in Cork harbour is taking one major area which could be a centre for innovation and high technology and effectively auctioning it off in a less than critical way to industries which will ultimately be selected more on the fact that they are prepared to use the facility than on what they would contribute towards a strategy for improving the quality of innovation and hence the quality of industrial production.</P>
    <P>We have to get away from the idea that there is a fund of industrial investment out there in the big world that we can manage to attract in simply by competing at lower prices with other countries.  We are not going to be able to do it in terms of labour costs and we are not going to be able to do it in terms of what other people can do in other indirect costs. The sort of country Senator Cregan was quoting had until recently the very useful additional attraction for investors that trade unions had very little in the area of rights.  By and large, if you tried to organise a trade union, if you were lucky, you only ended up in jail.  If you were unlucky, you disappeared and never surfaced again.</P>
    <P>President Marcos was very much into the idea of enterprise and free zones.  As well as having tax free environments, you also had trade union free environments, no nasty State safety regulations and very little in the area of regulation of working hours.  We can move in either of two directions in our industrial development <Col N="1309" /> strategy.  We can move towards high technology and innovation in a way identified not by me or by other unrepresentative persons of the Left but by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; or else we can begin, sadly, to move backwards and identify a Third World strategy based on low cost and low taxation.  I do not believe that would work.  I do not believe it has achieved industrialisation anywhere else in Western Europe and it is a step backwards.</P>
    <P>The resources in Cork Harbour could be used in a far more creative and constructive way by developing a policy of innovation and encouraging small Irish firms to expand by sharing the risks with small Irish firms through a more creative role by the Irish banks and by various State agencies.  In that way, encouraging small Irish firms to become large indigenous Irish firms by making the wealth thus created available within this country to stimulate further investment, further employment and to create real large scale modern Irish indigenous industries is what we need.  I am not going to push this to a vote but I want to put on record that I see no future in free ports strategies and I would be opposed to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity at this late stage of the evening to comment briefly on this Bill.  I was unaware that it was going to be reached tonight but I want to avail of the opportunity nonetheless to make a few general comments on its contents.  I am stimulated in my thought patterns by the previous contribution from Senator Ryan, who touched the kernel of the whole issue.  The kernel of the issue is not a question of maritime policy but rather a strategy for industrial promotion and development.  This Bill is a product not of any careful analysis of maritime strategy or of a carefully outlined ports policy, but rather it is the product of a task force on unemployment which was a political response to a dire need from one section of the country.  When that governmental task force camped itself in the southern capital and addressed itself to the real <Col N="1310" /> needs and difficulties that city was experiencing at that time, there is no doubt that they looked for some mechanism to respond to those needs.</P>
      <P>One of the measures decided upon was to look at the idea of creating a free port. In its formulation I have difficulties with the way this Bill emerged.  The concept of a free port is a good one.  It has huge potential to develop and to make a very significant contribution to the industrial development of our country.  But I am concerned at the way this Bill came about in response to a particular geographical need at a particular point in time instead of an overall strategy for the development of the ports of Ireland.  I would rather that a very detailed critique had taken place on a merit basis of all the ports with possibilities and that the designation would be made on that basis.  No doubt the Minister will respond that that can still take place, that this is enabling legislation and, if the need arises for further free ports to be designated in the years to come, that that can be addressed through the processes of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I was sorry that careful analysis encompassing the geographical and natural resources of a particular area, the merits and demerits of an area and encompassing the much broader and greater industrial analysis put forward by Senator Brendan Ryan earlier had not taken place prior to this Bill's emergence.  I want to address myself to the general strategy of industrial promotion that Senator Ryan commented on in his contribution.  He talked in terms of the establishment of free ports which somehow parallelled a Third World type of industrial strategy whereby hugh multinationals, which were itinerant vehicles looking around the world for a place to set up some sort of semi-permanent roots subject to the vagaries of an alternative call, would be the core and substance of our economic and industrial strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that it will be totally impossible for us to set our face against the tremendous advances we have made as a people in protecting workers, in establishing workers' rights, legal safety requirements and environmental protection.  I reject <Col N="1311" /> the notion that the high levels of industrial growth are not compatible with the very stringent and high standards for environmental protection and with the safety regulations for workers.</P>
    <P>Much of the contribution Senator Ryan made centred on an alternative strategy, one of innovation, that Ireland should be innovative, geared into the new technologies, able to grab ideas, to nurture brains and to create jobs.  That is a very valid strategy but it does not exclude the sort of concept that is encompassed in the establishment of free ports.  They are certainly not exclusive.  I totally support the idea of State initiative.  We all have participated in recent times in the passage of a Bill to enable this to take place for the first time in a very constructive and organised way through the National Development Corporation Bill.  In the medium and long term the NDC will be a vehicle for the sort of State development and the nurturing of innovation that Senator Ryan talked about.</P>
    <P>This Bill will enable a parallel and equally valid type of industrial development to take place.  We are a trading country. We depend on trade for our life blood. We are in a very healthy trading position at this point in time.  We cannot close ourselves off from the developments that are happening in our trading partners. The whole idea of free ports has expanded across the world.  It is not a new idea.  Senators in previous contributions referred back to medieval examples of free ports.  But the type of modern free port envisaged in this Bill, and which has begun to take form in other developed Western countries, is new.  It is something worthy of consideration and merit.  My fear is that the in-depth analysis of the real needs of this economy and of the industrial development of our country have not taken place in the formulation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the emphasis will be put upon Ringaskiddy because that area had at that time major industrial difficulties.  The correct analysis had not taken place to look at the overall needs of the country.  That was a mistake.  I <Col N="1312" /> know that as far back as the middle of the last decade the European Community designated another port, Rosslare Harbour, as the development port for Ireland. Through political manoeuvrings and pressure that development has not taken place.  I do not want to be too parochial in outlining one region because it is a factor that could apply to others. However, I will say in defence and in promotion of the port of Rosslare that it has, without any great supportive structures in recent years, emerged as one of the success stories in Irish maritime policy.  It is a success story despite the State's reaction to it rather than because of it.  It is a great cause of regret that when the South Eastern Region Developmental Organisation set about identifying ports in the south-east region which would possibly merit inclusion in any list of free ports in the country Rosslare did not get adequate consideration by An Foras Forbartha at the time due in no small measure to the attitude of the port authority, CIE.</P>
    <P>The Minister would accept that there has been somewhat of a change in the port authority's attitude to development of the harbour in recent times, possibly because of the inclusion of a possible change of structure in a Government White Paper.  Whatever the reason, we have seen a <i>de facto</i> change in attitude by the management of that harbour.  We have seen concrete development.  They have produced a £5 million plan which will provide the passengers who are already picking the port by choice, despite the inadequate facilities, and provide the shipping companies who are already picking the port by choice, despite the inadequate facilities, the facilities to match the demand that is there. The position in other areas in the country is that fabulous facilities are being provided in advance of demand to attract demand.  The story of Rosslare has been that the demand is there for a number of reasons &mdash; the location, the efficiency of the workforce, and the communication links that are provided.  Rosslare, on its own merits, deserves careful consideration for inclusion among the free ports. <Col N="1313" /> New Ross is another harbour that the Foras Forbartha report designated would be worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The type of in-depth analysis that is required in advance of the launching of this type of development has not taken place.  It is quite clear that, to many people, a free port is just a concept and something positive.  &ldquo;We must have one. let us scream and shout about it.&rdquo; Anyone who has looked at the idea of a free port will recognise that it will be a useless concept unless it is capable of attracting business through either its own natural advantages or through the structures that are put into it.  It must be in a position to attract business from other competing areas and develop and nurture business that would not be in this country at all.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate for me to outline and underline the real potential of Rosslare Harbour as a free port.  Because of its geographical location, it is already the choice of port users.  It is a success story, despite the impediments put upon it by the port authority and the State agencies responsible.  It is appropriate for me to outline the economic situation in the county of Wexford at large.  Unfortunately, it gives me no great comfort to have to state in this House again that, in the Wexford district, which includes the Rosslare Harbour region, the unemployment rate is now 25 per cent.  In real terms there are only two counties with a higher unemployment rate than my own, and both of those have peculiar characteristics which, in effect, mean that the Wexford situation is unique as a black spot.  That in itself would merit the detailed consideration that the task force on unemployment gave to Cork.  Wexford would deserve the same sort of sympathetic and real consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not ask for favours in that regard. I have no doubt in the world that the merits of Rosslare Harbour will stand up in economic, geographical and performance terms historically.  It does not need anybody to paint a rosy picture of its potential.  Its record and performance to date have proven that again and again. <Col N="1314" /> What I ask for is simply a reasonable, balanced consideration to be given to it as well as to other areas.  I hope that that will not be taken by my Cork colleagues as a sort of begrudging mentality.  The development of our country is contingent on the proper utilisation of all its natural resources.  It is in everybody's interest that a natural asset, like Rosslare Harbour, would be used to its best possible advantage for the benefit of the country. Rosslare Harbour applied, as long ago as 1981, for consideration.  A comprehensive development plan was laid before the Government at that time by the Rosslare Harbour Development Association, who commissioned a very comprehensive report and paid for it from their own resources.  It was paid for by interested bodies, individuals and business people in the area.  They put forward a very comprehensive and worthwhile plan.</P>
    <P>I believe that the idea of a free port is a tremendously positive one.  The potential has not been spelled out in the Bill before us but will emerge in the years to come.  I would hope that our attitude to industrial development and to the exploitation of our natural resources, be it ports or anything else, would not be contingent on the immediate emergence of a disaster situation.  There should be a proper analysis of the best development of the infrastructures of our country.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan in his earlier contribution talked about the benefits of oil and the possibility of utilising a free port structure based on Cork for the servicing of offshore rigs and, ultimately, for the exploitation and bringing ashore of the raw material.  It remains to be seen, of course, where the actual resources are to be found.  Hopefully, they will be in abundance all along our south coast. There is great potential there for an ordered State-controlled investment in a free port area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope that the concepts envisaged in it will bear fruit for the benefit of the State as a whole.  I am cautious that it would be seen by some as a stop rather than a serious important element in the industrial strategy to <Col N="1315" /> tackle the problem of mass unemployment. If it is a genuine part of a thoughtout, concerted State strategy, that will have many arms encompassing the ideas of innovation, which Senator Ryan mentioned, then this concept will be a welcome one and will bear fruit for us all.  It is something, I hope, we will see expanding to other areas of the country.</P>

      <P>Píosa an-ghairid atá le rá agam anois.  Ar an dtaobh seo den Tí cuirimid fáilte roimh An mBille Saorphort, 1985, cé go bhfuil cúpla athruithe ag teastáil uainn.  Tá súil agam go bhfuilimid ag dul sa treo ceart leis an chéim seo agus b'fhéidir go n-éireoidh linn obair a fháil do dhaoine.  Ceapaim gur tosach maith é agus mar a deir an seanfhocal, &ldquo;Tosach maith leath na hoibre&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief.  We give this Bill a guarded welcome.  It is understandable that Senator Cregan, who comes from an area which will benefit directly as a result of this Bill, has reservations about it.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate in both Houses we heard details of the history of free ports.  Apparently they extend much longer into the past than I have realised. Of course, the very successful ones were dealt with in some detail, ports such as Miami and others.  We had the experience of Shannon in our own country since 1947.  Unfortunately, it appears that we do not have the same scope now for success as we had in those earlier years.  To some degree it is an imitation of developments in the UK.  This Bill was activated and the attempts to have a free port brought here were activated at the same time as there was some demand over in England.  We have an enlarged Community. There are 12 countries and there are no tarriffs or customs barriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that Cork seems to have suffered more than any other part of this country.  We heard of Ford, Dunlop and the Verolme Dockyard closing.  There are other areas which would be very anxious to get the same opportunity. <Col N="1316" /> Senator Howlin made an appeal for Rosslare. I am sure it is very deserving.  I hope, if this is a success, that before long all these other areas will be given an opportunity as well.</P>
    <P>It is an enabling measure.  The Minister has told us that he does not deal with any specific location.  The initial attempt will be made in Ringaskiddy.  The origins of the Bill go back to the deliberations of the task force and recommendations which were made in 1984.  Despite the fact that some people have been critical of the delay in bringing the Bill before the House, it seems to me that, with that background and the time required for researching this concept, we should not be too critical of the time involved.</P>
    <P>The Government are attempting to provide legislation which will generate additional economic activity.  This is most important because additional activity is necessary.  This is primarily the reason why we welcome the Bill.  If it does not do that, the whole operation is a failure.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that there were a number of mechanisms already in existence through which firms can suspend payments of customs duties.  He is proceeding with this enabling measure now while the arrangements as regards the development and management of the Ringaskiddy Free Port are being investigated. This is something with which we would agree, because, as well as giving them an opportunity to investigate and explore the possibilities in this area, it is also lending that impetus to the investigations.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the facility which is available in the form of a new deep-water berth in Ringaskiddy.  It has cost the State about £10 million in grants. When the berth is completed next year it will accommodate vessels of up to 60,000 tonnes dead weight.  It will be the biggest berth of this kind in the State.</P>
    <P>There are other areas I would like to go into, but at this late hour I do not think it is necessary.  One point which was mentioned in the other House regarding the geographical location was the importance of the transport and communication <Col N="1317" /> facilities which are available.  Communications by way of telephone, road, rail and air are important.  There has been a big growth in free port traffic in recent years.  It is estimated that 20 per cent of the world trade takes place through free ports.  Of course, we have to distinguish between this facility in the less developed countries.  We cannot expect the same success here.  I simply rose to welcome this measure in so far as it is an attempt to deal with many of our problems.  I am sure there will be difficulties in many areas.  With regard to the claims of other locations I feel sure these will be taken into account if this is a success in Ringaskiddy. For that reason every effort should be made to ensure that this operation would be a total success and in so far as it attempts to deal with the problems that I have mentioned, I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill to the House.  It is a very futuristic Bill.  I wish the Minister success in its implementation. At the same time I hope that he will not rely over-heavily on the existing State and semi-State organisations for the establishment and development of free ports.  Many countries, both in the Community and, indeed, in the states associated with the European Community, have developed free ports over a considerable number of years.  I presume that the Minister, or some of his senior officials, have visited and looked with keen interest at the developments and the practices that have evolved in those varying countries.  It is significant.  I hope that the Minister is in a position to take the better ideas and adapt them to suit the particular situation in our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to deal with his present policy on the actual free ports themselves.  Are we talking about the upgrading or the special legislation for one free port, namely, Ringaskiddy?  I would hope not.  The development in the port of Cork has been significant.  It is unfortunate that just as it was ready, there were some problems with ferries and perhaps a loss of a certain amount of business to that marvellous infrastructure. <Col N="1318" /> On the free port, the Minister has not spelt it out sufficiently in his Second Reading speech here.  I was rather taken aback by that.  I would like to know what the Irish free ports are going to be.  Is it going to be a sort of a maritime addition of the Shannon Free Airport?  The SFADCo, which evolved from Shannon has, in its own sphere, been eminently successful.  I suppose there are many things to be taken from that.  This is 1986, and the State has a considerable amount of experience going back to 1948 or 1949 in the administration of incentives for industrial development and incentives for the development of facilities such as were afforded in the Shannon Free Airport area.  Those incentives, by and large, cost the Irish taxpayer a considerable amount of money.  I hope, being a great optimist, that all of that money was very well spent. I would like the Government to indicate their policy on the spending of such money and to show how much of it is risk capital and what percentage of a chance we should take.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion over the last few years that there should be a greater percentage of chance or risk capital offered by the Small Industry Section of the IDA to small firms, such as family enterprises who start up to pursue some sort of a craft industry or small family-based industry.  When we come to the free ports, I wonder is the Minister thinking &mdash; and we must remember that there are three Ministers involved in this legislation or at least in the envisaged administration of it &mdash; of very small enterprises within the free port complex?  The one thing that annoys me a little, having regard to the tremendous rip-offs in the last 25 years in this House that I have witnessed in the State and semi-State companies, is that the penalties in section 6 for contravening the regulations are £500 and then £1,000.  Sections 9, 10 and 12 all mention fines of £500.  Is the Minister providing for huckster shops solely? He is proposing in a free port, a free tax area, a prohibitive fine and a deterrent of £500.  An ordinary farmer driving down the road with a car valued at £500, £1,000, or even a new one with red diesel in it <Col N="1319" /> would incur a fine on the first offence of £1,000; on the second offence, the car, whether it is valuable or not, is confiscated. Here we are going into a free port which will certainly attract a percentage of chancers and fly-by-nights.  We must accept that.  There is not a perfect society here and I see no sign of one emerging either.  We are in an era of rip-offs.</P>
    <P>I was looking at the programme &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; on the mining situation. The amounts of allocations alleged from the State agencies was in six or eight figures.  Perhaps you cannot believe everything you read in the papers or see on the television.  Is the Minister really serious when he is proposing £500 penalties for breaches of the regulations in a free port, tax-free, duty-free area? Unless they are going to have, or envisage, very small enterprises, indeed, I would have thought there would have been greater horizons.  My conception of a free port is that we are going to provide the facilities for multi-national organisations to establish in designated free port areas, with heavy infrastructural development. The by-product for the taxpayer in Ireland would be that we would have greater opportunities for industrial work which we would not otherwise be able to provide in this country.  Any legislation that the Government introduce that encourages or provides more employment has to be welcomed.  We have the opportunity now in 1986 of seeing the way the free ports have operated in a dozen countries, with which I am sure the Government and the Minister are familiar and which could be compared to the situation here.</P>
    <P>I would see the development of the free ports in two or three stages.  The first stage would be the investment stage.  I notice that in section 4 of the Bill provision is being made for more than manufacturing enterprises, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Minister may after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce grant or refuse to grant to any person a licence authorising the carrying on <Col N="1320" /> within a free port of any trade, business or manufacture.</P>
    <P>From that I take it that in the free port we are going to have more than manufacturing businesses.  I would envisage, perhaps, some of the international big banks moving in.  How restricted will they be? Will they supply a service?  Taking the interest rates in continental Europe, you will see that in Luxembourg, where there are perhaps 120 international banks you can borrow at 3 or 4 per cent.  If some of those big banks establish in the free port is that kind of business envisaged there? Will it be entirely to service the new industries and the new enterprises there, or will we be able to visit it as if we were going to another jurisdiction and, perhaps, be able to get an attractive deal there as well?  For instance, does the Minister intend to grant a licence to international insurance companies to establish and open for business?  That is just two of the non-manufacturing areas.  Nevertheless, there is a facility in the Bill but the Minister has not given us an idea of what kind of employment he envisages in the new free ports.  I think that is a pity. This is an opportunity for us to pick the brains of those managing successfully the free ports across Europe.  I suppose some of the enterprises have not been as successful as others but if we are going to have a marshalling yard for people to get around international regulations by importing and exporting just to save tax, then I do not think it is worth the effort or the bother.  People will use it just as a port or flag of convenience to save themselves from, perhaps, some other national taxation.</P>
    <P>I take it that there will be exemptions from taxes, duties and tolls.  If so, in what way does the Minister envisage raising the finance to keep this development afloat?  In some of the free ports in Europe there are exemptions from export formalities.  Yet in one of the sections here I notice that the customs people will not only be active within the free port but will be operating any place within 32 kilometres of the actual gates <Col N="1321" /> of the free port.  Once the place is established I presume there will be exemptions from taxes and duties and tolls as well.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister will there be income tax exemption for some or all of the workers who may be living within the boundaries of the free port.  If we are to go by the tax holidays that were extended in the Shannon Free Airport Development Act in the Fifties, where the companies got a 20-year tax holiday from corporation profit tax, is it the Minister's intention to have that kind of an incentive for foreign manufacturers to come and get established here so that we will have the benefit of job creation? I would expect that there would be an exemption from corporation tax on profits.  If so, how does the Minister get around the fair competition restrictions that we come across in the Treaty of Rome?  It would be an attractive incentive if, coupled into all those exemptions, the Minister was to write in a benefit for people once they were established to win new incentives that might be introduced at a later stage in the envolvement of the free port.</P>
    <P>Will the non-manufacturing enterprises, that is, just the business and commercial enterprises, benefit from tax concessions?  Will they also be exempt from Irish company law?  Will things like bank licences be issued in a special fashion?  What will the situation be on customs exemptions?  Will there be special provisions for goods exported from the duty-free port out of the jurisdiction? Will they be different from the conditions relating to goods which are imported into the country from the free port as well?</P>
    <P>I think this is an opportunity to look at the progress that successive Governments have made through CCT, the IDA and through SFADCo and through those agencies that have worked so hard and so successfully over the last quarter of a century.  I would hope, with the introduction of the new free port legislation, that we could perhaps try out some forward labour incentives.  Could we not tie in with the tax honeymoon, <Col N="1322" /> perhaps, a ten-year strike-free period? Could we not possibly introduce an order to ensure index-linked wages for the workers? Could we not have special regulations regarding social security?  It would be a pity if this new incentive was only aimed at the balance of payments and that there would not be specific provisions within it for the ordinary people who are expected to work there as well.</P>
    <P>I would hope in policy and planning that not only would significant structures be provided but that regional planning and administration would be invoked as well.  In conclusion, could I ask the Minister if his Department would consider the establishment of a fund to set up this new concept of industrial development? Would he think of objectives to establish and help finance the foundation and the continued development of the free port? The special authority should be able to hold on to all the work.  They will be responsible not only for the establishment of the infrastructures but for maintenance and repair.  I also think they should have complete control over the training of workers and the special incentives to encourage new entrants and projects into the complex.  I would look forward also to a section within that authority that would ensure the modernisation and research needed for proper continuity, complete co-ordination within the proposed authority, branches of AnCO and the various other semi-State organisations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the free port legislation.  I look forward to the Minister being able to reply to some of the points I have raised, as the Bill is one that I should like to see amended.  It is a pity that, even in this era of politicians being constantly reminded of junkets and what have you, the Members should have been encouraged to look at some of the existing free ports not too far away to see exactly the kind of development we want here and to pick the best of what is available.  At least the Minister should have said that his officials have looked at a number of free ports.  We should not just be spending money.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill, and also to congratulate the special task force that was set up in Cork to bring about this very important legislation.  I have no reason to begrudge the people of Cork the establishment of a free port at Ringaskiddy; nevertheless, there are many other suitable locations in the country that could claim as well to be considered for these very special concessions and advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to my own area along the Shannon Estuary from Tarbert to Ballylongford.  I know the case will be made that there is already a free airport in Shannon.  The advantages of the Shannon Estuary for deepwater port locations have been very well documented over the years and I would like to refer to the 1983 Foras Forbartha report which decided on certain locations along the Shannon Estuary that had prime advantages for the location of industry in the future, especially heavy industry.  In this report the area from Tarbert to Ballylongford was singled out as being one of the prime locations for future deep port development. For that reason I feel that I am justified in bringing this argument before the Minister here tonight.  I have said this on numerous occasions, whether it is because I am new to politics or not, that we along the Shannon Estuary have lost out over the years because of lack of real political clout and because of political commitment and leadership.  The fact that Ringaskiddy has been singled out bears testimony to the fact that local political leadership can be a major contributory factor in deciding on locations for special consideration.  That is the reason <Col N="1324" /> why an area such as the Shannon Estuary with its considerable natural advantages has been neglected and will continue to be neglected in the future unless there are some initiatives taken in the very near future.  I would like to welcome the proposed setting up of the estuarial authority. It will have to be announced and formulated in the very near future.  Such an authority could be very supportive in having the area referred to designated as a free port area and it could promote the area abroad especially in Europe and America.  The Shannon Estuary has been associated with the Clyde in Scotland and Rotterdam as being one of the finest natural harbours and estuaries in Europe. There is definitely no argument to discount this.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to take this into consideration when replying. The infrastructure that existed in the Cork area especially in Ringaskiddy had already existed and will help in the success of Ringaskiddy as a free port.  Nevertheless if the location referred to has any hope in the future of becoming a free port or indeed enjoying the advantages that it should there should be some move regarding the development of the area, especially in relation to the infrastructure. For example, at the moment the amount of clean water that is available is restricted and the Department of the Environment have plans for a major dam works in North Kerry on the Smearlagh river and I would like this to be given prime consideration because if the area is to develop it will need this type of supply of water, and besides there has been a suggestion that the gas pipeline would be extended to this region.  There are very many justifiable arguments to support this as well.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat the great natural advantages that this area has besides its very suitable terrain and the fact that we have a major unemployment problem in North Kerry.  We have one of the greatest rates of emigration at present to both America and England.  The area cannot continue to be neglected and ignored by successive Governments.  When one considers that Alcan decided on its location <Col N="1325" /> in Aughinish Island and the ESB decided on the location at Moneypoint for the coal burning station then I feel that the area along the Shannon, which already has an ESB station, from Tarbert to Ballylongford cannot be ignored for future industrial expansion, and again I would like the Minister to consider what I have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, may I thank the Senators for the contributions and indeed the general welcome given to this Bill with possibly one exception.  One Senator had severe reservations, to put it mildly.  As I said earlier, this is enabling legislation and once it has gone through this House and gone on to the Statute Book, it is possible to set up free ports at a sea port or inland or wherever.  Senator Howlin has been talking about Rosslare and Senator Deenihan spoke about his area and the great natural advantages along the entry to the Shannon Estuary.  Once it is on the Statute Book it will be up to any area to put forward the merits of its particular location.</P>
      <P>As far as Ringaskiddy is concerned, this free port idea emerged from the work of the Cork task force.  I understand that one of the motivating people in putting forward the idea at the initial stages was a Senator who made his contribution this evening.  The word &ldquo;Ringaskiddy&rdquo; is not mentioned in the Bill.  There should be no jealousy from any other part of the country.  The potential is there and we are starting with Ringaskiddy.  It is wise and prudent to wait and see what happens in Ringaskiddy because some Senators mentioned that, as far as the United Kingdom experience is concerned, it has not been all that exciting.  There has been no great success.  With the possible exceptions of Liverpool and Southampton, the others have had moderate success, if any success at all.  We can learn from Ringaskiddy and then proceed slowly to other areas if it is thought advisable.  This is taking a positive step.  It is a new initiative and one of considerable potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the Senators that there <Col N="1326" /> is no intention of being negative.  The point was made throughout the debate that perhaps we were being too circumspect in what we were doing, but why should we be on this?  We will be as liberal as we possibly can.  It is up to the ingenuity, imagination and enterprise of the various operators to get action on the ground.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan said we must be broadminded about it.  Certainly I will do that. The important thing to remember is that we have to conform to the EC ground rules that exist.  These rules are very clear, very tight, very specific and leave little area for fudging and discretion. They are laid down in an extremely tight form and we have to conform to them. We have a customs area in the entire EC and these are regulations for particular specific developments withing that.  We heard from Senator Killilea about the situation in North Cyprus and from Senator Cregan about the operations in Turkey, where there is a far more liberal regime and far greater enticements and inducements to operate in a free port zone than we are offering in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan pointed out that people working within the free port area paid no income tax at all and that this was in the brochure.  The only people who enjoy that advantage in Ireland are creative artists, and rightly so.  There is no question of similar facilities being provided here because we have to operate absolutely and totally within the EC regulations. Just as we operate in the agricultural area, in the industrial area, in the financial area, we have to conform to the rules and there is no way of breaking them.  Naturally, we have to exercise our enterprise and ingenuity to see how far we can go within the rules.  But, once the rules are there, we have to conform to them; but we will be broadminded and say we will be liberal.  I am sure that when the Cork people produce their brochure there will be plenty of allure and attraction from the financial point of view and all other attractions to come to Cork and perhaps the one from Turkey, although it is produced nicely, may fade into insignificance <Col N="1327" /> when the imagination of the Cork people gets going.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of vesting too much power in the Minister and also associated with this are the Minister for Communications, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In view of the implications for the Exchequer we must have the involvement of all those Ministers.  Once the licences are issued and the people are there <i>in situ</i>, then it is up to the operator, whether it is a person or a corporate body of some sort.  In that respect there should not be this great fear that this Bill does not give the local input.  For instance, if the Cork Harbour Commissioners are the people who turn out to be successful for Ringaskiddy and if they, in turn, bring in other people, as they are seeking to do, then you will have a corporate body who will in most cases have a very big if not total local interest involved.  I do not think there is any great fear on that issue. I would like to re-assure the Senators on that.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have control by the Minister for Communications in consultation with the other Ministers because what we want to do in this area above all else is to generate extra new economic activity.  There is no use in Ringaskiddy in Cork attracting something down from the west or attracting something from Rosslare and so on by simply having better facilities there.  The Minister in giving the licences must have the regulatory power in that respect.  What we want is new generated activity, not a substitution for something that is already happening somewhere else.  While increasing the wealth or the growth of job creation in one area you are impoverishing another area, which nobody wants and neither does Ringaskiddy.  Regulatory control is needed and once it is in operation the real activities will belong the the operator. From the way in which it is shaping up in Cork it looks as if some Cork body will be very involved, although the Minister said he is willing to look at the submissions that come from anyone.  Any person <Col N="1328" /> who feels they should belong should be making submissions to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Cork Harbour Commissioners are seeking local partners.  This is not to suggest that other proposals should not be made or be considered by the Minister. The chances that a person or persons designated under this section will have a significant local involvement are very great.  Senator Ryan said that we should be in the business of the high-tech area, but of course we are in that business. There is nothing exclusive about it.  That does not mean we are abrogating our ideas to go into the high-tech business by the fact that we are introducing a free port area and neither does it mean that we cannot continue precisely as we are. We have plenty of space for all of these activities.  If there are any other good industries in the high-tech area that come to Cork we are not stopping them by this in any way.  In fact the ancillary activities may greatly encourage them or encourage them to set up in the free port area.</P>
    <P>Senator Howlin talked about the lack of overall strategy, that this was enabling legislation and that it should not be derived from the start of the task force in Cork but that it should have been researched and worked on well.  As Senator Fitzsimons said, tosach maith, leath na hoibre.  At least, this is a beginning.  We could have waited until we had everything on the ground perfectly in shape; but I am a great believer in getting it there and subsequently improving on it, if we can improve on it.  My experience in the relatively short period in which I have been Minister of State is that, unless one decides on action and presses for action all the time, one's great ideas will simply float around with no practical result on the ground.  It was very wise in this case to make a start.  If we make mistakes in Ringaskiddy then perhaps other parts of the country will benefit from it if they subsequently go into the free port area.  Rosslare have put forward their claim, as has Greenore in the other House, and a number of other areas.  It has also been suggested that the Connacht Regional Airport could be a suitable area for a free port zone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> Senator MacDonald mentioned fines, but these are fines on top of any other fine, plus forfeiture of goods, which can be a very important aspect as far as penalties are concerned.  I remember, from my early reporting days along the Border, when smuggling was at its height along the Louth-Armagh and Louth-Down borders, forfeiture of the goods was by far the greatest penalty that could be encountered by the people involved.</P>
    <P>Many of the points Senator McDonald raised could best be answered on Committee Stage.  It is very much up to the operators themselves to generate activities. There will always be the usual facilities available to the people taking part in the activities and there will be the usual incentives for industry as such.  We are making a start here.  As everyone knows, the first beneficiaries of the legislation will be Ringaskiddy.  If it is successful obviously other areas will seek to come in and put forward their advantages. There is no point in proliferating free port areas all over the country because one would be negativing the benefit of the other.  It has to be controlled and regulated in an orderly fashion.  I believe what is here is a good idea.  It has been proved successful in other areas.  I believe that we have the imagination and the ingenuity to do it ourselves.  As far as the facilities and the incentives are available, we have to conform to the regulations within that context, otherwise we would be as liberal and as generous and, to use the words of Senator Cregan, as broadminded as we possibly can within that framework.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Senators for the manner in which the Bill has been received.  I always believed that once legislation came to either the Dáil or the Seanad there was no further improvement on it.  This may have resulted from my long period reporting the affairs rather than actually participating in them.  I now find that all legislation &mdash; particularly that which is inaugurated in this House, and I had the opportunity to do that with a number of Bills &mdash; is at a <Col N="1330" /> more leisurely pace, and a less controversial attitude always results in an improvement of the Bill.  I believe that always happens.  I think that some of the various points raised here will certainly guide the Minister very strongly in his attitudes when this legislation is being put into force.</P>

      <P>Would the Senators who are here bear with me for a few moments before I take the matter on the Adjournment of the House? Because of something that happened earlier this evening in this House, and because of my commitment to the Chair I was quite upset about it, I feel that for the record of myself and the officials I should make the following statement. Before the House adjourns I want to clarify for the record the question raised earlier this evening after a vote on Item 8, motion on pensions, by two Senators who alleged they were prevented from voting by the doors being locked earlier than is usual on a division.  Indeed, the Senators requested that this matter should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, of which I am a member.  I agreed to that and the Senators have the right to refer any matter to that committee.  Without wishing to pre-empt the committee's views on the matter, since the vote was taken I have had the opportunity to have the matter investigated.  I am perfectly satisfied, as Leas-Chathaoirleach, that the division was taken in accordance with normal practice of this House.  I felt that for the record of this House I had to set this point straight for myself, as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>

      <P>I want to thank you a Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Minister <Col N="1331" /> and the House for giving me an opportunity to discuss this very important matter, even at this very late hour.  We had a motion earlier which dealt in some way with criticisms of the Seanad.  People do not take into consideration that the House can sit very late.  In my own case I did not have anything to eat since lunchtime today and I will not be home until well after midnight.  These things are always overlooked.</P>
      <P>I would like to say to the Minister &mdash; I am sure he will agree with me &mdash; that this is a very important motion.  To put it in some kind of perspective, I want to remind the Minister that the Joint Committee on Women's Rights received many submissions, 15 of which included recommendations for the provision of child care facilities.  We were dealing only with education but, of all the submissions made, 15 of them included recommendations &mdash; some of them expanded and some of them not so much so &mdash; urging the provision of child care facilities.</P>
      <P>I would be very concerned for all women in society, particularly the deprived, the less well off.  As I mentioned many times before in this House, it is a far different situation when you go into a housing scheme, walk into a house and you see the actual conditions there.  I have heard some stories and I have seen many unfortunate situations.  I mentioned before in this House of approaching a door and, on being answered by a young girl, I asked to see the woman of the house.  This small slip of a girl said: &ldquo;I am the woman of the house&rdquo;.  In those houses there is very little furniture.  We hear so many instances of people milking the system.  This is totally exaggerated. We are anxious that people who live in those areas would be happy, that they would be able to avoid sickness and to look after their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fair test of the committee system is to examine recommendations submitted and see what has been carried out in response to those recommendations. Health boards throughout the country have limited funds for child care facilities and these are, in general, for socially <Col N="1332" /> deprived children.  That is a limited area, but nevertheless it is welcome.</P>
    <P>With regard to the motion, I feel I can best put a case before the Minister by quoting extracts from the reports which make these suggestions.  Before doing so I will make a few small points.  There are pressures on all those family areas.  The case is made by some people that by providing these facilities more women will be looking for and getting employment. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Women's Rights made the case that where married women sign for unemployment benefit they must have some provision to look after their children. This would be one area where that would be provided.  The provision of a creche in a housing estate would not be very costly. I am sure it would cost less than half the price of another house.  These could be very well designed.  They could be landscaped pleasantly.  Housing development may be regarded as the implementation of social policy.  I believe that social policy should be ongoing.  It should be revised in order to incorporate requirements of society as we go along.  Clearly, it has been shown that child care facilities are very necessary.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to all those who work in the child care area; limited though they may be, nevertheless they do a good job.  We have not enough of them.  It has been mentioned many times in this House before that traditionally women have been slaves in this country. They have done the difficult work.  They have looked after the elderly and sick people.  They have got no respite.  This provision would make the task far easier in situations where women would have problems with sick or elderly people or with very young children.</P>
    <P>About three to four years ago I did a course for a diploma in adult education teaching which necessitated a visit to Milton Keynes in England.  It was extraordinary to see the provisions for child care, simple creche facilities.  In this country we are very far behind with regard to adult education.  There is tremendous scope, particularly in relation to unemployment. If child caring facilities were <Col N="1333" /> available on the scale I would envisage from these recommendations adult education would be far more successful.  I would recommend that the Minister seriously consider implementation of these proposals.</P>
    <P>The initial report I referred to was a report by the Commission on the Status of Women presented in 1972.  It is a very comprehensive report.  There are about, six pages dealing with day-care for children. It starts off with the position as regards married women who find that they must re-enter employment, or mothers who are ill or hospitalised for any length of time, and are faced with the task of finding suitable care facilities for young children.  The most satisfactory solution to this problem is where arrangements can be made for parents or other relations to undertake responsibility for them while the mother is working or incapacitated. Frequently, it is not possible for the mother to make this kind of arrangement and she must either try to avail of professional child-minding facilities or else depend on older children to look after the younger ones outside school hours.  This latter solution is clearly a very unsafe and unsatisfactory one, but representations were made to the committee to the effect that in certain areas it is not an infrequent occurrence where mothers are working and that the responsibility lies with the State and other authorities for not providing suitable creche and day-nursery facilities where young children can receive skilled care if the mother is forced by economic necessity to resume work.  The report goes on further to state:</P>
    <P>In dealing with the question of the provision of day-care facilities for babies and young children, we wish to stress that we are unanimous in the opinion that very young children, at least up to 3 years of age, should, if at all possible, be cared for by the mother at home and that as far as re-entry to employment is concerned, the provision of day care for such children must be viewed as a solution to the problems of the mother who had particularly <Col N="1334" /> strong reasons to resume employment.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to deal with the number of nurseries at the time in the Dublin area.  There were six day nurseries catering for children under six years of age.  The report states at paragraph 313, page 131:</P>
    <P>On a very rough estimate, the annual cost of providing one child-care place in the day nurseries referred to in paragraph 311 is approximately £150-200 without reckoning any charge in relation to capital investment.  The total number of places available is about 1,250.  The cost of providing places in creches would, we believe, be much higher than the figure quoted due to the relatively smaller number of children which each staff member could care for.  According to the 1966 Census, there were over 45,000 children between the ages of 3 and 6 years in the Dublin and Cork County Boroughs alone.  Any effort to provide special nursery facilities for even a fraction of these would give rise to a very heavy capital costs and running costs and progress in this direction could be expected to be very slow in the light of the ever-growing list of competing claims for improved social services.  In short, we do not see any immediate prospects of a large-scale investment in special day-nursery care for young children, although there may be pressure for the provision of such care on purely educational grounds.  We do consider, however, that where new housing schemes are being erected, provision should be made for the building of creches or day-nurseries in the schemes and we recommended that the provision of facilities of this nature should be a condition for the grant of planning permission for such schemes where many women may have an economic necessity to take up part-time work.</P>
    <P>I would like to make the point that where a local authority builds houses of its own, it is not necessary to apply for planning <Col N="1335" /> permission.  Therefore, in this instance, we are dealing solely with the situation where builders provide schemes of houses and also the situation where it would cost nothing to the State to have that provision incorporated in the planning regulations.  In other words, to make it a condition of planning permission that creve;ches would be provided with residential development.  That would not cost the State anything in the way it is worded in this report.</P>
    <P>I would like to make the case to the Minister that not alone would it be necessary to provide creches in those residential areas but it would be equally important, perhaps more so, to provide child rearing facilities, child care facilities and creches in schemes provided by local authorities.  What I am saying is that to implement the recommendations of this report will cost the State nothing.  I am asking the Minister to go further to ensure that in housing estates completed by local authorities these creches would be provided.</P>
    <P>I referred to the section that deals with child minding facilities in the report of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights. I would like to quote the paragraph.  It is on page 30, paragraph 12.1:</P>
    <P>The need for proper child minding facilities has long been recognised by those engaged in the social services and it is not surprising that many groups, including the various teacher organisations, who made submissions, referred to the lack of these facilities. Teachers have emphasised the necessity to provide creches and the Joint Committee is convinced that if they were made available women teachers would be less likely to resign or take time off to look after their small children, and thus eliminate further obstacles to their prospects of promotion.  It is true that child care facilities are made available, mainly in the Dublin area on a limited scale, by some educational authorities, health boards and by private interests (mainly small groups of concerned parents).  Nevertheless the <Col N="1336" /> position generally is far from satisfactory and it will only be improved by the provision of community creches on a wide scale throughout the country, particularly in the larger areas of population. Apart from use by teachers community creches will be a boon to parents with school going children and younger children at home and also to mothers attending day time classes where they are available.  The Joint Committee is agreed that all future residential developments should incorporate creche facilities and that similar facilities should be provided in existing developments where it is feasible to do so.</P>
    <P>It goes on in the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee wishes to reinforce the recommendation in the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women 1972 (a report which has been accepted by all Governments since then) concerning the provision of creches.</P>
    <P>There are other reports which I could quote from but at this late hour it is not necessary.  There is a considerable section in the report of the Working Party on Child Care Facilities for Working Parents which was presented to the Minister for Labour in March 1983 which deals with the regulation and provision of child care facilities.  <i>Women's Rights in Ireland</i>, published by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, has a considerable section on child minding and pre-school facilities.</P>
    <P>I should also mention to the Minister that in the Bill which will soon come before the House, Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985, section 8 deals with the regulation of certain child care services.  I do not want to delay the House by going into all of these areas.  From the recommendations made by the various committees, it is an important matter.  It is an area which would involve no extra expense for the State.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously what is suggested in the 1972 report, 14 years after the report was presented, and issue directions that <Col N="1337" /> these recommendations should be incorporated in all planning permissions and that the provision of creche facilities should be mandatory where residential housing is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that I strongly favour the provision of facilities which can help women to live a much fuller life, avail of the further educational facilities which are available, and remain in or return to the labour force if they so desire.  I am not totally convinced, however, that the action called for in this motion is the appropriate way to tackle it.  Use of the provisions of the Planning Acts to ensure the provisions of creche or similar facilities would pose many problems even if it were possible having regard to the criteria which govern the consideration of planning applications. It would be virtually impossible for the planning authority to assess the likely demand for such facilities at planning application stage.  When a particular estate is being built, there is no way of knowing who is going to occupy the houses, whether there are likely to be young children or whether the parents would wish to avail of creche facilities in the estate.  For what size estate should the conditions be imposed?</P>
      <P>If a condition were applied in relation to all schemes, say, of 200 houses or more, builders could evade it by organising their schemes in smaller units which, in fact, are the norm.  We are all aware today that builders are tending to go into smaller schemes and develop as the demand is there.  To whom would the developer hand over the creche on completion of the estate?  Who would be responsible for the cost of staffing, equipping, running and maintenance of creche facilities?  These matters could not be dealt with in the context of a planning permission.  Liability for them could not be reasonably attached to a developer on a continuing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask ourselves also whether creche facilities should be singled out for special attention in this way.  If the <Col N="1338" /> principle of requiring an estate developer to provide a creche were to be accepted, there would be no reason why a developer should not equally be required to provide churches, schools, community halls and other facilities which might be considered to be equally important.  In practice, local planning authorities do attach conditions in appropriate cases requiring sites to be reserved for schools and other essential facilities. This could be considered by the planning authority for creches in the appropriate cases.  But a condition requiring such a facility to be provided by the developer would be unprecedented.</P>
    <P>I see the Senator's view on this.  I do not think we are miles apart on what we want.  We are all aware that often facilities are provided without thought, are not used and become white elephants. If the planning authority in their overall planning strategy were to look at the needs of particular areas they could designate in the planning application that X Y and Z should be located for various community facilities.  That is the way we could look at this.  Often it is the better way to look at it.  In the general sense, it would seem that the physical planning system, which is concerned primarily with land use, is not the appropriate vehicle for dealing with the provision of creche facilities.  Neither do I see the operation of such facilities in the housing estate generally as an appropriate function for the local authorities.  The child care area, as we are aware, is generally the responsibility of health boards and the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>As the Senator has stated, the Department of Health provided £1.5 million in 1985 to enable health boards to grant aid groups or agencies providing services which are analogous or ancillary to health services.  Grants have been made for this provision to help voluntary groups to provide day care services for pre-school children.  Where it is appropriate to do so, having regard to local circumstances, local authorities should support and encourage the provision of child care facilities, but to impose on developers an obligation to provide these <Col N="1339" /> without reference to local circumstances, existing provisions or proper assessment of needs, would be hard to justify.  There are ways of putting it in place at an early stage.  As Senators are no doubt aware in most urban areas there are already well established systems of pre-school nurseries and play groups provided by private persons and organisations.  I always believe that voluntary organisations can respond much more flexibly to the demands in an area and provide such services.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health currently has before the Dáil the legislation in relation to the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985, which includes provisions for the introduction of a system of registration for day care services such as creches. This type of control should ensure that proper standards of safety and hygiene are preserved.  In this area, planning authorities also have a function as the operation of creches on a commercial basis in existing dwellinghouses could require planning permission depending on the nature and extent of use.  In addition, the provision by private enterprise of a play group in a local authority house or flat would require the consent of the authority.  Such applications would be considered on their merits, taking into account the need for the particular facility and the effect it has on other tenants. Local authorities have powers under the Housing Act to provide facilities such as creches and day nurseries in connection with their own housing units.  I have seen them operate in various areas in Dublin where the corporation have made available units of accommodation for such activity, and it is left to the tenants and mothers to organise these units in a very effective way.  There is no doubt they play a big role in particular areas.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Women's Rights are particularly concerned with <Col N="1340" /> child minding facilities in the context of teachers stating that women teachers would be less likely to resign or take time off to look after their small children if creche facilities were available.  This would eliminate further obstacles to their prospects of promotion.  The committee were also concerned that the absence of such facilities, among other things, inhibit women from attending further educational classes.  In these areas a considerable amount could be done, without the intervention of local authorities, if the institutes and, in particular, the adult education areas provided these facilities. They are the places, in the educational sense, because mothers would be close to their children when they are attending these.  That, in my view, is a better way. It is my view and opinion and it does not take away our particular views that there is a need for some type of facility.</P>
    <P>The Planning Acts are too blunt an instrument to use and it is not the way to do it.  The way to do it is on the initial planning in laying the foundations and making the space available.  If there is a need there and a need is generated, then it should be looked at in that context.  If we do that, we would be going in the right direction.  For that reason, I would reluctantly not accept that this provision should be inserted into all planning permissions for housing estates.  It might have an inhibiting effect on development and put undue cost on housing.  Again, we may construct something which is not going to be used.  We can all point at that. I take the Senator's sincerely held view he has on this.  Most of us would agree that there is a need in various areas but to have it as a blanket condition right across all housing developments would not be a wise course of action.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 March 1986.</P>
