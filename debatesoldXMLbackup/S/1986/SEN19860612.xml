      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in that order. No. 1 is a report from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in regard to the broadcasting of the proceedings of the House.  It represents a long series of discussions and the motion is signed by a representative of each of the groups in the House.  So it represents the opinion of all the groups.</P>
      <P>In regard to No. 2, a short while before the end of business last night there was an understanding that this would not be taken today but would be taken next Tuesday.  Subsequently the Leader of the Opposition on the adjournment of the debate indicated that it should be taken this morning.  It is on the basis of what the Leader of the Opposition said at the conclusion of proceedings yesterday that I am ordering No. 2.</P>
      <P>No. 3 is the Urban Renewal Bill.  It is proposed to take only the Second Stage. No. 4 is the Garda Síochána Bill.  It is proposed to take only the Second Stage. It is hoped that No. 5 might be completed, even if this involved sitting for some short time beyond the normal closing time but the exact arrangements could be made.  We should take a one hour break sometime around lunch time at a suitable point in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the following arrangements for the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Seanad, recommended by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, be adopted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) that Radio Telefís Éireann be authorised to commence experimental broadcasting of the proceedings of the Seanad and Oireachtas Committees on a pilot basis for twelve months, provided that such broadcasting proves satisfactory throughout that period;</P>
      <P>(2) that such broadcasting be reviewed on an on-going basis by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges;</P>
      <P>(3) that such broadcasting to be in any of the following forms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) in edited form in Radio and Television News bulletins and current affairs programmes,</P>
      <P>(ii) in edited form in a &ldquo;Today in the Seanad/Oireachtas&rdquo; type programme,</P>
      <P>(iii) in edited form in a &ldquo;This week in the Committees&rdquo; type programme,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iv)  occasional live broadcasts of major debates of events in the Seanad or in Committees subject in each case to the prior approval of <Col N="581" /> the Committee on Procedure and Privileges;</P>
    <P>(4)  that recordings should not be used in programmes of light entertainment, political satire or in party political broadcasts;</P>
    <P>(5)  that copyright of the material be retained by the Houses of the Oireachtas;</P>
    <P>(6)  that Radio Telefís Éireann archive material in accordance with their usual practice;</P>
    <P>(7)  that Radio Telefís Éireann be empowered to sell the recordings to foreign broadcasting stations at an appropriate charge subject to a formal agreement between Radio Telefís Éireann and such foreign broadcasting stations that the recordings shall not be used in programmes of light entertainment, political satire or in party political broadcasts;</P>
    <P>(8)  that Radio Telefís Éireann devote a proportion of broadcast coverage to proceedings of Oireachtas Committees; and</P>
    <P>(9)  that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges monitor progress of the new arrangements and be the body to consider any complaints from Senators about material broadcast.</P>
    <P>As Senators can see, this is an all-party resolution from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in connection with the broadcasting of the proceedings of the House.  It goes back to October 1983 when we had RTE carrying out test broadcasting and test programming from the House.  Thankfully, there has been a measure of agreement all the time from all sides of the House.  We were anxious to agree as quickly as possible to the formal report that the proceedings of the House should be broadcast by RTE.  It is in that context and in the context of all-party <Col N="582" /> agreement that I have proposed the Motion.</P>

      <P>What we are proposing here is that the number of directors for each subsidiary company be increased from five to six and that two of those six nominated by the chairman of the board shall be worker directors of the main board elected under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.  This is a further refinement of the Bill to further improve the position of the workforce in the reorganised CIE structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for amendment No. 13 and for defining the number of worker directors who will be on the subsidiary boards.  I take it that the main board will have four worker directors elected to it by the workers in the industry, that is in the whole of CIE.  They will all be workers in different sections of CIE presumably, depending on the results&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is a further amendment later which clarifies beyond doubt that the electorate for the election of the four worker directors to the main board will be all the employees of the board and its subsidiary companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for clarifying that matter.  I presume it is possible to say then that the majority of the directors of Irish Rail and Irish Bus will be common to both companies.  It is possible that the two worker directors could be common to both companies elected by the chairman to the subsidiary companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Killilea was worried as to how it would be decided which two would be common to both companies. That is a matter that we could theoretically argue but in the final analysis it would be the prerogative of the chairman. The most important thing is that they would come from the elected workers to the main board and they will be common to all three &mdash; the main board, Irish Rail and Irish Bus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice what will happen is there will be four worker directors on the main board and there will be six worker director places on the subsidiary boards.  It may well be that the chairman and the worker directors would wish the same two directors to be on the provincial bus company and the rail company. It will depend on circumstances.  I am sure these things will be achieved through discussion in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get further clarification from the Minister on this.  The membership of the board has been increased from five, including the chairman, to six, including the chairman. That was the proposal in the original Bill. Now we have a change which means that the directors can be directors of each of the subsidiary companies.  There is a further complication in that a person can be a member of the main board and a member of the subsidiary board.  It is a total dilution of the powers of the main board of the holding company if directors of the main board, who are supposed to be the arbiters on policy, can equally be members of the subsidiary boards.  This does not make sense.  The main board of a holding company is supposed to be a policy-making group.  Down the line there are two subsidiary companies, the members of which are supposed to deal with the day to day business of the companies under the direction of the main board.  If there are four directors on the main board who will equally be members of each of the subsidiary boards, it will not work.  I would like the Minister to comment on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a common feature in large companies and groups of companies that there is a commonality between the main board and subsidiary boards with perhaps some new blood on the subsidiary board.  It is not unusual for members of a main board to be also members of several subsidiaries in normal commercial situations.  That is what we provide for here in the case of worker directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The four worker directors under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, are elected to the main board by the workforce in the total transport system.  They will all have an opportunity through the election process to elect four people to serve on the main board.  Out of those four people at least two must sit on Irish Bus and two must sit on Irish Rail.  The Minister's amendment provides for a commonality between Irish <Col N="585" /> Rail and Irish Bus.  We were all concerned yesterday that if there was not a commonality we could have competition which would result in unhealthy repetition or duplication.  The workers involved will be nominated by the chairman but first they must have been elected.  Otherwise it is possible that it would be necessary to have another form of election to the subsidiary boards.</P>
      <P>The trade union movement have insisted that there would be two worker directors on the subsidiary boards.  When we have agreed common membership for both companies, they will be on that also. This ensures that whatever policy is esposed by the major company will be followed through in the subsidiary companies and the workers' interests will be protected by what the Minister is suggesting and the amendment he agreed to yesterday.  This is the most desirable arrangement.  It is the only way to ensure that particular boards carry out a policy in line with the top board and have worker participation.  The Minister has conceded to this. His amendment to increase the number on the board to six allows that. The majority situation which will come in a new section will ensure that at least four of the two boards will be common. That would include the worker directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris has maybe spelt out what the Minister is thinking.  The Minister's amendment does not state anything about worker directors.  Senator Ferris has now said that agreement has been reached with the trade unions that the commonality of directors shall be worker directors.  I would ask the Minister to clarify this.  Am I to understand from Senator Ferris that these common directors will have to be worker directors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The position is very clear.  It is intended that on Irish Bus and Irish Rail there will be four directors in common out of the six.  They can be any four directors out of the six.  They may be two worker directors and two other directors or one worker director <Col N="586" /> and three other directors.  Out of the six there will be two worker directors.  What is likely to happen is that there will be the same two worker directors on Irish Bus and Irish Rail and two other directors in common.  I cannot guarantee that that is what will happen on all occasions.  It is not specifically required by what we are proposing.  What is required is commonality of four directors and also that each board of a subsidiary company has two worker directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification for Senator Lanigan, because there will have to be a commonality of four on each of the two companies and because this section states that there will be two worker directors, it will then be a matter for the chairman of CIE and the trade unions represented by the worker directors on the main board to negotiate the desirability, the speciality, the calibre of the four worker directors elected to the main board.  If they represent different unions, a discussion can take place.  The whole concept that there will be two worker directors on subsidiary boards is important and that on the board of Irish Rail and Irish Bus there will be a commonality. There will have to be four of a commonality which gives the worker directors a decided advantage.  It gives them a better chance of at least being duplicated on the two boards.  The personalities involved will be discussed between the chairman and the trade unions or the worker directors themselves. A cardinal election will have taken place to the main board which will represent all the workers in Irish Rail, Irish Bus and the Dublin City Service. That is ideal and meets all the points that were made by the Trade Union Movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get further clarification on this.  A further complication has been brought in by Senator Ferris.  The chairman will consult with the unions as to the composition of the board.  Is this correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not say that. <Col N="587" /> The Senator should be very careful about what he says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should be very careful also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the worker directors on the board.  Naturally, there will be discussions between the worker directors as to which board they want to be on; the unions will be consulted by the worker directors and the chairman of the board.  This kind of consultation goes on all the time, especially with worker directors.  Any time they go into a board meeting they have consultations with their trade unions.  Naturally, they are representing the workforce. That is their brief.  When they are elected by their colleagues they are on the top board.  There is an element of co-ordination between the Minister and the chairman of CIE that in the formulation of these boards that in accordance with the law, there will have to be two working directors.  The only way a working director can be achieved is to have one that is elected.  The only election process under this Bill is the one which elected him to the board in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want clarification from the Minister.  Is the consultation going to take place at main board level or between the chairman of the board and trade unions who are not at all involved?  If a working director is elected, he is the person who is elected and after that the trade unions have absolutely no part to play in negotiations as to where these people go.  If a director goes through the electoral process he is on the board.  Then the only consultation that can take place is which company board he sits on this should be between the individuals, the chairman and the main board.  From any reading of it they should have absolutely no consultations after that with the trade unions because, though they are elected as members of trade unions, they are no longer trade union people, they are directors of the company.  I would like to have clarification on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="588" />
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good point. They are directors of the company and they have all the responsibilities, duties, advantages and disadvantages of all the other directors of the company.  That is correct.  There is nothing in this law which says that the chairman may only nominate worker directors from among those on the main board to subsidiaries following consultations with the trade unions. The chairman will not be forced to consult the worker directors or trade unions. In practice, these things are usually worked out and any sensible person will consult and will not do things unilaterally in an area intrinsic to industrial relations when the essence of industrial relations is consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with that answer at all.  The Minister continues to suggest that once the worker directors are elected consultations can go on between the chairman of the board and the trade unions which might include the worker directors.  What the Minister said is a very dangerous principle.  Why elect workers directors if you are going to go over their heads and consult the trade unions again after these people have been elected to the board through the normal electoral process and have gone through their trade union?  Their trade union should know exactly what they are at. The Minister is bringing in a further complication. He is suggesting that there will be a separate entity in the board of CIE, that the board will be elected and having been elected they will not have the powers to do their job.  They will have to go back to the trade unions and ask them where they should put their elected members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going down an alleyway which there is no need to go down.  There is nothing in the law that says that the chairman of the board of CIE must consult with anybody except the Minister to appoint anybody.  The number that we have included will ensure that the two working directors who are appointed by the chairman in consultation with the Minister must have been <Col N="589" /> elected by the trade union movement and all the members working in the industry. Surely Senator Lanigan is not suggesting for a moment that once four worker directors are elected to serve as directors on the board and they have all the powers of board membership that they do not, in fact, on a continuous basis, have consultations with their trade union movement.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan, although an elected Member to this House and can act in any way he likes, still has consultation with his parliamentary party.  This is the whole process of democracy.  Surely it is desirable that the trade union, who help by their votes to elect worker directors on to the board should have a dialogue with them.  In this instance, I sincerely hope that there will be dialogue between them. Now that it is known by the trade unions who elected the worker directors, that there will be subsidiary companies which they will now be serving, it is only natural that there will be consultation as to which worker director will best serve the interests of Irish Rail, Irish Bus and Dublin Bus.</P>
      <P>This is a process of consultation and there is nothing wrong with it.  I shudder to think that such an important section in CIE, the actual workers, could have no dialogue either with their worker directors or indeed, if they so wished, with all the trade unions &mdash; the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Council of Trade Unions or any form which encompasses all of them &mdash; they would not be in a position to seek a meeting with the chairman of the board of CIE to make suggestions to him.  Such rights would be fundamental to the kind of democracy that we would like to espouse particularly in the trade union movement.  Their structures are fairly rigid and I know they would like to have the process of consultation. I know that anybody who does something without consulting with somebody else is a fool.  I know for a fact that the chairman of CIE is not.  He will consult if necessary and he will get consensus from his worker directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody will say: &ldquo;you serve on that <Col N="590" /> board whether you like it or not&rdquo;. Nobody could adopt such an attitude. There will be worker directors who will have a specialised interest in rail and bus, provincial or otherwise.  If one knows the worker directors like I do they represent a particular interest on the board of CIE because only in that way will all the workers ensure that at least their interests at board level are put forward.  On any board the worker directors are a minority. I would like to see the day when we could have a majority of workers involved where the overall good of the company would be for the workers.</P>
    <P>In this instance, the workers represent an important section.  They have representation under the 1977 Act initiated by Deputy Michael O'Leary when he was Minister for Labour to ensure that workers have a right to be represented on the board that controls the policy of their livelihood.  It is an extension of that that it has been agreed that on subsidiaries there will also be worker directors without the necessity for having a further set of elections to elect the worker directors on the other boards.  To comply with our agreement yesterday about commonality, the chairman of the board of CIE will draw his worker directors from the main board.  He will have four worker directors available to choose from.  That will be done by way of consultation.  We should not legislate for it to be done any other way because consultation is a process that needs a certain amount of flexibility.  There will be agreement and we should not put up obstacles in the way of people who will be given a certain freedom within the constraints of the Bill at the discretion of the chairman and the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw this out a little.  Senator Ferris inferred that I made suggestions.  This is not the case.  I am only reacting to suggestions which were made by Senator Ferris and the Minister. I am still not clear.  The Senator continues to say that consultation will take place <Col N="591" /> between the chairman and the trade unions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to give me a reply.  Once the main board of CIE are elected is it within that board that decisions will be made as to where people will sit or as to who sits on the subsidiary companies?  After worker directors have been elected will the chairman go over their heads and start talking to the trade union movement to decide where these people should sit?  This is exactly what Senator Ferris is inferring. I sincerely hope that he is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is we can only speculate on what this future chairman might do.  I speculate that any wise chairman would have all the necessary consultations.  It is important to highlight the fact here that it is the chairman of the board who nominates the subsidiary boards.  It is not the Minister.  I deliberately divested myself of that power and have given it to the chairman.  He is the man we are appointing to run the group of companies.  He is the man we hold responsible if the group of companies are not a success.  He is the man we penalise if they are a failure.  He is the one who is nominating the board of directors. Obviously he will consult his fellow directors. He may feel there is a necessity to have wider consultation.  That is a matter for him.  I can only speculate.  Senator Lanigan and Senator Ferris can have their views as to what they would do in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting that there can be a dilution of the powers of directors.  The situation, according to the Minister, can be that the worker directors go through the process of being elected to the board, that the chairman might not be satisfied with the calibre of these worker directors and, therefore, will go into consultation with other persons to decide if this worker director or that worker director is qualified to sit on one of the boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the worker directors will not be full members of the board and that the chairman cannot override their wishes or the good of the company by going outside the board of directors to get suggestions as to which board certain directors should sit on?  This is what he is inferring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speculating that a chairman may wish to have wide consultation. I do not think this House, nor do I think Senator Lanigan would wish to hamstring any chairman in having whatever consultations he felt were appropriate. There are four worker directors elected by the workforce of CIE.  In future they will be elected by the entire workforce of the CIE group set up by this Bill.  Inevitably, some of those directors will represent different unions and different interests within the group and some of them will be more interested in sitting on one subsidiary board rather than another.  Perhaps there might be three worker directors wanting to sit on the same board whereas there are only two places.  From my own experience of industrial relations &mdash; although one scarcely needs any knowledge of industrial relations to appreciate it, that is the sort of circumstances which would prompt consultation as between the interests involved.  That is basic common sense.</P>

      <P>Will this basic consultation take place between the directors of the company or will it take place with persons outside the board of directors? The Minister is suggesting that, in a situation where there are the four directors from the same union, because they are representing the same body of workers in CIE, you have to go outside that body of opinion to get a proper balance on the directors of the subsidiary companies.  I want the Minister to tell me once the main board is elected will the chairman and the main board make decisions as to who sits on the various companies or will there be another element which will tell <Col N="593" /> the chairman not to put X director on X company or not to put Y director on Y company?</P>

      <P>The directors of the main board have no role in this.  It is the chairman of the board.  A wise chairman will consult his directors and will consult the unions as necessary.  I hope Senator Lanigan is not suggesting that there should not be consultation with the board of directors or the trade union representatives if the chairman should think it necessary.  We can only speculate and as it is not in the Bill, it seems prudent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want this tied down. The Minister is suggesting that he has a board selected and part of the board will be elected.  The only people who will be elected will be the worker directors.  He is now suggesting that, the election having taken place, the chairman will be able to consult outside interests as to which of the worker directors should sit on subsidiary companies.  That is what the Minister is suggesting.  I would like him to get up and say: &ldquo;no, the worker directors who are elected by the CIE workers will have a choice of which company they sit on&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I wanted the Minister to say because that is exactly what the argument has been about.  The Minister is now saying that these worker directors will not have a choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment to this board will be by the chairman.  I will read another subsection afterwards which deals with another point raised by the Minister.  The appointment to these subsidiary boards will be made by the chairman.  The worker directors he will appoint will already have been elected and will be on the main board.  The Minister is not suggesting to the chairman of CIE that he has to do anything in that process.  Neither am I.  We know that in <Col N="594" /> that process he will not just point fingers at people, and say: &ldquo;You do this, you do that&rdquo;.  He will talk to people, he will consult with them.</P>
      <P>They, in turn, may want to consult with the people they represent to know how they can represent the best interests of the people that elected them, should it be on Irish Rail, Irish Bus, or both or should it be just one worker director who might be elected in the interests of the Dublin services alone and may have no interest in the other two boards.  He would say to the chairman in this process of consultation: &ldquo;now, chairman, you know that I was elected basically by the people in Dublin, my interests are theirs&rdquo;.  There is nothing in the Bill to say that he must not do it.  It is discretionary. As the Minister said, any sensible chairman will avail of all the discretion he has available to him to appoint his subsidiary boards.  The reason I mentioned the Minister is that in subsection (b) it says:</P>
      <P>The chairman and other directors shall be appointed and may be removed from office by the Chairman of the Board with the consent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I read that as it is written.  From what the Minister has said now the chairman and other directors shall be appointed.  They may only be removed from the board by the chairman with the consent of the Minister.  Are they separate?  There will be an element of consultation with the Minister in the appointment by the chairman of the subsidiary boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Or any removal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was making.  I know the Minister will not be appointing them, the chairman will.  The chairman naturally is here.  He will be doing it with the Minister's consent so there will an element of discussion with the Minister on the people he is putting on to the subsidiary boards.  The Oireachtas in legislating would be losing its control of subsidiary boards, the kind of people who would be on them or the interests they would represent if there <Col N="595" /> was not some process of consent or consultation. I know of no other legislation that has been enacted by this House or the other House that did not involve some ministerial consent or approval.</P>
      <P>We must have the final say.  We pay the piper, and no doubt, we call the tune at times.  This is a very liberal way of doing it.  I am glad the Minister is divesting himself of all the political implications that could go on in those situations.  The chairman of the board is being given a lot of discretion but in the area of worker directors he will be confined to four people.  In that process he will do the best he can to represent them all and have the various interests represented on the boards, taking into account the function of the boards and their policy formulation.</P>
      <P>They will be formulating policy and will be carrying out the policy formulation through a management structure which the Minister wants.  They will be getting all that, so naturally the chairman of the board will ensure that the worker directors will have a specialised interest in those areas.  It is certainly something that the trade unions were looking for.  They were looking for proper representation. That is their right, not just a lobby, but with an interest in promoting CIE into something more than what we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers have an interest in being involved in a new dynamic role for the main company and the subsidiary companies. The workers want to be part of that.  The whole principle of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act 1977, reflected that.  This is the follow through.  Now, because we are moving from the main board down to subsidiary boards, with executive roles, the worker directors want to be in there, too.  I am defending their right to be there.  This ensures they will be there.  It is a good day for the workers and the industry to be able to be involved in their own industry, in what they are working in, in what they have a commitment to.  The chairman of the board will consult with anybody who needs to reflect that interest. There is nothing wrong with it.  This <Col N="596" /> does not say he must or he must not.  We all know he will.  Senator Lanigan is not suggesting, because he is a democrat as well, that he should not consult with people if he wants to.  He might even consult with the Senator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>You never know. Another set of irrelevancies has been brought by Senator Ferris into this argument. My main point here is to ensure that the worker directors have as much power as is necessary.  Since the Senator brought in this question of non-political involvement, the section says that the chairman shall be appointed and can be removed by the Minister.  Therefore, the Minister has a direct involvement in the appointment of the chairman.  If the chairman is not acting according to the Minister's plan, he can be removed by the Minister.  Therefore the powers of the main board can be politicised because in no section of this Bill is there any power, other than the Minister's power, to appoint the chairman.  If the chairman is a political appointee, the membership of the boards can be politicised, because if the chairman does not go along with the Minister's wishes, he can be removed. Therefore, the chairman has not got the powers of consultation that Senator Ferris mentioned.  He is a political appointee, but he can also be removed by the Minister.  If the situation arises when the chairman might appoint board members to subsidiary companies and the Minister does not like the decisions being made, the Minister can remove the chairman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way it is at the moment.  The Minister can remove the chairman or director of any company for which he is responsible, if it is in the public interest to do so.  It is not something that any Minister would do lightly.  It is not something that a Minister would do and hope to escape the inquiries of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is very desirable that the Minister, as the representative of the Houses of the Oireachtas, should have that power, should the public interest demand it.  It is only a normal provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, this boils down to the fact that the chairman can appoint his own board of directors to the subsidiary companies.  There will not be consultation with the trade unions on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be it is a diminution of the powers of the worker directors.  It is going away from the democratic process by which they were elected.  The Senator is suggesting that if the worker directors do not suit the chairman can then go out and consult with the trade unions again as to which area these people should represent.  That is going away from the situation we all want, where workers will have the say on the boards of the companies in which they work but if, having got a say through the democratic process, the chairman can go back and consult with other people as to where these people should sit on companies, that is definitely a dilution of their powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister also ensure that the chairman of the board is aware of my views?  I think it is desirable that there be consultation.  Senator Lanigan specifically put on the record of the House that there should not be consultation with anybody.  I am saying that the chairman of the board should have the freedom to consult with anybody he wishes.  The point I was making, which Senator Lanigan has forgotten, was that the worker directors will have consultations with the trade unions who elected them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with that because they were elected originally to the top board.  There is nothing to stop anybody else having consultation. The Senator can have consultation with <Col N="598" /> the chairman of the board of CIE, and say: &ldquo;there is a particular worker director that I have an interest in, he would be excellent on two boards&rdquo;.  There is nothing wrong with that if you want to talk to the chairman of the board of CIE.  We should not legislate for him to say: &ldquo;I am sorry Senator Lanigan I cannot talk to you because you said in the House I should not have consultations with anybody&rdquo;. I am saying he should have the freedom to do whatever he wishes in the common interests and the common good in this instance.</P>
      <P>I know the calibre of the man who is there now and I know that is the kind of process he will have.  I welcome that initiative.  He has proved, since he went into CIE that he has turned the company around and done things that are welcomed by all of us and have been itemised by the Minister.  I know it can be painful for the Senator's side of the House, if we repeat that there have been improvements and that the Minister has done things.  I know politically that can be painful. In this instance we are not legislating to prohibit him from talking to anybody, we are not prohibiting the worker directors from consulting with anybody, if the chairman is to consult with anybody else why not?  This Bill does not say that he should not.  It does not say that he should either.  I am saying he will have four directors available to him and those four directors will in some way represent interests on the other boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of consultation to achieve that will go on whether the Senator or I know of it or approve of it.  Our approval is not required.  No worker director need serve on a board to which he feels he has nothing to contribute.  Would he not be a foolish man to just accept a nomination on to a board in which he did not have an interest or in which that interest in some way might be contrary to the interests of the people who elected him, because he might be elected for Dublin only by Dublin people, who might not have an interest in provincial rail.  No director will say: &ldquo;I will take it because you told me I have to sit on the board.&rdquo; There will be a process.  The worker <Col N="599" /> director will say that he has a special interest.  There would not be a refusal but there would be a consultation in the matter of acceptance.</P>
    <P>When the chairman of the board of CIE nominates the directors they go to the Minister in a consultative process for his formal approval.  That is the same in many boards.  Various interests around the country nominate their people to a Minister and the Minister appoints them. I see nothing wrong with it.  Any consultations that are necessary regarding the membership of the subsidiary boards, will go on.  We should not tie the hands of anybody in that process.  I know the Senator does not want to do it that way. Maybe I am not making myself very clear.  I know from the Senators' interests and his consultations with the workers and the people he knows in his area, that he welcomes the development of worker participation and their involvement. Possibly there is some breakdown in the communications between us.  I am happy that what we are doing will reflect what I feel we want to have reflected on these subsidiary boards.</P>

      <P>It is required here that two of the six of each subsidiary company shall be appointed to the subsidiary board.  It occurs to me that the situation could arise that all four worker directors could refuse to serve on a particular board because they want to be on another board.  It is highly unlikely.  It is certainly something that we should provide for on Report Stage in the most unlikely eventuality that the chairman was not able to get two of the four worker directors to serve on a particular subsidiary &mdash; although if they refuse to act there would be vacanies.

      <P>Considering that the Trade Union Movement are anxious for worker participation at this level it can be presumed by all of us that the whole Trade Union Movement in the election of worker directors would require them to sit on the subsidiary board.  Their peers will require them to do so.  This Bill provides that they shall be on it.  In all the other circumstances vacancies would be created for worker directors and an election would take place to elect people who would be prepared to sit on any board. That is why I think the chairman of the board should have certain freedom for consultation and discussion.  I do not want to dilute this section.  It says &ldquo;there shall be two worker directors&rdquo; and there are already worker directors elected to the main board.  That is the only source of worker directors that the chairman of the board has available to him.  If we are saying &ldquo;there shall be&rdquo; that puts a certain onus on the worker directors to serve. The company in which they would best serve the interests is a matter for discussion, negotiation and agreement.</P>

The Taoiseach could nominate somebody as a Member so that terminology there is &ldquo;nominated as a Member&rdquo;, not &ldquo;nominated to contest the election&rdquo; as it was in previous legislation which was discriminatory because one could, in fact, be nominated to contest the Seanad election without one's knowledge.  Somebody could do it vindictively to remove a person from a board.  That was the reality of it.  We have been changing legislation and we are affirming person's rights to contest elections in a democratic way but it is only on their election that they then forfeit the right to serve as a director. That should not apply to workers in an industry.  It does not apply to any worker. Workers whether they are teachers or train drivers or otherwise who are elected to this House are either seconded from there jobs or in the case of Post Office workers lose their jobs.  Directors are different because directors would now be their own bosses if you did not have this provision.  We could have a director who would also be a Member of the House. He could dominate a situation; he could influence the Minister about selection of all the other directors.  It is an important new section.  It takes into account the situation of Members of this House who in the process of nomination to contest would not be included at all and would not be discriminated against but if they were nominated by the Taoiseach as Members would naturally on becoming Members forfeit their directorships.  That is appropriate.</P>

      <P>I can see that anybody who is elected to this House or nominated to this House could be allowed to continue in whatever job he has because this <Col N="606" /> House is not supposed to be a full-time House.  When I say &ldquo;not supposed to be,&rdquo; it is a full-time House but we do not get full-time salary.  I cannot see that a director of CIE, who would have an interest in the operation of CIE, should be precluded from being a member of the board just because he is elected or nominated to this House.  Although Senator Ferris said that you could have a director dealing with his own affairs and he could have an influence in this House which might be against the interests of the board, surely it would be of advantage to the board and to this House to have a director of CIE sitting in this House.  I can see the point that workers are seconded from employment just as teachers are seconded at present but I cannot see why somebody in a business situation who is selected as a director of CIE automatically loses the seat on the board just because he is elected or nominated to this House.  I would like the Minister to give me the rationale behind that sort of thinking.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly there is some point in what Senator Lanigan says. Very often we politicians, perhaps in our disunity and anxiety to score points off each other close off areas to ourselves in a way which may not be totally justified. The counterpoint here is that Members of either House of the Oireachtas, involved in approving expenditure for State companies and approving policy changes, if also directors of those companies would not be as detached as they should be. That is the basic rationale.</P>

      <P>Apart from a major company it applies to the smallest semi-State organisation, An Foras Talúntais, the board of ACOT, anything that involves the State and in which a Member of the House is concerned with the allocation of money.  There would be an element of &mdash; to say the least &mdash; some form of vested interest and it would be incompatible with my understanding of what the position should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of worker participation is very important but we here have certain statutory roles and functions for the allocation <Col N="607" /> of public expenditure and if we could influence the allocation of that into a company of which we were also directors there is an element of incompatibility about it.  It has never been accepted by anybody since the foundation of the State that there could be such a dual role. Maybe we should look at it.  As I see it at the moment, it would be unacceptable. I wanted to make sure there was no discrimination in legislation.  The process of nomination to contest would discriminate and that up to recently was the position. The Minister for Health was the first Minister who changed it in legislation.  It was beginning to come through from the Parliamentary Draftsman's office on a regular basis that even being nominated to contest election meant you automatically lost your post.  If you were not elected, then you probably had no opportunity to get back.  People with a political background should not be precluded from serving on boards; they can make a useful contribution.  Once they are elected that political activity should cease; they cannot hold a dual position. I would not mind having a discussion about it with Senator Lanigan.  As of now, it is what we have always looked for; it is always done and it is done at every level in the public service and the Houses of the Oireachtas particularly.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 11 to 13, to delete subsection (5), and substitute new subsections as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) Save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union concerned, every person who, immediately before the vesting day, is an officer or servant of the Board shall not, while in the service of the Board or a company, as <Col N="608" /> the case may be, receive a lesser scale of pay or be brought to less beneficial conditions of service than the scale of pay to which he was entitled and the conditions of service to which he was subject immediately before the vesting day.</P>
    <P>(6) Until such time as the scales of pay and conditions of service of such officers or servants are varied by the Board or a company, as the case may be, following consultation and after agreement with recognised trade unions, the scales of pay to which they were entitled and the conditions of service, restrictions, requirements and obligations to which they were subject immediately before the vesting day shall continue to apply to them and may be exercised or imposed by the Board or the chief executive of the Board or by the Board or chief executive of the relevant company, as the case may be, while they are in its service. As provided in subsection (5) no such variation shall operate to worsen the scales of pay and conditions of service applicable to such persons immediately before the vesting day, save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union concerned.</P>
    <P>(7) If any of the companies is wound up, the functions of the company shall be exercised by the Board, and the Board shall accept into its employment without interruption of service all officers and servants employed by the company in consequence of subsection (4).  Such officers and servants shall resume their employment with the Board on the same conditions of service as applied before the vesting day unless otherwise provided for in a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union concerned.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There are three parts to this amendment &mdash; as can be seen. The first two parts are substantially taken from the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act which was the last major public sector reorganisation with which <Col N="609" /> this House dealt and spell out and reiterate the fact that the security and conditions of employment of workers now working in CIE when the company becomes reorganised into three companies are not one whit reduced.</P>
      <P>The third section, the proposed subsection (7) was discussed yesterday with an earlier amendment concerning the winding-up of the company.  This provides that the functions of a company and those employed in the company who were employed on vesting day shall revert to the board should the company close down for any reason whatsoever.  It is a guarantee that the security of tenure is in no way affected by this change.  That is the underlying principle of all the changes here; the wool is not going to be pulled over anybody's eyes.  There is no diminution of the security of tenure.  If there is to be any discussion regarding redundancies or rationalisation or changes in the future that will have to be done in consultation with the trade unions, as is the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure exactly what this means.  Yesterday we were assured by the Minister that there would be no closure of any element of CIE. While I welcome the guarantees being given to employees, nevertheless, there is an inherent recognition in this particular subsection that there is a possibility, remote or otherwise, that elements of the company could be wound up.  The Minister is now giving a guarantee which he did not give to people working in other semi-State companies that in the eventuality of a wind-up of either one or other or all of the companies a continuation of employment will ensue at rates of remuneration which will not be less than those that they had on the wind-up.  I would like the Minister to explain how that could work.  If a company is wound up &mdash; say it is the rail section &mdash; there is a guarantee now being given by the Minister that the workers involved in the wound-up sitiution will be given jobs at the same remuneration or that they will not be given jobs but will continue at the <Col N="610" /> same rate of remuneration as they had before the wind-up of the company.  How will that work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are saying is, if for any reason whatsoever one of these companies should be wound up &mdash; and I have to reiterate that this is a most unlikely eventuality but because there is a possibility, however slight &mdash; we are making provision that not only will the employment of those who are transferred from the group on vesting day, to the company, be restored under the board without any break in continuity but also that the functions of the company will revert to the board.  So the functions will continue and the employment will continue as if the vesting had never taken place.  Just as now, if this Bill never came before the House, if CIE have a programme of rationalisation as they have had in the past, they discuss it and come to an agreement with their trade unions.  That is what we are providing, that the company should do likewise, whereas in the event of any closure that cannot happen unless there is a collective agreement with the trade unions to deal with it.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable provision.  At the moment CIE, being a statutory corporation, cannot be liquidated because the provisions of the Companies Act do not apply to them.  That gives a certain security against liquidation to the corporation and their employees.  But because we were keen to get the company format for the subsidiaries, as it gives greater flexibility in terms of the aims and objectives of the company and changing those aims and objectives to suit prudent developments, we acknowledged that the company format would have greater risks unless we provided (a) that the shares cannot be sold and (b) that the employment is secure and the services are secure.  That is what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Senator Lanigan appreciates the importance of the amendment to this section.  I thank the Minister for the long process of negotiation, discussion and legal opinion and so on <Col N="611" /> involved in this.  It is vital to the workers in CIE that because we want to set up a company format there should be adequate protection.  If it was set up in the normal way like any other company, employees would have the benefit of the Employers and Employees Insolvency Fund to fall back on &mdash; the Government legislated for that retrospectively to October 1983 &mdash; and they would have had protection for all their legal rights on the day their company went bankrupt. This is a company format but, because it is a statutory company, because it is associated with a semi-State company in the event of these subsidiary companies not being able to carry out the directive of the main board and falling down in some way and feeling that it should liquidate, all the assets and employees revert to the main board to continue the service.  If management structure at that level of a subsidiary statutory company are unable to do the job, we feel they can do &mdash; and I would be surprised if they could not because they need this kind of freedom to do it and this Bill will give them the freedom they need and the dynamic role we want them to have &mdash; if something extraordinary happened and they did not do it, if the price of diesel went sky high and they had to decide they could not provide a service and went bankrupt as a subsidiary company of the main board, then all that would pass back to the main board who would then hand the responsibility back to the Houses of the Oireachtas with the allocation we would give and the one-third fraction for the social service, all these things would be taken into account.  Most important, it gives some rights to the workers: they are not going to be thrown on to the unemployment register as they know can happen with a company.  It is happening in the private sector regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this instance, after a lot of discussions and legal opinions and so on this ministerial amendment meets the criteria that all of us with an interest in the workforce have.  Whatever reassurances we can give them by way of legislation are enshrined in this.  A lot of hard work went <Col N="612" /> into this amendment.  I commend the Minister for bringing it in.  It sounds complicated but the consensus behind it is that those involved in CIE, the workers and their trade unions, will have this process of negotiation and consultation that we all wish for.  We feel it is important that the trade union movement, a very important movement, should have the rights and powers we are giving them and also the workers involved should have security of tenure in their employment.  I see nothing wrong with that.  It is very important because we are dealing with many employees.  Senator Killilea talked about 20,000; I think it is more like 14,000 to 15,000 following the rationalisation programme.  It is important for their peace of mind that they have some fallback and that they know we did not forget them in this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see the crocodile tears being shed by Senator Ferris for the workers who might be made redundant or put on the scrap heap when, as it seems to me, there there is a possibility in his mind that one of these companies will be wound up and in that eventuality the workers will be paid for doing nothing, which is basically what is stated here.  I agree with every protection being given to workers, but there is inherent in this section a factor which does not preclude the winding up of a particular company within the CIE group and the workers being maintained in their employment at the same level of remuneration. I am wondering how they can have the same prospect of progressing throughout the company they would have if the company kept going.  I am sorry the people in Irish Shipping did not have the same protection that is suggested here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at issue is that there is inherent in this subsection an acknowledgement that there is every possibility of one of the companies being wound up and in that instance the workers will be absorbed and will have the same promotion prospects they would have if the company did not break up. How could this work from a practical point of view?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Effectively, the net effect of this subsection of the amendment will be almost certainly to see to it that no company would be wound up. That is the desired effect.  We cannot absolutely and totally guarantee against a company being wound up but we are going as far as we can to ensure that.  If a company does wind up, the functions and the employees to which subsection (4) refers revert back to the board.</P>
      <P>Elsewhere in the Bill there is provision that people can transfer from one company to another or from the board to the company or the company to the board and be promoted across companies etc. so that there is a coherent workforce for the entire group.  The next amendment will make clear that that is one group for the purposes of election to the board. One can see the common strand throughout the Bill that we are not changing one whit the security of employment or the cohesion of the group.  We are trying to get the organisation forming the group to maximise its possibilities for success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not shedding crocodile tears at all; I am being absolutely positive.  Drafted in consultation with the workers, in consultation with the trade union movement, this is a positive section in the Bill and in spite of any doubts the Senator might have about it, this ensures that in any eventuality they will be protected. If we did not have that section, we would have negative legislation. Nowadays people are competent enough to know that in legislation you try to legislate for every eventuality.  That does <Col N="614" /> not mean that it will happen.  There must be an element of assurance in legislation that, even if the unforeseen happens, we will have taken care of it.  This section takes care of people's rights.  In all other legislation in private company law we have initiated legislation that protects the worker before anybody else, before the claim of the Revenue Commissioners, Fóir Teoranta or anybody else.  It is about time we had this attitude to people who give their lives in the service of their company or in this case, Córas Iompair Éireann.  It is important to recognise that the overall employer is the main board to which the workers have been elected.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to deal with Irish Shipping. If the board of Irish Shipping carried out their business correctly, and this Government did not appoint the board, the workers would not be in the dilemma they are in.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now guaranteeing that, irrespective of what happens in the structure of CIE, if the subsidiary companies become insolvent, if for any reason in the future they go out of business, the State will continue to take up the tab for the former workers at the rates of remuneration at the date of the insolvency or the breaking up of the companies.  The State will continue to pay the salaries and will continue to provide for them in the same manner as if they were employed by the company.</P>

      <P>They will not be former employees.  They will remain as employees.  The board will retain the functions the company was discharging. It is not a case of paying people for doing nothing.  They will be doing the same work as previously.  The only difference is that the functions would revert to the board.  The people employed on vesting day have exactly the same security of tenure as they have now.</P>

      <P>The Senator did say that because we are including it we are almost saying that one of these companies are going to go wrong.  That is negative thinking. We on this side of the House must be positive.  We are positive about this being an important section.  There is nothing wrong with giving reassurance to people that their existing rights are not compromised in any way by legislation on a vesting day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a fundamental right of anybody. If it were not included here, they would probably have the right to go to the Labour Court or to a civil court on the grounds of our removing something they already enjoyed.  This was also done in the transfer of interest in Bord Telecom and An Post.  It was done by way of amendment to the original legislation.  A process of discussions and negotiations is carried out, particularly involving the workers.  I do not owe an apology to Senator Lanigan for doing it in this way. Certainly, it meets the requirements, as we see them and, as a minimum the <Col N="616" /> people are entitled to their existing rights. In the event of anything going wrong with one of the subsidiary companies, they revert back to the original board continuing their rights.  If that board eventually want to do something different, it can only be done in consultation with the trade union as is the normal practice.</P>

Can protection be given, not alone to CIE employees, but to workers in other industries, who want to invest their savings?  The CIE employees felt they were investing in a company which was a subsidiary of or, at least part of, the establishment of CIE. Can the Minister give CIE employees an assurance that in future, if there is such an investment society which has <i>de facto</i> the agreement of the company because the funds were transferred directly from their wages or salaries to the savings or investment company that protection will be given to employees in the future to prevent recurrences.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I want to raise <Col N="618" /> concerns the power to transfer property from the main board to the subsidiary board.  I am thinking in terms of Limerick Junction.  The whole village of Limerick Junction was a G S Railway village originally and now it is a CIE village.  Most, if not all of the houses, were CIE houses. Extraordinarily enough, the actual roadway going down to Limerick Junction Railway Station from the main Limerick Waterford road was also CIE property. Of course, with the passage of time much of the property by way of houses which belonged to the original workforce has been disposed of by CIE to the workforce in an ordinary common sale situation. Unfortunately, the road went into such disrepair that the County Council of South Tipperary made representations to CIE to take publicly in charge the roadway leading down through the housing estate to the station.  It is only in the past couple of years that it has become a public road in the local authority terminology of a public road.  The council are now responsible for the maintenance of the road surface and the footpaths.  That is as it should be.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are patches of wasteland on that roadway.  Across the road from the housing estate, the local tenants would like Córas Iompair Éireann to consider the transfer to them of the wasteland so that it could be planted and enhanced by local community effort.  In this environmental week, I should like if Córas Iompair Éireann would consider divesting themselves of land they cannot have any use for.  It is outside their boundary wall, so to speak, and is siding on to the public road.  If this piece of wasteland was transferred into public ownership, to the council, my next move is with the county council, to acquire it from them back to the community or, at least, give the community permission to beautify the entrance to Limerick Junction, which is, to say the least, pretty stark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Limerick Junction is a difficultly constructed main important rail junction. The owners of property made many attempts to improve their property and the old railway cottages.  They are beginning to improve the property but where <Col N="619" /> it is situated on that rail artery it is difficult to make it as presentable as in the case of other stations which are situated and designed differently.  If we could transfer the ownership of that land to a local community residents' association who would maintain it and beautify it, it would be a step in the right direction.  This is the only section that I can see on which I have an opportunity to ask such a question.</P>

      <P>I can assure Senator Ferris that I will take up the question with the Chairman of CIE, whom I will ask to communicate directly with him. The section itself just provides for the transfer of lands and properties from the board to the company unless the board decides specifically without having to go through Land Registry and all sorts of fees, charges and stamp duty.  It is in ease of the company.</P>

      <P>That was not the point I was raising.  Could the Minister confer with the chairman of the board about the worries that workers have about direct debits from their salaries and wages to pay into what the workers considered to be very valuable entities, as was the case in regard to the Tontine Society.  Unfortunately, there is no protection for them if the societies into which their funds are going are not made secure.  There was a case recently where workers were involved in a savings situation in a private company.  The company went bankrupt and the savings of the workers went as well.  There is a worry where arrangements are entered into.  Protection should be given to them at all times and no deductions should be made unless the board had full knowledge of the operation of the group concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly pass on to the chairman the points made by Senator Lanigan.  I suppose in all cases where money is handled it is a question of confidence.  That is so in the case of the banking world.  If workers have not got confidence that the money being stopped from their wage packages is going where they want, they can (a) act <Col N="620" /> individually to cease the stoppages or (b) have the unions take them up.  It is less of a problem in a company like CIE which is a statutory corporation with all the backing of statute <i>et cetera</i> compared to private companies.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>20.  In page 9, before section 21, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;21.  &mdash;(1) Where at a meeting of the directors of a company any of the following matters arises, namely&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an arrangement to which the company is a party or a proposed such arrangement, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a contract or other agreement with the company or a proposed such contract or other agreement,</P>
      <P>then any director of the company present at the meeting who otherwise than in his capacity as such a director is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in the matter shall at the meeting disclose to the company the fact of such interest and the nature thereof and shall not vote on a decision relating to the matter and, where an interest is disclosed pursuant to this section, the disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting concerned and, for so long as the matter to which the disclosure relates is being dealt with by the meeting, the director by whom the disclosure is made shall not be counted in the quorum for the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Where at a meeting of the directors of a company a question arises as to whether or not a course of conduct, if pursued by a director of the company, would be a failure by him to <Col N="621" /> comply with the requirements of subsection (1), the question may be determined by the chairman of the meeting whose decision shall be final and where such a question is so determined particulars of the determination shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.</P>
    <P>(3)  Section 194 of the Companies Act, 1963, shall not apply to a director of a company.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very long section.  Perhaps the best thing I can do is to give Senator Lanigan a copy of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first paragraph of section 194 it states</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of a director of a company who is in any way, whether directly or indirectly interested in a contract or proposed contract with the company to declare the nature of his interest...&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why have that section deleted from section 21 and introduce another section that they have to disclose their interest? <Col N="622" /> It would appear that section 194 declares that they have to disclose their interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This formulation deals more precisely with the situation of a State company particularly where there are directors who are not owners.  They are worker directors and other nominated directors.  It is felt that this formulation is better in this context.  There is a difference between this section and section 194 of the Companies Act.  The main areas of difference are (a) the extent to the interest which must be disclosed; (b) the limitations imposed on directors' participation at meetings which discuss the contracts etc. involved; (c) the penalisation or failure to comply with the statutory requirements; (d) the power of the chairman to settle any questions which arise concerning a director's obligations in this regard.  In relation to the extent of interest, this section requires a director to disclose the nature of any interest he may have in any arrangement, agreement or contract.  Whereas the disclosure requirement in section 194 of the Companies Act extends only to contracts in which the director has an interest.</P>
      <P>With regard to limitation and participation at meeting, under this section a director may not vote, take part in discussions or be counted in the quorum present at a meeting while the matter to which the disclosure relates is under discussion. There is no such provision in section 194.</P>
      <P>With regard to penalisation at failure to disclose interests, the 1963 Act, section 194, provides for penalisation of failures to meet the requirements in regard to disclosure of interest.  A similar provision is not included in this section as the chairman is being empowered to determine what must be disclosed.  On the question of the power of the chairman, under this section if a question arises whether a course of action if pursued by a director would be in breach of the section, the chairman may decide the issue.  The 1963 Act does not convey such power on the chairman.</P>

      <P>There is a penalty, though a very minor one, in section 194 but there is no penalty from what I can see in the present section.  Therefore, if he does not disclose interest, there is no penalty other than possibly removal from the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>How does this section affect worker directors?  Obviously, worker directors would have a certain interest, particularly if a board was making a decision about a major rationalisation programme or something else that would directly involve the workers' interests. Worker directors by their very nature have a vested interest in their employment and the employment of their colleagues.  What would happen at a board meeting?  Would a worker director be precluded from voting in a particular situation which would affect the interests of the people he represents?  I know that under the Companies Act we are talking specifically about financial vested interest as opposed to a worker director who has only the common good and the common interest of his own colleagues at heart. Would he be precluded from making a contribution at the board?  Would he be precluded from voting at the board?  Why I raise the matter in this context is that we had problems with worker directors on the board of Comhlucht Siúcre Éireann Teo when decisions were being made in connection with closure over a short period of the sugar factories in Tuam and Thurles.  In consultation with one of the worker directors, he was precluded from making a contribution on the subject of the closure because he was considered to have a vested interest.  It would be a diminution of all that we understand to be the powers of workers' directors.  They should be full board members.  Their disclosure of interest is known on the day of their election.  Their only interest is to represent their colleagues in the trade <Col N="624" /> union movement who elected them and they are the only directors actually elected.  So the process of their election is a disclosure of their interest so to speak. When they go in and sit down on the board, I should not like to feel that they would be precluded in any way from participating, being part of the quorum of voting.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on that?</P>

      <P>No, I want to assure the Senator that this section is an exact repeat of a section in the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act.  This only deals with people who have a personal vested interest, not a representative interest, as Senator Ferris mentioned. This section already relates to CIE itself because it is provided for in the 1977 Act. We are now extending the provisions to include the companies set up under this Bill.</P>

    <P>I was delighted to hear that the various amendments tabled in the name of the Minister have been approved by the House so far.  I welcome the principle behind this amendment.  It is one of the ones the Minister and I discussed, I think, during our discussions over the last few weeks.  I am aware that it is a replica of the provision in the Post and Telecommunications Act.  One matter has arisen which, perhaps, we could seek clarification on between now and Report Stage and it is one which has a broader implication than simply in relation to this particular section.  I understand from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that they <Col N="625" /> are a bit concerned about the provision in (b), a contract or &ldquo;other agreement&rdquo;. They are not concerned about it solely in relation to this Bill but because this provision is replicated in other legislation, they are seeking legal advice as to whether the phrase &ldquo;other agreements&rdquo; there in (b) might have implications for worker directors' ability to report back to their relevant constituent bodies either the Irish Congress of Trade Unions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Disclosure of certain interests&rdquo;: Is that not the one?  It is a question of the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;other agreement&rdquo; which is not particular to this Bill, it is a whole set of legislation, whether it might in any way have implications for the ability of worker directors, with discretion, to consult with their relevant bodies, whether the Congress or the workforce on the basis of discretion and so on.  It is a matter that is of general interest to the trade unions and it is one that I raise now in the hope that we might have some clarification either now or on Report Stage.</P>

      <Col N="626" /> Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 21:</P>
    <P>In page 9, before section 21 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>22. &mdash;(1)  A person shall not disclose confidential information obtained by him while performing duties as a member of the Board or director of a company or a member of the staff of, or an adviser or consultant to, the Board or a company unless he is duly authorised to do so.</P>
    <P>(2) A person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is borrowed almost exactly from the Post and Telecommunications Services Act.  It provides for the prohibition of unauthorised disclosure of information by people in the companies set up by the Bill.  It is a protection if people who are on the boards or in the employment of the boards do not disclose confidential information which would be unauthorised or inimical to the interest of the company or the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has worried the trade union movement especially regarding the position of worker directors on boards.  The Minister should realise that, in the normal process trade <Col N="627" /> unions are privy to certain confidential information in discussions with companies, whether semi-State or private companies.  They are at times privy to confidential information which could influence the course of a wage negotiation, for example.  A company could, and does, disclose confidentially to the trade union certain information about the capabilities or otherwise of the company. We could tell them that it is to be confidential.</P>
      <P>Here you have a worker director whose interests are known the moment he contests and is elected.  If he wanted to consult with the members of the unit which elected him, on a fundamental matter which would be coming before the board &mdash; in the knowledge that they would be expecting him to do a particular thing as their representative on the board, or to be putting their view &mdash; a difficulty could arise if he was precluded from consulting with them.  In that process he may be disclosing what the board might consider confidential, but what he as a worker director might consider to be valuable information which, of course, would not be made public.  He might want to discuss a particular trend or some information with the executive of his union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not wish to penalise worker directors for this process, because it would not be deliberate disclosure of confidential information but by their very nature they might want to consult with their union executive.  I am worried in case we would be penalising that kind of director.  I would have no reservation about penalising a normal director who would have forgotten about the confidentiality of his responsibility on the board and disclosed to a newspaper something that could undermine the company or the subsidiary board.  I just have reservations now.  The Minister will probably have experience because he has said it is a replica of something that is in another Act already which involves worker participation. Perhaps we might tease it a little bit further.  I am sure Senator Flor <Col N="628" /> O'Mahony will want to speak on it again because he has had consultation with the same people as I had on the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express the same concerns as Senator Ferris has expressed.  I am, as he is, aware that this provision is included in a similar fashion in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, and I imagine in other legislation also governing other State companies where worker directors are represented as members on the board.</P>
      <P>While I have no doubt that it is not the intention in this provision to spancel worker directors in terms of their ability to maintain contact with those whom they represent whether through the Congress of Trade Unions or through the executives of their own unions.  I am just concerned that it might open up the possibility that these normal and discreet reporting back or consultation arrangements might be seen to be in breach of this proposed section.  The phrase is there, &ldquo;unless he is duly authorised to do so,&rdquo; and that is a phrase that is in the other legislation that has been mentioned. The problem is duly authorised to do so by whom?  Is there due authorisation for worker directors to consult with representatives of the workforce, as they would be expected to do, given the nature of the function of worker directors?  Are they authorised to do so in some other legislation?  Where would the authorisation come from beyond the common sense authorisation that worker directors do have responsibility on some occasions and in the most discreet manner possible to consult with those whom they represent, through whatever means are thought suitable?  This process of consultation goes on at the moment.  Of course, no worker director has ever been penalised to my knowledge under similar kinds of legislation.  There is a question mark there which needs to be looked at.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with Senators in expressing my reservations about this section.  There are obvious problems which will be encountered by worker directors as a result of this section. <Col N="629" /> Between now and Report Stage perhaps we could have a further look at it to ensure that no worker director could be penalised for discussing with his special interest group &mdash; whichever union is involved &mdash; before decisions are made.  I wonder if this section would apply to the Minister in his revelation of confidential Government memoranda which were produced to this House yesterday?</P>

      <P>Disclosure of information of a confidential nature from any board is something that we should not condone.  During the past few years we have seen newspaper reports giving confidential information from board meetings, whether they be Cabinet or otherwise.  We should not condone the disclosure of information other than that which is authorised.</P>
      <P>There are inefficiencies here which worker directors might suffer from if this section goes through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the concerns expressed by Senators but they are unfounded.  This is a very wise and necessary provision.  Worker directors have responsibilities like other directors.  It is very important that worker directors understand the need for confidentiality on boards.  Otherwise management of companies will use as an excuse for not bringing to board, for circumventing board, the fact that they cannot bring anything to the board because, it will be disclosed publicly or that they have not got this opportunity of private analysis which is very necessary.  If documents put up for discussion &mdash; and it may apply to memoranda to Government as well &mdash; are to be revealed as if they were one's last thoughts it would certainly be difficult <Col N="630" /> to have a calm analysis of issues.  It is very important that all directors, including worker directors, understand the need for confidentiality.  It may be used as an excuse that they cannot go to board with very confidential information of importance to the company.  I have known cases where that has happened in the past.  That was the excuse given. Effectively it means that the board is losing control and therefore, this Parliament is losing control.  We should not let that happen.  The provision in this amendment is a wise one.  This provision already exists in relation to Telecom Éireann and An Post, although there are additional reasons there why confidentiality would be necessary for instance, the confidentiality of mails and telecommunication messages that people might come to know about.  It is not intended to stifle or silence completely worker directors in their communications with the electorate and the people they represent, although it is intended to ensure that they do not disclose even to those they represent, confidential information which it would not be in the overall interest of the company to have disclosed prematurely, just as the Minister would be very neglectful or wrong in his duty to disclose information merely because he wanted to consult with the electorate about it.  It could be very inimical to the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has reassured us to some extent.  He recognises, as we all do, that trade unions particularly have an element of confidentiality about them and that would be the process regarding a decision of the board.  Because the worker director, above all other directors, has to have a regard to the views of the people who elected him, the Minister is saying that there is nothing wrong with the fact that he should be able to consult with the executive of the union he represents. In that process we would not like him to be penalised, although we are aware of the fact that if it is confidential it will be treated by the executive of the union as confidential and would not be made public.  If it was made public, then <Col N="631" /> the union and everybody would be in contravention of the section.  What we want is a certain element of freedom to the worker director to have a process of consultation with the people he would represent.  The Minister has assured us that he can do that within this situation, having regard to the overall responsibility that he would have as a member of the board.  Worker directors in all semi-State boards have proved to have a very high degree of intelligence and competence and also they are not prone to going off making wild cat statements of a confidential nature.  Naturally, they would give a view on a board's decision when it is reached and when it becomes common knowledge.  They might say: &ldquo;I objected to it, I voted against it and I was outvoted&rdquo;. This process of confidential information which could lead to a policy decision perhaps involving all the workers in some way should not preclude them totally from consulting in a confidential way with somebody to whom they in turn are responsible to and were elected by.  I trust them to deal with it in the confidential way we want them to do it, but I would not like to preclude them totally from having an avenue available to them for assurance about which particular role they are going to play when the decision is being made.  That is basically what we are worried about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. Obviously, worker directors are the same as other directors in the sense that they have an obligation to see to it that nothing is said or done that damages the company or the board.  They are different from other directors in the sense that they represent the workforce.  Other directors presumably represent the Minister, or the Minister as shareholder, and are not directly accountable to anybody outside that remit; whereas the worker directors have an obligation to represent the position of the workforce on the board while at the same time not undertaking any action that would be detrimental to the board.  In order to fulfil that representational role there must be a possibility for <Col N="632" /> them to consult from time to time in a discreet manner and in a manner that is not detrimental to the interests of the boards.  To clarify their right to do that is what is at issue.</P>
      <P>I am not sure the phrase &mdash; which is not particular to this legislation and is more generalised &mdash;&ldquo;unless he is duly authorised to do so&rdquo; is clear enough.  It does not take account of the particular circumstances of worker directors as opposed to the general circumstances of all directors.  That ability to be free of a concern about a charge under this section in a circumstance in which a worker director would act in the way I have described is important to establish.  I want to raise the question at this stage.  I do not have a particular answer at this point, but perhaps between now and Report Stage I can consider one.  The phrase &ldquo;duly authorised&rdquo; means authorised by, as may be appropriate, the board or the company or some person authorised on their behalf by the board or the company.  That does not necessarily take account of the particular circumstances and responsibilities of worker directors as opposed to other directors.  It leaves open the possibility that the board would create its own internal guidelines whereby worker directors would consult with the workforce through an appropriate institutional arrangement, but it does not necessarily say that that must happen.  There is a question mark in my mind and, I think, in the minds of worker directors, although from past experience there has not been a problem with this section in relation to worker directors.  It is very important also, of course, that the worker directors are aware that they have a responsibility to the whole company as a company, and therefore cannot consult left, right and centre about the most confidential nature of the decisions being taken or the considerations of the board.  I do not know whether we can improve on the amendment on Report Stage, but we can at least think about it.</P>

      <P>I do not think the worries expressed are justified.  What we are trying to provide against here is <Col N="633" /> people copying out memoranda and posting them on a notice board.  Unfortunately, that has happened in some cases of worker directors.  This deals with all directors and not only worker directors. It certainly works in the case of An Post and Telecom Éireann.  Worker directors are going to have a certain amount of consultation, but within that consultation they have to be clear that there are things that are confidential to them.  Each director has to make up his own mind on issues like that.  Therefore, I think the worries expressed by Senators are not justified.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister inform us on Report Stage as to the situation regarding worker directors in this particular instance, because I can see that once somebody is appointed to the board they have the overall responsibility of the company at heart and not just a sectional responsibility.  Under no circumstances should a worker director or any other director be running back to his sectional interest for consultation at every stage. Nevertheless, in section 20 there is no penalty for a director who does not declare interests.  In 21 there is a penalty of £1,000.  I would suggest that, if there is a penalty in this instance for disclosure of confidential information, equally in the other section there should be a penalty for non-disclosure of interests.  I would like the Minister to consider these points between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Does the board have to have consultation with the local authorities when we have compulsory acquisition of land?  As a member of a local authority I am aware that semi-State bodies do not have to apply for planning permission. Sometimes buildings or developments undertaken by semi-State bodies are totally in opposition to the plans laid down by local authorities.  In connection with compulsory acquisition of land do the local authorities have any say under this section?</P>

      <P>What we are providing here is that the existing powers and privileges be transferred <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to the companies.  CIE are required to get planning permission, like everybody else, except in the immediate area of the railway itself.  Even in those cases I think they would consult with local authorities. Other than that, they have to obtain planning permission and the companies themselves will likewise have to get planning permission.  In this section we are making sure that the companies will be empowered to make by-laws and so on in relation <Col N="635" /> to their functions just as the board are at present.</P>

      <P>This compulsory acquisition power is something the board will welcome.  Obviously from time to time they will need to acquire land that may not necessarily be available by consent or by agreement to purchase.  County councils have the same problem.  As a member of a county council I find that the process of compulsory acquisition of land is quite slow.  Will this section as it relates to Córas Iompair Éireann be any swifter than the one which the local authorities are saddled with?  The Minister gave a commitment to the Joint Committee on Building Land of which I was a member, to speed up the process of acquisition.  I am thinking in terms of the benefit to the board if they need to acquire land for a specific reason if they can do so quickly.</P>
      <P>Yesterday we agreed that the new boards would have a new kind of dynamism and that they could enter into areas which would generate more business.  In that process they might decide to build a construction in a town which was too close to a bus stop, for instance, and naturally they would not do that without discussion with the local authority.  Under the Planning Acts, that would be the normal process.  If a railway station needed to be replaced it would not be necessary to obtain planning permission to do that.  I would like to think their powers of CPO are quicker and more efficient than those of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I am proposing to accept the suggestion of my colleagues to delete this section from the Bill.  We will still expect CIE and the companies to have regard to national pay guidelines. A consistent strand of this Bill is that we are not changing anything in relation to terms or conditions of employment or security of employment.  In that spirit this is not the Bill to make this provision though, in practice, of course, all State companies must have regard to national pay guidelines and Government directives.</P>

I agree with the Minister that obviously there will have to be consultation with the Government and Government guidelines will have to be taken into account in any negotiations on salary and remuneration or allowances of whatever.  One of the major problems regarding this Bill is now being eliminated as a result of the opposition to it by Senator Killilea and our group and by the Labour group.

      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to delete this section.  It is the one about which we had most concern in our discussions over recent weeks.  I am glad the Minister has been able to accede to our request to delete it.  This provision, which is already in existence in some legislation, relates to State bodies, is unwise.  It is more likely to cause industrial relations problems that it is to solve them.  Had the section been left in, it would have imposed an artificial constraint on a State company which would have been entirely inappropriate and troublesome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the view of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who made the point that, if we are in the business of operating State companies in the commercial world, and CIE are to a great extent operating commercially, we have to treat <Col N="637" /> them as we would treat any other company. They have to have the ability to negotiate pay and conditions with their workforce and, should there be disagreement at that point, the matter can be resolved in the Labour Court as heretofore. I welcome the Minister's decision to accede to our request to remove this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply I should like to say that this is a vexed question.  There is no doubt that State companies have to have regard to national guidelines or to Government directives.  Whether we need to express this statutorily in this Bill is what is at stake here.  One of the main momentums for that sort of guideline is that unions go into the Labour Court and quote analogues as between the ESB, Aer Lingus and CIE.  They cannot have it both ways.  By saying each company must be treated on its own and when it suits them saying: &ldquo;They are getting something, so we should get it&rdquo;.  We have to be a little bit consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that trade unions in their discussions and negotiations should have regard to Government pay guidelines, and they do.  All these guidelines are subject to negotiation and discussion.  Far be it from us that we should ever remove the right of trade unions to have discussions even on guidelines. During the past few months we have proved that you can set down all the guidelines you like, but they are all subject to agreement, discussion and negotiation.  That is how it should be. Otherwise we are working in a dictatorship. I am grateful to the Minister.  I compliment my colleague Senator O'Mahony who did much work on this section and I was present at some of the meetings he chaired on this subject.  In the past number of months we have proven that.  Guidelines can be set down but they are all subject to agreement in discussion and negotiations.  That is how it should be.  Otherwise we are working in a dictatorship.  We are grateful to the Minister and I compliment my colleague, Senator Flor O'Mahony, who has done a <Col N="638" /> lot of work on section 29.  I was present at some of the meetings that he chaired on this subject.  We felt, and rightly so, and the Minister conceded it in the end, that we would be, for the first time in the public sector, statutorily legislating in the area of wages and conditions.  In my opinion as a trade unionist, that would be a dangerous precedent for one particular section of employees.  For that reason we welcome its deletion.  We can talk about all the other things that we would like to have but that is the essence of it.  It would have been statutory control of wages. That would have been unacceptable to us.  The deletion of the section ensures that the normal process of agreement in discussion, negotiation and in making use of all the employer-labour conferences the Labour Court and every other procedure will be followed.</P>

We did order for today both the Urban Renewal Bill on Second Stage and the Garda (Complaints) Bill on Second Stage.  The position is that neither the Minister for Justice nor the Minister of State at the Department of Justice will be available next week.  My suggestion would be that if the Urban Renewal Bill has not been completed on Second Stage by 4 o'clock we should then take the Garda (Complaints) Bill so that the Minister for Justice could make his Second Stage speech.  Therefore, the House could debate the Bill next week. It is not proposed that there should be any further speeches.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents a significant step towards full implementation of the package of measures relating to unemployment and taxation announced by the Taoiseach in October last.  Taken together with the revised scheme of house improvement grants and the provisions of the Finance Act, 1986, it will provide a major stimulus to the renewal of inner-city areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate origins of the Bill are to be found in the recommendations of a working party established by the Government to report on the best approach to be adopted in relation to the Custom House Docks site in Dublin.  The working party reported to the Government in October 1985.  It recommended the establishment of a special statutory authority with responsibility for securing the redevelopment of the site and to promote the redevelopment effort.  The Government accepted these recommendations and decided that taxation incentives should be used more widely to promote the renewal of other inner-city areas <Col N="641" /> where dereliction and decay are most extensive and pervasive.</P>
    <P>Arising from these decisions, a broadly-based programme is now being initiated to secure the revitalisation and re-building of the older core parts of our larger urban centres.  Details of the specific areas to which special attention is to be given have already been announced and the areas are formally described in the Fourth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1986.  I have arranged to have maps of the areas in question placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information and assistance of Members.</P>
    <P>The present Bill and the initiatives now being taken by the Government represent a more comprehensive, positive and effective approach in urban renewal than was envisaged in any previous proposals. The basic premise on which this approach is based is that the inner areas of our major urban centre represent a very valuable resource in terms of people and community life, public buildings, business, commercial and cultural centres, infrastructure and other urban amenities.  Resources of this kind cannot be allowed to suffer from neglect or dereliction without heavy costs in terms of social problems, physical decay and massive demands for heavy investment in other locations.</P>
    <P>For many years, the inner cores of our larger urban centres have been decaying and large areas have become derelict. The factors which inhibit the redevelopment of such areas are well known.  Site acquisition and development costs tend to be high; there are environmental and social problems and there has been a movement of established industries and other commercial activity to suburban locations.  These and other factors have contributed to a process which is difficult to reverse.</P>
    <P>The situation in our inner-cities would, in fact, be far worse but for the efforts of local authorities and the various other agencies who have worked strenuously over the years to reverse the trend.  For example, local authority housing of a high standard is being provided in inner-urban <Col N="642" /> areas, especially in Dublin.  But efforts to encourage private housing development in inner city areas have had little or no success and activity by the private sector in general has been painfully slow in securing the redevelopment of such areas.  All the evidence suggests that matters will get considerably worse unless a major effort in made to redress the situation.  Such an effort requires Government intervention of the kind which is now being provided for.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted that the north inner-city area of Dublin has suffered most in terms of dereliction and physical decay over the years and has failed to attract new development of the kind undertaken elsewhere in the city.  Only 15 per cent of the office space provided in Dublin, for example, between 1960 and 1984 was located on the north side of the city.</P>
    <P>As is well known, the Custom House Docks site, which is in the ownership of Dublin Port and Docks Board, comprises a total of 27 acres, including some seven acres of docks, on the northern side of the River Liffey and lying immediately east of the Custom House and Amiens Street.  The site is relatively close to the commercial centre of Dublin City but it is underutilised and is in a rundown condition.  Outline planning permission was granted to Dublin Port and Docks Board in 1982 for intensive development on the site for office, industrial, residential and shopping uses but this development was not proceeded with.</P>
    <P>The Custom House Docks is of significant social and civic importance and could not be left undeveloped without considerable repercussions for the surrounding area but the working party concluded that the site would remain undeveloped for the foreseeable future, for ten to fifteen years at least, if matters were left to the normal operation of the property market.  It was also the view of the working party that a less intensive and more socially oriented development than that provided for in the existing outline permission would provide the best basis for the development of the site itself <Col N="643" /> and provide a catalyst for the improvement of the surrounding area and the north inner-city generally.  It was obvious, in view of the history and location of the site, and the sheer scale of development involved, that special efforts would be required to secure its early redevelopment.  The working party recommended, therefore&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the establishment of a statutory authority with planning functions to secure and control redevelopment of the site, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the provision of a package of incentives by way of taxation and rating reliefs to encourage development and to attract occupiers.</P>
    <P>These recommendations were accepted in full by the Government and the present Bill, together with the Finance Act, will give effect to them.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that it was the view of the working party, and of the Government, that the establishment of a new authority, or the introduction of a simplified planning control regime, would not of themselves be sufficient to bring about development of the scale envisaged on the Custom House Docks site.  It was accepted that, in addition, there would be a need for a real commitment from the Government in the form of taxation incentives both to encourage development and the occupation of new or refurbished buildings on the site.  In this regard the approach now being pursued by the Government differs significantly from earlier proposals relating to the site.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the establishment of a separate single-purpose new authority is necessary in relation to the Custom House Docks site. The scale of development involved requires a unified and comprehensive approach to promote and control development. Besides, the site is unique in that it is in the hands of one owner which itself is a public body.  These conditions do not apply in any of the other areas proposed for designation.  In these areas, <Col N="644" /> the Government are satisfied that the proper approach is to provide the financial incentives to generate a demand for development and to leave the general coordination and control and development proposals to the local planning authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the designation of the inner urban areas which are in need of renewal and for the application of rates relief to promote redevelopment in these areas.  The areas intended for designation under the Bill are, of course, the areas already described in the Fourth Schedule to the Finance Act.  That Act also provides for the other financial incentives decided on by the Government.  These include capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of commercial buildings, the granting of relief to lessors under section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981 for the provision of dwellings for letting, the granting of relief to owner-occupiers for expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of dwellings and double-rent relief for traders occupying newly constructed or refurbished buildings.</P>
    <P>The capital allowances will be available, for income tax and corporation tax purposes, in respect of commercial buildings and structures, including offices, shops, leisure and car-parking facilities, on the same lines as the allowances available for industrial buildings and structures.  The allowances will generally be given in respect of the cost of construction work carried out in the period from 23 October 1985 to 31 May 1989, but, as respects the Custom House Docks area, will apply for the five-year period commencing on the date of approval of the planning scheme for the site under section 12 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The allowances in question are, in general, a 50 per cent initial allowance and a 4 per cent annual allowance, with free depreciation for owner-occupiers.  However, as regards the designated areas in Dublin other than the Custom House Docks area, only one-half of those allowances will be available.</P>
    <P>The relief being made available to lessors under section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981 will apply to the construction or <Col N="645" /> conversion cost of dwellings provided for rental in the Custom House Docks area in so far as the work is carried out in the five-year period commencing when the planning scheme for the area is approved. This relief will be available against all such rental income of the lessor and not merely the rental income from the premises in respect of which relief was given. The normal rules relating to section 23 relief in regard to such matters as the size of flats or houses, the letting of premises for ten years and compliance with standards of construction will operate.</P>
    <P>A special new tax allowance will be available to owner-occupiers in respect of a dwelling newly-constructed or refurbished during the period from 23 October, 1985 to 31 May 1989, in certain designated areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway other than the Custom House Docks area.  The allowance may be claimed in each of the first ten years of the life of the dwelling following construction or refurbishment, provided that the dwelling is the sole or main residence of the individual concerned. The annual allowance will be equal to 5 per cent of the expenditure incurred by the individual, excluding site costs and net of all grants payable to him.</P>
    <P>A double rent allowance as an expense in computing trading profits for tax purposes will be available to traders in the Custom House Docks area and in the designated areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  The relief may be claimed for each of the first ten years of each new lease entered into by traders during the period from 23 October 1985 to 31 May 1989, or, as respects the Custom House Docks area, during the five-year period commencing when the planning scheme for the area is approved.</P>
    <P>The new allowance being provided will apply in addition to all other existing incentives such as income tax relief on mortgage interest, allowance under section 23 of the Finance Act 1981 for the provision of rented residential accommodation and capital allowances for the <Col N="646" /> construction and refurbishment of industrial buildings.  All these incentives taken together represent a comprehensive package aimed at stimulating an early and positive response from the private sector.</P>
    <P>The inner-city areas in each of the five county boroughs to which the tax incentives will apply are those where dereliction and decay are extensive and which are likely to remain undeveloped unless special measures are taken.  The areas are so located that their redevelopment will have a major impact and bring about a change in the unfavourable perception of inner-city areas as locations for investment and development and as places for people to live and work.  The range of incentives now available should create a suitable financial climate for large-scale investment by the private sector in these areas and generate the confidence that would lead to a self-sustaining urban renewal process in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I have already requested local authorities to put their full weight behind the new measures.  I have asked them to see themselves as development brokers, bringing landowners, developers and potential investors together where necessary, doing everything they can to facilitate development proposals, and using their full powers under the Planning Acts to promote and facilitate development. Specifically, I have put it to the local authorities that they should&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;appoint a suitable senior officer to act as development co-ordinator, to liaise with potential developers and to facilitate their dealings with the Corporation departments;</P>
    <P>&mdash;review their development plan, where necessary, to remove inflexible or out-of-date provisions;</P>
    <P>&mdash;use their compulsory land acquisition powers, where necessary to ensure that sites of suitable size and shape are available for development and to overcome title problems which private developers may experience;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" />&mdash;make land owned by them &mdash; especially derelict or vacant sites &mdash; available, on reasonable terms, for development or carry out early development themselves on the land;</P>
    <P>&mdash;give special attention to the improvement of the appearance and general environment of the designated areas by way of better street cleansing and refuse collection, deal ing with fly-posting, grafitti and obtrusive and unsightly advertising and other hoardings, the initiation of programmes of environmental improvement, the maintenance of footpaths, roads and public lighting, the implementation of pedestrianisation schemes, the improvement of street furniture to enhance its appearance and to remove clutter and the preparation of design guidelines to encourage attractive designs of building, shop fronts and facades generally.</P>
    <P>The response of local authorities has been positive and encouraging and I am certain that all concerned can count on their whole-hearted co-operation.  It is now a matter for private sector interests immediately to set about formulating their plans so that the maximum amount of construction work will qualify for relief.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear at this stage that there are no proposals for the extension or modification of the designated areas or for the application of the incentives to areas other than those already announced. Great care has already been taken, in consultation with officials of the local authorities concerned in the selection of the areas to which the scheme should apply.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the areas which are being designated are the only areas which suffer from dereliction but they are the areas where redevelopment would make maximum impact on the physical appearance of our inner cities as well as on the perception of inner-city areas as suitable locations for investment and development and for <Col N="648" /> people to live and work.  As many as possible of the problem areas identified by local authority officials were included subject only to ensuring that attention was focussed on the areas most in need of redevelopment.  The incentives being made available in the designated areas have a limited life span and there should be no false expectations about their extension.  The construction industry, property, business and commercial interests should quickly get together to devise suitable schemes of development and redevelopment which can be got underway in the designated areas.  We are dealing with a once-off special offer for a limited period only.  I hope that it will be treated as an opportunity not to be missed.</P>
    <P>The general approach of the Government to urban renewal avoids many of the unacceptable features of the proposals contained in the Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982 and provides a simpler but far more effective strategy for actually achieving the objective.  There are no proposals in the Bill for the establishment of a large number of urban development commissions or bodies to take over the planning and other functions of local authorities in relation to areas designated for urban renewal.  On this point I would mention that a good deal of the debate in the other House related to the area of the mediaeval walled city of Dublin and the fact that a special authority for that area is not being established.  I think it is important clearly to distinguish the differences between the Custom House Docks site and the area of the mediaeval walled city.  The Custom House Docks site is a single site of 27 acres in an underutilised and run-down condition and in the hands of a single owner which is itself a public body.  Virtually the whole site is capable of redevelopment and the function of the Custom House Docks Development Authority will be to secure its early redevelopment.  The area of the mediaeval walled city, by contrast, like other areas of the city enjoy a wide range of uses and diverse ownership.  Responsibility for planning control and development for that area rests properly with <Col N="649" /> Dublin Corporation which is the local planning authority for the area.  I am aware that in the current review of the Development Plan for Dublin City, special attention is being paid to the needs of the walled city area in terms of overall development objectives for the area and the conditions which might be attached to planning permissions for development in the area.</P>
    <P>A detailed explanatory memorandum has already been circulated with the Bill and so I propose to deal now only with its main features.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill will enable the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to designate areas in which there is a special need to promote urban renewal.  As I indicated earlier, the areas proposed for designation have already been determined and are described in the Fourth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1986.  These same areas will be designated under section 6 as soon as the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides for the making of schemes for the remission of rates in respect of premises in designated areas and these schemes will be made as soon as possible after the enactment of the Bill.  The intention is that there will be full remission of rates for ten years on new buildings constructed in a designated area between 23 October 1985 and 31 May 1989 and full remission of the rates on any increase in the valuation of enlarged or improved buildings.</P>
    <P>Sections 8, 9 and 10 provide for the establishment of the Custom House Docks Development Authority and for the functions of the authority.  The authority will consist of a chairman and four ordinary members appointed by the Minister.  It will basically be a single-purpose, <i>ad hoc</i> authority charged with the task of securing the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks area.  The size of the authority, both in terms of its membership and staffing arrangements, is being kept to the minimum consistent with the effective performance of its task. It will be an executive rather than representative body.  It will acquire, hold and <Col N="650" /> manage land for development by itself or others; prepare a scheme or schemes for development, redevelopment or renewal of land in the area; develop or secure the development of such land; provide infrastructure and carry out works of amenity development or environmental improvment.</P>
    <P>The type of persons to be appointed as members of the new authority will be selected on the basis of their expertise and experience in relation to such matters as land acquisition and disposal, estate management and development, commercial and financial management and experience in local government and public administration.  The staffing arrangements and other services required by the authority will obviously vary over the various stages of the project and the Bill, therefore, provides for flexible arrangements whether by way of direct employment of staff under section 20, the engagement of consultants under section 21 or the use of services or staff provided by the Minister or any other statutory authority under section 8 (5).  The authority will have all the powers necessary to undertake and complete the task assigned to it, following which it will be dissolved under section 22.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is an important provision which deals with the position of the authority in relation to the physical planning system.  The provisions of this section are carefully framed with a view to harmonising as closely as possible with the normal operation of the physical planning system but, as the same time, ensuring that the objective of initiating and securing the redevelopment of the area can be achieved with the minimum of delay on a properly planned basis.</P>
    <P>The authority will prepare a planning scheme for the site and the carrying out of any development which is consistent with that scheme will be exempted development for the purposes of the Planning Acts and will not, therefore, require-planning permission in the ordinary way. Safeguards are, however, being incorporated to ensure that a reasonable balance is maintained between the need to promote early development on the site, and <Col N="651" /> the need to provide for public participation and compatibility with the objectives of the planning authority as set out in the Development Plan for Dublin City.  In the first instance, the authority will be required, in the preparation of the planning scheme, to consult with Dublin Corporation, to have regard to the development plan for Dublin city, to receive and consider submissions from interested parties and to comply with any general directives issued by the Minister under section 9 of the Bill.  Second, the authority will be required to submit the planning scheme for approval by the Minister and, at the same time, send a copy of the scheme to Dublin Corporation. Third, the Minister will be required to consider any objections to the scheme made within one month by Dublin Corporation and, following consideration of any such objections, it will be open to him to approve or amend the scheme in such manner as he thinks proper.  The carrying out of development on the site will be exempted development only if consistent with the planning scheme so approved.  Any amendments which the authority wish to make to the planning scheme will be subject to the same procedures as the original scheme.  These arrangements should constitute an acceptable framework for the discharge of their functions by the authority without unduly disturbing or conflicting with the established principles of the physical planning system.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill provides for the transfer to the authority of land in the Custom House Docks area now in the ownership of the Dublin Port and Docks Board and for the payment to the board of proper compensation for the land so transferred.  The actual amount of compensation to be paid will be determined by the Minister, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Communications. The value of the land is to be taken, for the purposes of that determination, as the open market value of the land immediately prior to the announcement <Col N="652" /> by the Taoiseach on 23 October 1985 of the proposals to confer a range of taxation advantages on development on the site.  This is consistent with the established principles for the determination of land values in cases of compulsory purchase.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 to 19 generally deal with the financial arrangements for the new authority.  There is provision for the making of grants to the Authority by the Minister in the first two years of its existence, power for the authority to borrow funds not exceeding £10 million, and power to make advances not exceeding £5 million to the authority from the Central Fund.  Provision is also made, in section 17, whereby the Minister will have power to issue general directives to the authority in relation to the conduct of their financial affairs and the application of profits or other income or funds of the authority.  It is envisaged in this regard that the authority will generally be self-financing and that their operations will not become a burden on the Exchequer.  It is quite possible, in fact, that surpluses will be incurred by the authority and that their operations will enable them to make contributions to the Exchequer to the advantage of taxpayers generally.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 require the keeping and auditing of accounts and the making of annual reports by the authority. Section 22, as I have mentioned already, provides for the dissolution of the authority when their services are no longer required and for the necessary consequential matters such as transfer of staff and property.  The schedule to the Bill describes the area for which the authority will be responsible.  The boundary has been drawn by reference to public thoroughfares rather than by reference to property boundaries but it is only land owned by the Dublin Port &amp; Docks Board in the area which can be transferred to the new authority.</P>
    <P>The Custom House Docks site has been the subject of a good deal of controversy for a number of years.  It has also been a subject of concern for many people that whatever action may be taken <Col N="653" /> in relation to it should properly reflect the unique importance of the site and its potential to make a significant contribution to the ongoing development of Dublin City.  The existing dock system on the site was completed more than 150 years ago.  We now have an exceptional opportunity to revive this special site and to develop new uses and activities there in a manner which will influence and enhance the future of the inner-city of Dublin for future decades.  By doing so, we can revitalise also the whole surrounding area of the north inner-city.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the proposals contained in the Bill will bring about the revitalisation not only of the Custom House Docks site but of the other designated areas as well.  I am also confident that the project will be welcomed by the community as a whole and I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get an opportunity to make my contribution to this debate.  I welcome the Bill.  The Minister made some general comparison with the 1982 Act.  All of us have made that comparison as well.  I felt that the 1982 Act in some ways was a far better Act.  It seems to be capable of being used on a far more widespread basis than this Bill.  While it could be said that this Bill is being directed to a specific area, it has very substantial benefits.  The Minister made the comparison.  I also read through the Bill and I am not convinced that this Bill is better than the 1982 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning section in the 1982 Act was more concerned with conservation than this Bill seems to be.  That concept was specifically incorporated in section 12 of the Act.  The Minister told us that this Bill is a result of the working party's report to the Government in October 1985.  It seems rather odd to me that it is so similar in very many ways to the 1982 Act.  We should acknowledge that the Government of that time were very much on top of the problem and they had not the benefit of the working party's report, which was available only in 1985.  For that reason I have a much higher appreciation <Col N="654" /> of the 1982 Act but I recognise the inherent value in this Bill and what it will be able to achieve.</P>
    <P>People are concerned about the appearance of our capital city, whether they live here or come here only occasionally. I come in through the Phoenix Park in the morning.  I drive along the quays and there is no need for me to describe the scene.  This applies all over the city. For many years the city has been plundered by those who did not care.  It has been desecrated by those who should have known better and who should have been more responsible in their dealings over that length of time.  I commend Frank McDonald's book.  <i>The Destruction of Dublin</i>, to which I have referred before in this House.  The blurb tells us that after 25 years of planning Dublin city is a mess.  Speculators, insurance and pension funds, civil servants, planners and architects have all combined to turn the city into a wilderness, peppered with unsmypathetic office blocks, decaying buildings and derelict sites.  I believe there is a tendency for exaggeration in the blurb of most books but I do not think anybody could honestly state that there is any exaggeration in that statement. Unfortunately, it is true.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill deals with the planning scheme for the Custom House Docks area.  Subsections (1) and (2) state:</P>
    <P>(1) (a) The Authority shall as soon as may be prepare a planning scheme for the Custom House Docks Area.</P>
    <P>(b) The Authority may at any time prepare a scheme amending a scheme under this section.</P>
    <P>(2) A scheme under this section shall consist of a written statement and a plan indicating the manner in which the Authority considers that the Custom House Docks Area should be redeveloped and in particular&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the nature and extent of the proposed development,</P>
    <P>(b) the proposed distribution and location of uses,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> (c) proposals in relation to the overall design of the proposed development, including the maximum heights and the external finishes of structures, and</P>
    <P>(d) proposals relating to the roads lay-out, the provision of parking places and traffic management.</P>
    <P>That is fairly comprehensive regarding the planning requirements.  I am involved in the planning area, the design area.  I have a special interest in this and special experience.  In my contribution I want to confine myself to this area, which is dealt with in section 12.</P>
    <P>Everybody will agree that the most important aspect of this Bill is planning and that a proper plan be prepared.  It will be impossible to have a satisfactory conclusion to the scheme without that. The different types of buildings will be of great importance and housing will be the most important of all.  Therefore, I will confine myself within this narrow sphere of housing and planning.</P>
    <P>There is no question in anybody's mind about the problems which have arisen due to high-rise buildings.  I believe the Utopian designs have been the cause of many of the problems that have arisen. While in this scheme, as in every other scheme, we will look for the ideal, which is difficult to achieve, we should learn from the expensive lessons of the past and we should ensure that none of these critical areas will be included in any scheme which is finalised for this area.</P>
    <P>Let us look briefly at some social aspects of housing and development planning. Planning and design processes have a strong impact on the social structure of the residents.  This has been extensively documented in research and is most graphically illustrated in the cases of the block of flats in the UK and US which, before they were paid for, had to be declared uninhabitable and demolished, either because of structural defects or because the block became a behavioural sink, or for both reasons.</P>
    <P>Such blocks are not only financially disastrous to build, they are more expensive <Col N="656" /> to maintain, and the social problems they produce, such as children in care, necessitate expanded social services, additional costs to the police because of high crime levels in flats, to the education authority because of vandalism affecting school buildings and equipment, to the hospitals because of muggings and stress-induced illness, to insurance companies and their clients.  Certain design features associated with these patterns have also been found on housing estates affected by graffiti, vandal damage and excrement.</P>
    <P>Conversely, successful neighbourhoods have been studied and the factors working to ensure the emergence of a firm social structure described.  See, for example, Jacobs, J.  <i>The Death and Life of the Great American Cities</i>, New York, Random House, 1961.  One underlying element in successful housing has been identified by writers in many countries. According to Turner and Fletcher:</P>
    <P>When dwellers control the major decisions and are free to make their own contribution to the design, construction and management of their housing, both the process and the environment produced stimulate individual and social well-being.  When people have no control over, nor responsibility for key decisions in the housing process, on the other hand, dwelling environments may instead become a barrier to personal fulfilment and a burden on the economy.</P>
    <P>That quotation is from Turner, JFC and R. Fichter editors of <i>Freedom to Build</i>, New York, Macmillan, 1972.</P>
    <P>Striking evidence of this law of housing is the Third World shanty town on the edge of cities where people without initial means turn their own labour into a capital asset over time, an asset that could only be acquired through the normal channels of housing provision at a much greater cost, usually beyond the reach of the owner-builder since institutional sources of housing finance are not available to such people.  The original straw houses are converted as rapidly as possible into brick and cement structures with an investment totalling millions of dollars. <Col N="657" /> The dwelling begins unserviced and develops its services over time, often through the initiative of the inhabitants.</P>
    <P>It was found in the Peruvian barriadas that employment rates, wages, literacy and educational levels were higher than the national average.  Thousands of people lived together in an orderly fashion with no police protection or public services.  Initially, the shanty towns were perceived as a blot on the landscape and a menace to public health and good order.  A new perception has arisen which sees the owner-builder's activities as a triumph of self-help and demands that they should be assisted rather than frustrated.  This perception has now become the official orthodoxy, so far as bodies like the UN and the World Bank are concerned, and &ldquo;site-and-service&rdquo; housing or &ldquo;aided self-help&rdquo; are the recommended government policies.</P>
    <P>Coleman asserts &mdash; in <i>Utopia on Trial:</i><i>Vision and Reality in Planned Housing</i>, London, Shipman, 1985 &mdash; that the twentieth century in Britain has been split in two by a revolution in housing.  The first half of the century was dominated by the age old system of natural selection, which left people free to secure the best accommodation they could.  The second half embraced the Utopian ideal of housing planned by a paternalistic authority, which offered hopes of improved standards but also ran the risk of trapping people in dwellings not of their own choosing.  Unfortunately, Utopia was not automatically synonymous with progress, and much of the planned housing proved to be retrograde.</P>
    <P>When considering developments in modern design and planning it is necessary to refer briefly to the role of Le Corbusier.  Architecture established itself independently of building when the ancient world began to produce grandiose public buildings that demanded forethought and measurement.  Temples, cathedrals, palaces and castles were its main preoccupation for many centuries, with a gradual extention of its sphere of activity downwards, from the religious to the secular, from the royal to the rich, <Col N="658" /> from the national to the municipal.  Over the same centuries vernacular building was evolving in the opposite direction, upward from the one-storeyed, one roomed, earth floored cottage.  It remained in close contact with how ordinary people lived, and gradually came to serve their needs more effectively, catering for a complex variety of functions, shelter, defensibility, scope for making one's mark and projecting one's image, opportunities for varied home based activities, and sense of security.</P>
    <P>During the thirties and forties the two trends approached.  Builders were improving their standards so far upward that the ordinary house began to seem within the proper sphere of architects, expanding downwards.  In the post war period, the trends were fused by virtue of the Planning Act, but the fusion did not give the best of both worlds that was expected.  Both architects and builders have been made responsible to planning authorities rather than to clients and purchasers and consequently they have been deprived of the strongest stimulus to mainstream evolution, direct feedback from occupiers.  Even in the private sector this is true to a considerable extent.</P>
    <P>To understand the form which the fusion has taken, it is necessary to look to the influence of one person, Le Corbusier. He was both an architect and a city planner who became a kind of patron saint to the two professions at a formative stage.  Planning was just coming out of its chrysalis, and in need of a unifying doctrine.  Architecture was seeking professional status.  Le Cosbusier was a powerful polemicist who provided precisely the authoritative rationale that fitted the time, and also had the advantage of leading both professions along the same principles, so that they gave each other mutual support.  In so far as Le Cosbusier was right, this was an added strength, but in so far as he was wrong it multiplied the error.</P>
    <P>Le Corbusier advocated a break with traditional architecture in favour of completely new and closely argued concept <Col N="659" /> of design.  The basic principle was functionalism, a house is a machine for living in. Functionalism was an integration of ideas on the aesthetics of buildings with ideas on desiderata for family and community living.  Le Corbusier was forceful on the human aspect.  He had a vision of community living and was convinced it could be created by design that threw people together, rooms should be thrown together in open plans, dwellings should be thrown together in tall towers and towers should be thrown together in vertical cities.</P>
    <P>Other land uses should be designed into the same buildings as the residences, shops and schools, roof gardens and hotels, theatres and gymnasia, for form a <i>unité d'habitation.</i>  The <i>unités</i> were to be set in green parks and raised up on pillars so that the space could pass uninterruptedly beneath them.  They should then be linked together by straight motorways and in order to expedite the birth of this Utopia, ageing neighbourhoods should be demolished in their entirety, to make way for comprehensive redevelopment.</P>
    <P>Le Corbusier's vision provided a sense of purpose and righteous mission, and gained an enormously powerful hold. Throughout the thirties and early forties there was a world wide reaction against the modern movement, which was directed against its leaders, including Le Corbusier.</P>
    <P>Levis Mumford declared the imagery of the City for Three Million to have been the dominant influence in architecture and planning schools for thirty years.  He said in <i>Architecture as a Home for Man</i>, that the chief reason for Le Corbusier's immediate impact lies in the fact that he brought together the two architectural conceptions that separately have dominated the modern environment in architecture and city planning, the machine made environment, standardised, bureaucracised, processed, technically perfected to the last degree and to offset this the natural environment treated as so much visual open space, providing sunlight, <Col N="660" /> pure air, green foliage and views. Referring to Le Corbusier's insensitiveness to time, change, organic adaptation, functional fitness, ecological complexity, his sociological naivete, his economic ignorance, and his political indifference, Levis Mumford said:</P>
    <P>These very deficiencies were as it turned out, what made his City of the Future such a successful model for worldwide initation; its form reflected perfectly the financial, bureaucratic and technological limitations of the present age.</P>
    <P>Modern designers were accused of not looking beyond the mythical simplicity they espoused to the actual complex social realities that must be explored if architectural design is to meet people's needs.  &ldquo;I propose one single building for all nations and climates,&rdquo; Le Corbusier wrote in 1930.</P>
    <P>Coleman's British research revealed certain design features to be associated with social malaise.  Coleman suggests that Le Corbusier's work was based on dogma, a theory or doctrine asserted on authority without supporting evidence as he was not in the business of testing and modifying his designs.  Coleman wrote:</P>
    <P>Most of the design features that have failed our tests prove, in retrospect, to stem from his Utopian vision.  He was fundamentally right in one respect, that design can alter the character of a community, but whether the effect will be for good or ill is something that can only be determined from factual evidence.  Creativity is not enough.  It should also be rooted in reality.</P>
    <P>We now come to housing design and social malaise from the international evidence. As blocks of flats began to multiply in the United States and the United Kingdom a groundswell of criticism began to emerge.  A strong stable social structure is the aim for new plan developments but Jacobs showed that designs that were alleged to be created in American cities were the barriers that precluded its emergence.</P>
    <P>Newman's research was conducted in all the public housing projects of council <Col N="661" /> estates in New York.  His aim was to discover which design features attracted the most crime or vandalism.  As he identified the designs that seemed to encourage crime, Newman advanced three principles that explained how crime was made easy to commit and difficult to prevent, anonymity, lack of surveillance and the presence of alternative escape routes. Anonymity was associated with size, number of people using the same entrance, number of storeys and the degree to which the grounds and common parts are shared and defended by different households.</P>
    <P>Newman showed that visibility is an essential ingredient of residential space. Criminals like to operate unobserved in screened and secluded places but the householder feels safer and more in control of his or her territory if he or she commands a clear view of the approaches to it.  The third principle, alternative escape routes allows criminals to be more audacious, as, even if they should be detected at work, they feel confident of being able to lose themselves in a network of outlets.  Newman advanced the concept of defensible space to describe housing designs that give the householder control over his or her territory.  There is evidence that similar designs can breed similar problems in a great diversity of countries.</P>
    <P>Newman has been called in as a consultant in Holland, Finland, Russia and China.  The Puerto Rican Government found that their first five estates of flats bred so many problems that they abandoned that type of solution in favour of self-help housing schemes.  Jones studied Venezuelan urbanisation on behalf of the United Nations and found that areas of housing erected by squatters developed a more stable social structure than large estates of flats.  The similarity across cultures suggests that Utopian designs have a widespread tendency to generate problems. Since this tendency is cross cultural, it may spring from something in human nature.</P>
    <P>A British research project in 1984 in the borough of Southwark showed that crime levels were strongly associated with <Col N="662" /> disadvantagement scores.  According to Coleman the blocks of flats with the highest disadvantagement had the highest rates of robbery, sexual assault bodily harm, criminal damage, theft, juvenile arrests and burglary, Preliminary evidence shows that arson rates and some kinds of psychiatric illness are related to the effects of Utopian designs.</P>
    <P>Coleman's research on 4,099 blocks of flats and 4,172 houses focused on marital evidence of social malaise that could be objectively observed: litter, graffiti, vandal damage and excrement, with some information on children in care.  It was found that in problem-free areas, British culture regarded these activities as taboo but when society breaks down, some taboos may be flouted more readily than others.  These are breached in a set order, from the weakest to the strongest &mdash; litter, graffiti, vandalism, taking of children into care and excrement.  The research shows that the five factors most strongly associated with anti-social behaviour were dwellings per entrance, dwellings per block, number of storeys, overhead walk-ways and spatial organisation. The various forms of social breakdown tended to occur in a set order as design features worsened to the successive degrees of depravity needed to undermine each social taboo in turn.  The effect was a general one, exercised by all the designs, not a question of different designs being responsible for different kinds of behavioural lapse.</P>
    <P>In their study of 4,172 houses, Coleman's team also found that designs which resulted in lack of surveillance and facelessness &mdash; expanses of walls, fences or hoardings unrelieved by windows or entrances &mdash; were associated with design disadvantagement, along with shrinkage of the front garden and size of fences and gates.  &ldquo;House design should satisfy the instinctive drives &mdash; to control a defensible territory and to make one's mark on it&rdquo;.  The team visited estates of houses plagued by graffiti, vandal damage and excrement and found that the defects of facade were invariably present in the problem estates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> Now we come to the social failing of modern architecture.  In <i>The Failure of</i><i>Modern Architecture,</i> London, Studio Vista, 1976, Brolin cities evidence throughout the world to show that modern architectural and planning ideas have failed wherever the architect disregards the social and aesthetic values of the user.  The public is disillusioned with modern architecture because architects imposed their values on a public that did not share them.</P>
    <P>Brolin states:</P>
    <P>By declaring the appropriateness of their architecture, and theirs alone, modernists placed themselves in opposition to the overwhelming majority of potential home owners.  When they assumed that visual traditions were no longer a valuable part of people's lives, they automatically excluded themselves from a major environmental undertaking &mdash; the planning of suburbia. Architects yield this realm to non architects because of their unwillingness to design houses based on traditional styles and to plan large groupings of detached single-family houses.</P>
    <P>In pre-industrial society the architect either intuitively understood his client's needs because they were similar to his own, or these needs were codified by tradition and the architect had only to follow the custom.  But, with the onset of industrialisation, the architect-client relationship took on a new aspect.  In large scale projects the client who paid for the project &mdash; often a government agency as in this case &mdash; was not the client who would use the project, and this separation between the paying client and the user client was critical.  Not only did architects no longer have the direct contact with the user-client that had been common in the past, but more importantly, because the user-client now came from a different class or even a different culture, the architect was often unaware of cultural differences between his own and his client's perception of space &mdash; that is, the different <Col N="664" /> ways that he and his user-client would choose to behave in the same room, Ignoring these cultural differences and making choices based on their own experience, most modern architects assumed that the user clients would become accustomed to living the way they expected them to live.  In doing this, far from feeling that they were bypassing their clients' actual preferences, they actually considered that they were fulfilling their social responsibilities to them.</P>
    <P>According to Brolin the success of any past or present design solution depends on whether the people who use it will actually share the values that the design embodies.</P>
    <P>Second-generation modernists re-emphasised the earlier modern viewpoint that the social life of contemporary people is so radically different from the past that it cannot be accommodated in the same physical containers of traditional streets, houses and other forms. But glancing around quickly tells us that, if anything, the opposite is true.</P>
    <P>No matter what culture it is used in, the greatest social distress seems to be caused by the high-rise, and this is the only new housing form of the century.  A supposed anachronism is the suburban single-family tract house, considered by most architects to be culturally obsolete. By all standards, however, it remains the most popular form of housing in the United States for example, and very definitely in this country.</P>
    <P>Of necessity the suburb demands an inhibiting regularity.  Each house must have a site of approximately the same size, for economic reasons.  Because the client wants a free-standing house, it must be put in the same place, the middle.  Most of the possible variations have been tried already, and originality in the cherished modern sense of demonstrating the designers individuality is virtually impossible.  The houses are spread evenly over the land, with no accents, no variation and no subtle patterns or contrasts, or at least none that the architect can discern.  Yet, for the owners <Col N="665" /> there is enough difference in the slight variations of colour, trim or site placement.</P>
    <P>Brolin stated:</P>
    <P>Furthermore the average suburbanite is likely to more conservative than the architect.  She/he is probably anti-intellectual, pro-tradition and generally conformist, whereas the architect often sees himself at the leading edge of cultural change.  Fortunately or unfortunately, suburbs depress architects more than they depress the people who live in them.</P>
    <P>We must keep in mind the Irish experience and the Irish context.  Planning in Ireland is a modern phenomenon which really began in 1964, with the introduction of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and coincided with the economic expansion engendered by the programmes for economic development.  The system endeavoured to balance the requirements of individuals with considerations of the common good and arbitrate on the conflicts of interest between various sections of the community.  One major issue has been the expansion of urban areas and the form this should take.  Two types of development are worth passing consideration &mdash; cluster development on housing estates and single house rural development. Research in the US, UK and Ireland shows the important role played by the house in promoting human happiness. The house was the primary factor open to comprehensive improvement by external agencies.</P>
    <P>There are indications that for a considerable proportion of people, if not a majority, living on an estate is a compromise. For many, the cherished ideal is an individual house surrounded by private land.  The attraction of such an arrangement is a mixture of the practical benefits which include visual privacy, the associated territorial control, the absence of &ldquo;other ugly buildings&rdquo; and the high social status associated with such housing.  To test this assumption, a study by An Foras Forbartha included a question relating to house type preferences.  People were <Col N="666" /> asked to pick first and second preferences from the following three types: a bungalow surrounded by an acre of land, a terraced town house and a house on a housing estate.  The bungalow was the clear favourite.  Three-quarters selected it first.</P>
    <P>Irish research on housing estates confirms the importance to residents of factors identified elsewhere &mdash; boundary definition and security, desire to make one's mark, need for diversity of environment, importance of the front garden as a buffer zone, smallness of scale in order to reduce anonymity with its attendant anti-social behaviour and reactions of withdrawal and defensiveness, house group form as security &mdash; concern with defensible space as a factor in crime reduction &mdash; and the safety of the street as a play space for children.</P>
    <P>Considerations which also arise are child traffic accident problems.  Research from An Foras Forbartha shows that the total number of child casualties, killed or injured, inside built-up areas outnumbers those occurring outside built-up areas. It shows that children travelling as car passengers comprise most of the casualties outside built-up areas while child casualties in built-up areas are most likely to be pedestrians.  Other Foras Forbartha research shows that the standards and regulations for housing estate layout invoked a conflict of objectives between concern for ease of traffic flow and adequate levels of vehicular safety and pedestrian safety.</P>
    <P>It is evident that road design and layout make little concession to child behaviour. Housing estate roads in our large cities are generally wide and straight.  They are wide because they are designed to allow for parking on both sides of the road.  Yet half the accidents to child pedestrians in residential areas occur when the child is crossing from behind a parked vehicle. The roads are straight because minimum garden depth requirements, building line requirements and sewers located in grass margins, make it uneconomic to put in curves.  Unfortunately, wide straight roads encourage higher speeds and this <Col N="667" /> leads to a greater proportion of pedestrian accidents being fatal.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Caution Children playing!&rdquo; is typical of the signs erected on housing estates. They demonstrate clearly that residents do not perceive their environment as being a safe one.  Questionnaire surveys confirm this concern of residents.</P>
    <P>The question of vandalism is always an important consideration.  Vandalism is a sufficient problem on some Dublin housing estates to give rise to substatial public spending on security and policing.  Dublin Corporation was reported to have spent £1.4 million on security in 1985.  However, notwithstanding this expenditure, vacant houses continue to be burned and vandalised.</P>
    <P>In this context it is interesting to note the comments of a British social worker who told the <i>Sunday Press</i> that the housing conditions in Ballymun and Darndale were &ldquo;awful&rdquo;, that similar developments in the US and Britain had been demolished and that the cost of maintaining them in social and economic terms was not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Cuttings from several of the daily papers confirm this problem.  The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 20 April 1986 had an article called &ldquo;Family fears as Corpo homes burn&rdquo;.  The <i>Irish Times</i> of 15 April 1986 had an article headed &ldquo;Army protection sought for vacant houses&rdquo; because of the same problem.  The <i>Evening Herald</i> of 10 April 1986 had a heading &ldquo;Tallaght terror as empty houses are set alight; &lsquo;Families fear they'll be burned alive&rsquo;.&rdquo;  The <i>Sunday Press</i> of 2 March 1986 had a heading &ldquo;Call to raze Ballymun tower blocks&rdquo;.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Mr. Jim Ennis, head of the Leicester Family Service Unit in Britain, told the <i>Sunday Press</i> that he had been to see housing conditions in Ballymun and Darndale in Dublin and found them &ldquo;awful.&rdquo;  Similar developments in the US and Britain had been demolished, he said.</P>
    <P>The cost of maintaining them in social and economic terms was &ldquo;not on&rdquo;, said Mr. Ennis before he went on <Col N="668" /> to address the ISPCC seminar &ldquo;Focus on Families&rdquo; in Drumcondra yesterday.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there is a major problem in that area.  These problems are not peculiar to Ireland; there have been major problems in practically all other countries. I would like to quote from <i>Housing by People, Towards Autonomy in Building Environments</i> by John F.C. Turner, published by Marian Boyars, London, 1976.  Page 43 of this book emphasises this point.  It states:</P>
    <P>Much has been written recently on the common material defects of modern housing which is perhaps best summarized in Alex Gordon's analysis of loose fitness, long life and low energy.</P>
    <P>In addition to non-quantifiable and scientifically elusive but aesthetically and emotionally shocking effects of excessive uniformity and size, there are a number of measurable consequences of heteronomy in housing.  The standardisation and size of developments minimize variety and fit, as already observed.  Unfortunately, most over-simple observations emphasize the need for physical flexibility within dwellings or of dwellings.  This has led to a great deal of investment in expensive construction systems that allow for internal rearrangements and the expansion and contraction of individual units &mdash; a mechanical view of &ldquo;loose-fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This investment in heteronomous technologies has proved both expensive and of only marginal benefit.  It has done very little in the way of providing for the vital needs of the great majority of people.  Their requirements are not measured only by arrangements of rooms and windows, but by the degree of accessibility that they have to their friends and relatives, to their sources of income and to the places where they spend it &mdash; all of which demand &ldquo;loose-fit.&rdquo;  Large-scale systems have created the most segrated cities the world has ever known.</P>
    <P>The life of modern buildings, <Col N="669" /> whether blocks of flats or office blocks, is already notoriously short.  Millions have watched the demise of the infamous Pruitt-Igoe public housing project in St. Louis, Missouri &mdash; partly dynamited by the US Army engineers only 20 years after it was built and awarded a prize for good design.  This is not an isolated case of public authorities giving up unmanageable and uneconomic housing estates.  Several local authorities in Britain have found that it is easier and cheaper to demolish structures that were well-built less than 40 years ago, than to rehabilitate and modernize them.</P>
    <P>Darndale is in this context.  Prizes have been awarded for the design of Darndale but these designs are unacceptable in their present state.</P>
    <P>It is easy to see the appeal of the single rural house despite its vocal critics.  Perhaps half the population living in open country, as many as 177,000 households, may not have any functional connection with the rural environment.  Their houses are defined as urban-generated rural housing, though this definition is acknowledged to be vague and unsatisfactory. For example, the meaning of &ldquo;rural&rdquo; in this context is unclear.  Ribbon development just outside a town boundary, where infill at a rapid rate is likely, may not be regarded by planners as objectionable as sporadic development further out.  No direct estimates of the extent of these forms of development at a national level are available.  It is estimated that during the period 1973-80 about 82,000 houses without access to public sewerage systems were built and that at least 38,000 of these were for people without any rural connection.  It is estimated that more than 80 per cent of private houses built outside boroughs and urban districts are single one-off houses.  Nearly all single, one-off houses are built outside boroughs and urban districts.  The number of such houses has been steadily increasing in recent years.</P>
    <P>Cost is a major determinant of location for many people choosing this type of housing.  The opportunity to build their <Col N="670" /> own house was cited as the reason for selecting a rural location by one-fifth of Quinn's respondents.  Living in or near towns or villages could be acceptable to many of those selecting rural sites.  Most valued the advantages of a serviced site and proximity to a town.  Fieldwork by An Foras Forbartha in 1974 revealed that more than half of the respondents chose their location for one of the following reasons: to gain privacy, to escape from the built-up environment, or to enjoy the scenic beauty of the area.  Nearly two-thirds of them stated they would not like to have more neighbours.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the single, rural house satisfies the criteria advanced by Newman and Coleman.  The design allows people to control a defensible territory and make their mark on it.</P>
    <P>Apart from economic questions the main charge levelled against these houses is their effect on the visual quality of the countryside.  When they occur in ribbon developments they have been described as &ldquo;ugly developments that should not have happened.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to Aalen:</P>
    <P>Rural suburbanisation raises numerous problems, among them... strong visual and aesthetic impacts. Bungalows are often ostentatious in design, prominent, sited and at odds with the rural surroundings, while trees and hedges are removed from the roadsides and replaced by brick walls.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte states that these developments threaten the quality of the scenery which is the primary reason that tourists choose to visit Ireland.  They say:</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is determined to change national attitudes in this regard because we believe that with proper planning we can reconcile conservation with the legitimate design and indeed right, of people to a home of their own. Apart from a desire to see vernacular architecture maintained we also know that discerning tourists take the trouble to write to us on their return home to state their incredulity at the range of fussy and imported ideas of house <Col N="671" /> design and external finish which manifest themselves in our modern countryside buildings.  The general problem becomes all the more pointed where this haphazard housing development takes place in scenic areas.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte plans to launch a design and siting guide booklet in the near future.</P>
    <P>These objections echo the objections described in other countries.  It is apparent that the values of the residents are at odds with those of the professionals.  One element of the problem may lie in the newness of the housing.  As Hardy and Ward have observed,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any new housing is raw and intrusive until it has mellowed into its surroundings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They cite the example of Gower St., London which was loathed by William Morris for its soulless Georgian regularity, the Victorian by-law street which was despised for almost a century but now has champions, the semi-detached suburb, disliked for years by the tastemakers, which now has its fervent admirers and the plotland houses of rural England whose critics complained in the 1920s about the &ldquo;cheap and nasty salmon-pink asbestos-cement roofs&rdquo; which have now attracted moss and lichen and have the colour and appearance of Cotswold stone.</P>
    <P>Conway has attacked these houses on the grounds that they are poorly designed in relation to internal layout and energy conservation.  Evidently the owners have made this choice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I want to make is that the Bill is confined to what is known as the &ldquo;inner city&rdquo;.  I have <Col N="672" /> asked people to define &ldquo;inner city&rdquo; but I have not got an answer.  I would think it applies to the area around the Customs House.  The Minister might throw some light on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  My point is that this is all associated with the problem of sprawl, the depopulation of the inner city, which is a major problem. I want to refer again very briefly to some of the points I have raised.  Planning is the most important aspect of this whole attempt and is dealt with in section 12.  If the planning is not a success the whole project is doomed to failure.  In my attempt to define the aspects of design I thought important to mention in some detail the importance of consulting people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us into areas which I have dealt with here before.  The problem has arisen in the first place because of the cost of land in the inner city area.  The high cost level may have been artifically created but local authorities with a certain amount of money, particularly Dublin Corporation, found themselves in the position where they could provide more houses in the suburbs than they could do by purchasing sites in the inner city area.  Therefore they opted for housing schemes on the perimeter of the city. This was a political decision.  Very few people took objection to it at the time. Approximately three times the number of houses were built that would be possible if the corporation had opted for the inner city area.  Problems arose when people were uprooted, their long developed culture was disregarded.  They were transferred to new housing schemes where they had few friends.  This placed extra stress on these people.  In the inner city areas they lived near their friends and in-laws.  The shops were nearby. They were transferred to conditions with which they were not familiar.  Many of the problems which arise in housing estates are not directly attributable to the people who live there.  They should not be blamed.  In many cases it is the fault of the designers and the people who made the decision to uproot these people. <Col N="673" /> Although the motive may have been a good one &mdash; to help as many as possible &mdash; the decision to move these people is responsible for the present situation.</P>
    <P>Reliefs and tax incentives are important. Without them it would be impossible to achieve the objectives of the Bill.  It is a pity there is not a general attempt to deal with the problems in other areas outside Dublin.  While the Minister will have the authority to order other areas where he feels it is necessary, when I compare the two Bills there is a nagging doubt in my mind concerning the advantages of the latest Bill.  If it achieves what it sets out to do it will be a good start. The Minister had dealt with the reliefs and tax incentives.  I will not refer to them.  They are necessary.  The State will get back much more in return, not alone in this specific area but in the social context and in reducing the stresses which are inherent in the present situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the litter problem, which is not confined to Dublin but can be seen even in isolated areas, in our beautiful bogs.  This problem does not exist to the same extent in any other country.  It is difficult to know how to deal with it.  I doubt if it can be cured by increasing the fine to £25.  Can it be cured by education?  I suppose this is the only way and money is best spent in that way.</P>
    <P>The planning laws to some extent have failed.  Five year development plans were prepared by all the local authorities. These plans are displayed.  The public have a right to object to them.  Yet the plans seem to have no bite.  There is no obligation on the local authority to see that the objectives incorporated in the plan are carried out within the specified period.  They are just a yardstick against which planning applications are compared.</P>
    <P>If we compare the problem in Dublin with other cities &mdash; for example in the UK &mdash; it is difficult to understand how development along the same lines could not be attempted.  I am thinking particularly of the lines in Brighton.  I once had an opportunity of visiting Brighton to attend a seminar &mdash; the only one for which the local authority paid my costs <Col N="674" />&mdash; and I gained a lot of experience and information with a lot of hard work: it was no junket.  In Brighton there are narrow laneways where there is no vehicular traffic.  Why could something along the same lines not be attempted here?</P>
    <P>An effort was made some time ago to deal with the problem of derelict sites. In the Fine Gael-Labour Programme for Government, published in December 1982, it was proposed to have an annual 10 per cent tax on derelict sites.  This has never materialised.  Perhaps it could be looked at again to see if some solution could be found.  Many local authorities are the biggest offenders.  It would discourage the hoarding of property and in many cases the resulting urban blight.  In the preparation of plans for this area a psychologist and perhaps a psychiatrist should be involved.</P>
    <P>I referred to the importance of the architect in one sense but in another sense the architect has become less important than at any other period.  In effect, the important thing is that the people themselves will be consulted.  They would have an input into any decisions that are made. It has been suggested that an archaeologist would be involved.  I would strongly recommend that.</P>
    <P>In addition to the improvement which will accrue from this Bill, there is the important matter of employment in the building industry.  I will conclude on this subject.  This is very welcome.  Any employment that will result is important and timely.  I have never seen the situation so bad in the building industry as it is at present.  I understand that gypsum sales have gone down by 20 per cent since last year.  This applies all over, in spite of the special grants given for the reconstruction of houses by the Department and was very welcome.</P>
    <P>In spite of the special scheme for local authority tenants and tenant purchasers to buy new houses, we had the problem of the burning of houses in the city area that I spoke of earlier on.  In spite of all these things, employment in the building industry has been declining.  I should like <Col N="675" /> to mention one aspect.  The Minister has quite rightly deplored the black economy in the building industry, but where architects are concerned there is the problem of those people employed by local authorities and young people who have taken out diplomas in regional colleges who are able to prepare plans and drawings at a charge far less than people in established practice who have to charge VAT and incur overheads.  This is an area which might be looked at.</P>
    <P>Altogether, I welcome the Bill.  Everybody must welcome any proposal which would improve the terrible situation we have and which seems to be getting worse.  Everything is documented in Frank McDonald's book.  Everybody has read it I am sure who is interested in this problem.  There is no point in referring to sections of it regarding certain areas. It is an enormous problem and is difficult to understand how it was ever allowed to develop.  The beautiful city we had with Georgian buildings and all the others such as the Russell Hotel and so on.  It is extraordinary to realise that it was only when the planning laws came into operation, laws that should have ensured that this kind of destruction would not have taken place, it is only then that these came about.  It raises a question mark about planning laws.  I welcome the Bill and wish it success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will be widely welcomed not only throughout the city of Dublin but also by many others in many parts of the country and, indeed, by many people who do not live here because the state of the city centre has received more Press coverage and writings and even in letters sent back to this country from people who have spent some time visiting here either as tourists or returned emigrants visiting their relatives and throughout the country at large. The problem of the derelict sites, not only in the city centre area but throughout the city of Dublin, is well known to everybody. This is the first real effort being made to tackle that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some reservations about the Bill <Col N="676" /> which I would have to voice here.  I will come to them later.  I wholeheartedly welcome the measure in many respects. First, because of the employment it will give in this depressed area.  I suppose there are only a few Members of this House who realise the depression in the city area, other than the Minister himself, of course.  Many of the problems in my area have emanated from the transfer of people from the city to the newly built corporation areas in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should like to place emphasis, in welcoming the measure, on the employment it is likely to give.  I hope that when the Bill is passed the Minister will take all necessary steps to expedite the setting up of the Custom House Docks Area Authority and whatever steps he can take to ensure that the effect of the Bill is carried through to its full potential and in as quickly a time as possible.  It is a measure which should have been taken many years ago.  Indeed, it was not for want of highlighting the problems within the city area, because politicians and Ministers were aware of them, but then many of them had different ways of looking at it.  Indeed, there was great disagreement on how it should be tackled.</P>
    <P>What gratifies me is that we are now clearing up an area which has worried me because of the effect it was having on the population of the city generally in particular the young people.  They did not know the city in any other state.</P>
    <P>It was a great pleasure to me, many years ago, when I was a much younger person, to spend my Sunday mornings cycling around the city centre area and chat with the men around the Liffey Wall below O'Connell Bridge particularly, and down in the docks area when there were people there on Sunday mornings.  It does not happen any more because their homes are now too far from the mouth of the Liffey.  There is no measuring the effect this must have had on the children who had to go to school and start their lives in a city that was so torn asunder physically.  Somebody remarked to me not so very long ago that if you leave out O'Connell Street and Grafton Street, no other street is left intact.  There are derelict <Col N="677" /> sites and run down buildings and no incentive to business people or property owners in the area to even keep the appearance or the facade of their property visually sound and pleasant and pleasing to the eye.  There is no incentive for that.</P>
    <P>The city is denuded of its population. We have seen over the years a policy in regard to large tracts of land in the county with little else appearing for many years except the dwellings which were so necessary for people who found themselves in the city situation where the dwellings were falling around them and where no effort was being made to deal with the derelict sites.  Sites were becoming vacant as was so apparent over the past ten or 15 years.  In the late sixties it was the policy of the then Government to depopulate the city centre area.</P>
    <P>When the Government took office in 1973 under Liam Cosgrave, they reversed that policy.  It was too late, perhaps, to prevent the effect which I described on the city population in the intervening years.  Even though steps were taken by the Government in 1973 to discontinue the policy of depopulating the city area, little effort was made to repopulate the city area.  I hope I live to see the effects of this measure carried out to the full. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than again to be able to go into the centre city area on a Sunday morning to talk with the population.  I am sure it will not be on a bicycle this time.</P>
    <P>I am glad that it is the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, who is handling this matter, with the Minister for Local Government who is a neighbouring politician because there are few in the Oireachtas who would know more about the situation and the effects of what has been happening over the last few years than either the Minister of State or, indeed, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy John Boland.</P>
    <P>In 1969, under the Government of the day, there was an allocation of £3 million supposed to be to the Dublin local authorities for the purchase of land. Every penny of that £3 million &mdash; it does not sound a great deal of money today <Col N="678" /> but in the money terms of 1969 it was an enormous amount of money &mdash; was to be allocated to a local authority to build up a land bank.  That money was spent mainly in my area in Tallaght by the Dublin Corporation in purchasing large tracts of land.  In one particular area of Tallaght they purchased as much as 1,500 acres in one swoop.  Their main purpose in purchasing this land was to reduce the housing list of the city.  Nobody can blame them for that.  They have to make efforts to ensure that the people so much in need of housing in the city centre area should have their houses as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I believe that was a wrong policy.  It has taken far too long for the authorities to recognise the advantage of building up the derelict sites in the centre city area. That £3 million would have been far better spent if it had been given to the Dublin Corporation to do just what the Minister is proposing to do here today.  I am not referring specifically to the Docks site.  It is something apart.</P>
    <P>The derelict sites of the city have been deliberately allowed to run down, the buildings and the property owners have been discouraged in every way from keeping their properties in a habitable state.  It is the present Leader of the Opposition who was then Minister for Finance who allocated the £3 million for that purpose.  I am sure it was with every good intention thinking he was doing the right thing and probably on the advice that he was given.  I regret that that £3 million was not spent in the city because it has caused not only problems within the city area and particularly in the centre city area but it has caused enormous problems in the area in which it was spent because we were bringing thousands of people out of the city to dwell in a new community.</P>
    <P>We were breaking up the city communities. There are few who know better than the Minister how Dublin Corporation allocated those houses, the large corporation estates which they built in the county of Dublin.  They considered the city area as one unit for housing purposes. When they were allocating 200 or 300 houses in County Dublin, they took <Col N="679" /> half a dozen people from Gardiner Street, half a dozen families from Sean McDermott Steet and half a dozen families from East Wall, thereby bringing together members of various communites who have taken years to settle down in County Dublin.  They were depriving the city of the value of those people to those areas despite the fact that there was ample room within the city to provide for them therein.</P>
    <P>Let us hope now that that is water under the bridge.  Many of the problems which have been referred to by Senator Fitzsimons have arisen because of that policy.  We have now come to the stage where many of these people, who are anxious to get back into the city, have been given the opportunity, through the various grants, to hand back the house they occupied for the past few years in County Dublin.  Many of them have moved back into the city availing of the grants made available by the Minister.  It has been difficult for the corporation to reallocate those houses hence the burning of houses and vandalising of them as referred to be Senator Fitzsimons.  I am not blaming the Leader of the Opposition or the Minister of the day.  I believe the £3 million was allocated with every good intention but that to me was was the greatest curse that could have befallen this city.</P>
    <P>The Customs House site would never be developed in our time were it not for Government intervention.  This is exactly what the Minister is doing now.  He is ensuring that that extremely valuable city centre site will be put to, I hope, the best possible use.  It has been lying there for many years.  I did a tour of it, with other public representatives from the county area, five, six or seven years ago.  We were taken around by Mr. Hayes who was then in charge of the area.  We were shown what plans they had for the area, but, we were also shown the difficulty they would have carrying out those plans. I believe the Government are right in doing what they are doing now, taking steps in relation to this extremely valuable site, which has been lying derelict-for <Col N="680" /> many years &mdash; I think part of it is lying derelict for over 25 years &mdash; while the corporation were spreading their wings out into the county and causing the enormous employment and transport problems and, indeed, the social problems that need never have arisen if efforts had been made in the early seventies to develop this Custom House site and indeed, the other derelict sites in the city.</P>
    <P>The remission which the Minister has promised is for 10 years, I think, and that is good.  What he has not spelt out is what is going to happen after that.  It would assist those who will be taking part in this development to know, because ten years is not a long time.  People will be anxious to know what will likely be their treatment come the end of ten years.  In other words &mdash; I am referring to the rates remission &mdash; there should be an easy phasing in back to full rates.  We do not know what it is going to be like in 20 years time should they ever be on full rates. However, let the authorities of the day decide on that.  I should like the Minister to give some indication of the position at the end of the ten year remission of rates.</P>
    <P>Great caution will have to be taken. Here I should like to voice my reservations about this Bill.  It is taking from the local authority any authority it would have over an area within its jurisdiction and in that we are creating a precedent. I hope it is not a dangerous precedent because, first of all, I hope it is a success, but the danger in it being a success is that it is likely to be repeated, despite what the Minister said here today.  I should not like to see us putting into the hands of a small group of people full authority for the development of a vast area.  Some might say 27 acres is not a vast area but 27 acres at this location in the centre city areas is enormous.  On my reading of the Bill, this Custom House Authority will have full authority except for the Minister. The Minister, and only the Minister can change any plans they may have for the development of that site.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the plans must be presented to Dublin Corporation.  Dublin Corporation will have no power to change those plans.  Of course, there will <Col N="681" /> be the consultation before plans are drawn up with Dublin Corporation and, perhaps, other people.  Other bodies will be free to make a submission to the authorities, but nobody but the Minister will have authority to change any plans that this new Authority will have.  It is probably necessary to get the job done. I suppose if we had such measures relating to developments of all local authorities throughout the country, there is many another job that would have been done.  I think I could name an industry or two or half a dozen we could have here that we did not have here because of the planning process, because of objections of some bodies or some individuals.</P>
    <P>No matter how much we dislike it, it is necessary that we would keep the governing of an area with its people.  It is the one distasteful thing that I see in the Bill, that we are passing the responsibility for planning and generally for the development of a large area of 27 acres in the centre city, which is a prime area, to a small group of people.  I am glad that I am able to say this without knowing who those people are and I have no doubt that the Minister will exercise the greatest care in selecting these people.  I have no doubt that the Minister will select the best, the most competent people, as he would see it, to carry out that job.  Nevertheless, it worries me when it goes to a small group of people sitting around a table none of whom will be answerable to the people of the city, because Members of the Oireachtas or local authority will be excluded.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take note of what I am saying.  I do not know if this point has been made in the other House. I did not follow the debate, unfortunately. I was surprised to hear in the Minister's speech here today, that there were Members of the other House who wanted this authority extended to a larger area of the city.  I doubt very much if they were city public representatives.  Maybe they were and they could even have been of my own party.  I am speaking here somewhat in ignorance.  I was surprised to hear that any public representative, not knowing how this authority was going <Col N="682" /> to work out, would want to hand to a small body of people, the responsibility which has been with local authorities heretofore, with the Minister, with An Bord Pleanála and with local communities who will have no input whatever in what is going to happen on the Custom House site.</P>
    <P>We do not know who the chairman or the four members will be.  I am glad we do not know who they are because it leaves us free to criticise the measure rather than criticise the appointment of certain people.  I wonder if the Government or the Minister is wise in excluding public representatives, people who would be leading members of the centre city communities.  It does not, of course, say that he has excluded those.  The Minister has said that the Bill will not permit the inclusion of Oireachtas or local authority members.  It is very likely that leaders of the community within the city will not be included.  I think that what would be a valuable contribution from the deliberations of these five people will be missed. I hope that, as I said earlier, we are not creating a dangerous precedent, because I do not know how the corporation members feel about it; but the measure is certainly divesting them of all authority within that 27 acre site, a site which is now clear flat land ready for development.  It is sad to think that the voices of the people who have been most interested in the development of areas in the past &mdash; I suppose it would be unfair to say that they will not be heard &mdash; will not be heeded.  Those people can make all the submissions they wish but we have no guarantee that those submissions will be given adequate consideration.</P>
    <P>I have great confidence in what the Minister will do in the appointment of the five members.  No matter what Minister is there, I am quite sure that he or she will take every care in ensuring that the five members are, to the best of his or her knowledge, the best people to be appointed.  Despite that, I fear what might happen in the future; but I hope I am wrong.  I hope it is a success.  I sincerely hope that it can be carried through. I see a danger that it could be repeated <Col N="683" /> again and that local authorities could lose more and more of their authority to govern the areas in which they have jurisdiction. The best laid plans of mice and men sometimes start a rat race, and I hope that this is not going to happen. There is no doubt that many of the speculators and developers will be in to get the best possible value out of what is happening and more power to them.  I am not complaining about that but we have got to be very careful to ensure that the rat race which may start with this measure is kept under control and that we will see a development of the city of which we will all be proud.</P>
    <P>Many of the developments that have taken place in the city in latter years are not as pleasing to those who love the city as they could have been.  We have the city offices, which the Minister was so much involved in, as indeed many of us were and which are now erected and will be there for our life time and indeed the life time of our children.  A far better job could have been done in the design.  That is a different complaint from what we have been hearing about that site over the last few years.  Many wanted it preserved and whatever parts of it have been taken out have been put in the Museum adjacent to our own building.  Whatever items of interest of the past remain in the ground will remain there for future generations to dig up in 1,000 years' time or whenever.  That is all gone like water under the bridge.  I sincerely hope that great care will be taken in the development of further areas along the quays to give us far better architecture than was given in the new city offices.</P>
    <P>The road to the Patent's Office is paved with good inventions.  I do not know how one can control the architecture or the buildings that will emerge from the architects, drawings because if we had five people discussing drawings around the table all five would have a different impression of what it should be.  We are likely to miss the advice and experience of public representatives on this body.  I know it does not refer to the quays but it refers to the Customs House site.  I am <Col N="684" /> sorry it is not a bigger body.  I am sorry that city leaders, be they known political leaders or community leaders, are being excluded from the body.  It is a pity that that their voice will not be heard on the body and I hope that the Minister will see fit in the appointment of one of the five members to include people who will be at least near that body of people or near that opinion.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the finished product.  I had been trying to envisage, while the Minister and Senator Fitzsimons were speaking, how this development might turn out.  I was wondering who would be the people working within that area.  I am sure many of them will be housed within the area, that much of it will be residential development, and I welcome that.  I would welcome the day that I could come back to the city area on a Sunday and find people standing around discussing the events or politics of the day, the weather or whatever.  I regret that that has gone from the city area as compared to when I was a boy.</P>
    <P>From my experience of trips abroad, sometimes called junkets, my observations on the Continent are that we must be one of the worst traffic managers in all Europe.  I am not going to refer to the controversy we had last week of the roadway through the Liberties but I can refer to some road development in recent times.  I would hope that great care will be taken, now that we are bringing development into the centre city area, because if not it could adversely affect the measures which the Minister is proposing.  It will be necessary for people to be able move freely in and out of the centre city area, because it is one of the main considerations when a person is moving from one area to another.  It is certainly one of the main considerations that has prompted the movement of people, whom I referred to earlier from Tallaght, back to the city area because of the difficulty of getting in and out of the city.  At approximately 9.40 a.m. this morning it took me 12 minutes to come from the hospice in Harolds Cross across the bridge.  That should not be and I sincerely hope that the developments that will take <Col N="685" /> place along the city quays and on this 27 acre site at the Custom House will take every consideration with regard to traffic flow.</P>
    <P>Despite all the engineers' reports and investigations in laying and constructing roads in Ireland, I am afraid we have failed miserably in bringing about a greater flow of traffic.  We have the Nass Road which was built from Dublin to Naas.  We were told it would be a complete run through from Inchicore to Naas. I have not counted the traffic lights on that road but every two or three years there seems to appear another set of traffic lights to hold up traffic.  Belgard Road which is in my constituency is a dual carriageway with three lanes of traffic in each carriageway.  It covers a distance of just short of two miles.  Believe it or not, there are nine traffic lights in that short stretch of roadway.  I do not believe that could happen in any other country.  It need not have happened here.  I sincerely hope that the Minister whoever he may be, who will be examining the plans of this new authority will give every consideration to the flow of traffic within that area and in and out of that area.</P>
    <P>Many of the traffic problems in the city centre area would not have arisen if we had made provision for cycle lanes; some thing which nobody ever thinks of here. I raise this matter constantly with my local authority and I am endeavouring to have a cycle lane constructed with the Tallaght bypass but every time we made application we were shot down by the Department on the basis that the exercise would be too expensive.  Is too much attention being given to the expense factor when any proposal comes before an authority or before the Department? I wonder if too little attention is given to the long term effect?  Could it be ascertained how much more fuel is used because we have nine traffic lights on less than two miles of a dual carriageway in Dublin?  Is it false economy to say we cannot build a service road alongside that carriageway to bring those into three junctions instead of nine junctions.  Could it be ascertained how much less fuel we would use if we had cycle lanes in the city?  Could it be <Col N="686" /> ascertained how much it would contribute to the lessening of traffic congestion and thereby to allowing people to get on with their business and work longer hours rather than being stuck in traffic for what amounts to many hours in the year.  I know there is an urge in the Dublin people to cycle where possible.  I have spoken to many who say they take their lives in their hands when they cycle in this city.  I am fully conscious of that and I have great sympathy and consideration for cyclists when I am driving.  I do not cycle now but I did cycle many years ago. When I see cyclists, even today coming into town I give them sufficient room between my car and the kerb but every motorists does not have the same consideration, it is probably through lack of thought.  You find cyclists getting in between two laneways of traffic.  It would pay the city authorities, no matter what the initial cost, to put cycle lanes wherevery possible.  I hope that in the development of the city quays and in the development of this major site of the Custom House that such laneways will be provided.  I believe that would pay off in the long run.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to fly posting. The Litter Act has dealt to a great extent with fly posting.  The posters we see on the lamp posts are all illegal and have been illegal for a long time but at the same time have been permitted.  I include also political posters.  I do not think they should be completely excluded from the city scene.  They are part and parcel of every day life.  They are part and parcel of a democracy.  They are part and parcel of life not only in Dublin but in many other towns and villages throughout Ireland. I learned recently of the corporation threatening to take auctioneers, who regularly use such means of advertising, to court because of their insistence in putting up these posters which were removed at one time by the then Department of Post and Telegraphs, when the posters were on their property and we in political parties suffered as a result of that action as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have second thoughts with regard to the control of <Col N="687" /> litter within the area.  I am all for a clean city.  Bodies who act responsibly &mdash; charitable organisations or auctioneers, for instance &mdash; should be allowed advertise by way of fly posting so long as they control the size of their advertising on poles and locations around the city.  A charitable organisation could be assigned a certain number of days or a week or two to advertise a charity show.  Much charitable and social work results from advertising in this way and revenue is generated for charitable organisations.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the measures in this Bill being expedited so far as possible. The Minister should take whatever steps are necessary to put the new authority into existence and have whatever discussions are necessary with Dublin Corporation to ensure they do not hold up matters and that they can expedite the development along the city quays.  This is a measure which most people will welcome. It should have been been taken many years ago.  There is no time set in the Bill for the authority coming into existence.  I am confident that the Minister will be as anxious, and indeed more anxious than most people, to see the authority in existence, to see it work and to see this development get under way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the Bill.  It appears that the urban renewal momentum has been greatly encouraged by the package of tax incentives for inner city areas announced by the Taoiseach on 23 November 1985 and applied to Limerick and other cities by the Minister for the Environment, when on 25 March 1986 he designated in the case of Limerick a comprehensive and a coherent zone of 39 acres which would qualify for the special programme of tax incentives.  This package of financial incentives to promote urban renewal and redevelopment of a substantial area of Limerick city is an exciting and challenging development.  I would like to add that the Granary which is situated in the heart of this development will act as a flag-ship and as an anchor for the total redevelopment.  The <Col N="688" /> designated area in the case of Limerick includes such important areas as Charlotte Quay, John's Gate area and the very important river front area from King John's Castle to Sarsfield House.</P>
      <P>The basic objective of this three year programme is to stimulate investment in new building, in reconstruction, redevelopment and to provide a major stimulus for the construction industry which has the potential to expand output and employment in the short term and also to revitalise the inner city areas where there has been so much dereliction and decay during the last few years.</P>
      <P>In the case of the cities enumerated by the Minister today new life must be brought to these run-down areas of our cities and they must again become attractive areas for living, shopping and leisure pursuits.  In the case of Limerick city, Limerick Corporation have responded quickly to the recent Government initiatives on inner city development and redevelopment.  A team of executives from Limerick Corporation and the Shannon Development Company have been, and are preparing action plans, for the designated area.  They are also preparing a marketing plan for the city. Limerick Corporation see themselves, in the words of the Minister, as a development corporation, a development broker bringing together land owners, developers and potential investors and doing everything in their power to facilitate development and redevelopment proposals. Limerick Corporation are fortunate also, through a long process of land purchase, in that 20 of the 39 acres are in their ownership.  Discussions have been going on for some time in regard to the provision of residential and commercial properties in these areas.  Developers investing in these areas in the various cities will enjoy, as the Minister said, a special status with rates relief, capital allowances, double rent allowances and incentives for owner occupiers and the owners of multiple dwellings.  All these new incentives will be available in addition to the existing tax incentives for certain kinds of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised scheme of home improvement <Col N="689" /> grants with the special £5,000 grant for pre-1940 dwellings should also have a major impact on the inner city areas. Finally, I would like to congratulate the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Boland, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy O'Brien, for their great work and the commitment they have shown in formulating this new programme of incentives. This will mark the beginning of a new era for our inner city areas which have for too long been caught up in the spiral of decline, dereliction and decay.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Members of this House for their warm welcome for this Bill.  Some Senators have had reservations on a few points.  In contrast to the Urban Development Areas Act, 1982, referred to by Senator Fitzsimons, this Bill spells out specifically the kind of incentives which are available.  That is important if we are to get these off the ground.  There is not much point in designating areas without specifically stating the type of aid and help one is prepared to give.  I would be opposed to giving the power in the 1982 Act, and referred to in the other House, to a Minister to set up commissions in other areas without recourse back to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McMahon had reservations about the whole question of removing power from the local authority to statutory bodies such as the port authority. That is why I was keen in this legislation not to follow what was in the Urban Renewal Act, 1982, where Ministers had the power to set up commissions or statutory bodies by order.  That is not a good idea.  I am not against the principle of setting up statutory bodies.  They have a role to play.  We should spell out in this legislation exactly what we are going to do and try as far as we can to cost it.  In doing that, we would hope to allay the fears which Members have about removing power from local authorities.  When working this matter out I was chairman of the working party.  I discussed this with the relevant local authority and asked <Col N="690" /> for their views and explained why I was thinking of doing it.  They were not opposed to such action providing it was selective. The Customs House Dock site is a very special site.  It has remained derelict for a number of years.</P>
    <P>There were proposals and talks about doing something but nothing happened. Because of the physical size of that site no local authorities could have taken on that type of development on their own. By setting up an executive type statutory body we hope to get movement on this site very quickly.  Large bodies can become talking shops.  What we wanted here was action, which I have spelt out in the Bill.  I have already stated today the kind of authority required and the kind of people I would like to see serving on it.  I want to assure the House that we will be very objective in our approach towards selecting members for the authority to ensure that they have experience and a sense of feeling for the kind of development that we would all like to see for this site.</P>
    <P>This site is a jewel in our city.  It is a jewel that needs to be treated, polished and developed well.  It is because of the type of incentives we are allowing that we can have the kind of low density open type of development that we would all like to see.  When one considers that site, with the water element in it, it affords a great opportunity to do something magnificent. It will have a tremendous spin-off effect on the area.  In all the great cities today we see a decline in dockland areas. It has been narrowed down and that is giving rise to a new type of development in the docks.  We see this in the Isle of Dogs in England, in Baltimore, Boston and in other dock areas throughout the world.  Where you can get one good development in, it acts as a catalyst to further development on either side.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that about 100 yards from the main street of our city we have 27 acres which can be treated in the way we would all want to see it treated.  I would like to see 16 to 18 hours a day activity on this site.  That site has the DART railtrack running through it, <Col N="691" /> which means that people can come right in on the site for shopping, for leisure activities or for employment.  Residents can also move freely about without using their own transport.  That adds tremendous value.  I want to assure the House with regard to that site, that we are all very anxious that something of a very high standard should be developed here. That can be done because of the incentives. One of the good incentives is the one for the end user.  We always talk about incentives that suit the developer &mdash; and there are incentives here for the developer &mdash; but we tend rarely to consider the end user.  In this case the end user gets a double rent relief against tax. Basically, if he is making any profit, that means that he is rent free for ten years. That is a tremendous incentive to get people to locate there.  There is also the ten year rates relief which is a great attraction.  I am confident that this site will act as a catalyst to develop the North inner city.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of office development between and 1960 and 1984 in the Dublin area.  Only 15 per cent of all the development took place north of the river and 10 per cent of that was by one developer. The developers who might locate there did not see it as attractive and were prepared to pay high premiums elsewhere. It behoves us all to try and get a good mix.</P>
    <P>With regard to giving powers to statutory bodies, I have often thought that had we set up statutory bodies in the formulation of our new towns, particularly satellite towns around the city, it might have been a far better approach than leaving them with local authorities who had a lot of other work to do.  I am not averse to having statutory authorites nor am I averse to setting up another authority next week or the week after if I thought it would be a help in doing a particular job in a particular area. Indeed, we are contemplating doing something like that in the near future. What we will be doing will also enhance our capital city and, while some of us are critical of what has gone on, we are all <Col N="692" /> proud of a lot of it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other designated areas, first of all we approached Dublin, Cork and Limerick and then we further included the Waterford and Galway areas.  They are the five county borough areas of our country and we believed that they all needed some incentive.  One of the problems in Dublin is the quays, an area which needs a lot of treatment.  I appeal to people in the building industry, developers and all the people who are interested in development to look at our proposals, to look at the tax breaks in them.  When they examine them fully they will see that they hold tremendous opportunies to develop the areas of the quays and a large portion of North inner city.  There is something over 160 acres. Senator McMahon was worried about taking something from the local authority. We are not taking all that much, 27 acres, but we are giving them the responsibility in the Dublin area of looking after 160 acres.  If they do that they will have plenty of work and plenty of opportunity to show their paces in developing it.  There is also over 80 acres of dereliction in Cork.  These are not the only areas of dereliction in these cities but, having talked to the local authority officials in each of the areas and to my own officials, these were the areas we believed would act as the catalyst to get something moving and eradicate the dereliction which exists in so many of our cities, I am confident that as soon as this legislation is passed through this House we will be able to get the local authorities in the respective areas moving to become real development agencies in getting what we all want to see done.</P>
    <P>The question of derelict sites came up. It is something that exercises all our minds from time to time.  Before the end of the year we will be bringing in legislation to deal with this matter, because it is long overdue.  Senator Fitzsimons said that it was in our Programme for Government. One of the problems is that it takes some time to assemble a site and also to assemble the necesary finance.  We will be bringing in legislation.  Local authorities have a major role and responsibility in <Col N="693" /> ensuring that they are not the people responsible for holding up derelict sites. The legislation we bring in will ensure that they will have to play their role as well.  I set out a number of things I wanted to see local authorities taking on board, like improving the environment, tree and shrub planting, street cleaning, postering. I would like to see care taken of these designated areas so that investors will be encouraged to come in.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Members for their warm welcome for this Bill.  We would like to see things moving quickly in all of the areas.  For the designated areas it is a three year programme and for the port and docks and it is a five year period, after the plan is made.  I would see an extension being required here because of the magnitude of the development but that will be taken on board if necessary.  I hope we will see positive development taking place to eradicate the decay, to make our respective cities better places, more attractive for people to reside and work in.  I hope that cities will become, as Senator McMahon said, places where you can go on a Sunday morning and meet the local people in a relaxed manner without looking over your shoulder.  With what we have achieved in this legislation, that will happen. Cities will become living entities in a positive way over the next three to five years. While I categorically stated that we would not be extending these, that would not be the best last word.  If they are successful one will then look further down the road.  Success will breed success. If it requires the same sort of injection that is what we should do.  I thank the Senators for their warm welcome for the Bill.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill establishes a new procedure for investigating and adjudicating on complaints from the public about the conduct of members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The procedure will be operated by a complaints board which will be independent in the exercise of its functions. Although investigation of complaints will continue to be carried out by the gardaí, the chief executive of the board, or some person acting on his behalf, may investigate a complaint if the board considers that the Garda investigation has not been, or is not being, properly carried out or that the public interest requires that the complaint should be so investigated. Provision is also made for tribunals to adjudicate on complaints which may disclose a breach of discipine.  A member who is dissatisfied with a decision of a tribunal may appeal to an appeal board.</P>
      <P>These are the main features of a Bill which implements the undertaking given by the Government in the programme it adopted on taking office that an effective independent complaints procedure would be established to safeguard the interests of both the public and the gardaí, who are often the subject of false allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, when circulating the Criminal Justice Bill the Government gave a commitment that those of its provisions which gave increased powers to the Garda would not be brought into operation until new procedures for the handling of complaints against gardaí <Col N="695" /> were in operation.  Senators will recall that this House amended the Bill to write that commitment into it and to make the operation of these provisions also dependent on the making of regulations for the treatment of persons in Garda custody in accordance with section 7 of that Bill. Proposals for these regulations have been published as a White Paper and they have been discussed in the Dáil.  A motion taking note of the proposals is on the Seanad Order Paper and I hope it will be debated in the very near future.</P>
    <P>There have been discussions with the Garda representative associations both before and since the publication of the Bill.  The discussions proved to be extremely useful and not only led to adjustments which were, by any objective standard, improvements but also increased the level of acceptability of the proposals.  That is not to say that some areas of disagreement do not remain but I think I can say that the gardaí accept the principle of, and the need for, an independent element in the procedure for handling complaints by members of the public as being likely to vindicate members who are wrongfully accused of misbehaviour and also to improve their relationship with the community of which they are part.</P>
    <P>In addition, further improvements were made as a result of the views put forward in the Dáil in the course of constructive debates on the second and committee stages of the Bill.  There was no disagreement on the principle of the Bill by any of the Members of that House. Where we agreed to differ was mainly in relation to the presence of the Garda Commissioner or his representative on the complaints board and, to a much lesser extent &mdash; in the sense that the opposing view was advanced by only a few Deputies &mdash; in relation to the gardaí carrying out the investigation of complaints.</P>
    <P>Before the Bill was finally drafted, these two issues had been discussed in both Houses during the closing stages of the Criminal Justice Bill debate and the Government gave careful consideration <Col N="696" /> to the views that had been expressed.</P>
    <P>On the question of including the commissioner or his representative on the board, it seemed to the Government that there was a compelling case for doing so. The commissioner is the chief officer of a disciplined force.  He is the custodian of its good name.  Conferring on any outside body powers in relation to the investigation of complaints and the imposition of disciplinary action on members necessarily involves some diminution of his authority in this respect.  That is unavoidable but to exclude the commissioner from any role at all in the consideration of complaints against his members would, in the Government's view, be bound to undermine seriously his authority and have adverse effects on morale and discipline. I believe that the Bill strikes the right balance.  Although, inevitably, his role in disciplinary matters will be weakened, the fact that he will be represented on the complaints board as well as on disciplinary tribunals will preserve his position to the maximum extent consistent with introducing a decisive independent voice into the complaints procedure. In the complaints board his representative will be one of nine members.  On a tribunal, which has power to determine the disciplinary action to be taken, he will be one of three.</P>
    <P>Apart from the need to have the commissioner represented on the board for the reasons I have mentioned, I believe his presence is also necessary in the interests of avoiding friction in the actual operation of the scheme.  A situation where the board would be operating at arm's length from the commissioner's office would, it seems to me, be likely to give rise to misunderstandings, friction and resentments &mdash; the classic &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; syndrome.  That cannot happen, or at least is less likely to happen, when the commissioner is represented on the board and is in a position to sort out any problems of this kind that may arise from time to time.  It is in his interest, as chief officer, that any genuine complaints are investigated thoroughly and fairly and for that reason his role as a member of the board must only be supportive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> The other matter which was criticised in the Dáil was the fact that the investigation of complaints would continue to be carried out by the gardaí.  It was said that the public could have no confidence that such investigations would be impartial or thorough.  It was suggested that the investigation should be taken out of their hands and left to a team of independent investigators attached to the board. Those who make this case ignore the very serious practical objections there are to it.  First of all, many of the complaints alleged against gardaí amount to allegations of criminal offences &mdash; assault and the like.  These allegations have to be investigated in the same way as any criminal offence, and the investigation has to be subject to the control and directions of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I do not think it right that criminal offences should be investigated by civilian investigators and, in any case, the gardaí are entitled to be treated in this respect in the same way as other members of the public suspected of criminal offences. Second, it would be extremely difficult to recruit civilian investigators of the requisite experience for the task.  It was said that retired gardaí would be suitable but I do not see how it can be argued that gardaí up to retirement could not have the confidence of the public but would undergo a complete change of attitude towards their former colleagues on retirement. As a practical matter, the size of the civilian team would not be large enough to provide adequate career prospects for persons of the calibre required.</P>
    <P>All in all, I think the Bill has adopted the correct approach.  The Garda will continue to investigate complaints but investigating officers will be subject to supervision by the board and be liable to produce such supplementary reports as it may require and to carry out any directions it may give after consultation with the DPP if a criminal offence is involved. In addition, as I have said, if the board thinks that the Garda are not investigating a complaint properly, it can request the chief executive to investigate it himself. I do not expect that this power would have to be exercised very often but it is <Col N="698" /> there and it provides a substantial measure of reassurance to the public that their interests will be fully protected.</P>
    <P>As I have said, a number of amendments were made as a result of views put forward in the Dáil and outside it as well as during the discussions with the Garda representative associations.  I should like to mention the most important of them. A Fourth Schedule has been added to the Bill listing the particular breaches of Garda discipline about which a member of the public may complain.  I believe that Senators, and the public generally, will find that a more convenient arrangement than having to refer to the breaches specified from time to time in the Garda discipline regulations, especially when some of those breaches are of purely internal concern, such as disobedience of orders or other conduct prejudicial to discipline.</P>
    <P>The membership of the complaints board has been increased from seven to nine members to enable arrangements to be made to ensure that members of the board serving on a disciplinary tribunal will not have had any previous involvement in the cases coming before them.  I was not fully convinced of the need for this amendment because the function of a member of the board is simply to decide whether a breach of discipline may be disclosed whereas it is for a tribunal, having heard all the evidence, including the case for the member concerned, to decide whether a breach of discipline has in fact occurred.  However, the Garda associations attached particular importance to this aspect and they made what seemed to me an impressive case for the amendment.  Although some members of the board will not participate on the investigative side so as to be available for membership of tribunals, they will be available to take part in collective discussion. The Garda Commissioner or his representative on the board will not be eligible to serve on a tribunal but provision has been made for the commissioner to nominate for this purpose a chief superintendent or a member of higher rank who has not been involved <Col N="699" /> in the investigation of the complaints in question.</P>
    <P>Another amendment confined the requirement on gardaí to furnish information to matters arising in connection with the performance of official functions.  And specific provision was made for prohibiting the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information by members of the complaints board or appeal board or by members of the staff. That is in section 12 of the Bill.  Finally, it is being made clear that a person who makes a complaint to the gardaí, rather than to the complaints board itself, will be presumed to wish to have his complaint considered by the board unless, at the time of making the complaint, he or she requests otherwise in writing.  This will allow complainants to specify that they wish their complaints to be dealt with by the Garda themselves.  Presumably they would do so in the case of minor complaints which they felt could be dealt with adequately by a rebuke to the member concerned from a superior.  On the other hand, it ensures that every other complaint will be subject to the board's supervision and, where necessary, to adjudication by a disciplinary tribunal of the board.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are in sections 4 to 11.  Senators will see that persons can make complaints by writing or calling to the office of the board or to any Garda station or to one of the Garda commissioners &mdash; this latter provision is intended to cover letters of complaint addressed to the commissioner at Garda headquarters.  All complaints intended for the board, however and wherever made, will be examined by the chief executive for admissibility.  Admissible complaints will be sent to the commissioner who must first consider whether they are suitable for informal resolution. I believe that many minor complaints, if justified, can be disposed of by an explanation and an expression of regret.  However, each case of informal resolution will be subject to scrutiny by the board, and it can require the complaint to be formally investigated if it thinks that it was not <Col N="700" /> suitable for informal resolution.  In any event, informal resolution is not possible in criminal cases or where either the complainant or the member concerned does not consent in writing to it.</P>
    <P>Section 6 details the procedure for a formal investigation.  It provides that the board must supervise generally the investigation and may give directions to an investigating officer.  It must consult with the DPP in relation to the investigation of any complaints which may constitute a criminal offence.  This is the section which contains the board's power to have an investigation carried out by the chief executive or some other person if the board considers that the public interest requires it or that the Gardaí have not carried out the investigation properly.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the various options open to the board after it has considered the report or reports of the investigating officer and the comments and recommendation of the chief executive.  If it considers that the conduct alleged may constitute an offence, it must refer the matter to the DPP.  If it thinks that neither an offence nor a breach of discipline is disclosed or that the complaint is otherwise not admissible, it takes no further action.  If it thinks that only a minor breach of discipline is disclosed and that it could appropriately be dealt with informally by the Commissioner by way of advice, admonition or warning, it refers the matter to the Commissioner. And if it thinks that a breach &mdash; other than such a minor breach &mdash; may be disclosed, it refers the matter to a tribunal.</P>
    <P>However, it may not refer a case to either the Commissioner or a tribunal if the breach is in substance the same as an offence of which the member concerned has been convicted or acquitted.  That is the &ldquo;double jeopardy&rdquo; rule, now set out in statutory form in subsection (7).  In relation to a conviction, this means that the member is not to be tried again before a disciplinary tribunal for the same or substantially the same offence.  However, the fact that the member has been convicted is itself a breach of discipline necessitating consideration by a tribunal <Col N="701" /> of the member's suitability for retention in his or her present grade or, in a serious case, in the Force itself.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) of section 7 provides that a member of the Garda Síochána who has refused to answer a question or furnish information during the investigation of a complaint may subsequently be required to do so in certain limited circumstances. Before this provision can be invoked, there must be no possibility of criminal proceedings arising in connection with the conduct referred to in the complaint and the conduct must have arisen in connection with the performance of the member's official duties.  The investigating officer must also inform the member concerned that he is acting in accordance with this subjection and that any answer the member gives will not be admissible in evidence against the member or his or her spouse in any proceedings whatsoever other than disciplinary proceedings against that member.</P>
    <P>I believe this is an appropriate provision to have in a measure which is designed to enable complaints by the public to be properly investigated.  It does no more than place the gardaí in the same position as any employee in the public or private sector who is asked to give an explanation or his or her conduct following a complaint about it.  It is a provision which I expect will be used only rarely but it seemed right to the Government to take the opportunity presented by the introduction of this measure to set out in statutory form the position in this respect, together with the safeguards I have referred to.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 8 and 9 about tribunals do not, I think call for special comment except, perhaps, to say that decisions of tribunals must be implemented by the Commissioner or, in the case of dismissals of members above the rank of inspector, by the Government. Sections 10 and 11 are concerned with the appeal board which will hear appeals from members against decisions of tribunals &mdash; either a decision finding a member to be in breach of discipline or a decision that disciplinary action should be taken or both.  The appeal board will have a <Col N="702" /> circuit court judge as chairman, a practising lawyer and one other member who is not a serving or retired member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The remaining provision to which I would like to invite attention is section 13.  It provides for the board making an annual report about its activities and it goes on to specify that the board may include in that report information and comment in relation to any matters which come to its notice and to which it considers that the attention of the Minister for Justice should be drawn.  Moreover, the board is obliged to keep under review the working of the system of investigation and adjudication of complaints and to make a report on it to the Minister not later than three years after its establishment and at least once during every subsequent period of three years.  In addition, the Minister for Justice is empowered to request the board to report to him on such general matters relating to its functions as he may specify. These provisions are designed to promote public confidence in the procedure by encouraging the board to make its reports as informative as possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would hope that this House, too, will endorse the Bill in principle as providing an adequate framework for dealing with complaints from the public about the conduct of the members of the Garda Síochána.  If there are any points of detail that Senators may wish to have me comment on, I shall endeavour to do so when replying and, in any event, I shall consider them between now and Committee Stage.  In the meantime I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill two years ago, when weighing up the necessity for the very onerous provisions which were in that Bill &mdash; they seemed to many people to be the most onerous provisions of this kind that had been introduced for 40 or 50 years &mdash; we had to have regard, firstly to the increasing crime and the case that was made for the new provisions that were provided in the Bill.  Secondly, we <Col N="703" /> had to have regard to the fact that some of these provisions undermined the civil liberties to which the public were entitled and which had existed up to that time. During the course of that debate we agonised whether the Bill was going too far.  I am sure some people may perhaps have felt it was not going far enough. One of the features of the debate, and certainly one of the determining factors of the debate, was an undertaking given by the Minister at that time to introduce a complaints procedure of some kind. This was very important because some of the new provisions were quite evidently provisions which could easily be abused. It was essential that procedures would be readily available to deal with the situation if these provisions were abused.  Originally, the introduction of these procedures was not tied to the Bill.  The Minister for Justice eventually agreed not to implement certain parts of the Bill until the Complaints Bill was passed.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Minister at that time for the fact that he acceded to this request.  It certainly made things a great deal easier for the House in discussing the Bill at that time.  I would like to refer to the fact that when this House comes under criticism as being unnecessary and redundant, that was something that was acceded to in this House, although the Minister had resisted it in the other House.  In drafting this Bill and in drafting the regulations in regard to detention, which are not before us, the Minister had no easy task.  It is his duty as Minister for Justice to encourage the Garda, to give them the powers they say they require, to give them the equipment they require and in every way possible to ensure that they can go about their job of curbing the ever-increasing crime.  But he must restrain them from exercising excessive zeal which would sometimes be to the detriment of civil liberties.  I acknowledge without question that it is an extremely difficult and very delicate task and certainly must be one of the hardest jobs the Minister for Justice has to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals with what constitutes an <Col N="704" /> offence or a complaint, how it should be investigated and the penalties which are laid down for it.  If the Bill does not go far enough, if it is inadequate, ineffective or too complex, the public will certainly feel aggrieved and in due course will feel not only that this Bill was inadequate but that the bargain, when the Criminal Justice Bill was introduced, has not turned out to be in their favour.  If the Bill goes too far, if it is too restrictive, if it imposes too many restrictions on the Garda, if it is vexatious or oppressive, then the Garda will certainly feel aggrieved and will complain that they are inhibited and frustrated in carrying out their duties.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Garda accepted this in discussions about this Bill.  He said that this Bill is not merely to ensure that the public, when they have a complaint, have a means of having that complaint investigated and having redress for any oppression they feel they have suffered but that it is for the benefit of the Garda, because if the complaint proves to be ill-founded then it will ensure that the gardaí involved will be acquitted of the complaint and it will be seen that the complaint was ill-founded and unjustified.  In any event, the Minister has a difficult task in holding the balance. I have no doubt that he will fail to please everybody.  It is probably one of the most difficult tasks he has, when all over the world, particularly in democratic countries, we have to hold the balance between upholding law and order and ensuring that the civil liberties of the public are preserved in so far as this is possible.  The Bill, at this stage in general terms, appears to be a reasonable effort to hold the balance between these two situations.  It provides for a complaints board, a tribunal, for an appeals board. It provides how complaints are to be made and investigated and sets out in the Schedules the composition of procedures of the board and tribunal and the conduct covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The details of the Bill should be dealt with on Committee Stage.  It is very largely a Committee Stage Bill.  If I have to make a criticism of the Bill I suppose it <Col N="705" /> is strange criticism to come from a lawyer &mdash; it is that this Bill seems to go into too much detail.  It seems to be an attempt by the draftsman to cover every possible eventuality and possibly ends up by being a bit too complex.  I admire, on the one hand, the ingenuity and hard work of the Department of Justice, the Minister and the parliamentary draftsman in trying to cover every possible eventuality.  But it seems to me for a relatively simple problem to be extremely long and complex. This may be a good thing, or it may have the effect of deterring people from attempting to exercise their rights under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into detail, but I will take one example of that.  Section 4 deals with who may make a complaint.  It says that any member of the public who witnesses any conduct of a member and who wishes to have a complaint concerning the conduct considered by the board shall himself or through his solicitor or, in the case of a person under the age of 17 years, through his parent or guardian, or, in the case of a person who is mentally handicapped or mentally ill, through a parent or guardian or some other person interested in his welfare, make a complaint thereto orally.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, all very helpful, but it is unnecessary.  There are, I am sure thousands of Bills where a member of the public is entitled to take action of this kind.  It is accepted that if he is not of mature age or if he is not fully capable of exercising his rights, then it is taken for granted, that if he is a person of that kind, he takes action through the appropriate people acting on his behalf.  That is merely an example of where this Bill perhaps goes a little bit too far in spelling out all the details and all the ways in which action can be taken.  It is not a criticism so much as the fact that it goes unnecessarily far and that it could in the end lead to people being deterred from proceeding under the Bill because it seems to be needlessly complex.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> I am sure this is something that will not happen, that those who want to make a complaint will make it in a simple way, will either call to a Garda station write to the Commissioners or something of that kind and that from there on the procedures will be implemented in the normal way.  In general terms this is a very reasonable effort to meet the needs of this kind of Bill.  It certainly represents an effort to live up to what we asked the Minister at the time to do, when the original Bill was introduced.  It is mainly a Committe Stage Bill, but in general terms it is acceptable and very welcome.</P>
