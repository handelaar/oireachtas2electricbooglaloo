      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Lynch that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the progress to date in the renovation work to the Garda barracks, Oldcastle, County Meath, since the matter was raised in the House on the 20 November 1985.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Thomas Hussey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the extension to Lavally school, Tuam, County Galway.</P>
      <P>I regard both matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Lynch's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken from 7.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  Senator Hussey may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take <Col N="1330" /> Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and 8 together.  It is proposed to take a luncheon break at a convenient time in the business.  The reason the Courts Bill, No. 2, which is high on the Order Paper, is not being taken is that there is a possibility of an additional Government amendment and the consideration of it is not complete.  It will be taken next week.</P>

      <P>I have received an amendment to section 18 of the Companies Bill, but I received it only this morning.  The Chair should have had it on Monday morning.  I am allowing it under the section as we will have a Government amendment coming in for the Courts Bill this evening, which is not giving due notice to the Members of the Seanad.  I am apologising to the Members but it was not my fault.</P>

The Courts Bill is not ordered for today because we wish to give the amendment full consideration and to give full notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a number of questions in regard to section 2, and I suppose if we ask them one a a time it will be easier rather than putting them all together on a string. <Col N="1331" /> Many of the comments I have to make on the Bill will be eliciting information from the Minister rather than disagreeing with him, because substantially we are all in agreement with regard to the need for the Bill.  Section 2 (1) (a) states that: &ldquo;the Act shall not apply to: a company not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members.&rdquo;.  I understand that.  Does that mean that any company which for the time being is not trading is also not covered by the Act?  You could have a company which is set up for the purposes of gain.  Senator Honan and myself might establish a company for the manufacture of garden gnomes, but we decide not to go into operation until the year 1990, or something would happen that we would not go into operation until the year 1990. Between this and 1990 would we be a company not trading for the acquisition of gain by members?  It does not say &ldquo;a company whose objects include not trading for the acquisition of gain.&rdquo;  It just says &ldquo;a company that is not trading for the acquisition of gain by its members.&rdquo; I would like to ask the Minister whether such a company is in fact covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The company which is trading for eventual gain would not come under this subsection. What we are trying to achieve here is clarity and definition.  The company you mentioned is one that would be intending to have gain for its members ultimately.  The definition we have used here is quite clear: it means a company not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members.  The company you raised, by way of example, would be intended for gain by the members either by way of the distribution of profit or by a method of acquiring a capital gain.  So that would not be covered by this.  What is intended here is that in no circumstances could the members gain either by acquisition of profit or by acquisition on distribution of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister says and, of course, I agree with <Col N="1332" /> him that is a correct objective.  But that is not what it says.  It says that any company not trading; it does not say a company whose intention is to trade.  It does not say anything about its intention.  It just says a company not trading for the acquisition of gain.  It does not say anything about the objects of the company. It does not make any comment like that. Irrespective of the objective of the Minister or the intention of the Minister and the draftsman, the effect of that would be, in my view, that this Act would not apply to a company which for the time being was not trading for the acquisition of gain by members.  Therefore, it would have to fall back to the provisions of the 1963 Act.  That is my interpretation of it. I know that is not the Minister's interpretation. I want to warn the Minister because it is only fair that he should be warned.  I am not really upset about it one way or the other.  My interpretation of it is, speaking from the limited knowledge I have of the situation, that, irrespective of his intention, a company like the example I gave, not for the time being trading or which had never traded for the acquisition of gain by members, is not covered by the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The words in section 2 (1) (a) must be taken in their entirety. &ldquo;A company not trading&rdquo;&mdash; a dormant company &mdash;&ldquo;for the acquisition of gain by the members.&rdquo;  It must be read in its entirety.  If it is the intention of a company to trade with the eventual objective of getting a gain for its members, then it is not excluded under this provision.  That is clear.  It was a matter of definition.  We did discuss it in the Dáil.  We are satisfied that the words here are clear enough to have effect in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We will agree to differ on it.  I do not agree.  The example of the company I have given will not be covered by this Act.  The Minister has to go by his advice.  I am not upset one way or the other about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is it intended in section 2 (2) (c) that hire purchase companies and credit-sale companies should be excluded from <Col N="1333" /> the Act?  I understand about banks, but these are not really banks.  Why is it intended that it should not apply to a hire purchase or a credit-sale company?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of companies mentioned by the Senator are primarily covered by a different directive governing banks and other financial institutions. It is because they have their own directives that they are not encompassed in this directive, which is primarily intended for limited companies in the trading and commercial sector rather than the financial sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I refer again to section 2 (1) (b).  The Act shall not apply to: a company to which subsection (4) (c) of section 28 of the Principal Act applies.  Section 128 (4) of the Principal Act, which is the Act of 1963, gives a list of companies to which the section shall not apply.  It does not say the section shall apply.  How does that figure then with a company to which section 28 (4) (c) of the Principal Act applies, because all section 128 (4) does is to list companies to which something shall not apply? Between those two I am terribly confused. In the Principal Act you have a list of things to which earlier provisions do not apply.  It states in this Act that any company which falls within section 28 (4) (c) of the Principal Act, but there are no companies falling within that.  All it is is a list of companies which are excluded from the operation.  Surely it should say a company which is excluded by virtue of section 28 (4) of the Principal Act?  If you look at section 128 of the Principal Act, perhaps I am looking at the wrong section, subsection (4) of that refers to &ldquo;this section shall not apply to&rdquo;.  We are talking only about (c).  Surely what we should say is &ldquo;a company which is of a type mentioned in section 28 (4) (c) of the Principal Act&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite clear that this Act does not apply to a company to which section 128 (4) (c) of the Principal Act applies:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> a company, not having a share capital, which is formed for an object that is charitable and is under the control of a religion recognised by the State under Article 44 of the Constitution, and which exercises its functions in accordance with the laws, canons and ordinances of the religion concerned.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that we are exempting religious type companies.  That is the objective and that is fairly clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the operation will have the effect which he says.  I think it is the most tortuous way of doing it.  I just do not understand how anyone would draft something like that.  I do not think the Minister understands it either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot go into the mind of the draftsman.  I am sure he had good reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he had good reason.  Would the Minister like to inform the House why he thinks this Act should not apply to religious companies and also of course charitable companies which are covered by subsections (4) (c) and (5) (a) of section 128 of the Companies Act, 1963 which states:</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland may, if they think fit, by order exempt, either altogether or for a limited period, from the application of this section a specified company, formed for charitable purposes, not having a share capital.</P>
      <P>The company for charitable purposes having not had share capital, would the Minister remind the House why he thinks those companies should be exempt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The directive covers <Col N="1335" /> commercial trading companies.  The companies being excluded here are religious companies and by any stretch of the imagination could not be defined as trading for profit or gain by their members.  It would appear to be quite outside the scope of the Bill.  It is not my intention to have such religious companies encompassed by the Bill.  Religious companies are known as custodian trustees.  Their usual function is to hold diocesan property in trust, and indeed such companies are already excluded from the requirement of publishing accounts under the Companies Act, 1963, on the basis that the nature of their activities is sufficiently outside normal commercial activity so as to justify their exclusion.  It is considered that their exclusion from the scope of this Bill is even more strongly justified in view of the more onerous disclosures required under the Bill.  We are not talking about commercially trading companies and it is that to which we are addressing our minds in the context of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very concerned about the exclusions under section 2 (2) (b) but I am a little more concerned about paragraph (c), where, in addition to the religious exclusion, there is exclusion of companies formed for charitable purposes. In addition, section 2 (2) (c) covers not the religious aspects, to which we have already referred and which are covered by section 2 (2) (b), but also the charitable aspect.  Many of these charitable companies are fairly substantial enterprises in their own way.  It is fair to say that large sums of money pass through their hands.  Public accountability, in addition to accountability to the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests of Ireland, is to be welcomed. I refer specifically to those covered in paragraph (c) rather than those in paragraph (b).  Those covered by paragraph (c) are related and referred to in section 128 (5) (a) of the Principal Act, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland <Col N="1336" /> may, if they think fit, by order exempt, either altogether or for a limited period, from the application of this section a specified company, formed for charitable purposes, not having a share capital.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing at all about the religious aspect of it.  Having recognised what the Minister has said, that it is not necessarily within the directive, we are not confined to the directive because we can extend it. As far as I am concerned, companies formed for charitable purposes should not be excluded from the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The companies in question include organisations which assist the sick and the infirm and, as with religious companies, the exemption proposed relates to those or to such companies which do not have a share capital.</P>
      <P>Under section 128 (5) of the Companies Act, 1963, the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland may, by order, exempt such companies from the requirement of publishing accounts.  Where such an order is granted a sealed copy thereof must be sent to the Company's Registration Office and such an order may be revoked at any time by the commissioners.  This facility was included in the 1963 Act in recognition of the special non-commercial nature of the activities of the companies.</P>
      <P>There are only 23 charitable companies at present exempted under section 128 (5) of the Companies Act, 1963.  Since the Commissioners for Charitable Bequests may not be renewing these orders as they expire, the numbers exempt will be declining.</P>
      <P>I share, to some extent, the thrust of what the Senator has said in respect of public accountability.  From what I have said over a period of time, these exemptions will diminish.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1337" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another most tortuous section.  The Minister had an opportunity of going through it in the other House and I would like if he would bear with me if I make some errors in trying to summarise the position.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, a new list of provisions relating to the method of preparation of accounts is laid down in section 3 of this Bill.  They are being superimposed upon the requirement of section 148 of the Companies Act, 1963, which, however, is not repealed.  The extraordinary situation is that one has two sets of requirements running side by side. Having thought about it, the 1963 Act covers, for example, unlimited companies. Some residual obligation must be kept for unlimited companies and, therefore, it is not possible to repeal sections 148 or 149 of the 1963 Act and replace it with this one.  It appears to me that, effectively, one is talking about the reenactment of section 148 and section 149 in this particular case.  If I am wrong in what I have said I am sure the Minister will correct me.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw to the attention of the house the latter end of subsection (1) of this section, which appears most extraordinary.  It deals with what should be in the profit and loss account and I quote:</P>
      <P>...and, accordingly, in the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1982, and the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983, in relation to a company to which this Act applies&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) references to the said section 149 shall be construed as references to subsection (5) and, in so far as it relates to the said subsection (5), subsection (7) of the said section 149 and to the provisions of this Act corresponding to the other provisions of the said section 149, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, large portions of section 149 of the 1963 Act are being taken out. They are not being repealed.  Their applicability to companies covered under this Bill is being removed except in so far as it relates to subsection (5) of section 149. <Col N="1338" /> I am not actually disputing the details of it.  Surely, it would be much better legislation, if one is preserving part of section 149 under the 1963 Act, to reenact section 149 <i>in toto,</i> including subsection (5) and subsection (7) in so far as it relates to subsection (5), and have a completely new section 149 incorporated in this Bill from beginning to end relating only to companies covered by this Bill.</P>
    <P>What we seem to be doing is this. Without specifying, we are talking about provisions of this Act corresponding to the provisions of the section 149 of the 1963 Act.  That is very sloppy work. A person who tries to work out what the obligations are under the Act and who reads section 149 will find it very difficult to understand what the obligations are. In detail, of course, the obligation to have a true and fair view of the accounts will be straightforward.  This convoluted section at the end states that you disregard section 149 except for subsection (5) but you do not disregard subsection (7) in so far as it relates to subsection (5) which you are already told not to disregard. That kind of drafting is enough to drive anyone through the roof.  Nobody will be able to understand what all the company legislation is about.  That is where the problem arises and I would like to have the Minister's view on it.  I know it is a difficult point.  I appreciate that when it is difficult for me to grasp it may be difficult for the Minister and for everyone else to grasp but imagine how difficult it will be for someone who just picks up the legislation to grasp it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the references to which the Senator has referred appear to be complicated.  However, the accounting profession have examined the Bill in its entirety and understand it clearly. When one reads the Finance Bill, one gets tied up far more than is the case on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording to which the Senator refers is a catch-all provision to ensure that where section 149 and indeed the Sixth Schedule to the Companies Act 1963 are referred to in the 1963 Act and <Col N="1339" /> subsequent Acts, they shall be taken to refer, in the case of limited companies, to the corresponding provisions of this Bill, that is section 3 of and the Schedule to this Bill, in addition to &mdash; they are the important words &mdash; subsections (5) and (7) of section 148 of the Companies Act, 1963.  What we are doing is saving subsections (5) and (7) of the Act.  I know it is complicated and appears cumbersome but it is the easiest way of continuing the provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State quite rightly referred to Finance Bills and to income tax legislation.  To an increasing extent that is being helped by the production of the income tax Acts in loose-leaf form which, if it is kept up to date, means we have all the legislation together.  Unfortunately in respect of company legislation that is not the position. We are looking at Acts which are becoming progressively more difficult to understand.  I do not want to press the Minister any longer on that but I have a question on subsection (4).</P>

      <P>I take the Senator's point.  I am not in favour of complex legislation if it can be avoided.  On Second Stage the Senator referred to the possibility of having a consolidation Bill.  My reply was that because there are other Bills and directives in the offing which will cover the Companies Acts it is not possible to deal with a consolidation Bill <Col N="1340" /> at this time.  The attitude in Europe and in this country to company law limited liability is being radically changed and until the dust settles and a clear philosophy is established it is simply not possible to draw up a consolidation Bill.  As a result of that, we have saved two provisions of the 1963 Act and, while it is cumbersome, this is the only way we could possibly do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to lay people understanding any section of this Bill.  We found this in another Bill yesterday.  Where previous legislation is referred to why not include the relevant section in the new Bill?  In that way lay people might be able to understand it.  Is it intended that only experts should understand company law legislation?  Surely Bills should be drafted so that we understand what the said sections are about.</P>
      <P>I always listen to Senator O'Leary because he understands what he is at. Surely those of us who do not understand company law in full are entitled to have before us legislation which we do understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, we have tried to make the Bill as straight forward as possible but because of the number of Acts involved it is necessary to make references backwards and it is also necessary to use technical terms.  These terms are understood in the accounting profession and by legal people.  I understand that a consolidation Act was produced in this area in England.  It took three years to complete and contains 747 sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that. Trying to produce a consolidation Bill at this time would be extremely cumbersome. What we are trying to do here is to give effect to the Fourth Directive from the EC in regard to companies.  We have done a good job and as simple a job as is possible given the responsibilities on us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 (4) refers to subsection 1 (b) of this section and states that every balance sheet of a company must give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the company and also that the requirement for a true and fair view overrides the requirements of sections 4 and 5 in the Schedule to this Act.  With regard to the companies which publish their accounts in full other sections will allow a certain reduction in the amount of publications and there will be a problem in that area which we will talk about at a later stage.  Is the Minister comfirming that the format laid down in this Act has to be looked at always in the context of giving a true and fair view and that whatever additional explanations are necessary have to be given in order to conform with the true and fair view requirement?  Subsection 1 (c) seems to cover that where it says where a balance sheet drawn up in accordance with paragraph (a) of this subsection would not provide sufficient information to comply with paragraph (b) of this subsection to give a true and fair view any additional information shall be provided in that balance sheet or profit or loss account or in a note to the accounts.  Would the Minister confirm that if the format of accounts which are required to be filed under section 4, which is referred to here in subsection (4), is not adequate to give a true and fair view it will also be necessary in that case to give whatever additional information is necessary on the balance sheet, the profit and loss account or indeed in notes attached to the accounts?</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that the concept of a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company is the central thrust of and the philosophy behind the Bill.  Whether it is in relation to figures under any format in the profit and loss account, in the balance sheet or in the notes, everything must be based on the principle of giving a true and fair view of the company's affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 (1) (c) covers that in respect of notes to the accounts, which was a <Col N="1342" /> specific point made by the Senator.  Subsection (4) is a catch-all phrase, again simply to reinforce the concept of a true and fair view.  It is the anchor on which this Bill is firmly set down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that and agree with it.  Can the Minister of State explain why subsection (4) states that subsection (1) (b) of the section overrides the requirements of sections 4 and 5 but not the requirements of sections 10, 11 and 12 of the Bill?  That would seem to suggest that in so far as the application of section 3 is concerned, sections 4 and 5 have a status which sections 10, 11 and 12 do not have.  When you come to sections 10, 11 and 12 you will find that it also hedged around.  The Minister has decided not to include under subsection (4) the requirements of sections 10, 11 and 12.  I emphasise that subsection (1) (b), which deals with the true and fair principle applies to sections 4 and 5 and by implication that means it does not apply to sections 10, 11 and 12.  For the benefit of other Senators, sections 10, 11 and 12 relate to the limited forms of accounts which small and medium size companies will be able to publish.  Sections 4 and 5 are the full accounts to be published by all other companies.  This section applies to every company, small, medium or large.  Every company of any size must conform with section 3 leaving aside the question of limited liability companies. That is a true statement.</P>

By implication we are really saying that it does not override the requirements of sections 10, 11 and 12 of the Act and the Schedule which is appropriate to those sections.  I should like to here the Minister of State's views on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be a bit simplistic by referring to section 3 (1) (b) and it states quite clearly:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> every such balance sheet of a company shall give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company as at the end of its financial year and every such profit and loss account of a company shall give a true and fair view of the profit or loss of the company for the financial year.</P>
    <P>Even if the exemptions as mentioned in sections 10, 11 and 12 are there or if the balance sheet is reduced in its presented form, the true and fair view applies.  Subsection (4) states positively that subsection (1) (b) of this section overrides the requirements of sections 4 and 5 of, and the Schedule to, this Act.  In other words the true and fair view prevails.  In section 10 it states:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of section 3 (1) of this Act, but subject to paragraph (b) of the said section 3 (1), the directors of a company treated...</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <P>Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of section 3 (1) of this Act, but subject to paragraph (b) of the said section 3 (1), ...</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State seems to be under some misapprehension. Every balance sheet of a company must give a true and fair view under section 3.  The Minister of State must recognise that every company will now have two balance sheets, a balance sheet which is drawn up for the purpose of complying with the Companies Act and a balance sheet which conforms with the format laid out in either sections 4 and 5 or in sections 10, 11 or 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this section is saying is that you can have all the balance sheets you like which conform with section 3 but any <Col N="1344" /> additional balance sheets, the ones filed in the Companies Office, which could be different balance sheets because they would be in a different form, must, by virtue of subsection (4), also give a true and fair view.  Is that the case?  If that means anything why is it not extended to sections 10, 11 and 12?  If it means nothing then we can take it out.  If the true and fair view is meant to extend to sections 10, 11 and 12 &mdash; I do not think it can extend to these sections &mdash; why is there not a subsection (5) or why is not subsection (4) drafted in such a way that it says: subsection (1) (b) of this section overrides the requirements of sections 4, 5, 10, 11 and 12 and the Schedule to this Act and all other requirements of the Companies Acts?  Why is it necessary to re-emphasise it?  What is the legal effect of this section? If this section was not there what would be the legal effect?  If it has no effect and if it is intended by the Minister that accounts under sections 10, 11 and 12 should also give a true and fair view, will the Minister of State please explain why it is not mentioned?</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Senator's suggestion that there is need to make reference to sections 10, 11 and 12. Sections 10 and 11 specifically refer back to section 3.  In relation to sections 4 and 5, we put in a catch-all subsection (4) to ensure that in any form of the accounts presented and in relation to the accounting principles used, section 3 is overriding. In other words, we are reinforcing the concept of a true and fair view.  In sections 10 and 11 we have again a reference &ldquo;subject to paragraph (b) of section 3 (1)&rdquo;, in other words, though small companies will not have to put in a profit and loss account they will have to put in a balance sheet in reduced form and that reduced form must give a true and fair view of the state of health of that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to medium-sized companies though there would be certain telescoping of their profit and loss accounts and balance sheets, they must give a true and fair view of the affairs of the company.

      <P>This is to be the nub of our discussion on the Bill during the course of the day.  It relates to the exemptions for small and medium-sized companies which are a little confused. The Minister of State quite rightly pointed out when I was referring to section 3 (4) that the start of this section 10 makes everything which is subsequently permitted subject to paragraph (b) of section 3 (1) which deals with a true and fair view in respect of a balance sheet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance sheet will be prepared in the normal way and will give a true and fair view.  It will be available to all the people to whom it is normally available. Anybody who has a debenture with the company will obviously see the balance sheet and anybody who is in the normal course of events, able to see a balance sheet will be entitled to see it and that balance sheet will have to continue to give a true and fair view of the company. The purpose of the exemption is to aid and assist companies.  The view has been expressed &mdash; it is one I share &mdash; that the very fact of summarising the balance sheet in the case of small and medium-sized companies must automatically remove it from the true and fair view. Before a balance sheet can be prepared in such a way as to give a true and fair view at present &mdash; forget the amendment to the law &mdash; it would have to contain considerably more of the information which is envisaged under the small companies format for filing in the companies registration office.  The purpose of my amendment is to clarify that but this is a <Col N="1347" /> good time to tackle it.  The actual process of summarising it means it cannot give a true and fair view.  We are saying, on the one hand, to small companies, &ldquo;you need not file your complete balance sheet.  In fact, you do not have to file your profit and loss account at all.&rdquo;  On the other hand we are saying that that truncated balance sheet must present a true and fair view of a company.  That is a contradiction in terms.  I do not think it is possible for such a balance sheet to continue to show a true and fair view of the company's affairs, or even to take advantage of the summarising that is allowed.  In fact, I do not think it is possible for a balance sheet to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of a company without a profit and loss account being attached.  I do not know how you could have a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company as required in paragraph (b) of section 3 (1) which states:</P>
    <P>every such balance sheet of a company shall give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company as at the end of its financial year and every such profit and loss account of a company shall give a true and fair view of the profit or loss of the company for the financial year,</P>
    <P>They are inter-dependent.  I do not think it is possible to pick up a balance sheet and say that it gives a true and fair view unless you see the profit and loss account.  One of the important things which is needed in assessing the worth of a company and getting a true and proper view of it, is the profit for this year and last year.  Part of the process of assessing in a true and fair way the health of a company is to look at the profit and loss account.</P>
    <P>It will be impossible in the truncated form to give a true and fair view.  I said to the Minister on Second Stage that I think some people might exaggerate the significance of that but the problem which will arise in this regard is that the truncated accounts will be filed and everybody will be happy.  Unfortunately, as I <Col N="1348" /> pointed out to the Minister, some aggrieved party who has depended on this will take action as some time in the future. That will lead to a very serious situation. A true and fair view of the state of affairs of a company is not possible unless you have both the balance sheet and profit and loss account.  It is not possible where you have a truncated balance sheet because all you will be offering those people will be a truncated balance sheet in respect of a small company.  No matter what notes you have unless you publish the whole accounts you cannot give a true and fair view of a company's position with only a truncated balance sheet. Therefore, some amelioration of that obligation has to be devised by the Minister. Otherwise the position will be absolutely untenable.</P>

      <P>Small companies will, of course, be required to draw up their accounts and have them certified in the normal course.  We are requiring them to lodge in the Companies Registration Office a truncated version &mdash; the phrase used by the Senator &mdash; of the balance sheet.  I do not think it is necessary for a small company to include a profit and loss account in order to get a fair view of the company's position.  I would suggest that the shareholders' funds would be an indication of what their profits were in the previous year.  The accounts would have to be accompanied by a directors' report and by an auditor's certificate.  I do not think we should be going overboard in requiring great detail from small companies and I do not intend to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying exactly what I believe.  That is not the point I am making.  The Minister is a businessman and I asked him whether in assessing a company he would be happy that a balance sheet only would give a true and fair view of the affairs of the <Col N="1349" /> company.  You have nothing but a balance sheet, another balance sheet and another balance sheet.  Would that give a true and fair view of the company?  Could it possibly do so &mdash; even if it was a full balance sheet?  Would the Minister be happy to act as a businessman on the basis of that information?  That is what we would be requiring &mdash; it is more information than we would be requiring &mdash; from the general public to act on in relation to a company.  What we are proposing to give them is not the balance sheet of the company as it exists but a truncated version of it.  I am in favour of that.  I do not think they should get the full thing but I do not think we should put an obligation on the company or the auditor of the company to state that that is a true and fair view of the company.  We should place an obligation on the directors and the auditors to ensure that it is a proper summary of a balance sheet.  That is all we should insist on.  We should not put an obligation on them, which I believe is totally incapable of being met, that is that they take a full set of accounts, knock off the profit and loss account, summarise the balance sheet and in some mystical way that summary of one portion of the accounts of the company continues or will continue to give a true and fair view of the affairs of the company.  It is not realistic.  It is not going to be a true and fair view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two attitudes can be adopted in those circumstances by the directors and auditors of the company.  They can say: &ldquo;We cannot conform with this without publishing the full accounts and going far beyond what is required by the Act.&rdquo;  Alternatively, they can conform strictly to the format here but I believe that by doing so they then lay themselves open to personal actions as a result of them representing that this format continues to give a true and fair view of the company.  It could not possibly continue to give a true and fair view of the company.  For that reason I ask the Minister to seriously consider the requirements he has put in in section 10.  On the one hand he is saying he does not want the small companies to have to file too much &mdash; and I agree with that &mdash;<Col N="1350" /> but on the other hand he is drafting the regulations in such a way that if they do not go the whole hog and find much more than the minimum they are breaking the law and are leaving themselves open, not so much to prosecution by the Registrar of Companies because I am sure he would be quite happy with it but they are leaving themselves open to actions from disgruntled creditors of the company who, are relying on the truncated balance sheet as having given a true and fair view.  If they are subsequently disappointed they will have an action against the directors personally or the auditors.  There is no way that these truncated accounts could possibly give a true and fair view of what is the state of the affairs of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must differ with Senator O'Leary on a point of principle.  If a limited company comply with the Act they comply with the Act and therefor cannot be brought to court for non-compliance with the Act.  If the directors misinform or the auditors are not prepared to give a proper certificate then that is a different matter.  In relation to a small company the requirements under this Bill are quite clearly laid out.  The responsibility is on the board of directors to submit a report and the responsibility on auditors is to certify the accounts as a whole.  That requirement is still there. What is required to be lodged in the companies office would still give a true and fair view of a company's affairs.  In section 3 (1) (b) it is a balance sheet itself that is relied upon to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of a company and in relation to profit and loss we provide that it shall give a true and fair view of the profit and loss of the company for the financial year.  They are two distinct requirements.  We are talking about the state of a company which will be reflected in their balance sheet.  I accept that what we require from small companies is less than the full figures which would apply to a large company.  What is required in the Act is sufficient to give a true and fair view of a small company.  Over a period <Col N="1351" /> of time, where one can compare one balance sheet with another it would be possible to extract the trend, the direction in which the company are going.  I have facilitated small companies in not having to compile a comprehensive set of accounts but I would contend that what we are requiring of them in relation to the balance sheet together with the report of the directors and certification by the auditors will be and is sufficient to give a true and fair view of a company's state of affairs.</P>

      <P>At the moment nothing is required.  We are moving into a new phase in relation to company accountability and the publication of accounts.  I would suggest that what we are requiring in this Bill will be sufficient for those interested in the affairs of the company to acquire a good knowledge of the company's state of health and over a period, when one compares balance sheets, it will allow all people interested in the company's affairs to get a good view of the company as reported by the board of directors and by the certification process of the auditors.</P>

I would like the Minister to recognise in this Bill that in summarising the full balance sheet of the company &mdash; and summarising in respect <Col N="1352" /> of medium-sized companies the profit and loss account &mdash; that in itself may distort the full requirement of section 3 (1) (b).  I do not think any argument has been put up by the Minister against that fact.  I am not interested in the Minister looking for more disclosures, I want the legislation to be framed in such a way that it would provide protection for those people who are genuinely carrying out their duties, whether they are directors of the company or the secretary or auditors. I believe it is impossible that an abridged balance sheet can give a true and fair view in precisely the same way as a full balance sheet.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister look at subsection (1) again, leaving aside that other section which I find totally unsatisfactory? I am not saying I am right in my point of view.  I think my view is entitled to a rational explanation which I do not think I am getting.  Perhaps the Minister would explain to us what would actually be required in respect of small companies. It says that the directors, pursuant to section 8 (1) of this Act:</P>
      <P>may draw up an abridged balance sheet showing only those items preceded by letters or roman numerals in Formats 1 and 2 of the balance sheet formats set out in the Schedule to this Act.</P>
      <P>I am looking at the balance sheet Format 1 and it contains only items preceded by letters or roman numerals.  Am I right in saying that in the case of the balance sheet under Format 1 what would be required in respect of a small company is fixed assets, intangible assets in total, tangible assets in total, financial assets in total, stocks in total, debtors in total?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I give the Minister an example from that of why I think that a true and fair view may not be possible. If you look under the heading Stocks, you see it is divided into the following: raw materials and consumables, work in progress, finished goods and payments on account.  Leaving aside the payments on account which is a specialist thing which applies more to builders and contractors than to anything else, the Minister will be aware that of crucial importance in deciding on the solvency of a company &mdash; not necessarily on its profitability &mdash; is whether their work in progress or finished goods has increased in size.  The Minister will realise that in considering the balance sheet of a company, one year with the other, with stocks more or less the same size, a crucial difference is going to be whether it was in raw materials the stocks were high, in work in progress or finished goods.  From my experience when I was an accountant, one of the most significant indicators of trouble in a company was an increase in finished stocks.  That showed that the company were failing to sell their goods.  I am not suggesting that more information should be made available but that a division of the stock between work in progress, raw materials and finished goods is a necessary prerequisite for a true and fair view of a company.  For any company who will get themselves into difficulty over a period of time and where the balance of the stock, which may have gradually increased significantly has shifted from being raw material stock to finished goods &mdash; that will be a significant factor.  A company cannot show a true and fair view of their position without disclosing on a year-by-year, ongoing basis the relative value of their stocks under these headings.  What you would expect in a company who are prospering is reasonably high and buoyant work in progress and raw material stocks enough to keep them going for sometime in the future, depending on the nature of the trade, and small finished goods as they get stuff out.  What you would expect in a company in trouble is very little raw materials, because they cannot afford to <Col N="1354" /> purchase.  There might be very little work in progress because they were under pressure for cash and high finished stocks. The total of the stock in both cases might be the same but to say that the total of the stock gives a true and fair view is not sustainable.</P>
      <P>I understand that if the position got to an extreme the auditors would have to draw attention to that by way of a note but there are going to be gradations and graduations within that.  As a general good principle, if a company do not show a detailed analysis of stock, at least under the headings as required by the full disclosure, they cannot continue to maintain that the accounts which are truncated and which omit that continue to give a true and fair view of the company.</P>

In relation to a small company &mdash; I am talking about the balance sheet &mdash; the balance sheet total should not exceed £1.25 million and the turnover in the year is £2.5 million.  If you look at the balance sheet total of £1.25 million we have two essential elements, one is fixed assets which must be specified and the other is current assets which must be specified.  You cannot take one figure and say that the company will hinge on the amount of finished stock and say that that will mean the company are going or gone.  The turnover must be shown, the comparable figure for the prior year must be shown.  This would give an immediate comparison on the balance sheet.  When one takes into account what is required on the liability side of the balance sheet, that figure would show, say under H where you have a capital and reserves, so that you should be able to get a clearer view of the direction in which a company are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I will make is that the directors are still statutorily required to make the annual report and that must also be correct and true.  The auditors must also certify the accounts.  There is the ultimate requirement that the auditors can qualify accounts and to what <Col N="1355" /> extent they can qualify accounts will depend on the state of health of the company. For instance, if they feel that the company on a going concern basis is not to their satisfaction they will qualify the accounts and enter into their certificate a statement in respect of a going concern. The problems raised by Senators in relation to small companies are there &mdash; I accept that.  It may be possible that a company may not be going well but our safeguard mechanism in the balance sheet and in the directors' report and the safeguard mechanism of certificates to be issued by the auditor must give support to the accounts procedure.</P>

If I was on the Opposition side I would certainly oppose the section &mdash; not that I disagree with it.  I agree with it, but I think that the requirement that it should be subject to paragraph (b) of section 3 (1) of this Bill is not sustainable.  It is not workable or practical.

      <P>Everything I said about section 10 applies with slightly less emphasis.  Because the disclosure requirements of medium-sized companies are greater than the disclosure requirements of small companies, the amount by which the abridged and abbreviated profit and loss account will continue to give a true and fair view is correspondingly reduced but the difficulty I believe remains.  The difficulty remains and I think that the Minister should have in section 11 (1) qualified the applicability of section 3 (1) (b) in some way just as he should have done it in subsection (2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> In page 18, between lines 6 and 7, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(6)  In this section &lsquo;properly prepared&rsquo; in relation to accounts shall mean that the accounts in question are consistent with the accounts prepared pursuant to section 3 of this Act.  Any summary of or omission from the accounts prepared pursuant to section 3 of this Act necessary for the purposes of conforming with the formats for accounts prepared pursuant to sections 10 to 12 of this Act shall not mean that the accounts in question are not properly prepared.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is intended to ameliorate in some way the serious effects which I think would follow the enactment of this legislation in respect of the auditing profession. I recognise that the Minister and I already have had a long argument as to whether abridged accounts can give a true and fair view.  The Minister has a different view from mine on it.  On the previous occasion the discussion was in relation to the duty of directors.  What we are talking about here is in relation to the duty of auditors.  In order to argue for the amendment it is necessary to review what is contained in section 18 of the Bill.  I hope the Leas-Chathaoirleach will permit me to make that review of what is in section 18 because to move the amendment without doing that would be pointless.</P>
    <P>Section 18 requires that a balance sheet and profit and loss account for small and medium-sized companies should be annexed to the return of the Companies' Office and should be signed as required by section 156 of the Principal Act and contain a statement required in subsection (2).  The statement must be as follows:</P>
    <P>A copy of the balance sheet prepared pursuant to any of the provisions of section 10 to 12 of the Act must contain a statement by the directors to the following effect: (a) that they have relied on specified exemptions contained in sections 10 to 12 of the Act, and (b) they have done so on the ground that the company is entitled to the benefit of those <Col N="1359" /> exemptions as a small or as a medium sized company.  In other words, the directors must certify that they have relied on the exemptions because they were a small or medium-sized company.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, it makes clear that there is no obligation, in the case of a profit and loss account or a balance sheet prepared for a medium-sized company which it is proposed to deliver to the Registrar of Companies under sections 10 to 12 of this Act for it to be accompanied by the auditor's report, even though it would have to be accompanied by the directors' report.  But it lays down that it shall be accompanied by a special report of the auditors.  Having given the ordinary report the auditors must then give a special report where some exemptions are being claimed.  It says that it shall be accompanied by (a) &ldquo;a copy of the report made by the auditors of the company under subsection (4) of this section on those accounts (b) and a copy of the report of the auditors under section 163 Principal Act.&rdquo;  Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4, as far as auditors are concerned, impose a new obligation which boils down to what is contained in subsection (4).  Subsection (4) contains the following requirement:</P>
    <P>Where the directors of a company propose to annex to the annual return accounts for any accounting period prepared pursuant to sections 10 to 12 of this Act and the auditors of the company are satisfied that the directors of the company are entitled, for that purpose, to rely on exemptions specified in sections 10 to 12 of this Act,</P>
    <P>This is the part we are dealing with in the amendment&mdash;</P>
    <P>and that the accounts have been properly prepared pursuant to these provisions, it shall be the duty of the auditors of the company to provide the directors of the company with a report in writing stating that, in the opinion of the auditors of the company the directors of the company are entitled to annex those accounts to the annual return and that the accounts so annexed are properly prepared as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" />&ldquo;Properly prepared&rdquo; has not been defined.  It would appear that in the absence of a definition &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; refers to and reimposes the obligation on the auditors to certify that the abridged accounts give a true and fair view.  I should like the Minister, when he is replying to me, to say whether he agrees with that interpretation.  Does &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; in that context require the auditors to be satisfied that the accounts, as prepared under the restricted formats of this Bill, do give a true and fair view?  In other words, is &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; the same as a true and fair view?</P>
    <P>I am concerned if that is the case.  I am also concerned about the auditors being satisfied about the directors of the company, but that is a different matter, which can await the actual section itself.  In order to put the matter beyond doubt, and in order to clarify the position of auditors who, after all, will be dealing with a variety of companies, and will be much more likely to be sued by the general public that the directors would, I should like it to be clear what &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; means.  Therefore, I move the following amendment and it is proposed to add it as a new subsection under subsection (5), in section 18:</P>
    <P>In this section &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; in relation to accounts shall mean that the accounts in question are consistent with the accounts prepared pursuant to section 3 of this Act ...</P>
    <P>First of all, they will have to be consistent. In other words, they cannot be manufactured, they will have to be consistent. That does not get over the other point:</P>
    <P>(6)  Any summary of or omission from the accounts prepared pursuant to section 3 of this Act necessary for the purposes of conforming with the formats for accounts prepared pursuant to sections 10 to 12 of this Act shall not mean that the accounts in question are not properly prepared.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> Just because it is summarised does not automatically mean the accounts &ldquo;are properly prepared.&rdquo;  I could rephrase it to say that any summary or omission from the ordinary accounts of the company necessary for the purpose of conforming to the restricted formats, that shall not mean that those accounts in question are not &ldquo;properly prepared.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If, in good faith the auditors take the full account of the company and they apply the new format, in those circumstances we should protect the auditors from being the people who would effectively underwrite the affairs of the company in filing those abridged accounts with the company's office.  In the absence of that, in theory both the directors of the company and the auditors of the company will be liable at civil law.  We are not talking about criminal law.  We are talking about civil law.  They will be liable in tort if there is any misstatement or anything which could be construed to be a misstatement or anything which could be construed not to give a true and fair view.  While both of them are theoretically liable, in point of fact in a company which has gone out of business, very often only the auditor is a mark.  For that reason the auditor is the one who will end up carrying the can.  For that reason this clarification of the duty of the auditors with regard to that aspect of the section, that is, the aspect of the section which deals with accounts being &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; is one which should find favour with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Senator quite closely.  In relation to abridged accounts being submitted, this is what we are talking about.  The section states:</P>
      <P>...it shall be the duty of the auditors of the company to provide the directors of the company with a report in writing stating that, in the opinion of the auditors of the company, the directors of the company are entitled to annex those accounts to the annual return and that the accounts so annexed are properly prepared as aforesaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator stressed the words &ldquo;properly <Col N="1362" /> prepared as aforesaid&rdquo;.  It is quite clear. We are putting an obligation on the auditors of the company to provide the directors of the company with a report in writing saying that they are entitled to submit the abridged accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is central to the Bill and it does affect the amendment.  The registrar of the companies will have to rely on some certification to be satisfied that the company is entitled to submit an abridged form of accounts.  The person who is the professonal certifying the accounts is the auditor.  What we are seeking is that he provides such an opinion which the company is entitled to so submit.</P>
      <P>It is also clear from the content and wording of sections 10 (2) and 11 (2), (3) that the company is responsible for annexing the material to the annual return and is, therefore, responsible for the document conforming to what is required by the Bill.  Secondly, section 18 (4) as worded at present requires the auditors to satisfy themselves that the directors of the company are entitled to rely on the exemptions of small or medium-sized companies because they fulfil the criteria for turnover assets and employment levels.  It does not seem unreasonable to require this standard in a matter which determines whether a company can obtain an exemption or not. As for the requirement that auditors satisfy themselves that accounts to be published by small and medium-sized companies are properly prepared, that is, giving a true and fair view, this is unremarkable in my view.  I do not see why auditors would seek to have special treatment in this regard.  I should think it would be an ordinary part of their audit and that they would be able to advise the company as to what they are and are not entitled to under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always had a high regard for auditors and it is proper that their professional standing should be reinforced under the measure.  That is what we are doing here.  Perhaps, too much is being <Col N="1363" /> read into section 18 (4).  As stated on Second Stage, the problem, if it exists, is somewhat exaggerated.  In my view the section, as drafted, fits the Bill and fits the overall philosophy of the Bill.  There is no doubt that there is a chain of responsibility in any company.  The chain moves from the officers of the company and the board of directors of the company through to the shareholders.  The responsibility on the directors and officers of the company compiling the annual accounts, the responsibility on the directors having those accounts audited, making a report on those accounts, all assumes the requirement of integrity both in law and in accounting practice but especially in law.  It is entirely consistent with the thrust of the Bill that the directors would have to submit a report, and the required notes to ensure that whatever is in the profit and loss account and the balance sheet that would be necessary to reinforce a fair and true view of the company's state is available.  An auditor would be required to give his written opinion that the company are entitled to the exemptions and to submit the accounts in a truncated form.  All of that is entirely consistent with the thrust of the Bill.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fascinated because the Minister did not speak about my amendment at all.  He certainly laid out the position about the necessity for directors to satisfy themselves as to what their entitlements are.  I am not arguing that it is necessary for the auditors to ensure and certify that accounts are properly prepared.  Of course, it is necessary that somebody would certify that the accounts are properly prepared.  All I am seeking to do and which the Minister did not do, is to define &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo;.  In addition, I am seeking to restrict the definition of &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; to a particular definition and restrict it as to meaning that the accounts in question are consistent with the main accounts of the company and that any summary or omission from the accounts necessary in order <Col N="1364" /> to conform with the format does not mean the accounts are not properly prepared. All I am trying to establish is that what is meant by &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; in relation to the auditors is the restrictive understanding of that statement.  The expression &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; must mean something.  If it is not defined, it will be taken to mean a true and fair view.  In other words, not alone, as we argued in the past are we putting undue responsibility on the directors to give a true and fair view but we are putting the responsibility on the auditors as well in respect of this restricted format.  This will not be possible.  I am not arguing with the other provisions in the section at the moment.  All I am seeking to do is to define &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to be non-informative.  I was at pains to give a comprehensive view of what is contained in section 18 (4).  What &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; means in subsection (4) is that the accounts have been properly prepared pursuant to the provisions of sections 10 to 12 of this measure which allows the company to abridge their profit and loss account or balance sheet.  All we ask here is that the auditors would provide the director of a company with a report in writing stating that the accounts had been prepared properly and comply with the provisions of sections 10 to 12.  Of course, sections 10 to 12 refer back to section 3.</P>
      <P>It is entirely consistent with the views I have been putting forward all along on this Bill in that the auditors should not find it too difficult to be able to say to the directors of the company: Yes, we are satisfied that you can avail of the provisions of sections 10 to 12 and that the accounts can be submitted in an abridged form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see what the great problem is. Generally speaking, an auditor gives a certificate that he has access to the books and that the accounts give a fair and true view of the company's state.  The directors could not say unless they were satisfied that the accounts were properly prepared.  I am not saying anything other than in respect of the words used in <Col N="1365" /> section 18 (4) here which mean that the accounts have been properly prepared in relation to the provisions of sections 10 to 12.  This is not a major problem for auditors.  I do not think it leaves them open to litigation as suggested by the Senator.  If the company are to rely on the exemptions of sections 10 to 12, the measure should properly require an auditor to certify that the accounts were properly prepared in respect of sections 10, 11 and 12 and that the directors are entitled to avail of the exemptions.  I do not see this as a major problem or as being cumbersome on auditors.  I do not see the legal liabilities as suggested by the Senator falling on the shoulders of the auditors because of the references in sections 10 to 12 to section 3.  This is a simple requirement of a company seeking exemption.  The Registrar of Companies would be entitled to see that the provisions of sections 10 to 12 have been fairly used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that reply.  It is much clearer than his earlier reply.  The position is as follows: &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; means properly prepared pursuant to sections 10 to 12.  Sections 10 to 12 impose an obligation on the directors and, I think, by extension on anybody who certifies that the accounts have been properly prepared pursuant to those sections.  The reduced format accounts give a true and fair view of the company.  In other words, &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; means a true and fair view. This comes back to the view I expressed earlier.  I do not think such accounts can give a true and fair view.</P>
      <P>It is not true for the Minister to say that this will not give rise to difficulty.  He will be well aware of the fact that many representations have been received from the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies on this.  The Minister is also aware that he has received many representations as, indeed, all Senators have, too.  It is only right that it should be put on record what they think the position is. They are the experts.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, considerable objections have been made by the consultative committee of accountants which is a joint committee, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Certified Accountants in Ireland and the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants, the latter one, of which I am a member.</P>
      <P>Those three bodies come together and examine matters which are relevant to the accountancy profession.  They have particular expertise in that area and in the area of auditing.  They have made representations to the Minister in particular with regard to section 18.  They have made representations on the basis that section 18 poses significant problems for a high percentage of small companies which will be put into the position of having to file unabridged accounts, whereas it is clearly the intention of the Minister under the measure to permit small companies to file abridged accounts.  In other words, their summary of the position is that in order to protect themselves they are going to have to force small companies to file their full accounts, if this goes through.  I understand they made representations to the Minister that section 18 was a section to which they would like to make reference. This concentration by them on section 18 was quite separate and distinct from my own analysis of the position.  My analysis of the position was that this was a crucial section as well.  I understand that they have homed in on, quite coincidentally, and I say it is quite coincidentally because I drafted that amendment myself, on the question of whether accounts have been properly prepared.  I understand they have expressed the view that the provision will pose severe problems for small companies and their auditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true to say that these matters have been recognised as difficult.  I understand that they have, indeed, been recognised as difficult.  I understand also that the people concerned found considerable difficulty but not at departmental level, <Col N="1367" /> where I must say from the brief conversation I had with them, they got nothing but co-operation.</P>
    <P>Obviously, they were not satisfied with regard to section 18.  I think they had severe difficulty with regard to making the legislators understand the problems they were faced with.  That is a pity but it is reality.  They had severe difficulty in getting sufficient people to understand what their problems are.  That is a reflection on us and it is also a reflection on the fact that they went about it in a too technical way.</P>
    <P>Leaving that aside, it is important that we should recognise that these difficulties exist.  The Minister has been advised that small companies will not be able to take advantage of the exemptions he wants to provide for them.  The reason for this is that their auditors will not be able to say that their accounts give a true and fair view in the restricted format.  That will not be true in every case but it will be true in a significant number of cases.  The Minister should know that most audited certificates in this country at the moment are subject to substantial qualification and that will continue to be the case. Most accounts are subject to some qualification and these qualifications will become clear because the report of the auditors, under section 163 of the principal Act would be filed anyway and it is right and proper that that should happen.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is the feeling of the only body who represent the auditing and accountancy profession in this country that the definition of &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo;, if left unamended by this Bill, is going to restrict the beneficial aspects of the Bill as it relates to small and medium-sized companies.  I understand the Minister has been so advised.  All I can say to the Minister is that I share that point.  I am anxious to know whether he can assure everybody that that is not the case.</P>

I said earlier &mdash; and I do not want to repeat it &mdash; that &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; in relation to this subsection applies to the manner in which summaries of accounts are done, abbreviated accounts or whatever you like to call them, but that they are properly prepared in accordance with sections 10 to 12 of the Act.

      <P>Where the directors of a company propose to annex to the annual return accounts for any accounting period prepared pursuant to any of the provisions of sections 10 to 12 of this Act and the auditors of the company are satisfied that &ldquo;the directors of the company are entitled, for that purpose, to rely on the exemptions specified in sections 10 to 12...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view that poses a very strict obligation on the auditors.  The directors of a company should be made primarily responsible for that decision.  I have no objection to it being drafted in such a way that the auditors have to in some way accept it or agree to it but it appears to me that the way this is drafted it puts all the ultimate responsibility on the auditors of the company.  I think the ultimate responsibility should remain with the <Col N="1369" /> directors of the company and not with the auditors of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It places the responsibility on a company's auditors of having to attest to the rights of company directors to avail of the exemptions under sections 10 to 12 of the Bill in filing modified accounts with the Registrar of Companies and confirming that such accounts have been properly prepared and dealt with.</P>
      <P>I do not see any reason why auditors, who are in the professional consultants and professional advisors, the professional outside experts in relation to a company, should not be satisfied that the directors of a company are entitled to rely on the exemptions.  That is a necessary and fair balance.  I am talking about a balance here because directors may, for commerical reasons, want to do one particular thing, take undue exemptions, for instance, because it is classified a small firm rather than a medium firm.  It is a fair balance to be required in law that the auditors would have an input here to ensure that the Act is seen to flow in a fair way, In other words, that companies would not wrongly avail of small companies status when it should clearly be a medium company.  I see nothing unfair in seeking or requiring the auditors of a company to express an opinion that the company directors are entitled to avail of these exemptions.  I do not believe it places an undue burden on the auditors. For the fairness of operation of this Act it is a logical and necessary component of it that the auditors should act in a clearing house fashion which will determine whether a company shall be a small company or a medium company or whatever.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>There is only one other matter that I want to raise on the Schedule. On page 26, paragraph (7), reads:</P>
      <P>The amount for creditors in respect of taxation and social welfare shall be shown separately from the amount for other creditors and in respect of taxation there shall be stated separately the amounts included in respect of income tax payable on emoluments to which Chapter IV of Part V of the Income Tax Act, 1967, applies, any other income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, value-added tax and any other tax.</P>
      <P>If the Minister looks back at the Balance Sheet Formats, C.8 refers to &ldquo;other creditors including tax and social welfare.&rdquo;  Is it the intention and would it be in order to show the tax and social welfare as a note to the Balance Sheet Formats?</P>

I am speaking about the fact that there is a specific statutory requirement to show income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, value-added tax and any other tax and social welfare payments separately.  Is it necessary to show those on the Balance Sheet Formats or can it be included under C.8 as a total figure and included as a note?</P>

Time and time again I made it crystal clear that I was happy with the disclosure requirements and what I was seeking to do was to ameliorate the duties and responsibilities which were being placed on the directors of small and medium sized companies and their auditors.  I was not, and I made it quite clear that I was not, seeking the publication of additional information. For the Minister to say that is to misrepresent my position in a most disgraceful fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  To get back to the point I was making, I have no objection to the note being put on the accounts indicating what tax is due in general.  That is a proper area of concern for the general public.  Normally if tax is due there is a substantial amount of interest accruing on it.  It would be necessary to show that in order to give a true and fair view of the affairs of the company. But as to whether it is income tax, capital gains tax, value added tax, PAYE or any other tax I think it is quite unnecessary to show that.  If you show corporation tax separately on a year by year basis it would be possible to assess what the profit of the company is.  If the whole thrust of the limited disclosure requirements in respect of small companies is to provide some measure of privacy for those companies, this is doing away with that measure of privacy or that, together with the other requirements, is combining to do away with it.  I do not think there is any reason at all why these things should be separate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief.  I welcome the Bill.  While it is a short Bill I am satisfied that it is an important one.  It is a pity we did not have an explanatory memorandum.  While I welcome the Bill I am not sure that its speedy passage through the House is all that critical.  Perhaps there are other areas to which we should give priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone concerned with the status of women would welcome developments in this area.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights I have a particular interest.  The members of the committee are totally dedicated in this area.  There are many areas in which there is discrimination.  We have people who are very helpful and who come before the committee and, at the same time, we have people who resent this and <Col N="1376" /> who do not give the help and encouragement one would expect.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage we are talking about the background to the Bill and I am in order to refer in passing to the religion situation in this country.  The Minister said in his introductory speech that the Bill is important also in that it is another step in the elimination from our laws of unequal treatment based on sex.  I have referred to religion and the difficulty I have with regard to my Church, the Roman Catholic Church.  I believe it has done an enormous amount of work for women, in spite of the epistles and the letters of St. Paul in which he said wives should be subject to their husbands and so on.  The Roman Catholic religion and the Christian religion have recognised the dignity and the importance of women and are responsible in many ways for the special position of women in our society.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Catholic Church does not allow women to be ordained priests.  The seven sacraments are available in certain circumstances to men, but women may only avail of six of them. They may not be ordained under any circumstances.  This is a fundamental hindrance in the area of equality for women.  This same religion is concerned at present about the referendum, especially in relation to women, yet women may not be ordained priests.  There may have been a problem in this regard 2,000 years ago.  Nowadays it is very difficult to criticise so many areas.  We condemn associations, for example, golf clubs, who do not give equal treatment to men and women.  Yet the basic force in our society, the Catholic Church which sets the moral values and the values we should aspire to refuses to do so.  It is very difficult to convince many of these associations and groups that women must get total equality in a country where most of the people belong to the Roman Catholic religion and where the Church refuses to confer this equality on women.</P>
    <P>In my time women slaved.  In the past we have been commended for being a caring society, looking after the old and the infirm.  In many cases it was women <Col N="1377" /> who were dedicated to doing that.  Of course, now they expect more, and very rightly so.  This could be regarded as the cause of the problem of unemployment in some ways.  If women were content to remain at home as they did in the past and not pursue their talents we would not have the same concern in this area. Women want to develop and use their talents whether they are married or single.  This is right and proper.</P>
    <P>This morning I heard a short report on the radio regarding women in national schools.  They do not get the opportunities that men get to become principals. It referred to the woman in the home, carrying the baby, feeding it with a bottle and waiting for the babysitter.  The core of the problem is missed out when men have to make sacrifices.  If women are to get equality, men will have to settle for less jobs or even stay at home.  When people get married, some kind of an arrangement should be entered into by both partners which sets out their aims and objectives so that they can help one another in this regard.  It is very commendable that we should remove discrimination, including class discrimination. It is fair to say men have proved themselves in many situations because women were excluded from them.  We are now coming into an area of pluralism and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The question of Irish citizenship, which we are dealing with in this Bill, is very valuable.  In Article 40 of the Constitution we are told that: &ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law&rdquo;.  When aliens marry an Irish spouse once they become citizens they are entitled to be held equal before the law the same as people who were reared and spent their whole life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, is the parent Act.  People in the North, the partitioned part of our country, have an automatic right to citizenship and I believe many of them use the facility. We were concerned about the rights of British citizens living here to vote in general elections.  We gave them that right. People from the North who are residing here have a right to vote in local elections, <Col N="1378" /> but Irish citizens residing in the North do not have that right.  When we talk about citizenship, we talk about the kind of Ireland we dream about and hope to build.  We want to make it a place in which men and women who marry aliens will want to live and bring up their family. In that regard, we must try to solve the unemployment problem.  We must try to solve all our social problems.  That is regarded as proper and desirable by all of us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of equality for women.  At present if an Irish man marries an alien, as termed in the Bill, his wife gets automatic citizenship if she makes a declaration.  This is not by virtue of marriage alone.  Foreign husbands of Irish citizens do not have the same right. This is regarded as discrimination against women.  They do not have the power to confer that right in the same way as men do.  There is a three years waiting period from the time of marriage.  This was explained by the Minister in her introductory speech and is dealt with in section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the differentiation referred to by the Minister and which was dealt with by the Council of Europe in 1977 in their recommendations, the Government have been very generous. For example, they recommended:</P>
    <P>Not to require for the acquisition of the nationality by the foreign spouse of a national more than five years residence in their territory including not more than three years of residence after the marriage.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out all the options which were available and the thinking behind them.  She said:</P>
    <P>The option which the Government has selected is to give a right to citizenship to foreign spouses of Irish nationals provided that the marriage to the Irish citizen is of at least three years duration, that it is subsisting and that the couple are living together as a husband and wife.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to live in Ireland in <Col N="1379" /> order to qualify in this regard.  The Minister also told us that the Government had decided to give a right of nationality and &ldquo;it does not necessarily involve residence in Ireland.&rdquo;  I fully appreciate that a couple hitherto living in that situation and wanting to come to Ireland, would not be able to get employment precisely because one of them would not be a citizen of this country.  That person could not get citizenship without residing here for a specified period of two years.  I am glad that vicious circle has been ended.</P>
    <P>With regard to facilitating greatly families who wish to return to Ireland, I am not clear if so many will want to, but I hope they will.  In relation to the new section which was added in the Dáil, section 7 regarding renouncement of Irish citizenship, the Minister did not refer to this so far as I am aware in her introductory speech and I am wondering why it had to be included or if there are many people who renounce their Irish citizenship? I am not too clear if there is such a thing as dual citizenship or even if a person could be a citizen of more than one, two or three states.  If that is the situation, it seems strange that someone would want to renounce their Irish citizenship. There must be a sound reason for doing so.  I would like the Minister to refer to it briefly in her reply.</P>
    <P>The existing law in this respect is the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  As law goes 30 years is not a long time.  There are very many much older Acts which would need to be updated. Like other Members of the House, I welcome this Bill.  It shows concern for the equality of women.  I realise that the Government are being urged by the Council of Europe and by the EC commitments in this respect.</P>
    <P>In 1985, 513 women acquired citizenship on lodgement of declaration after marriage to Irish citizens, and only 81 men were granted certificates of naturalisation after marriage to Irish women.  I am not too sure if it is envisaged that there will be a dramatic change in this area.  More husbands will apply for citizenship subsequent to the legislation, if <Col N="1380" /> they think it is important and if they have that affinity towards this country, which I hope they will.  In any event, they will be able to apply for citizenship more or less straight away, whereas under the 1956 Act they would have to meet the requirement of residence.</P>
    <P>The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Bill, 1985, also highlighted the problems and the inequality in this area.  For example, an Irishman could leave his wife in Ireland, go to England and obtain a divorce whereas an Irish wife could not do the same because she would have the domicile of her husband. I am glad that situation has been changed.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill proposes to amend section 7 of the 1956 Act which provides for the granting of citizenship by registration to people of Irish descent.  The position seems to be that a person applying for registration in this way would be deemed to have citizenship from birth. The Minister told us that this was the intention of the 1956 Act when it was being drafted.  For that reason, it is very important that on Committee Stage we go into all the details on the intent and wording of all of these sections.  I suppose this is not a critically important section. It seems strange that there would be a deficiency about it and that the intent could not be described simply.  It should not be a difficult job for a draftsman, who goes through so many intricate Bills and details, to miss out on this.  It is not of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that people of Irish ancestry take out Irish citizenship simply as a safeguard in case their children should ever need a second citizenship in future.  We have some statistics in this area relating to one year, 1984-85.  When one considers all the bureaucracy involved in these matters, filling forms, making applications and so on, should we not have on file enough information to provide us with statistics to cover any period?</P>
    <P>With regard to refugees, I read from time to time, that there are problems at our airports for people who want to come into this country.  The general belief is, at least, that we do not help as many as <Col N="1381" /> we could and perhaps this would be an appropriate time to do something about that.  I merely make this reference in passing.</P>
    <P>The Bill will benefit only a fairly limited number of people, as the Minister has stated.  While we do not know how many people will avail of these means of becoming citizens, one wonders how welcome they are to do so generally.  Is it something that we really welcome?  Is there any special advantage to this country apart from the advantages that accrue to them?  In effect, are we encouraging it?  These are just a few brief thoughts which come to mind.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome anything that would help to bring an end to this discrimination against women.  Consequently, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to contribute briefly to this Bill.  Any Bill which affects the acquisition of citizenship by an alien is a Bill which must, at first glance, be examined carefully.  Irish citizenship is something which we, as Irish citizens, treasure very dearly.  We are aware of the constitutional rights and privileges which we have by virtue of the fact of our Irish citizenship.</P>
      <P>It follows, therefore, that any legislation which comes before both Houses of the Oireachtas and which has the effect of enabling the acquisition of Irish citizenship by an alien is a measure which must be looked at with particular care and attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill simply reflects current international and social thinking and as such amends the 1956 Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  The main purpose of the Bill is to provide a statutory right to Irish citizenship for spouses of Irish citizens after three years of marriage.  That is a statutory automatic right provided the statutory conditions prescribed in section 3 of this Bill are complied with.  It is a reasonable provision that the spouse of an Irish citizen, whether that spouse be man or woman, should be entitled without the necessity of residence or without the necessity of the existence of <Col N="1382" /> ministerial discretion to obtain Irish citizenship provided that alien, for a period of three years, has been married to an Irish citizen.  As the Minister of State said in her speech in this House, and indeed in the other House, the main thrust of the Bill follows on international obligations entered into by us and to international obligations to which we have been a party.  The Minister of State referred to a resolution of the Council of Europe of May 1977 and also the United Nations Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. In so far as the Bill in section 3 effects that purpose, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this point to compliment and congratulate the Minister of State for her work in this regard.  This Bill appropriately follows on the consideration by this House of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Bill.  That Bill in another small way had the effect of chipping away at the type of discrimination against women which existed, and indeed still exists to a great measure, in our legislation.  In so far as the Minister of State is removing gradually these forms of discrimination, I welcome this Bill and I welcome in particular the provision contained in section 3.  I welcome also from a practical and technical point of view the fact that citizenship may be acquired simply by the completion of the declaration in the prescribed form.  I presume that the form will be prescribed by ministerial regulation.  I wonder at this stage if the Bill contains a specific subsection to give the relevant Minister power to make the regulations in question, or perhaps that power is already conferred by the 1956 Act which I did not have an opportunity to look at.</P>
    <P>I have been pleased to note in the past the strict ease with which people who are entitled to Irish citizenship have been able to obtain it.  From practical experience I have been aware of situations where confirmation of Irish citizenship has been required as a matter of urgency for legal reasons.  I would like to compliment the officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs, not alone in Dublin but in our embassies abroad, for helping <Col N="1383" /> people to have declared their right to Irish citizenship.  I hope that the regulations made under section 3 of this Bill will allow that easy approach to continue while at the same time ensuring that the necessary safeguards are maintained.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset Irish citizenship is something which is valuable and must not be abused.  We are living in a troubled world and we are conscious of the fact that many descendants of Irish people live in troubled corners of the globe. Trouble in their particular corners may, for reasons pertaining to political difficulties, give rise to applications for Irish citizenship.  One need only reflect on the fact that many people of Irish descent live in South Africa, in parts of South America and indeed in other troubled places and I would like to be assured that applications by such persons will be considered with ease but also with all due scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the provision in the Bill which eases in certain respects the position so far as refugees are concerned. Citizenship is something we value.  At the same time we are all aware of the tremendous tragedy of displaced persons. We have experienced in recent times the problems people can suffer when political boundaries are redrawn.  Perhaps the greatest human tragedy which can be inflicted on any person is to find that he or she has, in effect, become displaced. We in Ireland have played a role by welcoming a certain number of Vietnamese refugees who reside not very far from here.  I would like to see the rights of those persons being ensured in a way that gives them a sense of security.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister of State once again for her commitment to ensure equality and for her continuing determination which is evidenced by her increasing presence in this House in bringing forward the necessary legislation to ensure that the kind of inequality which now exists is removed from our legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should <Col N="1384" /> like to thank those Senators who have contributed to this debate and indeed it is very gratifying to come into the House and bring forward two amending pieces of legislation which will enable us to delete some of the reservations from the UN Convention on the elimination of discrimination against women.  As Senator Durcan said it is important that we change the law to enable women to be reflected equally with men in our State. One would wish I suppose that the changes in law could be reflected to a greater degree in general attitudes but that is something that is recognised as being slow elsewhere in the world and we are no different.  It is certainly important that we should have our laws reflect equal treatment in the eighties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To deal with the points raised, Senator Ryan mentioned that the phrase &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; in section 16, as substituted by section 5 of the Bill, is not defined. The phrase &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; is in the 1956 Act and, indeed, there was considerable debate on that phrase when the 1955 Bill was going through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  One speaker felt that the phrase could refer to the case of an Arab in Cairo drinking a glass of Irish whiskey and thus being qualified to claim naturalisation because he had Irish associations.  The then Minister, Mr. Everett, confirmed that the fact that &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; was not defined in the Bill was deliberate.  He pointed out that the same expression occurred in the 1935 Act on nationality and citizenship. He said that it was intended to cover unusual circumstances such as an alien who had been in Ireland for many years but who for some reason was unable to fulfil the conditions concerning a continuous year's residence in the State prior to the date of application for naturalisation. In this context he gave the example of a person who was in the State for a considerable number of years but had succeeded in getting a scholarship which required that he study abroad for a number of months in each year.  Unless there was some provision for unusual cases of this nature it would not be possible to give naturalisation to a person <Col N="1385" /> who was fitted in every other way to obtain naturalisation.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was being debated in the Dáil a set of circumstances were mentioned in which the granting of naturalisation by reference to the phrase &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; would be appropriate.  The case referred to was that of a couple in a marriage of mixed nationality where the Irish partner died within three years of the marriage.  In such a case the foreign spouse would not qualify to take Irish citizenship by post-nuptial declaration as he or she would not have been married to the Irish person for three years as is required in the new section 8 which is being inserted by section 3 of the Bill.  In a case such as this the Minister could exercise his discretion and give naturalisation on the grounds that the surviving spouse had Irish associations and, accordingly, the normal conditions for naturalisation need not be fulfilled in that case.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the discretion which was originally included in the 1956 Act, and which is now being repeated in the Bill before the House, should remain in the Bill and that the term &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; should not be defined.  The purpose of that phrase is to give the Minister power to grant naturalisation without the normal conditions being fulfilled where a deserving case is brought to his notice. We can, of course, envisage some sets of circumstances in which it would be appropriate for the Minister to exercise that discretion but, undoubtedly, there would be other sets of circumstances arising down through the years which we cannot foresee at present.  Accordingly, it is appropriate that the term &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; should be left undefined.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the fact that spouses of naturalised citizens may not obtain citizenship by post-nuptial declaration. This is the position in the new section 8 being substituted by section 3 of the Bill.  It is also the position under the current section 8 of the 1956 Act.  The new section 8 is not making any change in this regard as compared with the original section 8.</P>
    <P>Citizenship obtained by naturalisation, <Col N="1386" /> which is provided for in Part III of the 1956 Act, is not quite on a par with the citizenship obtained under Part II of the Act in that citizenship under Part III may be revoked by the Minister in certain circumstances provided for in the Act. Spouses of naturalised citizens should continue to be dealt with under Part III of the Act as it would not be appropriate that the spouse of a person who has citizenship under Part III should, by virtue of being married to that person, be able to get what may be termed the higher grade citizenship which is obtainable under Part II.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary in his contribution referred to the fact that grandchildren of Irish born citizens will continue to be able to obtain citizenship by registration.  He also raised the point whether citizenship by descent should be confined to the first generation born abroad.  This is a very important point.  Our citizenship legislation is considered liberal by comparison with the citizenship laws of many other countries.  However, that liberal approach is explained by our history. Down through the centuries millions of people have had to leave Ireland and make their lives in other countries.  Many of them have retained their sense of being Irish from generation to generation.  This fact has been recognised in our citizenship legislation and provision has been included to enable descendants of Irish born people to obtain Irish citizenship. To make a change in our approach on this question would be a major change in the policy that has been reflected in our legislation to date.  There are very weighty arguments against making any change.  There are many thousands of people of Irish descent who are proud of their Irish heritage and who wish to maintain Irish citizenship in their families from generation to generation. That opportunity should not be denied to them.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the objectives of the Bill now under consideration were very limited.  The main objective was to eliminate the differentiation as between men and women in the acquisition of citizenship by spouses of Irish <Col N="1387" /> citizens.  A few other non-controversial changes were provided for in the Bill as initiated and some further changes were decided on during the passage of the Bill through Dáil Éireann.  Again, these latter changes were of relatively minor significance and were non-controversial.  I feel that consideration of the point raised by Senator O'Leary would be outside the scope and intention of the Bill in that if a change were to be made it would be a radical change in our policy and one that would require much more consideration than has been given to the topic in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The amendment to section 7 (2) of the 1956 Act is intended to restore the position to what was intended when the 1956 Act was being drafted, that the citizenship of a person registering would date from the date of registration or the date of passing of the Act, whichever was the later, and that citizenship would not be backdated to date of birth.</P>
    <P>Following the passing of the Bill families of Irish extraction who wish to maintain Irish citizenship from generation to generation will continue to be able to do so provided each generation registers before the next generation is born.  Families with a real sense of their Irishness will be able to maintain the citizenship link.  The amendment will operate against families who have not maintained the link and who, it is felt, are now using the law as it stands in an opportunistic manner by obtaining Irish citizenship for use in some future emergency rather than taking Irish citizenship through a very real pride in their Irishness.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons referred to refugee applications.  Refugee applications at airports are appropriate to the Aliens Act, 1935, and not to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  However, all refugee applications are dealt with sympathetically by the Minister and his Department in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  The terms of the 1951 UN Convention on the status of refugees are also taken into account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> A further point raised by Senator Fitzsimons was with regard to the renouncing of Irish citizenship.  Some states require when a person is taking their citizenship that they renounce their citizenship of origin.  Germany is one of those states. In many other case people can hold dual citizenship.</P>

      <P>Following the <Col N="1389" /> passing of this Bill families of Irish extraction who wish to maintain Irish citizenship from generation to generation will continue to be able to do so provided each generation registers before they have children.  Otherwise they would have to establish their interest and their connection with Ireland at that point.  It will not be possible for citizenship to be given retrospective to children they already have.  At present it can be done but that was not the intention of the original Act and this amendment is to get back to what was originally intended in the 1956 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that in years to come it would be possible for people to be deemed Irish citizens who were not born in Ireland, whose parents were not born in Ireland, whose grandparents were not born in Ireland and whose great-grand-parents were not born in Ireland, provided the previous generations effected registration in time.  Am I right in my supposition?</P>

      <P>The requirements under this section will be that each generation will have to register.  It will indicate their commitment and fealty to the State.  In the event that they do not and there is a case to be made perhaps under the section for granting naturalisation by Irish association, maybe that could be brought into effect in that instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a danger in relation to the operation of this section? We have, for instance, strong Irish Associations in various parts of the United States.  We have strong Irish associations in Australia and in New Zealand.  If these associations become aware of the effect of this section they may ensure that Irish people maintain registration.  We will have a situation whereby associations representing people of Irish descent will automatically effect registration and we may in time, therefore, have a large collection of Irish citizens living abroad.  Indeed, we may even have a situation where they could claim voting rights, maybe a little like the <Col N="1390" /> French elections when people on some remote islands vote and there is always a delay of a day or two pending the receipt of the ballot boxes or the returns from those places.</P>
      <P>It offers a rather loose loophole and shows a certain disregard for what should be a constitutionally protected citizenship. If people have no real connection with the country in terms of residence, fealty and a commitment to what is happening in the country and if that continues in a <i>de facto</i> sense for a number of generations, then this provision should not be available to families to enable them to obtain Irish citizenship.</P>
      <P>Our learned colleague, Senator Michael D. Higgins, recently visited one of the island in the West Indies where he carried out certain surveys.  In retrospect this is a rather bizzare example.  While there he met people whose pigmentation ensured that they had black skin but they had red hair.  They had names which were Irish.  This was because their ancestors emigrated to those parts 200 and 300 years ago.  My worry is in, say, 100 or 150 years time, people who had never been to Ireland or whose parents and grandparents had not been here, could, by the operation of this section, be Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>A person who is an alien at the date of that person's marriage to an Irish citizen will be granted citizenship after three years.  It seems that women are losing out here because a foreign woman at present marrying an Irish citizen would automatically qualify for citizenship from the time of the marrage. Why was a term of three years selected?  Reference was made elsewhere to a marriage of convenience.  Is it simply that, or is it to get a balance that three years was selected.  Clearly it is an arbitrary number.  With regard to subsection (2) &mdash; I know the Minister has referred to this &mdash; a person who lodges a declaration under subsection (1) shall be an Irish citizen from the date of the lodgment.  It seems to me that it is automatic.  Would it not be better if some kind of decision had to be made, some imprimatur given or if there was some way of certifying that this application had been granted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>We had considerable discussion and debate in the Dáil about the length of time.  We obviously had to strike a fair balance, not make it too long &mdash; in some countries it is up to eight years &mdash; and not make it too easy.  It was decided that this period was fair and <Col N="1392" /> reasonable.  We are changing the legislation to make it three years of marriage without any requirement for residence. That is a fair and reasonable change.  I would remind the Senator that it is full citizenship which cannot be revoked which is being afforded to both spouses and not naturalisation.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator McDonald's point, there is no evidence to show that people get married just for the sake of citizenship but in any event we feel that three years of marriage is a very adequate safeguard against any such eventuality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of Second Stage I made the point that Irish citizenship is something which should be valued. It confers constitutional rights and privileges. I ask the Minister to try to ensure that when persons are making the required declaration before a justice of the Distict Court in open court, arrangements are made to ensure that the declaration is given and that the matter is dealt with in a courtroom which is suitable for dealing with such applications and that the circumstances and surroundings have attached to them the necessary importance which such occasions should have. I have witnessed situations where people make an application, comply with the statutory requirements and then are faced with attending a District Court to give the required declaration.  They regard this as a very important moment in their lives.  There is all too frequently an amazing sense of let down and disappointment when they find themselves attending in grimy court rooms, sometimes in the dining rooms of hotels or in other very inappropriate circumstances where district courts are held.  The Minister should provide by regulation that these matters would be dealt with in a court room which is most suitable for <Col N="1393" /> dealing with such applications.  By suitable I mean that the surroundings should reflect the importance of the occasion for the person who is acquiring Irish citizenship. At present the surroundings frequently do not reflect that importance and that may lead to a disregard or a lack of understanding of the importance of the citizenship being conferred on the applicant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's points.  The declaration is very important. The provision of courthouse accommodation is not the responsibility of the Department of Justice but of local authorities except in Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but in every county there is at least one decent courthouse where the High Court and Circuit Court sit.  The regulations should provide that these applications are dealt with in the most suitable courthouse in the county in order to attach a sense of importance to the occasion.  The ideal of attaching importance to occasions like this is something which we do not adhere to for reasons which may be a reflection on our attitude to the imperial past we experienced until we won our freedom in the early part of this century.  A change in attitude is required to reflect the importance of these occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience of making representations to successive Ministers for Justice on the question of naturalisation is confined to no more than three or four persons in the past 20 years. It has never been easy.  While section 4 reads clearly, does the Minister of State have at her disposal guidelines in relation to the good character of applicants?  Subsection (c) requires that the applicant must have a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application, and during the eight years immediately preceding that period to have a total residence in the State amounting to four years.  That is a shorter qualifying period than under existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes one would wonder why <Col N="1394" /> people want Irish citizenship.  In my limited experience, every obstacle that the Department can put in an applicant's way is so placed.  Perhaps the Minister of State might put on the record of the House the kind of guidelines under which the civil servants who examine these applications in the Department of Justice operate when considering such applications.</P>

      <P>The Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation in the following cases, although the conditions of naturalisation (or any of them) are not complied with:</P>
      <P>(a) where the application is of Irish descent or Irish associations;</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty in understanding the meaning of the words &ldquo;where the applicant is of Irish descent&rdquo;.  I have considerable difficulty in understanding the meaning of the words &ldquo;where the applicant is of Irish associations&rdquo;. What does that mean?  There are people who come to this country.  There are people who walk down Fifth Avenue with shamrock in their hats on St. Patrick's Day and there are people who drink green beer at certain times of the year but what does a person of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; mean?</P>

      <P>As I told the House in the reply on Second Stage &mdash; Senator Ryan mentioned this in his contribution <Col N="1396" />&mdash; it has been decided that it is not important or right to define &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;.  The Senator is right when he mentions somebody walking down Fifth Avenue with shamrock in his lapel, but it is important that there should be a facility and discretion for the Minister to decide on &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; and what that can entail in order to extend naturalisation.  We had a discussion in the other House on this and it was decided that, under the new legislation, in the case of a couple of mixed nationality, an Irish citizen and an alien spouse, where the Irish citizen dies within the three years of marriage the alien spouse might want to have Irish citizenship but could not under the provisions of the new legislation, but could be granted it under this section.  It was decided that the phrase &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; was better left undefined.</P>

      <P>To repeat, the Minister, at the time when the &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; decision was taken, was Deputy Everett and he pointed out that the same expression occurred in the 1935 Act of nationality and citizenship.  He said it was intended to cover unusual circumstances such as an alien who had been in Ireland for many years but for some reason was unable to fulfill the conditions concerning a continuous year's residence in the State prior to the date of application for naturalisation. Yes, it is at the Minister's discretion.</P>

      <P>We have had in the past unusual Ministers.  Section 5 (f) which is an obnoxious subsection &mdash; it is the new paragraph (f) in section 16 of the 1956 Act says &mdash;&ldquo;where the applicant is or has been resident abroad in the public service&rdquo;.  This is one the Parliamentary Draftsman has included.  The Minister has accepted it and I am sure the mandarins whom I respect greatly decided it should be included.  Surely this means <Col N="1397" /> that if the Irish Ambassador in Somalia or if the Irish Ambassador in South Africa &mdash; we do not have one there &mdash; decided that his chauffeur or any employee of his, who, I imagine, would be a member of the Irish public service, should be naturalised, he could automatically obtain naturalisation?  It seems to be a very open provision and one that could be open to abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my disappointment at the level of fines contained in this section.  Last year when we were dealing with the Dentists Bill in this House we had fines which were imposable on summary conviction at a level of £800.  We persuaded the Minister for Health to introduce a standard level of fine of £1,000 which would reflect the seriousness of the offences envisaged by that Bill while, at the same time, not offending against the constitutional proprieties in relation to the jurisdiction of the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in section 6 of this Bill an offence which I would regard as a very serious offence.  Any offence which relates to nationality and citizenship and which is based on the giving of false and misleading information should be regarded as very serious.  Such an offence is one which offends against the constitutional rights, privileges and guarantees which we have.  To leave that offence at £500 on summary conviction is unreasonable. There is the discretion of the court to impose six months prison sentence. This is the type of offence where a district justice would say to somebody who was <Col N="1398" /> not an Irish citizen: &ldquo;We will impose the maximum fine provided you leave the country forthwith&rdquo;.  The level of fine is much too low.  A higher level of fine should be imposed.  It does not reflect the seriousness of the offence which is created by section 17 of the 1956 Act.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the previous occasion I was talking about how important the independent element would appear to the general public.  I was making the point that the public perception is very sensitive and that the reason for any element of independent investigation was to reassure the public that nothing would be hidden, that there would be no secrecy, no cover-up, but all cards on the table.  I tried to explain that the chief executive officer satisfied the degree of independence.  I went on to explain why I had come down solidly against the total lay investigation as distinct from an independent element along with police investigation. If we are to reassure the public we must obviously, on balance, have the <Col N="1399" /> confidence of the enforcement officers, the police.  We then have the element of not total lay investigation but investigation by the police accompanied by or scrutinised by the person who will become the chief executive officer of the police board.  That is on its way in the North also.  When I was there there was no chief executive officer.  He will be called the commissioner of police in the North: we call him chief executive officer here in the South.  There is a two-pronged attempt to satisfy the public and then the confidence of the law enforcement officers must be secured also.  My information is that law enforcement officers all over the world, where there is police complaints machinery, do accept that the best formula is to have an element of independent investigation along with their police investigation.  The public should be made aware that the police are professional investigators.  Apart from that, their status should not appear to be diminished as investigators into the complaints against their body or officers of their body.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the main content of the Bill is satisfactory.  I am critical of the weight of legal bodies both on the board and on the tribunal.  Before I come to that I want to make an observation about the perception of independence.  I do not like the idea of the Commissioner or his nominee being on the police complaints board in the Republic.  It does not look good.  I am not suggesting that the Commissioner's nominee would be biased and would be able to twist the arms of the rest of the board to make decisions: he would probably be a useful asset being an expert in the field.  What I am saying is that public perception may not accept the board as being as independent as they might wish it because of the presence of the Commissioner or his nominee</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come back to the legal weight, the bodies of professional, legalistic persons who will be on the board and on the tribunal.  I tried to explain that that was not necessary.  I ask the Minister in reply to explain the weight of legal, professional bodies on both the board and the <Col N="1400" /> tribunal.  A breach of the disciplinary code is not a breach of law.  That is why the police complaints board in the North was and is a lay body.  If there were lawyers on the board in the North it was not because they were lawyers; it was fortuitous that they happened to be selected.  If legal opinion is required by a police board which is composed of lay persons, professional legalistic opinion can be bought and sought.  I do not like the idea of the weight of the professional legal bodies on the board of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer will probably be a lay person.  He will have to argue a case before the tribunal.  He does not have to be a lawyer.  Why are there lawyers on the tribunal?  Why not lay people?  That is what I think about the legal presence on both the board and the tribunal.  I would like the Minister to explain why the legal profession is represented in such weight.  It is very important that that be done.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I must commend the argument for &mdash; the process of democratic consultation with the police officers concerned with their representative bodies.  I am not aware that the police in Great Britain were consulted.  I do know that the police in the North were not consulted.  The Department have to be commended in the Republic for having consulted with the police bodies.  This is democratic and it would be the only way probably to get agreement with the police officers representative bodies so that the Department are to be commended for that kind of process which is set in motion.</P>
    <P>There is one outstanding problem &mdash; the right to silence &mdash; apparently, with one of the Garda representative bodies. I want to try to explain the problem about double jeopardy.  Again, I ask the Minister to give an explanation in some depth about double jeopardy.  I will endeavour in simple language to do that if it will assist.  Natural justice determines or indicates quite clearly that no man should be tried twice for the same offence.  That is inherent in the two areas we are talking about, a breach of criminal law and a breach of the disciplinary code.  The <Col N="1401" /> criminal offence must be completely different from any charge or complaint that might be made on the basis of a breach of the disciplinary code.  If therefore a breach of the disciplinary code is substantially the same as the breach of criminal law the board have no function &mdash; that is double jeopardy.  The board may not hear such a complaint.  The Explanatory Memorandum says that subsection (6) requires a board to postpone taking action or further action on a complaint if court proceedings are pending in the course of which it is likely that an issue relevant to or concerning conduct alleged in the complaint will be determined.  That is understandable.  It continues, &ldquo;where the conduct alleged in the complaint has already been investigated by a court in civil proceedings and the court has determined issues in favour of the member concerned...&rdquo;.  Why only &ldquo;in favour&rdquo;? ... &ldquo;which are in substance the issues involved in the complaint...&rdquo;.  Why only &ldquo;in favour&rdquo; or even &ldquo;convicted&rdquo;? The operative expression is &ldquo;tried&rdquo;.  It does not matter whether it is conviction or acquittal.  No man may be tried twice for the same offence.  The Minister will have to explain why this Explanatory Memorandum and the section in the Bill refers only to issues decided by the court in favour when in fact double jeopardy simply means a person cannot be tried twice for the same offence.  Convicted or acquitted does not matter.  The operative expression is &ldquo;tried&rdquo; where it is substantially the same.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example to clarify the situation: a garda goes off the beat to which he has been assigned.  He commits a burglary.  He is apprehended and tried. It is a criminal offence.  He has broken the disciplinary code by leaving his beat. The issue is not substantially the same and the board may operate in that context although he has been in court.  The substance of his second breach &mdash; which is of the disciplinary code &mdash; is not substantially the same as the issue that was in court.  That is double jeopardy.  Therefore, the Minister will have to explain that also and why the language used is <Col N="1402" /> only &ldquo;in favour&rdquo; in regard to the decision of the court.  I do not understand that.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the informal resolution of complaints.  This is a very intelligent thing.  It is one of the things that my board in the North recommended from time to time during our experimental years &mdash; the first three years were experimental.  The informal resolution of complaints could be used to restore confidence, if it is lost, in a section of the public or an individual from the public in the conduct of an officer complained about.  It is a good exercise in public relations, if you have a public relations department.  The Garda should have a public relations department.  As a matter of fact, every garda is a public relations person.  The best form of policing that I ever saw was neighbourhood policing, where the police officers got to know everybody and everybody got to know them.  They knew the officer was right when he arrested anybody or tackled anybody, or perhaps even advised people.</P>
    <P>So, the informal resolution of complaints is good.  I am taking it that the complainant has the right to insist on a formal resolution.  I am also taking it &mdash; and this is even more important for the officer involved and the informal resolution of the complaint is going on about this officer &mdash; that the officer must be able to have the complaint formally investigated in cases where he believes that is the right way for him to clear his good name.  I would like the Minister to clarify that situation.  I am not too sure about it: it has to be clarified &mdash; whether the officer can insist on a formal hearing although people have decided that it should be done informally.  That is the only kind of advice that I would have to give on the informal resolution of complaints. It is a good thing: it is intelligent. It should work.  It is a public relations exercise, depending on how it is handled.</P>
    <P>I understand that one representative body is a bit concerned about the right to silence.  I think they are a bit confused about it.  The right to silence problem has been handled expertly and intelligently this way: that an officer is obliged to <Col N="1403" /> answer questions put to him relating to a breach of the disciplinary code.  He is obliged to answer those truthfully; but in so doing, if he does reveal something that might incriminate him in a criminal matter, he has complete immunity from there on.  If the matter is of a criminal nature, he has the right to silence.  He has the right to silence, therefore, in the criminal area; but he has no right to silence in the area of breaches of the disciplinary code.  It is only commonsense that the right to silence rule should not operate in a breach of the disciplinary code.  If I am wrong, I stand to be corrected. I believe that was the way it was handled.  It is reasonable that a police officer is expected and obliged to tell the full truth concerning matters relating to breaches of the disciplinary code, but not inside the criminal area.</P>
    <P>The appeal machinery for the officer complaining is good.  It should work.  We had no appeal machinery of that kind in the North.  If we found the officer who was the subject of complaint guilty of misconduct and so on, he could appeal to the Secretary of State.  We did not have the kind of machinery which is being set up here.  Let me go back on this point again.  If the board finds itself in the position that it can say it is likely that there is guilt here, they pass it on to a tribunal. This is very heavy machinery, quite apart altogether from the professional legal people on the board.  We had a very simple operation.  Five or six lay people with a chairman made the decision.  If our decision was not, through recommendation to the Chief Constable, accepted, we had the power to direct him to set up a tribunal.  No lawyers were on the tribunal. It comprised two of my board members and was presided over by the Chief Constable &mdash; that is all.  When I examine the machinery which is in the Bill, with all its commendable features that I have stressed and pointed out, I find it rather cumbersome and weighty.  I believe it will be very costly.  It could have been done in a much simpler way.  I do not know where the copy came from: it certainly did not come from Britain.  It is <Col N="1404" /> a bit cumbersome from those two points of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been a long time in coming before the Seanad.  When the original Criminal Justice Bill came before the Dáil and Seanad, we expected that this Bill would have been before us at least a year ago.  However, it is now before us.  The passing of the Bill will bring into operation the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act and the Garda Síochána face an increasingly difficult situation in their efforts to enforce the law with an ever-increasing work load, often in a hostile atmosphere.  The sooner this Bill goes through and the proper complaints board be set up the better. The Garda have been doing an excellent job overall.  Whereas there have been many cases where gardaí have not operated with propriety, it has to be said that the vast majority of the force are people of the utmost honesty and integrity who are exemplary in their attitude to their job and the laws they seek to uphold.</P>
      <P>In many cases, because of possible differences in interpretations in courts and the expertise of lawyers, the good police work of the Garda may come to nothing. This sometimes breeds cynicism among members of the force.  This is very understandable.</P>
      <P>Our Garda force is our citizens' first line of defence in crimes against the person and against property and we must give them every help possible in their ongoing efforts on our behalf.  We must equally ensure that our citizens have protection from any action by gardaí which would be contrary to the laws of the State.  We must ensure that in this Bill we give full protection within the law to our Garda force and our citizens on an equal basis.  In the general atmosphere of increasing crime, it is definitely necessary to strengthen the hand of the Garda, but in doing so we must ensure that the powers of the Garda do not override the rights of our citizens.  This Bill is an attempt to balance the legislation, to give both citizen and Garda equal protection within the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> Section 1 (2) of the Criminal Justice Act provides that an Order shall not be made in respect of sections 4-6, 8-10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 until legislation is enacted relating to the investigation of complaints from the public against members of the Garda.  The powers we are talking of here are in section 4, which deals with detention after arrest.  Section 6 deals with powers of the Garda in relation to a detained person.  Section 8 deals with the destruction of records.  Section 9 deals with the application to persons in custody under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  Section 10 deals with re-arrest under the powers of this Act. Section 15 deals with withholding of information regarding firearms or ammunition. Section 16 deals with the witholding of information regarding stolen property.  Section 18 deals with inferences drawn from a failure or a refusal to account for objects, marks and so on. Involved also is section 19, which deals with inferences drawn from an accused person's presence in a certain place. None of these sections can be proceeded with until a satisfactory complaints procedure has been introduced and until the regulations regarding the treatment of people in custody have also been introduced. Therefore, there is a large number of sections in the Criminal Justice Act which cannot be brought into effect until this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>The new powers of arrest and imprisonment have marked a departure in our laws.  These new powers need the introduction of new complaints provisions. It is a pity that the Garda Síochána Disciplinary Regulations, 1971 are not any longer sufficient for today.  Too many disturbing occurrences have taken place which necessitate the new regulations.</P>
    <P>I will not enumerate the causes of concern of the public about the behaviour of a small number of gardaí and the need to see that complaints against them are dealt with in an impartial and just manner in which the public has full confidence.</P>
    <P>It might appear to many people that recently there has been an increasing number of crimes committed by gardaí against members of the public and that <Col N="1406" /> there has been an increasing number of incidences of a doubtful nature in which gardaí have been involved.  Is there an increasing number of crimes by gardaí or is it that the public are becoming more aware of their rights under the law?  Is it because they are reacting to these rights that it appears that there is an increase in the number of crimes by gardaí?</P>
    <P>As people become more educated, they become more cognisant of their rights and it may not be that there is an increase in the number of problems within the Garda but that those that exist are being found out and are being publicised. Perhaps we do not have so much to worry about as it would appear on the surface.</P>
    <P>The Garda, under the law, have more power than any other section of our community. It is right and proper that these powers be carried out in an equitable and responsible way.  The general public, in the majority of situations, see the need for a strong Garda force backed up by laws which would enable them to perform their duties in the fight against all the major types of crime which confront Irish citizens on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>In the past, there has been a feeling that there are more laws hindering gardaí in the course of their duties than there are in assisting them.  One would hope that with the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act and the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill that justice would be available to complainants against gardaí and also that the gardaí, themselves, would feel that they could be treated on an equal basis when complaints are made against them.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that support for the Garda does not extend to giving them power to conduct themselves in an oppressive, irregular or otherwise unacceptable manner.  Therefore, we need a system of dealing with complaints which is independent, fair and practicable.  In too many countries, we have seen where, because of repressive measures which can be taken by police forces, law breaks down in a manner which was not intended by the people who gave these police forces the powers they have.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> We have seen on our television screens and we read daily of the states which give their police forces too much power and the problems that are created.  Eventually, what happens in these states where police have been given too much power, is that the laws of the state are disregarded and then there is a backup against the legal system which breaks down.  As a result, there is the setting up, in some countries, of illegal police forces consisting of gangs purporting to be police forces but who are nothing more than thugs and gangsters.  If police forces are given too much power inevitably this can be the result.</P>
    <P>The complaints procedure should not hinder the normal work of the Garda.  It should compliment their work and support their position within the community and act as a preventative influcence on a garda who might otherwise involve himself in dubious police tactics.</P>
    <P>The Minister has delayed for too long in the setting up of a complaints commission.  This delay has obviously hindered the Garda in their fight against the ever growing crime wave.  When the Criminal Justice Act was introduced we were promised that the complaints commission would be set up with all speed.  I am sorry that this is not the case.  I would consider that many of the problems we have had in the past couple of years could have been solved were this complaints commission set up.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not used the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in his proposed commission for investigation and adjudication of complaints.  I was glad to hear Senator McGonagle mention this when he was speaking as a person who has worked on a complaints commission in the North of Ireland and who has at a practical level seen what value a complaints commission can be if it is independent of the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Minister is providing in this Bill that of the proposed seven members of the complaints commission, one will be the commissioner or his deputy or an assistant commissioner.  We object to this and suggest that no serving member of <Col N="1408" /> the force should be a member of the commission.  If a matter of grave public interest is addressed by the commission, it would hardly be seen by the public to be independent if the commissioner or his representative was on that particular board.</P>
    <P>We are agreed that the most practicable method of investigation/ adjudication, with some minor exceptions, is to leave it to the gardaí themselves on an informal basis and, if necessary, on a formal basis but not at commissioner level.  If there is need after the findings of the minor board of adjudication or an in-barracks adjudication, if the complainant is not satisfied, then the complaint could be passed on to the commission if it were found that the complaint was of a nature that should be passed on because in many cases complaints are made which would not stand up in any court of law and which are not made for the proper reasons.  It is important, therefore, that the gardaí should be protected from complaints of no standing.</P>
    <P>If the board are seen to be independent, that would give them proper authority and make them acceptable to all sides.  The role of the commissioner would not be eroded by virtue of the fact that he would not be represented on the board but rather that his role as Commissioner might be strengthened because he would have an independence within the force to make disciplinary judgments and if they were passed on to the board, he could not be seen to interfere in the work of the board or, indeed, interfere with the disciplinary aspects of his work as commissioner, which would have to be totally studied if the commissioner is to be put on the board.  He would be in a very difficult situation in that he would be acting as a member of the Garda and he would be acting supposedly as a member of an independent commission in a matter of discipline within the Garda. I do not think it could work out in practical terms.</P>
    <P>The Garda associations have looked for representation on the board.  I would suggest that they would have as much <Col N="1409" /> right to a place on the board as has the commissioner.  Nevertheless, I think, irrespective of what the association feel &mdash; they may feel that their desire to be represented on the board is as a result of the Minister's suggestion that the commissioner will be represented on the board &mdash; it might allay their fears as to what might happen on the board if the commissioner or assistant commissioner or a nominated person were not on the board either.</P>
    <P>We agree with the Minister that the commissioner must have the right to exert discipline within the force and we do not feel that this right to exert discipline should do away with the need to provide a mechanism whereby members of the public can bring their complaints and allegations before a board which can clearly be seen to be independent.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Garda complaints board it is essential that there should be close dialogue between the board and the Garda Commissioner.  I do not think that this close dialogue should extend to having the commissioner on the board. An independent board would have the full confidence of the public in the Garda and we must ensure that we produce a board which is independent and seen to be so.  There would seem to be an obvious value in having medical, vocational and community interests involved in the forum, and we agree with the Minister's suggestion that at least two members of the board should be practising barristers or solicitors.</P>
    <P>When we look for medical representation, we know that an understanding of the medical and psychological aspects of treatment of persons in custody is extremely valuable.  I take the point made by Senator McGonagle, who stated that the boards on which he served were totally independent and were vocational and community orientated in the main, that there were no professional interests involved.  He felt that this state of independence to the board was very valuable. I agree with this because many of the complaints against the Garda would be made by people who do not come from a legal background: the complaints they <Col N="1410" /> would make would be about the operation of the Garda in their position as gardaí.  It would seem that people who would have no legal background could adjudicate on matters such as this just as well as professionals.  I feel, nevertheless, that where serious complaints are made and where legal judgments would have to be made, there should be a barrister and a solicitor involved in the make-up of the board.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the value of community policing and of having gardaí on the ground who would know the people in the area in which they work.  If they know the people in the area in which they work, they also know the organisations in which they operate and they give better value as a Garda force.  This is one of the reasons we suggest that there should be vocational and community interests involved on the complaints commission.</P>
    <P>Gardaí are extremely concerned about their individual positions in relation to this Bill and we have no desire to have the point reached where the Garda are not free to pursue their work to the limit within the law.  There must be a greater emphasis placed on in-depth training and in-service training for recruits and other ranks as they proceed through their careers.  Gardaí need to be extremely well versed in their legal status at all times and also have knowledge of the legal systems, status of criminals or charged persons.</P>
    <P>The professional criminal has a great knowledge of his rights within the law and he can often manipulate this knowledge to his own advantage.  This makes it imperative to have the Garda as well versed in legal aspects of their job as is the criminal today.  The criminal today is well versed in law.  We have seen over the past number of years a growth in the knowledge of the law that these people have and we have seen them manipulate the courts.  They are manipulating the lawyers.  In too many cases they have not been incarcerated when they should have been and we have seen them cock a snoot at the law when they walk free, give finger signs and laugh and shout, make jokes and, indeed, run down the garda who has <Col N="1411" /> done all the work to bring them in, but because of some quip in the court these people have walked out free.  It makes the garda disillusioned when they see criminals released on technicalities or because of the inadequacies of courts or released because of lack of space in prisons. We must ensure when we bring in laws that the laws can be enforced and that this Bill will give them back the confidence they should have to allow them to do the job in the best possible manner.</P>
    <P>Where there are vexatious complaints made against the Garda and there is a continuation of these complaints there must be adequate provision so that the offended garda should have easy access to some method of stopping these complaints. In the case of minor complaints, there must be a system involved which is not onerous or bureaucratic and which will not take any civil right away from the garda.</P>
    <P>In the case of the consideration of complaints against the Garda where legal or other fees are involved, consideration must be given to a system of reimbursement of these fees to the gardaí concerned. This is very important because it would appear that, in the case of a complaint laid against a garda, the garda might have to incur large legal fees to defend himself against these complaints. I may be wrong in this, but I do not see in this Bill where protection is given to the garda to re-imburse himself for these costs that he can face, particularly in a case where he would be exonerated of all blame for the complaint laid against him.</P>
    <P>We have seen the need for the introduction of this legislation.  Unfortunately, we live in a society in which we see an escalation in crime, increasing sophistication of criminals and increasing worry by the ordinary man or woman in the street that they are not getting the type of protection from our legal system that they want.  They feel that, in general, the Garda do a good job. They abhor the fact that there has been an increasing number of incidents in which gardaí have been involved and they <Col N="1412" /> feel that there seems to be a need for further disciplinary procedures to ensure justice from within the Garda force.  I hope that, when this Bill has gone through Second Stage and the Minister has heard the views of this House, some of the problems we have with the Bill can be eliminated and that on Committee Stage the Minister will amend his proposal to ensure, in particular, that an independent complaints commission will be set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I am pleased to contribute to this debate. As Members are aware, the implimentation of certain sections of the Criminal Justice Bill is held up until such time as the Complaints Bill passes through this House, along with the provision of regulations governing the treatment of persons in custody.</P>
      <P>The Bill marks another step in the programme which this Government adopted on taking office.  On introducing the Criminal Justice Bill, the Government gave a commitment that the section's giving increased power to the Garda would not be brought into operation until the new procedure for handling complaints against gardaí was in operation. We all acknowledge the difficult task faced by the Garda in dealing with crime.  I have no doubt that there is a willingness on the part of Members on all sides to strengthen their hand and support them in their fight against crime in the difficult and changing social scene in which they operate, while at the same time endeavouring to protect the rights of the citizen.  It is regrettable that new powers are necessary, but the high levels of crime made them inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real problems is to balance the legislation to give extra support to the Garda to enable them to curb the escalation of crime while at the same time protecting the rights of the citizen.  We must give our full support to the Garda in carrying out their duties.  We live in difficult times and crime is part and parcel of our lives.  The Garda must have every assistance, through legislation and the <Col N="1413" /> support of the people, to safeguard the community.</P>
    <P>I should like to see greater co-operation between the Garda and the community.  If that co-operation is not forthcoming the Garda will not achieve a very high success rate in law enforcement and in the detection of serious crime. Members will be alarmed at the growing increase in urbanised crime, particularly those concerning drugs and armed robberies. We have a responsibility, as legislators, to take whatever action is necessary to strengthen the hands of the Garda in dealing with crime and protecting society from the worst effects of crime.  If the Garda are to survive as protectors of the State, they must have community support.</P>
    <P>In these difficult times of crime and vandalism we hear much talk about community policing and neighbourhood watch.  They are good initiatives in their own right.  In recent years we have had many cowardly attacks on old people and the Minister, politicians and community leaders are calling on the general public to become more involved in the fight against crime and against such atrocities. Support for the garda in carrying out their duties does not, however, extend to supporting conduct that is oppressive, irregular or otherwise unacceptable. Therefore we need a system for dealing with complaints against members of the force which is independent, fair and practicable. The complaints procedure should not impede the normal working of the Garda.  It should complement their work. support their onerous position within the community and act as a brake or preventative influence on the would-be errant garda.</P>
    <P>There have been some cases of suspects wrongly and deliberately accusing a garda of ill-treatment.  Therefore, it is necessary to provide safeguards for the gardaí to protect them from such false allegations.  In this Bill we shall provide the mechanism through which all legitimate complaints can be dealt with in a fair manner so that the gardaí going about there lawful duties in a lawful manner will be protected from such allegations. <Col N="1414" /> The main objective of any legislation establishing a procedure for dealing with complaints against police is to ensure that the handling of complaints should be just and seen to be just both to the complainant and to the gardaí.  It must be a system in which the public have confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the investigation of the complaints and a subsequent adjudication of them.  The Garda themselves are very conscious of the need to have public confidence in this aspect of their operations and of the importance it has in fostering good relations between themselves and the community.</P>
    <P>Gardaí on the beat, if they are to be effective, must have good relationships with the community they serve.  It is pleasing, therefore, to note that neighbourhood watch schemes launched last year are making steady progress.  The same applies to the community alert schemes.  In 1984 reported crime dropped by 2.6 per cent.  That was the first decrease in a number of years.  Reported crimes for 1985 show an even more remarkable drop, 8.5 per cent, the sharpest experienced since 1960.  It was the first time since 1961 that there was a decline in reported crime for two years in succession.</P>
    <P>The prevention of crime is one of our chief concerns and one which governs decisions on how manpower and equipment are allocated.  We must ensure that the existing strength operates with the greatest possible efficency and effectiveness in meeting all the policing needs of the community.  If I were to interpret the spirit of general Garda reaction to the Bill, I would say that the Garda are extremely concerned about their individual positions in relation to some aspects. I support the stand taken by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors who are a very responsible body of people and who were very aggrieved by the introduction of section 7 (9) in the Bill, as they see it, at the last minute.</P>
    <P>I will make a few quotations from statements by different members of that <Col N="1415" /> organisation.  I will quote from an editorial in the <i>Garda News</i> of June 1985 which states:</P>
    <P>One can only speculate on the reasons why Mr. Noonan, at the very last minute, decided to introduce the controversial &ldquo;right to silence&rdquo; measure in the Garda Síochána Complaints Bill.  Without even being told he must surely have been aware of the likely reaction among gardaí which such a proposal would generate.  So there must have been some powerful and compelling reasons for taking such a step.  If that be the case the Minister has been less than anxious (at least at time of going to press) to spell them out and certainly the evidence available to the gardaí and the general public is insufficiently convincing to sustain an argument in support of this extraordinary measure.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fundamental rights aspect of this issue, there is a deeper and far stronger reason why the Garda so determinedly oppose this particular provision.  Many gardaí feel genuinely hurt that they, and their profession, should be held in such low esteem by the Government and that they can no longer be trusted, can be no longer be accorded the same rights and respect as all other public servants &mdash; not to mention the criminals.  At a time when the gardaí are under siege from all sides the least they could have hoped for was that their own Minister for Justice would not add to the cacophony of abuse but would instead do something to boost flagging morale.</P>
    <P>The logic behind this legislation is to make the Garda more accountable for their actions.  Fine, but how more accountable will they have to become before the Government are satisfied? Right now they are held accountable under a draconian disciplinary code under which they can be summarily fined, suspended or dismissed.  They are accountable to the courts where every minute particle of their behaviour is daily analysed under the microscopic attention <Col N="1416" /> of the legal profession.  They are accountable to the Minister for Justice who can order an inquiry into any aspect of Garda behaviour and, through him, they are accountable to the Oireachtas who can and most recently did, authorise an inquiry into Garda behaviour.  On top of all this they will now be further accountable to another body who will authorise investigations and reinvestigations if they like, prosecute, adjudicate and sentence gardaí for alleged misbehaviour.  The message from all this to the Garda is clear: &ldquo;If they do not get you one way, they are sure to get you some other way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From the same issue of June 1985 <i>Garda News</i> I quote the words of the former president of the AGSI, Dan Ryan who states:</P>
    <P>While I have supported the concept of some independent element in Garda complaints procedure I must admit that the contents of the Bill went far beyond what I or the Association had anticipated.  In particular that section which requires members to answer questions and produce documents in certain circumstances is one, not only that I did not envisage, but one which I could never accept.  It is a sad day when the members of An Garda Síochána should be treated less favourably than the rest of the citizens of this State.  We have loyally served the people of this country for well over 60 years in very difficult circumstances, often with little thanks and with continuous risk to life and limb.  We are charged with a series of duties more demanding than those required to be performed by any other public servants. We receive only limited resources to fulfil those duties and instead of the Government setting out to improve that situation we find that this measure is designed to further restrict the Force in the performance of its duties.</P>
    <P>No one, least of all I, deny the need for the gardaí to be accountable for their actions.  But I contend that at present they are amply accountable for those actions &mdash; as recent events have proven beyond doubt.  We have a most <Col N="1417" /> stringent disciplinary code which enables the Commissioner to do practically anything he wants to a member.</P>
    <P>Those are very strong words from the Garda representative association, the AGSI.  I have one final quotation which highlights the frustration being experienced by members of the force at the moment.  It is in the same issue of the <i>Garda News</i> of June 1985.  It is a statement from the general secretary of the AGSI, Michael Murphy:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Garda morale has suffered&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;there is a growing lack of confidence among members &mdash; confidence in their own worth to a community which seems to doubt that worth.  In the last 18 months we have heard very few words of praise from the politicians with a few notable exceptions, for the police force facing a near impossible task with fortitude and courage.  It is within this atmosphere that Mr. Noonan introduces his Bill.  A Bill designed to &lsquo;nobble&rsquo; the Guards and &lsquo;nobble&rsquo; them good!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the AGSI withdrew from discussions and negotiations with the Department of Justice on the terms of the Bill.  They maintained that they were not prepared to have discussions with preconditions forced on them by the Department of Justice.  In the words of their former president:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We queried&rdquo;, said Mr. Ryan, &ldquo;the need or circumstances that made certain provisions in the Bill necessary and to date the Department of Justice has failed to provide any convincing justification for these unprecedented measures.  I repeat once again that this Association was and remains at all times ready to negotiate in respect of any proposed changes in the Disciplinary Regulations without preconditions. It will, as it has always done, respond in a responsible and constructive manner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that this Association acted in a more than reasonable manner in facilitating <Col N="1418" /> agreement on the large range of comparatively severe measures initially proposed.</P>
    <P>However, it was time to call a halt when this additional draconian measure was slipped in at the eleventh hour without warning, not to mention negotiation. Why are members of the force now being oppressed by this measure which applies to no other public servant nor indeed, to any other citizen...</P>
    <P>It is equally relevant to point out that such a measure does not apply to members of any other police force throughout the EC.  The right to silence is the contentious issue.  The section, in a sense, requires members to convict themselves under the complaints procedure.  Since this cannot be accomplished under ordinary rules of evidence, it is an area to which serious attention must be paid.  The right to silence is afforded to all who are under investigation.  To deny gardaí that right is a denial of natural justice.  I would say to the Minister that a lot more consultation and discussion should take place between all concerned in this regard.  On Committee Stage I hope we will be able to discuss this matter further with a view to seeking solutions to the problems at present being highlighted by the force.</P>
    <P>I made reference earlier to a statement by the general secretary, Michael Murray.  I was shocked in this House last week to hear a statement made by my good friend and party colleague, Senator Durcan, making what I would regard as an unfair attack on the general secretary for comments he had made on behalf of his association in the <i>Garda News</i> magazine. He accused Mr. Murray of making a political attack on the Minister and the Government.  I would have to disassociate myself from his remarks because I believe that an officer of any association has a right to represent the views of his association, he has the right to challenge the Minister on different areas of legislation which he would believe to be damaging to his own organisation and he has <Col N="1419" /> a right to protect the members of his organisation.  Senator Durcan in this House issued a challenge to Mr. Murray and in his own words he threw down the gauntlet to Mr. Murray.  I regard that as Garda bashing and we have too much of that in this society.  I believe some politicians can be accused of doing this to excess in many cases.</P>
    <P>Returning to the terms of the Bill, the Minister has provided that of the proposed seven members of this complaints board, one will be the commissioner or his deputy or an assistant commissioner. In my view, this is neither desirable nor acceptable.  Since the request from the Garda associations to have one of their members on the board was rejected, no serving member of the force should be a member of that board.</P>
    <P>The Garda associations have sought the right to nominate a member to the board.  If management is represented, then why should they not be represented too?  This would be the normal argument. If management is to be represented, then should the staff not be represented also? For the board to be seen to be independent neither staff nor management should be on the board in this instance.  I agree with Senator McGonagle's remarks in relation to this issue.  I believe that for the board to be seen to be totally independent the commissioner should not be on the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised the internal disciplinary control which the commissioner must exert within the force.  I accept that they are a disciplined force and the commissioner has that function, but we are looking here at them as a body and our principal interest here is to provide a mechanism whereby members of the public can bring their complaints and allegations before a board who are clearly to be seen as independent.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the willingness of the Garda associations to accept the principle of an independent complaints tribunal.  Therefore, from the point of view of the public and of the Garda force, the term &ldquo;independent&rdquo; is crucial to this entire debate.  The decision of the Garda <Col N="1420" /> representative bodies to accept the principle of an independent complaints tribunal was good judgment on their part and that is why I make the point as strongly as I can that the Minister should give serious consideration to this aspect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I say to the commissioner and the force generally that never in the history of the State was there such a need for the widest possible acceptance of the credibility and performance of our gardaí.  Never was there a greater need for closer public co-operation with the force.  I am greatly concerned that there is conflict in existence between the Minister, the Department of Justice and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and I urge both sides to come together and try to resolve the difficulties that now exist between them.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas in this Bill which the Garda associations are a little unhappy about.  They are not satisfied that members of a disciplinary tribunal on the board who will adjudicate on a complaint may have been involved already in a decision to refer that complaint to the tribunal.  They suggested that this could be unfair to a garda and would be contrary to their principles of natural justice.  Another area of concern was the period within which a complaint must be made against a garda.  The associations have suggested that the six months provided by section 4(3) is too long.  They have suggested a period of 28 days which is more desirable.  It should be noted that the law at present provides in the case of dangerous and careless driving that while the prosecution must be brought within six months, the defendant must be notified immediately, or within 14 days of the intention to prosecute.  This is so that a defendant may be in a position to produce evidence in his defence.  Otherwise, he may not be aware that he has committed any offence and it would be unfair to require him to defend such a case as late as six months after the alleged incident had occurred.  I believe that a similar regulation should apply in support of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern to the Garda <Col N="1421" /> is the one of legal aid for their members. They look upon it as the failure of the State to defend members against actions arising out of the due execution of their duties.  In a number of recent incidents actions have been taken against Ireland, the Attorney General, the Minister for Justice, the commissioner and a named member.  The State provides legal representation for everybody involved but the member.  Why isolate the member and force him to pay his own defence?  In my own county I am aware of a sergeant who has difficulties because of having to pay legal expenses.  He put in a claim for legal expenses in July, 1983.  The claim was recommended by all parties &mdash; his district officer, his divisional officer, the commissioner and the Department of Justice.  He was assured that the claim would be paid. However, three years later his claim is still not paid.  The situation is now so serious that as a result of a mortgage judgment taken out recently against his property the sergeant may be compelled to sell the family home to pay the legal expenses.  The Minister and the Department of Justice are fully aware of the case I am talking about.  It is in the East Cork area and if the Minister wants details privately afterwards, I will have no difficulty in giving them.  The sergeant owes approximately £10,500 in legal expenses.  Not alone is this known in the Garda station but is widely known in the immediate area and it certainly does not do anything to boost his morale or help him to do his job any better than what he is doing it.</P>
    <P>Having discussed the broad terms of the Bill, I must come back to the most contentious section, section 7 (9), relating to the right of silence.  I am asking the Minister why he sees this wide and far-reaching measure to be necessary.  What evidence is there to suggest either (a) widespread abuse of Garda powers or (b) widespread failure by gardaí to account for their actions in the normal course of duty to warrant such a fundamental diminution of the hard won rights of the Garda?  The Department of Justice admit that by virtue of Regulation 9 of the Garda Disciplinary Regulations, 1971, <Col N="1422" /> the Garda have been in a special position in that the right of silence was specifically extended to cover disciplinary inquiries. This was a hard fought concession negotiated at the Garda Conciliation Council and was aimed at counterbalancing the otherwise stringent and severe regime provided for in the disciplinary regulations.</P>
    <P>Regulation 9 is founded on the principle that no person shall be compelled to expose himself to penalty out of his own mouth.  If a person is to be punished for a wrong-doing it should be proved against him by those who accuse him.  I would urge the Minister to have another look at this section and amend it if possible at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána, sometimes at great personal cost, have never flinched from their duty to protect the community. They have played their part well in the past and I have no doubt they will continue to do so.  The former president of the AGSI, Dan Ryan, said:</P>
    <P>Let the word go out loud and clear. Give us the tools to do the job, reassert the supports which you have given us for the past 60 years, have confidence in us and we will restore peace, security and dignity to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kelleher had some very interesting points about the injustices being done to gardaí by certain subsections of this Bill.  I am intrigued that he can tell us that the country is in the grip of a ferocious crime wave and then take great satisfaction from boasting about the fact that crime is in decline, for the first time in 20 years, in two successive years.  It is hard to reconcile the two assertions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics are there to prove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also interesting that crime is in decline without the obnoxious provisions of the Criminal Justice Act being brought into force.  They were never needed and it is becoming obvious <Col N="1423" /> as crime declines that the obnoxious provisions of the Act which are still not in operation but which regrettably will be coming into operation soon were not necessary.  Crime was being dealt with, according to Senator Kelleher, quite effectively without them.  The Criminal Justice Act was appalling, continues to be appalling and unnecessary and will be the cause of much conflict, much trouble and an enormous amount of work for the complaints board.  It was offensive in intent and remains offensive notwithstanding the improvements that were made to it.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that we have for our size a large police force.  We are the most policed country in Western Europe.  We have more police in proportion to our population than any other country in western Europe.  Most authorities now agree that increasing the number of Gardaí would not <i>per se</i> necessarily improve anything in the area of crime.  It disturbs me that we have such a large Garda force and at the same time so many people seem to feel that when they have their own personal crisis which requires the gardaí, gardaí are not available.  We need to reflect on our large police force when we hear the glib demand for more gardaí.</P>
      <P>I have many reasons to believe and be aware of the enormous generosity and kindness of many members of the Garda force.  I have been on record in Cork on many occasions as praising the willingness and the ability of the members of the Garda to deal with homeless people who are intoxicated and are less than easy to deal with.  Their good humour and their flexibility, patience and generosity far exceeds, very often, that of the so-called caring professions.  I have seen more people brought home in a garda car than I ever saw brought home in an ambulance.  I have seen people treated with greater dignity in a garda cell than they were ever treated in a hospital casualty department.  That is to the credit of the vast majority of the gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a regrettable fact that the Garda are not entirely made up of angels. <Col N="1424" /> Deterioration in the quality of behaviour have been referred to me by people who could not be described as liberal.  I am surprised at some of the people who are extremely unhappy about the levels of courtesy in dealing with members of the public who come into contact with the Garda.  I continue to be amazed at the number of people who feel obliged to contrast the general courtesy and disposition of members of the RUC with their experiences with members of the Garda Síochána.  I get the impression that many gardaí do not seem to have the same recognition of themselves as servants of the public as used to be the case in the past.  I can say, as one who did it once, to go into a Garda station to say that you have a complaint to make about the behaviour of a member of the Garda is a particularly chilling experience.  I did it a number of years ago in McCurtain Street Garda Station in Cork.  There were about 30 gardaí inside having an animated conversation about last night's football match, or something.  I had a quite serious complaint to make about the behaviour of a member of the force not towards myself but towards somebody else.  When I opened my mouth an icy chill descended on the Garda station and all conversation ceased.  Every single word I said was listened to not just by the officer on duty but by everyone in the station.  If I had not been reasonably confident of myself &mdash; I was not a Member of the Oireachtas at the time &mdash; and had not been in a position where I felt reasonably secure I think I would have been intimidated into silence on the spot not by any overt threat but by the atmosphere that descended when I said I had a complaint to make.  I say this not so much by way of a complaint, I think the reaction was perfectly natural, but by way of an indication of the fact that simply setting up a complaints board will not necessarily make people feel that they are able to make complaints. I heard a Deputy in the other House from the inner city of Dublin explain in detail an experience that one of his constituents had of an extraordinary coincidence of complaint and prosecution, of a complaint being made against <Col N="1425" /> the gardaí and a prosecution surfacing months later about the same night. People may not necessarily be right but if a perception is left with people that making a complaint may cause trouble you end up with people still being afraid to make complaints.  That is why, if investigations are to be done by the gardaí it will make people nervous.  You would not believe the number of Members of this House and of the other House who warned me during the period of discussion on the Criminal Justice Act that I would want to be careful about what I was saying about the gardaí because they might &ldquo;get&rdquo; me.</P>
    <P>Such considerations did not influence me and I have no reason to believe that those warnings were justified.  I have had nothing but courtesy from the gardaí in this House and everywhere else.  I have heard people with whom I have been associated in the public mind, Members of the Oireachtas in fact, making allegations about their being persecuted by the Garda.  As far as I am concerned, nothing like that ever happened.  Neither did I have any reason to believe that it would happen.  I have no reason to believe that criticism of the gardaí by anybody produces the sort of consequences that people fear it will.  Nevertheless a large section of our soceity do not share that view and that section of our society will not be reassured by a complaints procedure where the first thing they discover is that the person who is investigating the complaint is a member of the same force against which they are making the complaint. That will have a serious effect on people's confidence in a well intentioned complaints procedure which I welcome.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that I could come up with an easy formula.  I fully accept that to set up a parallel investigational mechanism independent of the Garda would be very difficult.  I am very happy that there is a subsection which enables the board in certain circumstances to direct the chief executive or somebody nominated by him to carry out an investigation.  I am more worried about public perceptions of how this will work than about suggesting an alternative mechanism which would be <Col N="1426" /> better.  I am not opposing this procedure but we would want to recognise its limitations and understand with as much care as possible and as much detail as possible the sense of suspicion and alienation large sections of our society feel towards most of the institutions of the state.</P>
    <P>The complaints procedure and the whole Bill are welcome.  I want to congratulate the Government on it.  It has been talked about in the country for a long time.  I regret that large sections of the gardaí seem to be unhappy about it.  It is important to remember that the individual member of the Garda Síochána has what can only be described as awesome powers.  Those powers are both necessary and justified with the exception of the recent Act to which I took great exception and with the notable exception of the Offences Against the State Act.  Most of the powers members of the Garda Síochána have, for instance in the area of drug abuse, are necessary but they are also awesome.  The quality of investigation, discipline and regulation required in a body of people who have those powers must also be of an awesomely high standard.</P>
    <P>This is where many members of the Garda representative bodies seem to lose their logic.  They are not just an ordinary group of employees being investigated because of breaches of discipline in the course of their employment.  They are a force with enormous powers that are necessary and justified who must be seen to use those powers properly.  It is not just the power of arrest; it is the stature in society that those powers give a person; it is the stature that the Garda Síochána as a force have in our society; it is the role they play in our society.  All of those things which are part of the process of enforcing the law in a free society necessitate an equally demanding discipline procedure to ensure that none of them can be abused through the most visible part which is the abuse of arrest or the abuse of position in return for privileges which people worry about and talk about.  All of the things referred to in the Third Schedule are the sort of things I am talking about.  Many of them do not look so <Col N="1427" /> serious in themselves but committed by people who are part of a force and who have enormous powers, they are serious offences because of what they do and because of the implied threat that can be behind what would be otherwise relatively minor offences.  It is the implied threat carried by the powers a garda has that makes many of these things serious offences.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into a long catalogue of Garda offences.  It is worth remembering that there have been many thousands of arrests under the Offences Against the State Act over the past number of years.  Over 90 per cent of those arrests have not resulted in any charges being brought against the persons arrested.  That is an Act under which people are supposed to be arrested only if the Garda have reasonable suspicion. I look forward to a complaints board investigating complaints in this regard.  I find it difficult to believe that you can reconcile reasonable suspicion with a 90 per cent failure rate in terms of subsequent prosecution.  The Offences Against the State Act says that a Garda must have reasonable suspicion that the person committed an offence, not that the person might be of some use in helping to find out who else committed an offence.</P>
    <P>It is an extremely broadly sweeping Act.  It is bad enough as it is, but it is worse when it is abused.  I have no doubt that it is abused.  It is used as a catch-all. I am glad the courts have begun to remind the gardaí that it cannot be used with the same lack of concern for the niceties of the law that it used to be.  It needs to be investigated.  A 90 per cent non-prosecution rate among people who are detained under the Offences Against the State Act is <i>prima facie</i> an abuse of the power contained in that Act.  In the area of search of premises the figures the Minister gave this House or the other House on a previous occasion suggested a similar high rate of failure of about 90 per cent of searches producing nothing.</P>
    <P>I could not let the occasion pass without detailing the experiences of two freinds of mine who were searched under <Col N="1428" /> the Offences Against the State Act and, given that the Minister present is who she is, I think she might find the story interesting.  Among the items taken away by the gardaí for further examination under the Offences Against the State Act was a large supply of contraceptives which a friend of mine was in the process of selling as part of a pro-contraceptive lobby in a working class area in Cork. The interesting and intriguing part of it was that &mdash; this was before access to contraceptives was legal in this country &mdash; in order to confuse any curious garda the top layer of all the packages had a contraceptive removed and a balloon inserted instead.  The garda showed an enormous interest in what &ldquo;them balloons&rdquo; were for.  I think he suspected they were using them to make bombs.</P>
    <P>A large supply of contraceptives was seized for inspection by the Garda Síochána under the Offences Against the State Act.  My friends did not and will not be pursuing this as a complaint.  They were fortunate to be articulate and they were equally fortunate in having reasonably articulate friends, myself included, and the matter was speedily tidied up.  It was frightening experience for them which caused them great distress.  I have no reason to believe, knowing them as I do, that there was anything in their activity.  The fact that they expressed what could be regarded as strongly Republican views about Northern Ireland should not, of itself, justify the attentions of the gardaí.  It is not an offence in this country to say you believe in Irish unity or that you believe the British Army should leave Northern Ireland.  It is not an offence and it should not be a ground for suspicion in this country to say so.  It was not an offence to support the H-Block hunger strike, even though I did not support them, and it should not have been regarded as grounds for suspicion.  Both of those things were used against my friends.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this occasion go without repeating that the arrest of the women in the Phoenix Park during the visit of President Reagan was one of the more <Col N="1429" /> disgraceful episodes in recent Irish history. The activity of the Garda Commissioner was involved there but I had better not say too much about that.  They were locked up.  It was never clarified what they were locked up for or why they were locked up.  They were held for two days and refused bail by a garda who was most unwilling to communicate to anybody why he felt they should be refused bail. They were not going to abscond.  They were going to go straight back to the Phoenix Park.  There are no grounds in Irish law for refusing somebody bail on suspicion that the might commit a further offence.  There are only two grounds for refusing bail &mdash; one is the possibility of intimidating witnesses and the possibility of 25 inoffensive women intimidating the entire Garda Síochána force who were witnesses to the offence seems rather unlikely.</P>
    <P>The possibility of their absconding seems equally unlikely since they had every intention of going back to where they were arrested.  The most convenient thing to do was to lock them up because they were a nuisance and an embarrassment and were also visible to President Reagan.  They were effectively interned for two days to keep us from being embarrassed while President Reagan was here. A week later when President Reagan was safely out of the country the charges were dropped when they came before the District Court.</P>
    <P>That was a disgraceful episode and one which did not reflect well either on the State or on the members of the Garda Síochána involved though I cannot but suspect that it was not the ordinary individual garda on the ground who took the decision that people should be locked up for two days but that it was taken at a considerably higher level in the interests of avoiding embarrassment.  It was sad and it was very offensive.  It reflected very badly on the Garda.  I know that the women in question, none of whom to my knowledge, with one exception, had ever been inside a Garda station under any <Col N="1430" /> negative circumstances before, were terrified out of their wits.  The general condition of many of those women over a two-day period deteriorated.  They were not physically abused, I hasten to add.  Their conditions were extremely uncomfortable, dirty and overcrowded, but there was no question of deliberate physical abuse or anything like it.  Being locked up for two days, with accompanying uncertainty, discomfort and fear, all that had a profound effect on those people. That is the reason I keep coming back to what I started off with: that one cannot talk about complaints against the Garda as if they were just another bunch of public service employees.  They are special in our society.  They have all sorts of qualities that make them special, and they have enormous powers.  That is why things that would be very dubious under normal circumstances, such as the restriction on their right to silence when dealing with offences, have to been seen in the context of the powers they have.</P>
    <P>There is also the regrettable fact that in a number of recent cases where attempts were made to investigate allegations against the Garda through the current investigation procedure, they refused point blank on legal advice to say anything and frustrated the whole intent of the investigation.  To some extent, therefore, one can only say that the activities of some members of the Garda have made this necessary.  I regret it.  I find also a certain irony in the fact that the Garda, who are now the most vocal defenders &mdash; at least some of them &mdash; of the right to silence, were among the most vocal members in our society who were demanding that the right to silence of suspects should be curtailed, if not eliminated. They were very upset when certain sections dealing with the capacity of the court to draw inferences from suspect silence were deleted from the Criminal Justice Act.  I find it ironic that they are now claiming that certain rights should be given to them, but which if they had their way, would be denied to the ordinary citizen.  It is a necessary part of this Bill that there should be a requirement <Col N="1431" /> that information be supplied.  It is well enough qualified to be worth doing.</P>
    <P>Most of us are reasonably well off, reasonbly articulate, reasonably comfortable and in a reasonably good relationship with the forces of law and order.  But we cannot sit here and ignore the fact that one of the problems the Garda have &mdash; it is not necessarily of their own making, though it is partly &mdash; is that there are increasing areas of our society where they are not seen as part of the community but as an alien force.  Alienation is not just a characteristic of the North; it is a characteristic of increasing areas of the Republic of Ireland as well.  The only way ultimately that that sort of a breakdown of contact between the Garda and large communities can be ended is through the efforts of the Garda.  It will require sensitivity and hard work on their part.  It is increasingly difficult when very few gardaí live in the areas they are actually policing.  There was a time when the Garda lived among the community they policed.  Given the changes in demographic structures and the increased income bracket into which the Garda have quite rightly moved, very often they do not live in the areas which they are required to police and in the areas where there may be the greatest difficulty in gaining acceptance for them.</P>
    <P>We need to have a long debate sometime concerning the causes of tensions between the Garda and sections of our society.  If we identified it now and started to talk about it and started to work on it, we could do something about it.  The neighbourhood watch scheme is a step in that direction.  The whole accept of community policing needs to be extended, thought out and developed.  It is a moot point whether one can have real community policing if the gardaí who are involved in community policing are not actually living in the community in which they are working.  The difficulties for both the Garda and the community on working that out could be considerable.  We need to work back towards a situation where the gardaí are part of the community they are policing.  The only kind of policing <Col N="1432" /> that can work in a free society is policing by consent.  You cannot do it any other way.</P>
    <P>In that regard I should like to ask the Minister if the report on the training of the Garda will be implemented?  What has happened to it?  The quality of Garda training is central to an improvement in their relationship with the community.  I would like to know what is going to happen with Garda training.  The present period of training is obviously hopelessly inadequate.  The possibilities of further training, the whole area of third level education for the Garda and the possibility of graduate recruitment into the force &mdash; all of those things would need to be thought about and looked at.  There is a need for specialist skills, which are often lacking.  There is a need, above all, as many of us have had painfully to witness, for communication skills by senior members of the force in dealing with the media.  Members of the press will tell you that the quality of the Army Press Office by comparison with the quality of the Garda Press office is away ahead.  The Army Press Office is efficient and forthcoming.  This is the report that the media give to me.  It is not the fault of the staff of the Garda Press Office.  It is an attitude that needs to be looked at. That is all part of regaining the sort of acceptance that the Garda used to have.</P>
    <P>I am an enthusiastic supporter of this Bill.  I only regret that it is part of a package.  This is the acceptable side of the package.  That does not make the other part of the package any less offensive to me than it ever was.  Nevertheless, it will be a welcome step forward.  It will mean a considerable amount of progress.</P>
    <P>I have a few queries about omissions in the Bill which I will refer to on Committee Stage.  I am interested in section 6, which deals with matters of national security.  It is difficult to understand what it actually means.  It appears that if the investigating officer thinks that something in the report would threaten national security &mdash; I am extremely suspicious of leaving people in the State apparatus to decide for themselves what is a threat to national security.  I have no <Col N="1433" /> doubt that there are people in the State apparatus who would regard me and a considerable number of people of my politics as a threat to national security.  If one reads section 8(a)(b)(c), effectively the commissioner and the Minister may decide that certain matters may not be referred to in a report.  Paragraph (d) seems to say the opposite.  It seems to suggest that this is one procedure, but if the complaints board and the commissioner can work out a different way of doing things, then that is all right.  I do not have the best legal brain in the world, but one of the best is coming after me. He might explain what it means.  He has often done this before, for my enlightenment.</P>
    <P>The other omission is by way of a query more than anything else.  I understood that there were very strict prohibitions on the Garda engaging in gainful employment while they were members of the force.  I thought that part time work by members of the Garda was frowned upon, if not disallowed.  I happen to think in regard to this whole thing of members of the Garda taking on second jobs &mdash; and it does appear to be fairly widespread &mdash; whether it be commercial or other activities that it is not in the interest of the force that they should do so.  It is not in interest of the community that they should do so.  In the less controversial area of work where I have my other employment I am required by my employers, the vocational educational committee, to get their permission before I undertake any other kind of work outside of teaching, because they regard it as not being in the interest of education or of my students that I should have other activities which might take up a large part of my energies, time and effort.  I think that is perfectly right.  Whatever the implications it has on personal freedom, you cannot really have people doing two jobs; one as the day job and the other being where the money is made.  I would like to ask the Minister whether gardaí are permitted to take on employment outside of their duty hours and, if not, would she consider inserting that activity into the list in the Third Schedule of <Col N="1434" /> offences about which complaints could or might be made.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have got this Bill.  My only major regret is that the passing of this Bill, together with the regulations dealing with people in Garda custody, will, of course, unfortunately result in the enactment of the draconian measures contained in the Criminal Justice Act.  I am glad that, when we finally succeed in getting the Criminal Justice Act repealed &mdash; as I am sure we will when enlightenment finally dawns &mdash; we will at least have left behind a good procedure for dealing with complaints against the Garda and also improved regulations for dealing with people in custody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some regret that I am unable to share the enthusiasm of some Members with regard to the contents of the Bill which leave a lot to be desired.  I propose during my speech on Second Stage and on Committee Stage to improve the Bill in such a way as to make it more effective in defending the rights of those who are making complaints and those against whom complaints are made.  It is in this spirit I approach this delicate task.</P>
      <P>Having a complaints Bill is an excellent idea, one that we should support and give help to because it is badly needed.  There appears to be a substantial difference in attitude between various categories of complaints of breaches of discipline or alleged breaches of discipline by members of the Garda Síochána.  It is true to say that breaches of discipline which arise and which are initiated internally within the Garda Síochána are pursued vigorously by the powers that be. Very often they result in very severe penalties against members of the Garda. Members of the Garda Síochána whom I have spoken to feel a little uncomfortable with regard to an additional amount of investigation of their activities.  This is because they consider that the investigations that relate to internal matters are most vigorously pursued and, indeed, often result in serious consequences for members of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before moving on to the other types of <Col N="1435" /> complaints, I notice something which is worthwhile and welcome in the Bill.  It is proposed to enable the various boards, tribunals and appeal procedures to have as an additional disciplinary reaction the power to require a member to retire or resign from the force as an alternative to dismissal.  That is a good protection for members of the force and also for members of the public.  A problem can arise where a member of the public makes a complaint, or where a garda is in breach of some regulation, whether it is an internal or external matter, and there is no doubt the complaint is justified but the upholding of the complaint in normal circumstances would lead to the dismissal of a garda.  Sometimes in the case of elder members the effect of dismissal from the force is out of all proportion to the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; committed by or alleged against a member of the force. The additional power to require members of the force to resign and thereby retain their pension rights is one of considerable advance in the flexibility which is such an important part in dealing with this delicate area.</P>
    <P>Members of the force feel hard done by at present with the strength with which internal disciplines of the Garda Síochána are pursued.  However, the general feeling among the public &mdash; which is not shared by members of the force &mdash; is that complaints about actions of members of the force emanating from members of the public are not treated in the same way. The vigour which is shown in regard to internal breaches of regulation is not, in the public perception, the same when breaches are alleged by members of the public.  A very prominent former Minister for Justice &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;former&rdquo; and I will not state what party that person belongs to &mdash; when discussing the question of Garda complaints even before the drafting of this Bill, said that in his view the way in which complaints by members of the public were dealt with by members of the Garda Síochána was to use the tactic of delay, that the way the problem was solved was to postpone it until everyone got bored and tired and then it <Col N="1436" /> became irrelevant as a result of the passage of time.  The procedure was strung out until such time as sufficient distance existed between the events which gave rise to the complaint and the actual action arising therefrom, that even if the complaint was upheld, the discipline taken was very small compared with the seriousness of the complaint.  That assertion was based on that person's experience as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>It is interesting in those circumstances to review briefly what is proposed in the legislation where a member of the public is aggrieved and makes a complaint against a member of the force.  What is the scheme proposed?  Will it serve the interest of speedy justice on the one hand, or, on the other hand, will it serve the process of delay &mdash; to which I have referred &mdash; in which members of the force handle their problems?</P>
    <P>What is being proposed in so far as I have been able to untangle it from what is probably the most complex legislation I have ever read is as follows. When a member of the public has a complaint he visits a Garda station or gets in contact with the board directly; he can visit the office of the board or contact a senior officer of the Force but, generally speaking, he will have to write to the board or, alternatively, call to a Garda station.  It appears to me that the chief executive of the board will have to decide whether the complaint which has been reduced to writing is admissible.  All such complaints are reduced to writing.  Even though this is appropriate, I will be putting down an amendment to that effect in case of the Garda Síochána.  Having decided it is admissible, the chief executive has to notify the Commissioner who, in turn, can decide that the complaint should be dealt with on an informal basis.  The decision will have to be made either by the Commissioner personally, or a person who is duly delegated by him to do that job.  I do not think it is something that can be done automatically.  If he comes to the conclusion that it is not a matter which can be dealt with by an informal method, he will appoint an investigator <Col N="1437" /> to invesitgate the complaint.  That investigator, having been appointed, will investigate the complaint.  The way in which that investigator can proceed is something I will discuss later.  At the moment he proceeds with his investigation.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 an investigating officer shall complete an investigation under this section as soon as may be and, if he is unable to do so within the period of 30 days from the date of his appointment, he shall write an interim report.  We can take it as certain that, in respect of all serious complaints that are made, an interim report will be necessary.  So an interim report which will have to be made to the chief executive and ultimately, of course, to the board.  The chief executive will receive it and in due course will transmit it to the board itself.  The board then will consider the matter and decide whether there is a possibility that there is an offence disclosed by the complaint and, if so, it will be referred to the DPP. The DPP will conduct whatever investigations he considers appropriate and make whatever decisions he wants to make with regard to the matter and, as a result of that, he will charge that member or some other member with an offence.  If he does not want to charge, or if he thinks it is not appropriate to charge, it will be sent back to the board.</P>
    <P>Having been sent back to the board, the board will be entitled to investigate the matter further if they want to or alternatively they will be entitled to take no action if they consider that appropriate. They will be entitled to warn the member under section 7(4) or if they consider that it is a serious complaint they can refer it to a tribunal.  The tribunal are actually the body that will adjudicate on this.  The board will not adjudicate on anything except its admissibility, or whether it is relevant to refer it to the DPP, or whether it is a trivial matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to any complaint which ultimately turns out to be a complaint of substance, the board will not adjudicate on it.  They will refer it to a tribunal and the tribunal will go through their own rigmarole and ultimately, if the tribunal find the member was in breach of his <Col N="1438" /> duties, it will go from that to an appeal. Does that suggest a system which will work with the minimum of delay, or does it suggest a system which, with the best of goodwill from the Department of Justice, they have been forced by precedent and by pressure to accept?  They know that, as a result of that, the processing of complaints will be extremely slow and tedious and will take a long time.  I must put it to the Minister that the most convoluted scheme which it is proposed to establish under this Bill is absolutely designer made to fulfil the requirement and the objective which a previous Minister for Justice said to me was the way in which complaints by members of the public were dealt with, that is, delay.</P>
    <P>I must put it to the Minister that this complicated procedure where the person goes to the Garda station and the complaint goes to the complaints board to see whether it is admissible; it goes to the Commissioner of the Garda; it goes from him to an investigating officer; it goes from him back to the chief executive of the board; it goes from the chief executive of the board to the board; it goes from the board perhaps to the DPP; and if not it goes to a tribunal; and it goes from the tribunal to an appeal board.</P>
    <P>It will never be finished.  Not days or months but years will pass, because at each and every one of these stages people will be entitled to legal representation. They will be entitled to make sure that they are properly advised.  There are procedures to be followed about people being notified about things in writing. There are procedures to be followed about people being asked questions.  All these things will have to be followed.  The investigating officer will require to be a most experienced person before he could possibly understand the complexities of the job which it is proposed to give him.</P>
    <P>At least one, if not two, of these steps is quite superfluous.  The procedure is quite unnecessarily complicated and does not appear to be designed to relate the decision as closely as possible within the confines or restraints of natural justice to the actual commission of the &ldquo;offence&rdquo;. <Col N="1439" /> The origin of the complaint and the decision must be in some way connected in time, because the more they get separated in time the greater the possibility that one will not do justice to the other. It appears that this centipede of a procedure is not calculated to restore the confidence which members of the public should have in the complaints procedure. I look forward to the Minister's explanation as to why this procedure is necessary. It appears to me that one of the reasons the procedure is necessary is that at all times the commissioner is being kept closely in touch with the procedure.  I wonder how realistic that is because, with regard to most offences or most allegations of this kind, the Commissioner cannot be expected to know personally what is going on.</P>
    <P>My main problem with the legislation is not the principle involved which I think is excellent, but the procedure which it is proposed to adopt which is tortuous, to say the least.  I am not sure this procedure is sufficiently streamlined to be able to protect properly the interests of the members of the Garda Síochána on the one hand and I am absolutely certain that their interests should be protected.  On the other hand, I feel equally strongly that the complaints of the members of the public should also be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The number of complaints against members of the Garda Síochána is something which is not well documented.  The Minister might like, when replying on Second Stage, to give us some indication as to the number of external complaints which are received on an annual basis in respect of conduct by members of the force.  How many of those were received in 1985, 1984 and 1983 and in respect of each of them going back as far as 1983, how many of those inquiries have been completed?  In how many cases was the complaint upheld?  I am not interested in what the disciplinary penalty was but the actual result.  This is a necessary prerequisite for seeing the scale of the problem.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister gives in his reply a good idea of the number of <Col N="1440" /> complaints which are likely to be the subject of this investigation procedure.  It will also be important to know the average length of time taken in respect of such complaints under the present disciplinary code.</P>

      <P>This morning the Cathaoirleach announced that the matter on the Adjournment would be taken at 7.30 p.m.  In the course of the day there was discussion among the groups and it was agreed that it would be highly desirable that the item which we are on now, the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, be completed to the end of Second Stage, thus enabling Senators to put down amendments for Committee Stage next week and save us from having that Committee Stage a week later in July.</P>
      <P>Time seems to be very precious to the Houses of the Oireachtas at this time of year.  Accordingly, there is agreement that we should, if necessary, sit somewhat later than originally agreed in order to do this.  I see no great difficulty because, apart from Senator O'Leary, to my knowledge there are only three other speakers offering and each of them has indicated that their contribution will be brief.  We have a speaker in possession, three speakers offering and a reply from the Minister.  It may well be that we will be finished by 7.30 p.m.  In case we are not, I ask for formal agreement to the amendment of this morning's order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the two aspects of this Bill which I felt were of some general interest.  The structure of the Bill and of the complaints procedure is far too complicated to meet the needs of the members of the general public who wish to make complaints against members of the Garda Síochána.  I have dealt with that matter fully, so I will not bore the House with it again.  There are, however, a number of other points to which I should like to refer during the course of this Second Stage debate.  The Minister in his speech introducing this on Second Stage referred to one point which is of central importance to the complaints procedure and to discipline within the Garda Síochána.  He referred to the contents of section 7 (9) which provided, according to the Minister, that a member of the Garda Síochána who has refused to answer questions or furnish information during an investigation of a complaint may subsequently be required to do so in certain limited circumstances.  Because this provision can be invoked there must be no possibility of criminal proceedings arising in connection with the conduct relating to the complaint and the conduct must have arisen in connection with the performance of the member's official duties.  The investigating officer must also inform the member concerned that he is acting in accordance with this subsection and that any answer the member will give will not be admissible in evidence against the member or his or her spouse in any proceedings whatsoever other than disciplinary proceedings against that member.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said he believed this was an appropriate provision to have to enable complaints by the public to be properly investigated.  It does no more than place the Garda in the same position as any employee in the public or private sector who is asked to give an explanation about his or her conduct following a complaint about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been misled in this regard and he is overstating the strength of his argument considerably.  One of the attractive elements of the complaints procedure promised by the previous Minister for Justice during the discussion on the <Col N="1442" /> Criminal Justice Act was that he intended to make it a disciplinary offence for a member to refuse to answer a question in respect of a matter which arose in the course of that member's official duties. It is obvious that this matter has been substantially watered down by the Minister and his Department following representations from the various Garda representative organisations.  I recognise the right of the Garda representative organisation to make the representations but it is up to the Minister to view those representations against the background of the common good.  In doing so, he has gone considerably farther than the common good requires or would allow.</P>
    <P>In addition the statement of the Minister, to which I have already referred, contains at least one substantially incorrect statement.  It is not true to say that this provision places the Garda Síochána in the same position as any other employee in the public or private sector. There is no obligation on the member of the force during the investigation of a disciplinary offence to answer the question and the matter of answering that question at a later stage only applies where there is no possibility of criminal proceedings.  In effect, that will only apply where the Director of Public Prosecutions has already decided that no criminal proceedings should take place.  That is not the position people in ordinary jobs find themselves in when faced with an accusation about the performance of their duties.</P>
    <P>Imagine the position of, say, an employee of a supermarket who was suspected of leaving money short or putting money in their pocket, or indeed, of assaulting a member of the public with whom they were doing business.  There is a case &mdash; assault of a customer by a person going about their duties &mdash; where they would obviously be liable to criminal proceedings. Of course, the fact that they are liable to criminal proceedings and would not have to answer questions from the Garda Síochána concerning whether they had assaulted somebody would not remove from those people the responsibility of answering questions from their <Col N="1443" /> employer about the incident.  Even while assault proceedings are pending there would, of course, be a duty on the employee to answer questions from the employer concerning whether or not the assault had taken place and the circumstances surrounding it.  I could not imagine a situation where the morning after an assault was alleged to have taken place, somebody goes back to their job in Roches Stores, or wherever, and is accused of having assaulted a customer, The question of legal proceedings is pending and the manager says: &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo;  And they say: &ldquo;I will not answer any of your questions because I am not obliged to incriminate myself&rdquo;. Of course they are not obliged to incriminate themselves, but as a result of the failure to answer the questions they leave themselves liable to dismissal.</P>
    <P>The fact is that a person has to make a choice.  As an employee there is no doubt that they must answer questions which relate to their employment.  As a potential defendant they are, of course, entitled under the Constitution and the law, as it is, to refuse to answer those questions, but they must, as is normal, take the adverse consequences of their refusal, whatever those adverse consequences may be. in the normal situation an employee would not be entitled to refuse to answer legitimate questions from their employer on the sole basis that to do so might leave them open to prosecution.  They would be entitled to refuse, but the employer would be entitled, in advance of any assault accusation in court or any adjudication by the court on it, in respect of an employee who had refused to give the information requested by the employer, to dismiss the employee or take other disciplinary procedures.  So it is not true to say that the members of the Garda Síochána are in the same position as any other member of the general public or any other employee of a State, semi-State or other organisation.</P>
    <P>People seem to be confused about two things.  One is the investigation by the Garda Síochána of a matter in their role <Col N="1444" /> as the upholders of the law so as to lay a possible complaint against a person, on the one hand, and their role as part of an investigation team to decide whether disciplinary proceedings are justified on the other hand.</P>
    <P>As the Minister quite rightly points out, in the unlikely event of a decision being taken to ensure that a member of the Garda Síochána ultimately is forced to answer questions and where the person must be informed in writing that that particular section is being invoked, the member would have to be advised that the information made available under that section will not be admissible against him or his spouse in any proceedings whatsoever other than in the disciplinary proceedings against him.  Is that not the protection that you need?</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda Síochána say they want the investigation of complaints against their members to be carried out exclusively by members of the Garda Síochána.  I know the Minister has got rid of the exclusive element of that but, by and large, the complaints against members of the Garda Síochána will be investigated by members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>That is fair enough but what they are confusing is the fact that the same force, although different members, may also be investigating that complaint for the possibility of laying criminal proceedings against the person.  They are getting those two things confused and there is no need for it.  There is no reason why the investigating officer, in the pursuit of his duties, could not give precisely the same undertaking that any information which he would glean would not be admissible against the member except in so far as the disciplinary proceedings were concerned. It is not necessary.  The same person will not be investigating the criminal element of it.  I do not see any good reason why the investigating officer cannot at an earlier stage require information from the member to aid and assist that inquiry. That information could be used only in the investigative process for disciplinary proceedings and for the actual hearing of such proceedings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> I do not see any reason why that should not be done.  What has happened is that the obligation to answer questions from one's superiors as to the method in which you carried out your duties can now be set aside if any member saw even the remotest possibility that as a result of answering that question he might leave himself liable to prosecution.  When a complaint has been made the members will say nothing, as they are entitled to do.  That has destroyed the effectiveness of the Bill.  It is a matter which we must consider on Committee Stage.  If a separate force or a separate arm of the Garda Síochána was in existence for the investigation of complaints like this, this problem would not arise.  It should be part of the procedure that no use could be made of the information so gathered except in disciplinary proceedings.  It has already been suggested that that requirement should exist.  There is no reason why information cannot be sought at a much earlier stage to decide whether disciplinary proceedings are justified.</P>
    <P>There was an amendment in the other House excusing from the duty to make certain information available to wives of members of the Garda Síochána who are themselves members of the Garda Síochána. I do not understand that.  It seems to be confusing the criminal law and discipline. It appears that somebody decided that questions which are legitimate in respect of every other member of the force should not be legitimate in respect of spouses of members of the force who are themselves members of the force. Where a husband and wife are members of the force under no circumstances can one be asked questions about the other, irrespective of the circumstances, for disciplinary proceedings.  That appears to be ridiculous.  The reduction of the obligation which should exist to answer questions has effectively destroyed a substantial portion of this procedure and makes it virtually useless.  It might work in theory but not in practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State might like to give us an expanded view on what is meant by the principle of double jeopardy.  He referred to it in his speech.  What is the <Col N="1446" /> present position in regard to double jeopardy? What he is saying in effect is that it may not refer a case to the Commissioner or a tribunal if the breach is in substance the same offence as that of which the member concerned has been acquitted.  I am not worried about the conviction aspect because that is dealt with elsewhere.  The standard of proof required in a criminal matter is totally different from that required for a disciplinary hearing.  I do not know what the present disciplinary procedure is in this regard, but the Minister might like to give us some information on that.</P>
    <P>Exceptional procedure must exist which would enable matters to be considered at a disciplinary level even though an acquittal on a charge related to the same incident has been returned in a court case.  Is that not precisely the same as what would happen in any other job? If you go back to the case of a woman working in Roches Stores, if she is acquitted of assaulting a person that does not mean that she cannot be dismissed from her job.  There are procedures under the Employment Appeals Tribunal to make sure that power would not be wrongly used.  If it is wrongly used a person should be entitled to have their job back.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that, where a person has been acquitted of a criminal action in respect of a series of events, no disciplinary procedure applies in everyday business. That is not the way it operates.  In the vast majority of cases where there is an acquittal it is unlikely that a breach of discipline can be proved or sustained against a member, but there could be circumstances in which a breach of discipline would be capable of being shown against a member even though it may not have amounted to a criminal offence.  Very often people are charged with the wrong criminal offence.  I may have decided to charge a person with murder when it should be manslaughter.  They charge them with one offence instead of another.  In those circumstances the person is acquitted.  That does not mean that the person has not done anything.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I do not think it should mean that a member of the Garda Síochána <Col N="1447" /> should be totally incapable of being disciplined in respect of a series of events which led to his acquittal.  That should be the normal situation.  The Minister should allow for flexibility even if it is a flexibility which is guarded by many different procedures which must be gone though before the matter can be looked at again. But it is important that the possibility should continue to exist.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the Fourth Schedule to the Bill which deals with disciplinary matters for the purpose of the public making complaints against members of the Garda Síochána.  It is right to say that discourtesy, neglect of duty, falsehood, prevarication, abuse of authority, corrupt or improper practice, misuse of money, intoxication, discreditable conduct, accessory to conduct specified in the Schedule, that is, conniving at or knowingly being an accessory to such conduct, are disciplinary offences.  That does not cover the full range of disciplinary offences in the force.  For example, it does not cover the possibility of members being involved in work outside their duty which is incompatible with their duties as members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>If a member of the public from now on comes across that and makes a complaint it would appear that the complaint would be automatically excluded.  It would be considered in the first instance by one of the various filtering processes which are necessary before the matter would come through.  It would have to be decided whether it was an admissible complaint. The complaints board chief executive would have to decide whether it is an admissible offence.  If it is not in the Schedule, then it is not an admissible offence.  In other words it is proposed that a member of the public will not be allowed to complain in respect of a member of the Garda Síochána who is doing a job which is incompatible with being a member of the Garda Síochána. I am not suggesting that I know any garda who is doing this.  If a member of the Garda Síochána was acting as a bouncer in a nightclub that would be quite incompatible with membership of the Garda <Col N="1448" /> Síochána.  If a member of the public saw that and was offended by it and if under the Bill he makes a complaint, is it true to say that that complaint would be considered not to be an admissible complaint? I wonder if that is true.  If it is true, is it right?</P>
    <P>There is another point that Members will be aware of and that is the question that members of the Garda are correctly discouraged in my view from displaying political favours or displaying too close an affinity with any political party.  The Garda Síochána Discipline Regulations, 1971 cover the various points I am making.  Under No. 15 on page 31 of that statutory instrument it says: &ldquo;Prohibited spare time activities &mdash; identify actively or publicly with a political party.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does that mean that it this is not in the Schedule and if somebody wants to make a complaint against members of the Garda Síochána that they have been closely identified with members of a political party, that that is not a proper complaint for the public to make against the Garda under this procedure?  Of course, I understand somebody internally may make the complaint.  Of course, the Garda Síochána Discipline Regulations, 1971, or whatever will take their place from time to time, will cover that.  As regards a member of the public making the complaint it would appear to me that it is not an admissible matter.  In those circumstances that seems to be a rather strange decision.  Something like that is obviously a matter for public concern &mdash; it is not an internal matter; it is not like filling in the station book incorrectly which is obviously an internal matter to be covered by internal disciplinary regulations. I am not talking about those things.  It is not like not turning up for duty on time, which again is an internal disciplinary matter and which of course is covered by the regulations.  This is a public matter.  If I, as a member of the public want to complain about a member of the Garda, that he or she is engaging too openly, actively or publicly in the affairs of a political party, is that going to be ruled an inadmissible complaint?  If it is, it is incorrect and is not appropriate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> There are other things like unauthorised entering of a licensed premises, that is to say, without good and sufficient cause while on duty or while off duty, but wearing uniform entering a premises in respect of which the statutory licence or permit has been granted in relation to intoxicating liquor, betting or gaming.  There are things like that which obviously have some relevance but I am sure that, on the question of engaging for reward or otherwise in an activity like, for example, being a bouncer in a night club or becoming publicly identified with a political party the Minister will give me the thrust of his view is with regard to allegations of that type.  I am sure we will be able to apply that to the various other possibilities which exist in respect of potential breaches of the Garda Síochána Discipline Regulations, 1971 and which are public in nature, but which are not specifically dealt with in the Schedule which again, was added during the course of the Dáil debate.</P>
    <P>I noticed that during the Dáil debate certain additions and changes were made with regard to the number of people who shall form part of the board and the number of people who may form part of the tribunal.  They are matters which I would like to take the opportunity to discuss with the Minister on Committee Stage.  It appears to me that, as initiated, this Bill incorporated into the Bill itself references to the regulations.  Any matter which is a breach of the regulations appears to me to be an admissible matter. The regulations &mdash; and these are the regulations of 1971 &mdash; have been taken out of the Bill and substituted by a Schedule 4 which contains only a portion of those regulations.  There are a lot of internal regulations with which I do not think the members of the public have a legitimate cause of complaint.  But there are other things.  The trouble with including anything in the Schedule is that you are leaving things out, and there are things left out there.  I notice there has been a significant change in the legislation during the course of its passage through the other House which includes the fact that the disciplinary regulations are no longer <Col N="1450" /> considered essential parts of the procedures.</P>
    <P>I consider that giving the disciplinary body the right to require the retirement or resignation of a member as an alternative to dismissal is quite good and quite positive, and is something which has my support.  I notice in addition that in regard to the reference which I made to the circumstances where a member can be called on to give an explanation, the notification of the applicability of that section must be given in writing to the member.  It fascinates me that it is considered appropriate, and I do consider it appropriate that it is required to give notice in writing to a member of the force who is under an investigation like that in those circumstances.  But any kind of similar obligation which was proposed to be inserted in the Criminal Justice Act for the benefit of the ordinary, decent people, was resisted strenuously.  From time to time people are accused of offences which in some cases they commit and in some cases do not.  Any such suggestion that they should be given in writing the substance of what was being insisted upon and the reason it was operating and the source of the authority was resisted strenuously.  It appears to me that we are correctly protecting the people who in my opinion do not need the protection to the same extent as the general public.</P>
    <P>I note that there is considerable resistance to the idea that six months is the appropriate length of time in which a complaint can be made.  I think it is quite short.  The appropriate time is six months under the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act: the normal time for the laying of a complaint is six months, if my memory serves me right.  But for all serious indictable offences there is no time limit at all.  One can be told of a complaint against one very long after the actual offence is alleged to have been committed.  That is only right and proper.  The six months is about right, and I would support the Minister in that.  I do not support that association who are vigorously campaigning to have that reduced to what I consider to be a ridiculous 28 days.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> That is basically what I want to say about the Bill.  The idea is excellent, the idea of extending in statutory form the complaints procedure which at present seems to be operated on a fairly secret basis as far as the general public is concerned, to a basis where at least anybody who has a Ph.D in law will understand it: presumably the rest of the people can pay people to explain to them what it is all about.  At least it is available, and the theory of it is available.  No doubt explanatory memoranda of all kinds will be got out for the information of the general public.  That is a good idea. Unfortunately, the procedure which has probably been imposed on the Minister by the growth of the disciplinary procedures in the past, together with the additional complaints boards and appeal boards and others conspire to create other situations.  In my view, as regards most complaints the position is going to be quite unworkable.  It is just not going to deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>Finally, the reason we need a Garda Complaints Bill and the reason we must make it easy for people to make complaints against the Garda, confident in the knowledge that they will be properly assessed, is not only to give redress to people who are badly treated by members of the Garda Síochána, but also to restore confidence, or to maintain confidence, in the members of the Garda Síochána and the way in which they act and, by so doing, to make a contribution towards the elimination, prevention or developing of the alienation to which Senator Ryan referred.</P>
    <P>The alienation between members of the Force and the general public is the most dangerous development in the field of police matters I have come across during my lifetime.  The alienation about which I spoke during the debate on the Criminal Justice Act is something which it is most essential should not be allowed to develop in this part of the country to the same extent as in other parts of the country.  The existence of a complaints procedure which will permit complaints to be dealt with speedily and to be done in a way which is considered fair by the <Col N="1452" /> general public and by the person making the complaint and the members of the Garda Síochána, is an ideal which will help to increase the status of the members of the force &mdash; something to which I am committed &mdash; as being truly the representatives of justice in Ireland and not just the representatives of law and order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the House is anxious to have the Second Stage debate concluded as soon as possible and my contribution will be brief.  I will be confining myself to general observations on the Bill.  I welcome it as the other Members have done.  It is necessary to have a properly structured method of dealing with complaints.  It is conceded on all sides of the House that, by and large, this Bill meets the requirements of Members.</P>
      <P>I attempted to get the views of gardaí some considerable time ago on this Bill. I got a written promise of some help in this regard, but it never materialised.  I was disappointed to some extent because on nearly all the legislation that goes through this House, we receive representations from people with vested interests. That is a good thing and in no sense improper provided that we retain our critical faculties.  I would have liked to have had some personal meetings with gardaí to discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>Like other Members of the House I want to pay tribute to the gardaí because they are a very fine body of men and women.  This might be attributed partly to the strict recruitment procedures where only the best are selected.  This is proper.  On a few occasions when I made representations with regard to young men who had passed the entrance examination I discovered that these names are left for a number of years on a register.  Some of them are never called.  Over 1,000 are left.  It is a pity that such a large number is left on the list and that many people are disappointed.  It should be kept closer to the exact numbers required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never known of any instance where a garda committed what I would regard as a serious or any discretion.  In my experience as a peace commissioner I have come into contact with gardaí more <Col N="1453" /> often than other people.  I recall a few years back a special court where a young married man was deported because of an alleged crime in Scotland.  I remember coming out of the court late at night and this young man and his wife and family were downstairs and when the gardaí were taking him away his little girl cried: &ldquo;Daddy don't leave me.&rdquo; That still upsets me.  About a week later I called to the station to inquire about the case and to say that, if I had known it was going to be so traumatic, I would not have been inclined to take part.  The gardaí produced the file and showed me a letter from that man thanking them for the civility and courtesy extended to him.</P>
    <P>Also on one occasion 30 years ago I was a witness in a murder trial in Green Street courthouse because I gave a lift to a young man and on that occasion I saw nothing but kindness extended.  My experience is that the gardaí are compassionate and kind.  There are exceptions but that is the general experience.</P>
    <P>On occasions in the past when we had an outbreak of a different type of crime, for example crime against the elderly, and on other occasions, and subsequently, when due to hard work by the gardaí, criminals were apprehended and sentenced, sometimes public representatives were asked to make representations on behalf of people apprehended, sentenced or due for sentence.  In a situation like that the gardaí might resent what they would regard as interference but it is difficult for a public representative to refuse to play a part, to be a judge in effect.  Overall the gardaí realise that public representatives have a duty to do and they do it to the best of their ability and, like the gardaí, with as much compassion as possible.  Inconsistencies in sentencing would be another problem in this area.  Maximum sentences are given under different Acts.  The courts have discretion but on a number of occasions it would be hard to persuade people that there was not serious inconsistency. These things are very demoralising for the gardaí.</P>
    <P>I admire the force.  I know there are some exceptions.  These exceptions are <Col N="1454" /> people who are very officious or overanxious to do their work.  It is hard to condemn them in a situation like that. Criticism comes easy.  I can see that a balance is necessary and perhaps that is something that the Garda will build up over a period.  They often deal with ruthless criminals.  This should not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>It is most important that the force be contented and happy in their work.  I see serious problems in many areas here with regard to premises which are unsuitable, not properly heated, not large enough and may be very old.  It is an occupation where there are not great opportunities for promotion.  Like other Members, I feel that there should be more opportunities for gardaí by way of the education and training necessary in their careers but also on a much broader basis including degrees and entering into third level educational areas.  I am not sure about the position with regard to seminars and conferences but in this area these would be very necessary.  In any profession at present it is necessary to spend almost half a day in the week reading up on new technology and new ideas.  This is very true in the case of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I agree with the other Members who feel that gardaí should not, if possible, be engaged in work outside their own duties.  The pay is very important, particularly for a young man with a wife and family.  All those areas are very important if we are to have a contented and happy Garda force which will in effect lead to members doing their duty more effeciently.</P>
    <P>With so many people unemployed at the moment it should be possible to recruit more people for the Garda and the Army.  The real cost to the country would not be the actual cost but the actual cost less the amount these individuals would qualify for if they were getting unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I agree with the neighbourhood patrol. It was an unfortunate decision to close down the small Garda stations throughout the country.  The gardaí in those stations knew the people and the surrounding areas.  They knew what to <Col N="1455" /> watch out for.  They could be credited with preventing crime much more than securing prosecutions.  In bigger stations wth more gardaí involved it is much more difficult for the people to get to know the gardaí.  I would have closer connections with the gardaí in my own town of Kells than other people there but I cannot say that I know any of them very well and I certainly do not know them personally.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan said that the Bill was too detailed and that there was an attempt to cover every contingency.  In a sense I feel that he was paying what might be regarded as a left-handed compliment to the Bill.  I would concur in that also.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 4, which deals with complaints to the board, and section 3, which relates to the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Board itself, I think it is proper that the Commissioner should be represented.  In addition, the ordinary member of the force, representative of the rank and file, should be included. Membership of the board has been increased from seven to nine to enable arrangements to be made to ensure that members of the board serving on the disciplinary tribunal will not have had any previous involvement in the cases coming before them.  The Minister told us that he was not convinced that this was necessary but the Garda Association attach particular importance to this arrangement and they made an impressive case.  I am glad, therefore, that this amendment is included.</P>
    <P>Section 12 was another section which was included in the other House and the Minister referred to it specifically.  It confines the requirement on gardaí to furnish information on matters arising in connection with the performance of official functions.  Specific provision was made for prohibiting the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information by members of the complaints board or appeal board or by members of the staff. I would like to ask the Minister about the position of a garda giving evidence in court.  For example, if he is questioned about another case about which he has information, will he have to divulge that <Col N="1456" /> in court?  Perhaps it may not be strictly relevant to this Bill, but I understand that there is some concern in this regard.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion in this House, when we dealt with the Report No. 77 of NESC regarding the criminal justice system, policy and performance, the Minister dealt with the long term solutions to the main causes of crime.  He told us that these would be solved in the areas of economic and social policy.  He also referred to short term measures and stated:</P>
    <P>For example, local authorities, town planners and health authorities could all take greater account of crime prevention as a factor in their recommendations and decisions.  This is very important and something that is not properly understood.  In this area local authorities have a very important role to play &mdash; for example, in housing, not alone in the actual design and lay-out of the House, but in schemes where people are taken from inner urban areas and brought to the suburbs, where they are taken out of their culture and away from their contacts. Where this involves other stresses, and there are many occasions when this happens.  I have referred to them before in the House.  This is an area which is not fully comprehended and taken into consideration with regard to crime, which, indeed, it should be.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another matter which Senator Kelleher mentioned in his contribution, and that is the failure of the authorities to support members when subjected to legal proceedings arising from the proper discharge of their duties. In the <i>Garda News</i> for May, 1986 this matter is dealt with on page 29, under the title &ldquo;Failure to Back Members&rdquo;.  I believe this problem is getting bigger.  I will quote this short paragraph:</P>
    <P>The State provides legal representation for everybody involved, but the member.  How can the Minister or our authorities support such a stance?  This is a factor which I believe is detrimental to the morale of the Garda Síochána. <Col N="1457" /> The Garda Síochána Complaints Bill was published on 13th June, 1985.  It contained sections which effectively removed protection against self-incrimination for our members yet, there are no provisions whatsoever, to provide free legal aid for the Gardaí, or even to discourage unfounded complaints against the Gardaí, a practice very much in fashion at the present time.  I put it to this conference that not only are existing claims not being paid, but it can be clearly seen from this Bill, that our authorities have no plans to pay any such legal expenses in the future.</P>
    <P>If this is true, it is a sad situation.  I would ask the Minister in his reply if he would also refer briefly to this.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Brendan Ryan that the Garda have great powers and necessarily so.  They have a difficult job to do.  I believe it is essential that where complaints are made &mdash; it is inevitable that many of them will be made &mdash; to have this structured method of dealing with the complaints.  Subject to further discussion and, perhaps, amendments on Committee Stage, I also welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been truly said in the Conroy Commision Report and I quote:</P>
      <P>The primary function of the policeman is to maintain law and order, to protect the person and property of the general public, to befriend any person who needs help and to assist in any emergency that may arise.</P>
      <P>It is in that context that I should like to join with the other Senators in paying public tribute to our police force, at all levels, for the excellence of the service which they have rendered down through the years, protecting the vulnerable and unprotected people from criminals, and in particular for advancing and safeguarding peace and security in our country. The standards of courage and loyalty and dedication displayed by members of the force over the past years is in keeping with the best traditions of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, it is appropriate on an occasion <Col N="1458" /> like this that our hearts and minds should go out to the families of members of the force who have been brutally killed and injured in the course of duty.</P>
    <P>It was a very fortunate development when, on February 9, 1922, a meeting was held in the Gresham Hotel in Dublin, presided over by General Richard Mulcahy, the purpose of which was to set up and prepare plans for the setting up of a new police force in this country.  Thus, the founding fathers of this State, with I believe great foresight and vision, set up a professional, unarmed police force which was unique among its kind in Europe. The first garda was enrolled on February 20, 1922 and within a few weeks 800 gardaí were enrolled.  Ever since the members of the Garda Síochána, the vast majority of them the salt of our nation, have proved themselves fair, impartial and reliable and, above all, they have displayed a sense of fair play in dealing with all our people.  They have done this in spite of the fact that the changing face of crime and the problems of security and drugs have made their duties more onerous, more complex and more demanding.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of a high morale in our police force is of prime importance, especially in a constitutional democracy like ours.</P>
    <P>I wish to condemn, as a Member of this House, the unabated level of Garda bashing to which the members of the force have been subjected by some politicians and other such persons in recent times.  Yet the vast majority of members of the force have maintained their strength, their confidence and their durability, at a time when the members are facing attacks on all sides.  They have nursed their grief for their colleagues in private and with dignity.</P>
    <P>I also believe that Garda commissioners and Ministers for Justice should stand behind the force and should be prepared to defend the force in public, where the members of the force are being unfairly and unjustly attacked.  This happens in other countries.  In this connection it is interesting to note that the <Col N="1459" /> Humberside Police Committee recently agreed to underwrite a libel action initiated by a police officer against <i>The Times</i> newspapers in the interest of what they called unfairness to the police officer.</P>
    <P>With regard to this Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, the right to silence is fundamental.  It should extend to any criminal or quasi-criminal investigation. The accused officer should enjoy the right of any other accused citizen to decline to give evidence which may be used in evidence against him or her.  I believe this right to silence should not eliminate, of course, the duty to co-operate fully with the inquiry, but abolishing the right increases the vulnerability of members of the force to false allegations and malicious claims.  For in the words of Sergeant Tom Kenny of Limerick and I quote:</P>
    <P>Members of the force are frequently subject to complaints by persons with nefarious motives simply to frustrate investigations and to discredit the force.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice should sit down again with the representative bodies in order to work out a more acceptable formula for dealing with complaints against the force.  Mr. Daniel Ryan, who was President of the AGSI last year asked why should members of the force be subjected to a measure which applied to no other public servant nor, indeed, to any other person, including the criminal.</P>
    <P>The practice of suspending members of the force on reduced pay of two thirds of basic salary is unfair and unjust.  It should be urgently reviewed by the Minister, because members of the force are often suspended while awaiting the hearing of the most trivial of charges.  The vast majority of these cases are thrown out by the courts.  Members of the force are effectively subjected to a form of advanced punishment before the court has even heard the charges against them. Something must be done about the general question of bail.  The Supreme Court decided in the O'Callaghan case of 20 years ago that bail could only be refused in the most restrictive of circumstances. <Col N="1460" /> The Government should either consider the holding of a referendum on this important question or should take proceedings to the Supreme Court to enable that court, 20 years on, to review the O'Callaghan case in the light of current circumstances.  A similar problem to our own existed in the United States of America but, under the Crime Control Act, 1984, a judge, when deciding the question of bail, may now consider the safety of any other person or the community. I also believe that the system of compensating gardaí and dependents when gardaí are injured on duty needs to be urgently reviewed and reformed. There is a very strong case for the introduction of mandatory sentences in regard to people who carry guns and the imposition of additional sentences where they use them.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Senators who have made the case for legal representations and free legal aid for the members of the force in respect of the operation of this proposed Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore, I hope that this Bill, when passed by Dáil Éireann, will be further reviewed, refined and modified by this House so that we can have an effective, fair complaints procedure established which will safeguard the interests of both the public and the Garda.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that all of us in public life support the Garda Síochána.  Very often, of late, it appears to me that according to the media most the gardaí are doing things that are wrong.  It is amazing how these things come across because incidents are reported.  It is grossly unfair to the Garda that this image is created by splashing certain incidents across the newspapers.  The impression can be given that everybody is involved.  I have absolutely no connection with the Garda; I have no relation in the force and I do not represent them.  As <Col N="1461" /> a citizen from the Midlands, I want to express my support for them and suggest that we should stand by them.  They are the people who stand by us when there is pressure.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I am not for one minute suggesting that everybody in the Garda is up to the standard that the members themselves might like.  The Garda force is made up of people, and in every organisation I know there are black sheep. People make mistakes or they are not suitable for the job they are doing.  The fact that some members fall below the standards everybody expects from them should not make us regard the whole Garda force as being anything but of the highest quality and standard.  I have heard attacks made on the Garda.  This demoralises people who are doing much good and is to be deplored.</P>
    <P>I welcome this complaints Bill.  The gardaí cannot be above the law.  The Government appointed an Ombudsman to hear complaints by the people.  There is no profession about which a complaint cannot be made.  While the procedure has been described as being very long and detailed some complaints may not get over the first hurdle.  In the long run, we have to accept that complaints must be made.</P>
    <P>I finish my very brief contribution by saying that many members of the Garda, when off duty, do much work in the community. It is of tremendous value that those members who are seen as the arm of the law can mix with the young people in particular, often in sporting organisations, give them an example and set them on the right road in a pleasant way. I hope the Garda Síochána will continue to live up to the very high standard they have always maintained and I hope our public statements will not do anything to detract from that high standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by thanking the House for the extremely constructive way in which the debate on this Bill has been approached.  This is the first occasion on which any Government in this country, have committed themselves to putting on <Col N="1462" /> the Statute Book independent machinery for dealing with complaints by the public about the conduct of members of the Garda Síochána.  It is quite right that we should take credit for doing this but, at the same time, we should make every possible effort to ensure that we have as wide as possible a consensus, before the enactment is made, about the form which the machinery itself should take.</P>
      <P>There has been a very dedicated effort in this direction both in this House and in the Dáil.  A measure of that effort in the Dáil can be seen in the fact that some 70 amendments were put down to the Bill and dealt with in a very thorough way. Those amendments which were dealt with and, indeed, many of the views expressed here during the course of the debate, brought out points which originated among Members of the Oireachtas, and other interested members of the public and in points put forward in discussions over quite a long period by the representative associations of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>We are trying all to get the best possible machinery for dealing with a subject which is an important one not just for members of the public but also for the members of the Garda Síochána.  The aim we have all set out to achieve is to produce a complaints machinery that will have the confidence of both the public and the members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Senator Eoin Ryan said that if he had a criticism, it was that the Bill was too complex and, while that might be in some ways a good thing, it might deter some people from making a complaint.  He gave some examples which supported that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Durcan also spoke about the complexity of section 4 of the Bill.  I agree that the Bill is extremely detailed in relation to the procedure to be followed by a person making a complaint and as to how that complaint should be processed by the chief executive, investigated and finally dealt with by the complaints board.  The decision to proceed in that way arose directly from a wish to make it very clear to all concerned from the very beginning what the procedure would <Col N="1463" /> be, so that Members of the Oireachtas and other interested people could see just exactly what was proposed, what the powers of the board are, what safeguards are included for the public and for the gardaí who are often, as has been pointed out in this debate, at the receiving end of unjustified complaints by people who have a particular interest in making such complaints.  All that requires quite an amount of detailed drafting.  If we had taken the line of having a much simpler Bill, it would necessarily have been a Bill that made the procedures on all of these points much less clear than they are in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think that setting out the process in detail in the Bill should deter anybody from making a complaint if he or she feels that a complaint should be made.  As far as the complainant is concerned, it is simply a matter of calling to the board's offices, or calling or writing to the local Garda station, or to Garda Headquarters.  Every single complaint, however, wherever and whenever it is made, will be examined by the chief executive of the board and, if it is admissible under the terms of the Bill, it will be dealt with from thereon under the supervision of the board.  The complainant may not wish the matter to be handled by the board.  There may and, indeed, will be cases where what is involved is a minor complaint which the complainant would prefer to see dealt with at local level by the immediate superiors of the member in question.</P>
    <P>In the interests of certainty, however, the Bill requires that in that case the complainant should indicate in writing his wish to have the complaint dealt with locally so that there can be no ambiguity about the matter and no recriminations at a later stage.  I think it is right that any complainant &mdash; and I know this is probably theoretical in a great many cases &mdash; or anybody advising any complainant should be able to look at the Act and find out what exactly is required, what steps he has to take and, even more important, what steps ensue once the complaint is made.  I do not accept as a <Col N="1464" /> criticism the suggestion that the Bill is excessively complex.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan asked how the present Garda discipline regulations would operate once this Bill becomes law.  At present these regulations govern the procedure for dealing with complaints against members of the force whether they come from the public or are concerned with matters of internal discipline.  Under the Bill, as a general rule, all complaints from the public will be handled by the board and that is because any member of the public making a complaint is presumed to wish to have it considered by the board.  If they want to have it considered by the Garda locally they must say so specifically in writing at the time the complaint is made.  In that event, the complaint will be dealt with under the discipline regulations as at present.  It may be dealt with informally, and I imagine that a great deal of the complaints that people would wish to leave to gardaí at local level to deal with would be suitable for informal treatment; or it could be a more serious complaint and come into the formal procedure that is provided for in these regulations.</P>
    <P>As I have said, in the normal course complaints from the public will be processed under the provisions of the Bill, or the Act as it will then be, and the regulations will no longer apply unless the complainant requests otherwise in writing.  I should remark, in passing, that the present discipline regulations will be superseded by new regulations to be worked out in consultation with three of the representative associations of the Garda.  They will incorporate a number of amendments which are designed to simplify procedures and they have been welcomed by the majority of the representatives of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan mentioned the absence from the Fourth Schedule of the specific breach of discipline now included in the Garda discipline regulations, which is the breach relating to prohibited spare time activities.  There were comments on this from a number of contributors to the debate.  These activities are defined under three headings.  Two of them relate to <Col N="1465" /> political activities, either by identifying actively or publicly with a political party or behaving in relation to political matters in such a manner and in such circumstances as to give rise to reasonable apprehension among members of the public in relation to impartiality in the discharge of duties.  The third category relates to engaging in any other activity which is prohibited by the commissioner as being likely to interfere with the proper discharge of duties and, again, likely to give rise to reasonable apprehension among the public in relation to the impartial discharge of duties or as being inappropriate for members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from that brief description, the activities range from active or public identification with a political party to spare time activities which would be inappropriate and which would interfere with the proper discharge of duties.  The best person to adjudicate on a complaint of this kind is the Commissioner, who, of course, is the chief officer of a disciplined force and ultimately is the custodian of its reputation.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner has laid down a list of activities in addition to the specified political activities which come within this prohibition.  I have to remark also that gardaí like other citizens, are perfectly entitled to their political opinions, but I cannot think of any other spare time activity that would be more likely to call their impartiality into question in the mind of the general public than, for example, canvassing for political parties during election times in civilian clothes. Senator Durcan expressed the view that that is not happening on a wide scale, and I am sure it is not.  Equally, I feel that the Commissioner is the person best placed to deal with any authenticated complaint of that kind.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan then went on to express the hope that an investigation of a complaint under section 6 of the Bill would be carried out by some Garda investigating officer who does not have a professional relationship with the member concerned.  That is a matter in relation to which the board would use the <Col N="1466" /> powers given to it under section 6(1)(c), which provides that the board may prescribe general principles to be observed in the appointment of investigating officers.</P>
    <P>He also advocated the inclusion in the Bill of a provision making it a criminal offence to make a malicious complaint against a member of the Garda Síochána. One has a degree of initial sympathy with that point of view because gardaí are liable to a greater extent to have that kind of complaint made against them than any other public servants.  For that reason the matter was the subject of prolonged discussions in the Garda Conciliation Council.  The question, obviously, is not an easy one.  As Senator Durcan pointed out, there is already a general provision in the criminal law &mdash; the Defamation Act, 1961 &mdash; making these complaints an indictable offence; but that provision has seldom, if ever, been used and what the Garda have asked for is that an offence be defined that could be disposed of summarily in the District Court.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is &mdash; and this is where I would disagree with Senator Durcan &mdash; that there is a real possibility that the existence of such an offence would in itself act as a disincentive to people who have genuine complaints to make.  It is that fear which brought me to decide against the creation of a special offence. However, I have agreed with the representative bodies of the Garda to ask the complaints board to consider whether some indication should be given to complaints of the existence of penalties for false complaints and to consider in due course, in the light of experience gained over a period of operation of the provisions before us, whether a special criminal offence might not need to be created in relation to these complaints.  I have not got an entirely closed mind to that proposition but it is one that, I think, could be assessed better in the light of experience of operation of the provisions set out in the Bill.  The board would be in a far better position to advise on this after some period of operation of the provisions.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan suggested that the six month period within which a complaint <Col N="1467" /> has to be made might be made extendable in certain circumstances.  I am not so sure on that point.  As Senator Durcan pointed out, six months has been traditionally the period provided for making a complaint in summary proceedings.  I am inclined to take the view that that is long enough for anybody to make a complaint and, on the other side of the argument, the Garda are entitled to a degree of certainty in matters of this kind.  It has also been suggested that the period for making a complaint should be reduced to three months with provision for extending it up to a maximum of six months in exceptional circumstances.  I would think that the balance of the argument would come down in favour of a period of six months, which indeed was the conclusion to which the other House also arrived and, I think, the conclusion to which Senator O'Leary also arrived.</P>
    <P>Senator McGonagle took up the question of the composition of the board itself and asked why there are so many lawyers on the board and on its tribunals.  The position is that there will be four lawyers in all on the board of whom the chairman is one.  Because two board members will sit on a tribunal who cannot previously have been involved in the case, one lawyer member must be reserved, therefore, for serving on the board, the chairman is one.  Two board members will sit on a tribunal and cannot previously have been involved in the case.  One lawyer member must be reserved, therefore, for serving on a tribunal and cannot take part in considering the report of the investigation and because two tribunals may need to sit at the same time, two lawyers will be concerned with that side, that is, the adjudication side of the boards work. That leaves one other lawyer member apart from the chairman.  That member will be concerned with the investigation side.  I do not think that in a board of nine which has to divide itself into two divisions, one for supervising investigations and the other for adjudicating on complaints, three lawyers is an excessive number.  We should also bear in mind the fact that even disciplinary proceedings <Col N="1468" /> can result in very serious consequences for gardaí.  It seems to me, therefore, right that some persons trained in legal procedures should be there to see that justice is done and that it is seen to be done.  The gardaí, no less than the general public, deserve that kind of assurance. As I said, there would be one lawyer apart from the chairman concerned with investigation aspects and one serving on the disciplinary tribunal or each of the tribunals to be set up under the Bill.  That seems to be the minimum number we should have to provide.</P>
    <P>Senator McGonagle then asked if a member could insist that a complaint be dealt with formally and not disposed of informally under section 5.  The answer is yes.  No complaint could be disposed of under the informal procedure provided for in section 5 without the written consent of both the complainant, in the first instance, and the member concerned. That is set out clearly in section 5 (3) (b).</P>
    <P>Senator McGonagle then went on to look at the double jeopardy provision and I think he was seeking to have it explained with a little more clarity than perhaps is sometimes possible in the language of the parliamentary draftsman. That provision is set out in Section 7 (7). Originally the concept of double jeopardy applied only in relation to criminal proceedings &mdash; a person could not be tried twice for the same offence &mdash; but it was later extended to disciplinary proceedings arising as a result of criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>In relation to convictions the rule means that the member concerned is not to be tried again for a breach which is substantially the same as the offence, but he may nevertheless be disciplined for the breach of discipline which consists of the conduct that constituted the offence in respect of which he was convicted. That is the effect of paragraph (b) (i) of the subsection.  That breach is usually called criminal conduct.  There is no rehearing of the evidence given at the trial.  The disciplinary tribunal will be concerned only with the fact of conviction.</P>
    <P>The disciplinary action taken is not to <Col N="1469" /> take the form of punishment because the member cannot be punished twice for his transgression.  The question to be considered is the member's suitability for retention in his present rank or in the force.  It is to be expected that a more serious view would be taken of convictions of gardaí than of persons in other employments having regard, in particular, to their role in upholding the law. A convicted member may be proceeded against not only for criminal conduct but also for any other breach of discipline involved in the complaint which is not in substance the same as the offence of which he was convicted.</P>
    <P>The application of the rule to acquittals is straightforward though it does not, of course, prevent disciplinary proceedings being taken for breaches which are not in substance the same.  Each case has to be considered individually and I think a very brief reference to the British practice might be useful in order to elucidate the point.  In the British case where guidance is given to chief officers it said that the criminal charge of assault and the disciplinary charge of unnecessary violence are the most common example of such charges being in substance the same. The guidance goes on to say that in considering whether double jeopardy operates, close attention should be paid to the similarity in the elements of the criminal charge and the possible disciplinary charge.  In some cases they may not be as similar as appears at first sight.  The mental element of the criminal offence may be lacking in the disciplinary offence or the conduct involved may differ. Where that is so, there is no bar to disciplinary proceedings because the two offences are not then in substance the same.  I do not think I should go into more detail on that, but it shows the necessity to look at each case individually in order to assess the relationship between the elements to be taken into account in relation to the disciplinary charge and the criminal charge.</P>
    <P>Senator McGonagle suggested that the double jeopardy rule under the Bill would apply only where a court decision has been given in favour of the garda <Col N="1470" /> concerned.  That is not the case.  It applies whether the garda is convicted or acquitted. The misunderstanding here may have arisen from the provision in section 6 (6)(b) that the board must take no further action on a complaint if the substantial issues involved have been investigated by a civil court and decided in favour of the garda in question.  The double jeopardy rule is normally expressed to apply only to criminal proceedings and not to civil proceedings.  If a member has been sued in civil proceedings and has to pay damages for conduct which amounts to a breach of discipline there seems to be no reason why that conduct should not be investigated and, if necessary, adjudicated on by the board and the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher criticised the provision in section 7 (9) requiring a member of the Garda Síochána in certain limited circumstances to answer questions or furnish information in relation to a complaint about that member's conduct. Substantially the same point was made by Senator Kennedy.  Much of the criticism of this provision is based on the proposition that a right is being taken from gardaí which every other citizen has.  It is essential that we should be clear on this.  That is not the case.  What is being done is no more than placing the gardaí in the same position as any other employee in the public or private sector who is asked by his or her superior to give an explanation when a complaint is made; nothing more and nothing less. That particular provision has no relevance to criminal proceedings because the provision can be used only where there is no possibility of criminal proceedings being taken against the member concerned.  It applies only where purely disciplinary matters are concerned.  As was pointed out when the Bill was being introduced in the House, it is a provision which I would expect would be used only rarely but it seemed right to the Government to take the opportunity presented by this measure to set out what the position should be in this respect, including the limitations on its exercise.  The essential point I want to get across is that this <Col N="1471" /> provision puts a member of the Garda Síochána in exactly the same position as any other public servant or as any employee in a private firm who is asked to give an explanation in the event of a complaint.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher takes the view that members of the board who have been involved in an investigation should not sit on a tribunal.  I agree with that and the Bill provides accordingly.  It was, indeed, amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide that members of the board who had been involved in the investigation of a complaint would be ineligible to sit on a tribunal dealing with that complaint. The membership of the board is being increased from seven to nine members to allow for that separation of functions.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher referred to the question of the six months period.  I have already dealt with this.  He went on to raise the matter of legal representation for gardaí at a complaints tribunal.  In relation to this particular matter I have agreed to set up a group with officials of my Department and representatives of the Garda associations under a neutral chairman to decide on applications from members for free legal assistance in advance of a hearing before a tribunal or an appeal board.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan gave it as his opinion that the commissioner should not be a member of the board.  This particular view has been debated long and comprehensively right from the time that the measure was first proposed.  Having examined all of that debate, I remain of the view that the commissioner or his representative must be a member of the complaints board and participate in the adjudication of complaints and in the determination of any disciplinary action to be taken.  Maintenance of discipline is an important part of the commissioner's function and indeed of his overall operational responsibility.  He is the chief disciplinary officer of the force and it is essential that any changes in the existing procedure for handling complaints should be such as not to undermine his <Col N="1472" /> position in this respect or weaken his command of the force.  To exclude him entirely from the disciplinary process would be bound to undermine his authority and, therefore, would be bound to undermine the morale of the force.  It would also tend to give rise to unnecessary friction between Garda management and the complaints board.  The fact of giving the commissioner a representation on the board and the adjudication in a tribunal preserves his position to the maximum extent consistent with introducing a decisive independent voice into the complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan asked for an explanation of (8) (d) of section 6.  This provides that nothing in subsection (8) shall prevent arrangements being made between the board and the commissioner for dealing with cases covered by the subsection in some other way.  For example, the commissioner could disclose information of the kind that we are concerned with here &mdash; security information or other information that would place persons at risk &mdash; to the chairman of the board alone on a personal basis which it would be dangerous or risky to disclose to all of the members of the board.  This is the particular reason for having this provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan also asked about the position in relation to the report of the committee on training for the Garda Síochána.  While this is not directly relevant to the subject matter of the Bill, I can inform the House that the report is under examination by myself and by my Department.  I hope that some of the recommendations made in the report can be implemented in time to be applied in the case of new recruits who would be taken into the Garda Síochána from the next entry competition.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary criticised the procedures in the Bill as being too long and drawn out and possibly resulting in complaints taking not months but years to process through the system.  If I may make a small entomological point to Senator O'Leary: centipedes do not necessarily have a long life-span.  The <Col N="1473" /> Senator's fears in this respect are exaggerated. If you take, first of all, the case of minor non-criminal complaints &mdash; many of those will be disposed of informally and quickly, perhaps by a letter of explanation or, where appropriate, by a letter of regret.  The remainder of those minor complaints will be processed by a formal investigation which should not in cases like this take very long nor should a decision on them take very long either. The board could make up their mind quickly on the investigation report and send it to the tribunal.  The tribunal's procedures may appear to be formal and legalistically structured but this is the minimum that the garda complained of can reasonably expect to be provided seeing that in many cases his future career prospects may be at stake.</P>
    <P>If the complaint involves conduct constituting a criminal offence, this has to be investigated as any other such offence would be and the board may have to refer it to the DPP.  In cases such as this, it is clear that there can be no short cuts.  The garda himself or herself is entitled to be treated in a matter like this in exactly the same way as any other citizen.  This may delay the disposal of the complaint but there is no way of avoiding it in this or in any other jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The remaining step in the procedure is that relating to appeals by members against decisions or findings against them.  There is no doubt but that such a right of appeal is necessary and it may delay the final determination of a complaint. But once a tribunal has made an adjudication, the complainant will have had his complaint investigated and disposed of.  In general the procedure will be no more complex or lengthy than is necessary in the interests of dealing properly and fairly with complaints both from the point of view of the complainant and of the person against whom the complaint is made.  It will be a function of the board to ensure that there is no avoidable delay in investigation and adjudication and that the only delays that occur will be those required in the interests of seeing that the complaint is properly handled and <Col N="1474" /> investigated and that the member complained of is given justice in the same way as the complainant.</P>
    <P>Referring to section 7 (9) Senator O'Leary suggested that it should be possible to have an initial investigation of every complaint and that the investigating officer could be given powers to require answers during that investigation with the proviso that the answers could not be used against the Garda member in any criminal proceedings.  Any criminal aspects could be investigated later by a different investigating officer.  He suggested that this would speed up the hearing of the complaint and be less complicated. I cannot go along with that.  It would be contrary to public policy to delay the investigation of criminal offences while the disciplinary aspects of the complaint are being disposed of.  The Bill proceeds on the basis that any complaint involving a criminal offence will be investigated under section 6 in the same way as any other criminal offence but subject to the supervision both of the board and of the DPP who, of course, the board must consult if they wish to give directions to the investigating officer.  It is important that the DPP retain control over the investigations and that the criminal aspects must be dealt with before any remaining disciplinary aspects can come to be considered.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary took, as sometimes happens, a rather more robust view than I in relation to his treatment otherwise of section 7 (9).  I prefer to leave that to the record and in this particular case follow, as I often do, in the wake of Senator O'Leary but very definitely in the same direction.</P>
    <P>He asked then about the numbers of complaints from members of the public that had been received by the Garda authorities in the period since 1983 and about the action taken as a result of those complaints.  The number of complaints in each of the last three years was as follows: in 1983, 376; in 1984, 420 and in 1985, 430.  As far as action taken is concerned, I will use the complaints of 1985 to illustrate the general position.  There were 430 complaints in that year.  A file was <Col N="1475" /> referred to the DPP in a total of 120 cases.  Proceedings were subsequently initiated in 20 cases while the decision of the DPP is still awaited in a further 20. The DPP decided not to prosecute in the remaining 88 cases.</P>

Twenty two complaints were dealt with by the Garda authorities as minor breaches under Regulation 7 of the Discipline Regulations.  Formal inquiries under those regulations were held in a further 23 cases.  Some of those complaints would also have been referred to the DPP as it is the commissioner's practice to refer the investigation report of any complaint which involves an allegation of criminal conduct to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Durcan and O'Leary, joined by Senator Fitzsimons, made some remarks about gardaí engaging in inappropriate spare time activities.  I have already indicated the view I have, which is that the commissioner is the best person to adjudicate on such complaints.  He is <Col N="1476" /> required, indeed, by the discipline regulations to draw up a list of inappropriate activities and this, of course, can be added to from time to time if he believes that there are emerging practices which should properly be classified under this heading.</P>
    <P>The foregoing is my reaction to the various specific points made during the course of the debate.  I would like again to repeat my gratitude to the House for the way in which this matter has been approached.  It has been very clear that, as I said at the beginning, we all share the objective of setting in place under Statute, which is a departure in our case and, indeed, one to be welcomed, machinery that will have the confidence both of the general public and of the Garda.  The balance of the remarks made during the course of this debate would indicate that overall this Bill achieves that objective.  On that basis, I commend it to the House.</P>
