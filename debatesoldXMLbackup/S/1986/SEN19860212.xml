      <P>I have notice from Senator Jack Fitzsimons that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House to-day he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to ensure that in the reconstruction housing grant scheme, in bona fide situations, nothing in the scheme will preclude applicants from carrying out the works, or parts of the works themselves, without the full services of a building contractor.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Ellis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The delay by the Department of Health in the provision of an extension to the Manorhamilton Hospital.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Patrick Durcan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to indicate his plans for the introduction of a full and proper system of integrated nursing in the psychiatric nursing service.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Browne of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The proposed closure of St. Dympna's Hospital, Carlow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> I also received notice from Senator Jimmy Deenihan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The urgent need for the Minister of Education to sanction proposals for the extension of Coolard National School, Listowel, County Kerry.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Donie Cassidy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Communications to issue a direction to Bord Telecom under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, in respect of maintaining an emergency call service, in order to allay public anxiety with recent breakdowns in this vital service.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Fitzsimons, Ellis, Durcan, Browne and Deenihan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I regret I have to rule that that matter raised by Senator Cassidy is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.  I have selected Senator Fitzsimons's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at 8 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators Ellis, Durcan, Browne and Deenihan may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Leader of the House, before I introduce the Order of Business, I want to propose a vote of sympathy to the widow and family of the late James Dillon.  Jim, as he was affectionately known to all of us who were privileged to know him, has passed away since our previous sitting and is being laid to rest today in his native town. It would be inappropriate if this House of the Oireachtas, sitting formally, did not take this opportunity to extend to his widow and family our deepest sympathy <Col N="401" /> on the passing of such a great statesman, a great Irishman and indeed a great Minister for Agriculture in two Governments.  His capabilities as an orator and his belief in democracy and its working is something that we should all aspire to.  None of us could ever achieve the high standard of dedication to duty that the late Jim Dillon achieved during his lifetime.  He came from a family who gave all of their lives over three generations to the service of the Irish nation. For that we will always be grateful.  It is appropriate to remember him here this morning.  I propose on behalf of the House to extend our sympathy to his widow and family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second that vote of sympathy to the Dillon family.  I had the pleasure of knowing James Dillon for a number of years.  I served with him on the Council of Europe for two years in the mid-sixties.  James Dillon was a gentleman.  He was a dedicated politician. He very seldom agreed with the Fianna Fáil Party but he once voted for Eamon de Valera as leader of the Government in 1932.  He had very strong Tipperary connections.  James Dillon's widow is from Clonmel.  His grandfather served as an MP for Tipperary.  The Dillon family took part in the rising at Ballingarry in 1848.  The Dillon family have a proud history.  We all regret the passing of such a great man to his eternal reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like on behalf of the Fine Gael party, to join in the vote of sympathy to Mrs. Dillon and family.  The passing of James Dillon marks the end of a great historical link with our political traditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Dillon, as those of us who had the pleasure of serving with him know, devoted his life to the service of the country. He regarded politics not just as a profession but as a vocation.  The memories we hold of this great and most charitable man are good ones.  That is often difficult to say about every political figure.  His policies, when he served the country so well on two occasions as Minister <Col N="402" /> for Agriculture, gave Irish farmers and farming the first lift out of the great depression in which they survived for generations.  With his pragmatic approach to development, the establishment of An Foras Talúntais, the ground limestone schemes, the TB eradication scheme, the land reclamation scheme, the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, all were milestones of progress achieved by this man of great vision.  He used his great gift as an orator not just to enthuse his supporters but indeed to get his message across to all, which he did without vindictiveness or bitterness or small-mindedness. His great integrity must continue to inspire those of us in public life. To his widow, Mrs. Maura Dillon, and his son John, and his family we extend our sincere condolences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion of sympathy as, I am sure, would the other Independents in the House.  It is very difficult to add to the tributes which have been paid to James Dillon in this House except to say that, apart from the fact that he was one of the greatest orators that either of these Houses have seen, he was a man of enormous integrity who stood out as a lonely voice, a man of enormous courage who was not afraid to take an unpopular stand on his own, particularly in the war years when his stand on neutrality was an unpopular one.</P>
      <P>I should like to express sympathy to his widow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the tributes to the late James Dillon.  I do so, not because I am a member of the party of which he was a member, but because, of all the Members in this House, I think I can be described as almost his next-door neighbour.  He lived just a few miles away from me.  Jim, as he was affectionately known, was one of the titans of the Oireachtas.  He belonged to the great tradition in Irish politics. His grandfather, John Dillon was a founder of the Young Ireland Movement. His father, John Dillon, was a most distinguished <Col N="403" /> member of the Irish Parliamentary Party.  He was a member who probably saw more of the changes that were taking place from 1917 onwards than any other member of that party. Then there was James himself, who came into Irish politics in the formative years of our political development &mdash; I think 1932 was his first election.  He served for almost 40 years in and out of Government; but, may I say, in Government with the greatest distinction of all.  He was probably the greatest Minister for Agriculture that this country has ever had, present incumbents excepted.  He was the first Minister who recognised agriculture for its crucial and pivotal role in the Irish economy and he saw to it that there was something done about it to give it its central position.  Senators have mentioned his achievements while he was in office.  There was the Land Project, the Bovine TB Eradication scheme. There was the research institute, An Foras Talúntais.  There were many, many others and they remain as living and continuing monuments to James Dillon's work as a Minister.</P>
      <P>I mourn his passing as a great parliamentarian, a great orator, a great raconteur and a great wit.  He was all of these things, all together.  He had a heart larger than this House itself.</P>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to his wife, Maura, to his son, John, and his wife and grandchildren. I might quote, in conclusion, what somebody said the other day: James Dillon bestrode the political world that he moved in and lived in like Colossus. We mourn him.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose the Order of Business for today as Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4.  We will have an adjournment for tea from 5.30 to 6.30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the remainder of the Order of Business, I want to assure the House <Col N="404" /> that it has always been my policy to try to get agreement, particularly agreement relating to Private Members' Time.  In spite of the accusations that are occasionally made against me for the way in which I have ordered certain items on the Order of Business, particularly relating to Private Members' Time, I want to assure the House that I have always tried to have the fullest consultation with the people concerned.  In this regard, I want to put on the record of the House my appreciation of Fianna Fáil, who had put down a Private Members' motion, which, at the time it was tabled, was politically the correct thing for them to do.  They were kind enough to adjourn final consideration of it because the negotiations had reached a very delicate stage.  Because of that they agreed to defer the taking of the balance of the time allocated for that motion, which is Motion No. 5.</P>
    <P>Last week I thought I had agreement that we should not continue it on that day because we felt it inopportune, and after a parliamentary party process it was decided that it was required to be taken by Fianna Fáil and there was a vote on the Order of Business.  This week, again in trying to reach agreement, I have had discussions with both parties concerned in Private Members' Time and had offered to Fianna Fáil that, if they did not consider that they should pursue the balance of their 30 minutes on No. 5, we would consider allowing them one and a half hours to deal with another motion because one hour and a half would be required to deal adequately with it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the other party concerned, the Fine Gael Party, whose time it is after the 30 minutes have expired, feel that it is their right to go into their time for their chosen motion and that would be at 7 o'clock.  In spite of my best efforts I failed to reach agreement and it is now a matter for the House.  I am proposing then, in view of what I have said &mdash; and I hope that all sides will accept what I have said and the sincerity with which I have put it &mdash; that at 6.30, after returning from the tea adjournment, we will take No. 5 for the 30 minutes allocated and from 7 to 8 o'clock we will take <Col N="405" /> No. 6.  I propose the Order of Business as Items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in that order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the efforts made by Senator Ferris to accommodate us, we cannot agree to the Order of Business because we feel that No. 35 should be taken instead of either No. 5 or 6.  It is some time since this motion on education was introduced.  We agreed that we would not take the last 30 minutes of it then because discussions were taking place between the Minister for Education and the teachers.  We did not want to upset things at that time and we did not insist on taking the last 30 minutes and having a vote.  There was no agreement between the teachers and the Minister. We felt that our 30 minutes should be taken last week in order that we could express our feelings as the Members of the Dáil did on the following day.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House, Senator Dooge, was not in favour of it being taken last week but he was not here at the time it arose and we had to insist on a vote on it and we were defeated on the vote.  We tried last week to raise that matter under another procedure and also the question of the hospitals.  It was ruled out by the Cathaoirleach and I asked him if there was any other way of doing it and he suggested by agreement between the Whips.  I spoke to the Fine Gael Whip and he would not agree to us taking the motion on Thursday of last week.  He did say on Thursday morning last that he would be prepared to accommodate us some other time.  This is &ldquo;some other time&rdquo; just now.  I am very disappointed with Fine Gael that they were not prepared to accommodate us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to point out here that we are the principal Opposition, and the only Opposition party here, and we are allowed three hours for a motion.  The Government Party are allowed six hours to our three hours, as the Labour Party have three hours and the Fine Gael Party have three hours; the Independents get three hours, which we do not begrudge. The Government Party are getting six hours on Private Members' Business to <Col N="406" /> our three hours.  We agreed to that, but when we agree to it there should be, now and again, some consideration given in return.  If Fine Gael are not prepared to agree to what I have asked we will be asking the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to have another look at how those Private Members' Motions should be taken.  Therefore I cannot agree to the Order of Business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get involved in any inter-party squabbling about the Order of Business.  I would like to welcome the promotion of Item No. 4 from away down the Order Paper to No. 4 which is the Bill in my name, Senator Ryan's and Senator Robb's for the abolition of capital punishment.  Although I welcome it, I would say in passing that out of courtesy I would have thought as it is in our name we might have been informed or consulted about it being ordered today, especially in view of the remarks that Senator Ferris has just passed that he normally consults the groups about such matters.  I would like to ask a question about this: does it indicate that it is now Government policy &mdash; I would like the Leader of the House to help me in this &mdash; to abolish capital punishment? Does it indicate that the Government are accepting this Bill or just debating it?  Does it indicate that the Government are proposing their own Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the Order of Business as proposed.  Certainly, as a member of the Fine Gael Party, I would like to facilitate Fianna Fáil with regard to Private Members' Time in the best way in which that can be done.  It was appreciated at the time that they were facilitating the Government with regard to the motion on education. Last week, as you will appreciate, the matter came before the House and it seemed to be a matter of great importance. That 30 minutes is available to Fianna Fáil now; even though it is our turn we are not seeking to upset that arrangement.  We are anxious that Fianna Fáil would take the remaining 30 minutes <Col N="407" /> on No. 5, and then take their normal turn in the House.  It may well be that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will change it some time but the normal rule of the House after that is that the next party get their opportunity and the next party is the Fine Gael Party.  If the Committee on Procedure and Privileges want to change it and give Fianna Fáil more time than that, that is fair enough. They can put that proposal to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  In the normal way it is unreasonable to expect Fine Gael to allow two Fianna Fáil items in Private Members' Time to be raised one after the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get party political about it.  I know what happened last week and I think the Senator knows what happened last week.  He knows why it is no longer opportune that it should be taken.  The wind is now blowing in a different direction.  I think there is nothing wrong with the proposal of the Leader of the House that the 30 minutes remaining to Fianna Fáil be taken and then the normal pattern re-established.  The normal pattern is that the next party whose turn it is should get whatever Private Members' time they feel is appropriate in the circumstances at the time.  That is all we are asking for and in the circumstances I support the Order of Business as proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Senator O'Leary to say that Fine Gael were granting a concession to Fianna Fáil to have a half an hour debate in Private Members' Time on the motion on teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not.</P>

    <Col N="408" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That was clearly my understanding. I would like to inform the House that Fine Gael have not the prerogative of deciding whether Fianna Fáil would use that half an hour or not.  Senator O'Leary then went on to say that he wanted to re-establish the norm.  The norm was disestablished last week and that is the problem.  In fairness to the Fianna Fáil Senators we have tried to be as co-operative as possible in the organisation of the business of this House and we rarely have a vote.  It is only because contempt is now being displayed for that goodwill and that co-operation the we find ourselves in the position where we must wrestle to try to get reasonable time for what we want to do here.</P>
      <P>Secondly, because of the wrangle last week, it was indicated to our Whip that an effort would be made to accommodate us this week.  Clearly, no effort has been made in this regard.  It would only be right at this stage if the Acting Leader of the House and the Government parties made some effort to try to see that there is a fair resolution of this problem.  We are wasting a lot of time and we will be wasting more time in the future if we do not try to uphold the co-operation which has always been part and parcel of the character of operations in this House.  It is being systematically dismantled.  It is being done by the majority parties, parties who face the electorate continually telling them how they would consider minority groups and others.  We happen to be a minority group in the Seanad and we are entitled to some rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDeBrun" hpid="Séamus de Brún Séamus de Brún">
      <NameTxt>Séamus de Brún</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support both my colleagues, that is, the acting leader of Fianna Fáil and Senator Smith, in all they have said in regard to these two motions.  The fact is that, notwithstanding what has been said on the other side of the House, there is a half hour due to Fianna Fáil on a motion that has been already discussed in this House.  It was agreed last week between the Whips and the parties on the other side that that half hour would not be utilised but, in lieu of that, that we would be accommodated on another occasion. <Col N="409" /> The accommodation which we are seeking now is in view of the situation that has arisen in the meantime.</P>
      <P>The situation in regard to the teachers' motion has taken a different turn in so far as there has been a vote on that motion in the other House.  In view of that and in view of the fact that both motions are equally nationally important, we are asking now that the motion on health, that is, the motion on the hospitals &mdash; St. Dympna's in Carlow and Saint Patrick's in Castlerea &mdash; be taken today instead of the motion on education.  I do not think that is an unreasonable request: I think we are being denied our rights here. We are being denied our rights and I would like to say that I am very disappointed that we are being treated thus.  It is very unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, in case there might be any misunderstanding about what Senator de Brún said, we are asking that item No. 35 be substituted this evening for the one-and-a-half hours during which items Nos. 5 and 6 would be taken.  We feel that, in view of the way in which this side of the House was treated last week, we should be accommodated this week and that we should be given an opportunity to discuss in Private Members' Time for one-and-a-half hours the motion dealing with the closure of Saint Dympna's Hospital, Carlow, and Saint Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea.  When we made this request we felt that there would be agreement on this matter in view of the fact that Senators on the other side of the House have expressed their opposition to the closure of both Saint Dympna's Hospital, Carlow, and Saint Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea and a debate on this motion this evening would give them the opportunity of letting the Government and the Minister for Health know they were opposed to these two closures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of things have come to my notice.  Is Senator Mullooly saying &mdash; if he is, it would surprise me &mdash; that he is no longer defensive of the <Col N="410" /> teachers and the teachers' union, to which he belongs at heart.  Senator Smith talks about rights of minorities. I would ask him to inform himself by getting the minutes of every AGM of every council meeting, urban council and county council throughout this nation, during last year and he will find how his party treat minorities.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentions that he is the leader of the only Opposition party.  May I remind him that there is another Opposition party, the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>Regardless of what happened last week, nobody can deny that Item No.35 is far more important for debate on this occasion than the items selected by the Fine Gael Party.  In view of the concern that has been expressed both in Castlerea, County Roscommon, and in Carlow during the week, I cannot understand how the members of the Fine Gael Party who were present at these meetings and who expressed concern for the patients and the workers in those hospitals, can sit here and tell us that Item No. 5 on the prison system is more important than the motion we are trying to propose and have discussed here.  It is a shame for those people.  I mention in particular Senator Connor who was present in Castlerea and who gave a commitment to the people of Castlerea, both to the patients and to the workers in that hospital, that he would do everything possible to have their case highlighted and to support them.  He is going to sit today and allow the opportunity to pass of having that item discussed on the floor of this House.</P>

I know that Senator Connor is a hypocrite when it comes to Castlerea.  Senator de Brún at a public meeting in Castlerea said that he would raise the matter on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that we are not depriving the Opposition of anything on the Order of Business. On Item No. 5 there is 30 minutes remaining.  The Minister was not <Col N="412" /> available last week.  Fianna Fáil are entitled to that 30 minutes and then in the ordinary sequence of events Private Members' Time comes to the Fine Gael Party and we have selected Motion No. 6 in Senator Durcan's name.  What the Opposition have not said is that they wish to withdraw Motion No. 5.  It is up to them to decide what they want to utilise the time on.</P>

What I said was that we could not reach agreement last week but that if the question was down as an ordinary motion we would try to facilitate the Opposition and have it debated.  That referred entirely to Motion No. 5; that was the undertaking I gave.  I did not say a word about any other motion.</P>

I indicated that that is likely to be the position for the future where we cannot get agreement.

We should try to arrange our business in an orderly way and in a way that ensures that the business of this House is transacted speedily and that we can represent the people for whom we are here to speak.  I am appalled at the hypocrisy displayed very blatantly today by the principal Opposition party.  There is a serious issue about which the principal Opposition party have expressed concern. Senator Connor showed his concern last week when he raised that on the Adjournment of the House.  It was open to any member of the Opposition party to move under Order 29 of Standing Orders a motion seeking a special debate for an hour-and-a-half and they failed or neglected to do so.  Senator Loughrey made the point that until very recently the main issue here was the teachers' pay dispute and those who were so concerned about that in the past are now prepared to drop the teachers by the wayside because, as Senator O'Leary said, the wind is now blowing the other way and for political opportunistic reasons that have nothing to do with the good running of this country, another issue is being raised.  I fully support the Order of Business as proposed.</P>

      <P>I would not like the occasion to pass without some mention of the dastardly killings at Maguires-bridge last night.  We have heard a great tribute from this House to a remarkable Irishman, a great parliamentarian and a constitutional nationalist.  We have seen how far Ireland has come in the three generations of the Dillon family.  We have also to recognise the other side of the coin, that is, when people depart from constitutional and democratic methods and we find ourselves witnessing what was referred to this morning in our news. In expressing sympathy &mdash; and I am sure the rest of the House would like to join me &mdash; to the families affected, I would also like to pay tribute to the security forces on this side of the Border and to make a plea.  Last week I heard in Dublin one or two people saying &ldquo;Why should we spend all this money on security on this side of the Border when it is a Border that we did not seek, that we did not create and that we do not want?&rdquo; Unless there is a feeling of security for the people who are isolated in south Fermanagh and south Tyrone, then that Border will increase in both depth and width.  That is the great justification for having stronger security on this side of the Border comparable with what is being attempted on the other side of it.  But, the same time we recognise the need to move forward in the parliamentary tradition, following the great principles of constitutional nationalism which were laid down 100 years age.  The two go hand in hand.</P>

      <P>In proposing the Order of Business, I apologised for the fact that I had been unable to reach agreement. Perhaps that is my fault.  I want to assure Senator Smith that a supreme effort was made to reach agreement.  The decision about Private Members' time is a decision by agreement.  It is not a Standing Order of the House.  It is a consensus between the groups.  The previous consensus was that a motion would last the three hours in two periods of one and a half hours each.  I have already thanked Fianna Fáil for the way they had agreed to postpone the final 30 minutes.  I want to assure Senator Smith, and indeed the House, that I tried to reach agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the point made by Senator Ross in regard to item No. 4, the questions he raised are a matter for the Minister in the House.  I am sure the Senator is aware of the Minister's public pronouncement on this issue.  Whether the Minister intends to bring in a Bill of his own or not, I do not know.  I am ordering the legislation as I see the need for it &mdash; Government priority, first of all, and then other Private Members' Bills and Private Members' motions.  That is why it was ordered at No. 4 today.  It is unlikely now with the kind of progress we are making, that we will get to it.  It would be remiss of me not to order it because it is a matter of concern to many of us.  It is for that reason that I ordered it as No. 4.  It would <Col N="416" /> be a matter for the Minister for Justice to intimate to the Senator the view of the Government, or indeed the view of the House, on the subject.  We will continue on the Second Stage of this Bill unless a Government Bill is brought forward. That is my view.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Ryan's proposal to amend the Order of Business, I am prepared to have further discussions, as a mediator between the two sides, if this would be of benefit to the House.  May I clarify in my mind what Senator Ryan is suggesting?  Is he suggesting that they would not use their 30 minutes for No. 5, but would use that 30 minutes for No. 35?  If we do not have that kind of agreement, I want to know.  The orders of the House say that if a matter being discussed is concluded it falls and immediately the next Private Members' Business takes over.  That is how it has happened in the past.  I want to know from Fianna Fáil whether they are looking for No. 35 to be taken for 30 minutes instead of No. 5 at 6.30 p.m. and then we will go on to the Fine Gael Motion No. 6.  If the Chair feels that I should try to reach some other agreement, if I am allowed time I will announce to you later if I can reach agreement. I will propose the Order of Business up to 5.30 p.m., that is, Nos. 1,2, 3 and 4.  If the House wants me to continue the negotiations I have had all the morning and over the weekend and yesterday, I will do so.</P>

      <P>When I was dealing with this matter last week I focussed on the unemployment problem.  This is the most important aspect of this Bill.  It has as a main intention to deal in large measure with the unemployment problem, in a positive way not simply as an overspill from the National Development Corporation. It is important for all of us to bring the plight of the unemployed to the <Col N="419" /> forefront of political and parliamentary discussion.  I have been critical of the various employment schemes.  It is only fair to welcome this Bill in so far as it may do something about the unemployment problem.  We on this side of the House, do not think it will do so.  All the experts have reservations.  The one that is quoted most often is from the <i>Irish Banking Review</i>, September 1985, where it is pointed out that we take a very pessimistic view of the National Development Corporation's future operations and that experience elsewhere hardly supports any other opinion.  That is an indictment of the Bill, and a very damning one. Nevertheless, as I say, to whatever extent it helps with the unemployment problem, we welcome it.</P>
      <P>I said, when we were dealing with this matter of unemployment, that the Government should have approached it in some radical way, realising that we have a crisis of change in the whole area of society.  I highlighted this last week to some extent.  With all the changes that have taken place since the industrial revolution, and since Tudor times and the changeover from the feudal system, there has been no change in the concept of employment, jobs or work.  It is a fundamental fault in the Bill that it does not focus on the problem of unemployment. It does not analyse it.  It does not try to deal with those changes.</P>
      <P>We have a number of groups linked together as failures &mdash; the retired, the ill, both mentally and physically, and the unemployed.  In past times the unemployed were the uneducated, those who were unable to get jobs in manual or menial occupations.  At the present time we have very highly qualified people unemployed.  They are all grouped together as failures.  This concept is wrong.  At the present there is neglect of research into this whole psychology of employment.  I have already quoted from Ann Sharp in the <i>Technology Ireland</i>, May 1985.  A number of factors emerge. We have fear, distress, numbness and apathy, and then socially disruptive behaviour and reactive behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> What the Government seem to be trying to do with this National Development Corporation is to make some inroads into the unemployment problem without taking into consideration the changes that have occurred.  They have not taken notice of the fact, for example, that technology has taken over to a very great extent and that the whole concept of work has changed.  Some people feel that in the future much time will be spent in leisure occupations.  No examination of this probability was carried out in a scientific way.  That is a fundamental flaw in the Bill.  Primarily, while the Bill and the National Development Corporation try to deal with the two problems &mdash; the commercial aspect and employment &mdash; it seems to me that by far the greatest problem is in the area of providing employment.  All the experts say the Bill is not going to provide that.  The evidence in Europe is that, where similar Bills were passed and where they had similar development corporations, they were a failure in every instance except in Sweden.</P>
    <P>On the basis of being tried and tested, it seems to me that the National Development Corporation is a failure from the word go.  If it does anything in that area, we welcome it.  We are all in favour of anything that would help in the smallest possible way.  We ask ourselves, is it possible in this instance that we could be the second country where such a scheme is going to be a success?  It seems to me that the answer must be no.  No matter what commercial operation we start, jobs will only be a means to an end.  As I pointed out last week, the whole trend has been to try to reduce employment and to increase the use of machinery.  Machinery is punctual.  It turns on with a switch.  It does not get sick.  It does not stay away on Mondays.  By and large, the whole trend has been to try to reduce employment by increasing the use of machinery. Now, of course, in this age of technology, with computerisation in all the other areas, this trend continues.  There is a big conflict here which I do not see resolved in any area of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This examination into the concept of work is most important, and I think it is <Col N="421" /> coming to the forefront generally.  I refer to a book by Charles Hanly, <i>The Future of Work</i>, which I do not have time to quote from.  At present there is a series of programmes on radio concerned with the future of work.  All these things show us clearly that the concept of work must be examined.  We must have a different evaluation from that which we had in the past.  In other words, we must come into the modern world.</P>
    <P>With regard to this Bill, both parties in the Government claim that they have a long-standing commitment to the National Development Corporation. Here we have two extremes &mdash; a capitalist side, and a social side looking for full employment and which is not necessarily linked to the profit motive.  In this area there is bound to be conflict in a Coalition Government.  It brings me back to my own youth and to the time when in County Meath, Fine Gael were identified with the big landlords.  It always seemed strange to me that labourers on these estates should associate themselves with people who were not committed to solving their problems.  I see an incompatibility there.  The problems will be left over to be carried out by a Fianna Fáil Government. I feel that this Government will no longer exist and that in a sense this is the reason for the delay in bringing forward this Bill which was promised for so long.</P>
    <P>There are many people who have wrong views about the unemployed. There are people who claim that it is an advantage to be unemployed and that those unemployed are better off.  To some degree a case can be made in this respect.  I wonder, if those in employment and those unemployed had their wages pooled and divided, what way it would work out.  As I stated previously, the problem with the unemployed is not simply being unemployed but a recourse to crime, the abuse of drugs and all those related problems in the health area.</P>
    <P>We know that the climate for investment is not right at present.  We must try to find a climate in which it will be possible to invest.  There is no incentive for investment.  We must try to create a climate where it would be profitable to <Col N="422" /> invest.  There is no incentive for investment. I feel that the consensus with regard to the budget is that, by and large in this regard it was mainly negative. There are many people who feel that the Minister for Finance could be compared to somebody with a metal detector going around to find out wherever there is wealth and then digging it up.  This does not help with regard to investment.  The cost of finance is too high.  It has been stated that a loan equity of one to one is the most desirable, but in fact in this country it works out at about 14 to one, which is out of all proportion and which makes the cost of financing operations far too high.  There is no doubt that high taxation is the cause of failure in most firms.  There would be sufficient capital if there were tax or other incentives. Indeed in that situation there would be no need at all for the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>Many times in this House I have spoken about research and its importance. There is no question whatever but that research is very important, no matter what risks are to be taken.  The risks can be minimised through research.  At the same time, I believe that at the end of the day a certain amount of good luck is necessary, or whatever it is that makes the difference between success and failure. In my time when going to school we did permutations and combinations in mathematics.  Brought down to the practical level, it was shown for example, that if I tossed a penny 20 times and it came down heads on the 21st time I throw it up, there was still a 50-50 chance for heads or harps.  That holds in business.  It is very true in business that there is no foolproof way of knowing beforehand that a project will be successful.  There is always this uncertain element.  Luck is also necessary, but the risks can be minimised. In many cases they are not being minimised.  At the same time, comparing the National Development Corporation to a company in a private situation, I do not think it would have the same thrust. One does not have the same hungry fighter seeking to win.  The sights are not set in the same way as an individual <Col N="423" /> entrepreneur would set his sights.  The same ambition is not there or the same commitment to prove oneself.  Possibly the same ruthlessness would not be there. These are all problems which, in my view, pose a question mark after the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>There is also the aspect of realising the assets &mdash; in other words, turning over the finances in a rolling situation, as it is referred to.  In one sense, while I understand that a case could be made for that, on the other hand it seems strange that the National Development Corporation would take the risks, make a project viable and profitable, and then at that stage turn it over to a private group.  It seems to me that that part should be reexamined. I am not saying it is wrong, but it is a policy about which I would ask many questions.</P>
    <P>With regard to research, I believe that in social engineering it is necessary to define the objectives.  While they are defined here in a commercial sense and in the employment sense, I think that they should be more strictly defined.  Of course, this may only be possible as a policy directive.  Again, it may have to await a change of Government.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, many graduates who, I am sure, could lift this country up by its shoestrings.  I have no doubt about that, if they were given the opportunity. Indeed, many of them are being lost to other countries.  There are great possibilities there.  On the other hand, we all could recount from our experience cases of many individuals who have been successful in business and who have been unable to read or write.  I know of many of them myself.  Some of them are millionaires or are regarded as millionaires. While many highly educated graduates from our colleges and third level educational establishments are being lost to the country at present, we rightly look to such graduates for help in this regard.  On the other hand, there are many people who are unable to get education.  I feel they also have something considerable to contribute.  Perhaps some of those people whom I spoke of have no formal education <Col N="424" /> but they might quite possibly have something to contribute when this Bill is passed and when the National Development Corporation is set up.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for change.  My party have produced a policy document on science and technology which I feel is very important in this area.  It points out the need for change and the potential contribution of science and technology to economic development.  It states quite categorically that this is not being realised at present.  It gives a number of reasons. May I just name a few of those?</P>
    <P>Responsibility for different elements of the science and technology framework is spread between different Government Departments without any formal co-ordination including the Departments of Labour, Education, Industry and Commerce and Communications. In important respects the different elements of what is presented as science and technology policy conflict.  Industrial development efforts in high technology areas are being or will be, hampered by the inadequate levels of support for science and technology research and training activity.  The technology capability of Irish industry is very low compared with our competitors.</P>
    <P>Firms in Ireland devote considerably less resources to Research and Development than firms in other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>Of 4,652 Irish owned manufacturing firms in 1982 only 74 had formal Research and Development departments. Only 231 conducted any research and development.</P>
    <P>There is insufficient industrial spin-off from college-based research in science and technology.  The importance of the Information Technologies is not acknowledged by the allocation of resources to promote awareness. Appreciation of the importance of high technology industries is not backed up by intensive efforts to select market areas in which Irish firms may succeed.</P>
    <P>I believe these are all areas where the <Col N="425" /> Government could help; and it does not require a Bill of this kind to do so.  In regard to agriculture &mdash; also dealt with under this Bill &mdash; much more could be done.  I believe that we could have far more employment on the land.  For example, in 1928 the ratio of those employed on the land to those employed in all the other industries was 18 to 20.  In 1968 it was 60 to 40.  In 1978 it was 22 to 78 and I am quite sure that this year it would be a complete reversal of 1928 when it was 20 to 80.  That is extraordinary in a primarily agricultural country.</P>
    <P>Much can be done in the area of horticulture. We have a motion coming up in this regard.  Membership of the board will probably be restricted to those with a record of achievement but I think that those with ability should have an opportunity of being on the board.  In this way it would be possible to make the greatest inroads into those problems.</P>
    <P>Staff should be of the highest calibre. Education is very important; but just as important is gumption, cop on or whatever you like to call that shrewd sense of feeling that individuals have.  It is felt that this is a political measure rather than one to tackle our economic problems.  At least this is the cynical view but the article to which I referred in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> states that the extent to which the NDC can depart from normal commercial criteria should be fully detailed.  I think this should be done from the start.</P>
    <P>There will be political pressures with regard to operations in this area and I suppose we will all be making representations. At present we encounter many people who want to set up in business and they have problems.  All of these seem to feel that their project would be a success.  It will be difficult to make the selection.  The latest project about which I was approached was in relation to the processing of potatoes.  A man who is an authority in that area &mdash; and, indeed, has a Ph.D. to prove it &mdash; feels that he can process potatoes as either chips or full potatoes peeled.  He maintains that they will retain their appearance and their flavour naturally for 35 days.  It would <Col N="426" /> take £1,250,000 to set up the plant to carry out that operation.</P>
    <P>Will that kind of project be helped by the National Development Corporation? Certainly, it must be considered; but there will also be representations made by politicians and other concerned people and I wonder to what extent political expediency will be considered.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that the intention is not to bail out firms in difficulty, but at the same time I am sure there would be many firms in difficulty that it would be proper to bail out.  It seems to me that it would be wrong to eliminate that area totally.  It is not only manufacturing industry which will be considered, and I think this is important.  I could refer to the State-sponsored bodies but this has been referred to in detail in the other House and I do not want to go over the same area.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask if the National Development Corporation will cream off the paying industries.  I think that this would again be wrong.  They will be in a monopoly situation or they certainly will be in a position to monopolise in that area.  I wonder what restriction will be on them in regard to that.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed the closure of many factories, mostly big factories and some small ones.  I do recognise that in the past 20 years or so the small factory has come into its own, the enterprise with a small number of people.  I am sure that there is far more scope in this regard.  I feel that, as firms grow bigger, it is more difficult; and there is always the danger of collapse as they get too big for themselves. I believe there are some firms that are more or less deemed to be small and that if they grow to be large firms they will become non-viable.</P>
    <P>The Small Firms' Association, as well as many other groups, made submissions before the budget and the response, by and large, was negative.  Many of them were extremely disappointed.  Many of the established small companies, if they got financial help in the budget, would have been able to give more employment. As it is, somebody with a small business looking for a loan from the bank <Col N="427" /> has to give personal guarantees, perhaps mortgage his house, and the interest rate is somewhere in the region of 23 per cent, whereas I believe in Germany money can be borrowed at 5 per cent.  That is a big difference and that is an area where the Government could help out.  Statistics show how good small firms have been and the Government could have been imaginative in that area.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 84 loans, which were referred to by the Minister, I should like to point out that my understanding is that these are not available to small firms and that, in general, between £100,000 and £200,000 must be borrowed. Therefore, in reality section 84 benefits only large firms.  Since the budget there is an additional surcharge of 15 per cent, which is a clawback to the Government and, again, is a big disincentive. The Leader of my party has pointed out in his submission in the other House that the micro-electronic revolution is an area where much could be done.  This is something with which we would all agree. Fisheries and forestry have been referred to, but I do not have to go into them in great detail.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a few areas in the Minister's speech.  He spoke about the development of an environment.  Of course, it is the prerogative of a Government to achieve this.  He spoke also about a gradual process requiring a significant change of attitudes.  If he refers to employment and labour, I would agree; but in the area of commerce I am not really convinced.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of a less conservative attitude towards risk taking.  I cannot see that being achieved because, by and large, people who invest are looking for profit and at the least risk.  So, while it seems very convincing to read that, in practice I think it is meaningless.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke of the emphasis in this year's budget which was aimed at the creation of a better climate for investment in industry.  As I said, the general consensus was that the overall effect of the budget was a negative one. The Minister stated that the National <Col N="428" /> Development Corporation was an integral part of the Government's industrial and job creation strategy.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is a body with the task of investing in enterprises which might not otherwise develop or even get off the ground.</P>
    <P>That would have to be expanded more. They would have to have some other claim rather than simply being enterprises which could not get off the ground because I would ask why did they not get off the ground.  If the answer is simply finances, then possibly a case could be made if sufficient research projected that some operation would be a success.  But to state blandly that it is a body with a task of investing in enterprises which might not otherwise develop or even get off the ground, is not a convincing argument.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the National Development Corporation was also designed as an integral part of the Government's strategy for innovation. This project was tried, tested and failed in other countries, so there is no innovation there.  Neither is there innovation with regard to the labour and employment element, with regard to our approach to employment and a change of emphasis about employment, so that employment would not be regarded as it has been regarded since the industrial revolution, in the sense that somebody working in a semi-skilled job, for example, was defined as a labourer simply because he worked at the project.  It related to his employment and why should it?  I do not think that is right.  That whole concept would have to be looked at.  I do not see how the Government can claim that there is any innovation there.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>... that the National Development Corporation must be viewed as one important element of the Government's overall package to tackle the unemployment problem and <Col N="429" /> to stimulate a greater level of investment in the traded sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>He then went on to say that:</P>
    <P>The potential contribution of the Corporation is enormous but it should not be expected to cure the problem of unemployment of its own accord.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is going to do anything for employment.  Last weekend we had a situation where the number on the Unemployment Register rose to 240,000. If we can believe the papers, the reaction of the Government was to say that they were very well satisfied with those figures.  In other words, they were saying that the figure that might have been expected could be more.  In that situation any figure could be accepted.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert in this area I do not pretend to be, but reading those who are experts in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> and other articles, I find it stated that this has been a failure in other countries.  They see no reason why it should be a success here.  We are all very much concerned about the unemployment problem, so if it does succeed in doing anything in this area, that will be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill sincerely. It is a wise departure from what has existed heretofore in so far as companies can be helped in areas of difficulty. We know of industries that have collapsed in the past because assistance was not forthcoming at the critical stage. This Bill is intended to do that.  I would like to compliment the Minister on the very comprehensive statement he made introducing the Bill outlining his provisions. It would not interfere with the work of the IDA or Fóir Teoranta.  He gave a clear exposition to the House of the purposes behind the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big problem facing the country is unemployment.  The Bill is being introduced to reduce unemployment.  Some Senators gave the impression that unemployment was a new experience for us in Ireland and some Senators say the problem of unemployment dates back <Col N="430" /> only three or four years.  Unemployment has been a problem in Ireland since the State was founded.  It was relieved by emigration during the thirties and forties when over 70,000 people emigrated. The countries to which these people emigrated also have unemployment problems. They are curtailing the number of emigrants.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the problem of how best to provide work for our people.  It is made difficult for a number of reasons. One of the reasons for unemployment is the worldwide recession.  We have a very high young population in Ireland.  It will tax the best efforts of governments in the future to provide full employment.  We must face up to the fact that technological advances are reducing the manpower required for several industries.  The problem is a very big one and is not confined to this country alone.  There are approximately 14 million unemployed in the countries of the EC.</P>
    <P>Everyone must be aware of the enormity of the problem that confronts us and, at the same time, recognise the genuine efforts made to ease the problem.  I believe that a genuine effort is being made at an opportune time to do that. We should all give it our blessing and watch its effect.  Since the State was founded we have failed to solve the unemployment problem.  A shortage of capital is one reason, a shortage of raw material, industrial expertise and so on but various steps have been taken by different governments to improve some of these matters.  There is an improvement in our expertise, capital is provided, and assistance is given in different ways to get industry established.  There are some areas where we have every reason to be proud of the progress made even though we might be disappointed that the progress was not on a bigger scale.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out to the House, a number of industries from time to time have collapsed because capital to keep them going was not readily available at a rate they could afford.  The position in the last few years was compounded by the fact that exorbitant rates of interest prevailed.  Many industries that went to <Col N="431" /> the wall because of the exorbitant rates of interest demanded of them on borrowed money would have survived if money had not been so dear.  Other industries have failed because the capital was not there to install new plants.  The capital might have been just barely sufficient to keep it going working on outdated machinery, but then competition became so keen &mdash; we live in a highly competitive world &mdash; that this outdated plant was not able to produce the goods at a rate that made them competitive on the world market. So it was inevitable that these industries or businesses would go to the wall in a very short time.  That, indeed, happened.</P>
    <P>Others have failed because of poor management and of a failure to recognise that there were progressive changes in the consumer demand.  The type of goods, the presentation of goods that did ten to 15 years ago just will not do now. These changes in the consumer market just passed some managers and their agents by.  The order books ran short, men were left off and places were closed down.  That has been the sad litany of what has been happening.  It was in very large measures, though not entirely, due to the fact that capital was very difficult to obtain at a price that the business or industry could afford and remain competitive.</P>
    <P>Another very important point, in my view, is our rate of absenteeism from work.  It is at 13 per cent of our work force, according to figures issued by the CII, and is by far the highest rate of absenteeism in the EC.  We cannot continue to compete successfully in a highly competitive market as long as we have a rate of absenteeism of that magnitude. Sometimes there is a failure on the part of the management in industry to move with the times.  At other times it is a failure on the part of the workforce to realise that they are in a competitive world and that there is no compulsion on people to buy the products that they send out on the world market if they are not of top quality and are not competitive in price.</P>
    <P>As a proof of what I am saying, I refer <Col N="432" /> very briefly to a dispute in a bacon curing plant last year where the rate of productivity per man employed was about one-third of the productivity rate in the best run bacon curing plants in the country.  If people working in a place like that, with very low rate of productivity as compared with their competitors at home, not to mention the Danes and others, want more holidays and shorter working weeks, it is complete proof of the fact that these people do not realise that they are trying to eke out an existence in a highly competitive world.  That sort of approach is outmoded.  If it is not cleared up by the wise leadership and guidance of the more responsible people in their groups, then there is little hope.</P>
    <P>Neither is there any hope for development in this country if you have responsible people making the kind of promise that was made a few years ago to car workers in the city here that they were assured of a full week's wages even if they never did a day's work.  One cannot have the proper approach to responsibility of work force and to a proper understanding of what they are up against if you have that kind of leadership.</P>
    <P>Senator Conway last week referred to the fact that when the Irish people went abroad, especially to America, they won greater fame and respect for their ability as workmen and women.  I think the main cause of that is something that American friends of mine keep telling me: that you are only a very short time in the United States of America when you clearly understand that, if you do not work, you do not eat.  That is the force to drive people to do a full day's work.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a certain reluctance on the part of people to invest in industry.  That is a well known fact. Senator Fitzsimons referred to it also.  It is due, in my opinion, to a number of reasons.  One reason would be the number of industries that collapsed without paying any dividends.  In the early years of the industrialisation of this country overemphasis was placed on introducing textile and footwear industries into this part of the world at a time when it was becoming obvious that in <Col N="433" /> traditional textile areas like Lancashire and Yorkshire, and also parts of France and Italy, the textile industry was under tremendous competition from the Far East.  Indeed, that competition from the Far East has gained such strength that even in these traditional textile areas there was a slump.</P>
    <P>That is not to imply that I think the IDA did not do useful work.  I would like, in passing, to pay tribute to the wonderful work by the IDA, but I believe what I have said with regard to some types of industries that were introduced &mdash; that they were the wrong choice because of what was happening the world over.  That also left people with a reluctance to invest.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fitzsimons pointed out, it is true that investment in industry does not yield the same return.  I have a few lines here from the CII <i>Newsletter</i> of 7 January 1986.  It deals with the question of investment that the Minister referred to.  It states:</P>
    <P>There is need for a major improvement in the climate of investment.  At present most people prefer to invest their savings in Government stocks or in the Post Office rather than in productive enterprise.  Ireland needs enterprise.  We have one of the highest unemployment rates in the European Community.  But more jobs and better living standards can only come from greater wealth creation through more rapid growth and productive output. Yet last year individuals and institutions invested 20 times more in risk free Government stocks than in new risk capital manufacturing industry. The reasons are obvious: profitability is low; the cost of essential services are exceptionally high; and the taxation system is biased against equity investment in industry.</P>
    <P>That is the view expressed by the president of the CII.  I agree with everything there.  The burden of taxation which hits industry is a spin-off effect of reckless borrowing in the past which left us with an enormous foreign debt.  As conditions improve it would be right, as the Minister <Col N="434" /> said, if people did invest in industry in order to build up prosperity, because in the last analysis the standard of living depends almost entirely on what we produce. If we produce greater wealth, we should have a higher standard of living. We cannot build up a higher standard of living on borrowed money.  Our standard of living depends on our productivity. Our productivity depends on our being abreast of modern developments, on our having management with expertise and salesmen with expertise and a committed workforce determined to do a full day's work every day and reduce the rate of absenteeism.</P>
    <P>An industrialist friend of mine from Europe pays tribute to the skill, intelligence and adaptability of the Irish worker but he cannot understand their readiness to stay away from work for trivial reasons.  He regards some of the medical certificates that are sent in about pains in the back and so on as triviality and a desire to avoid work and an irresponsible approach to their commitment to their employers.  What I have been saying is part of what is necessary if we are to become a successful country in a highly competitive world.  We are on the western fringe of the EC, competing with countries with long industrial experience and great expertise.  As an agricultural country we are competing with farmers in Denmark and other people who have developed agriculture to a very high degree.  We can no longer rest on the notion that they will buy products because they are Irish or because it is labelled with shamrocks.  We must produce good products at a competitive price.  That can only be done by good management, by a good response from the workforce and by the ability of the people involved in setting up this industry to depend on financial relief in times of difficulty at a cost they can meet.  This Bill aims to do that and therefore must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In the CII <i>Newsletter</i> of 7 January 1986 it is encouraging to read that:</P>
    <P>The food processing sector showed steady growth and the output of many <Col N="435" /> traditional sectors of industry was higher than the level at the end of last year.</P>
    <P>There is great potential for the development of the food processing industry. Other Senators who have spoken here share the same view and it is confirmed by the CII.  Anything that can be done to develop that industry will be to the good of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Other encouraging signs listed in the CII <i>Newsletter</i> are:</P>
    <P>The rate of inflation in Europe declined rapidly throughout the year. For the first time in many years Irish inflation in 1985 came into line with that of our main trading partners and a rise of only 0.2 per cent was recorded in the last quarter of the year.  Indeed wholesale prices, export prices and import prices have actually declined in recent months.  These trends point to the possibility of a very low rate of inflation in 1986, possibly about 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>If you compare that 3 per cent with the 20 per cent inflation which we had a few years ago, it indicates how close we are to being able to make rapid strides forward.</P>
    <P>The <i>Newsletter</i> continues:</P>
    <P>The medium term interest rate trend should also continue to decrease, despite short term hiccups, with rates dropping further this year.  The importance of bringing our inflation rate into line with our main trading partners was highlighted by the improved performance of many longer established sectors of manufacturing industry during 1985.</P>
    <P>These are hopeful indications that generate a certain amount of optimism, provided we face up to reality and that we realise that we are in a competitive world, a world not run on sentiment.</P>
    <P>With regard to further development, I was pleased to see that forestry and tourism were mentioned by the Minister.  It <Col N="436" /> is encouraging to know that tourism generated more wealth last year.  Other Senators spoke about the potential in forestry development and timber production.  I will not repeat what has already been said.  In my constituency, around the Border counties, we have a certain disadvantage because of the Border which has affected the economic development of that area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the aid package we hope to get from the United States as a result of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, I hope that a percentage of that will be spent in the south.  A major part of it will be spent in the Six County area.  The Border counties have a special claim to a major share of whatever comes to the Republic.  A few years ago when a firm of consultants were asked to examine the prospect of development of the Erne catchment area for tourism and industry and other activities, one of their main findings was that the approach roads to the Border were in very bad repair &mdash; the worst in the country.  It is not possible to build up industry with a very bad road structure.  The creamery in Killeshandra, County Cavan, and McCormick's Milk Products, sited in the same town, are under a great disadvantage because of the poor road structure especially from Killeshandra to Cavan.  Constant complaints are being made about springs being broken and delays on the fleets of lorries.  I hope that development in that area will be assisted by the terms of the Bill, but before it can be done we will want the infrastructure that is necessary for it.  I would also join with the Senators, who drew attention to the boon it will be for tourism to have a link-up between the Erne and the Shannon.  The potential for tourism in that part of the country is very high.  I look forward to its being attained progressively over the next few years.</P>
    <P>It is bad for our thinking as a people that we should refer to so many things as being free.  At a very early stage in life, the child is introduced to what he is told are free books, free education and free buses.  We get the belief developed in the young mind and it is developed in the mind of the adolescent, that lots of things <Col N="437" /> are free.  The truth of course is that none of them is free.  They may be free to the person involved but they are provided by the taxpayer.  The sooner we get rid of that belief the better.  We can give what assistance we can afford.  I am in favour of helping people in their education.  I am in favour of helping people to buy books if they are unable to do it themselves. I am in favour of helping people with footwear if the family's finances cannot meet the bill.  These things should not be described as being free because it generates a line of thinking that if you know how to play the game properly you can get through life for free.  That is not the right approach.  That is not the fact.  The fact is that somebody, by his thrift, his entrepreneurial spirit, his hard work or his dedication has put himself into a position where the Government decide that because he has done so well, he should help so many other people.  We should have a greater realisation as a people, that to get on well we must work.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill and the way in which he did it.  I hope the tax structure will improve to such an degree that workers will find themselves in a position to invest in the industry they work in as the Minister hopes they will do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill to establish the National Development Corporation. I deeply regret that it has been introduced at least two years too late. For no good reason there has been delay in the introduction of the Bill itself into the Oireachtas and this has meant that the establishment of the NDC and getting it into working order is unlikely to have occurred during the lifetime of this Government.  I say &ldquo;for no good reason&rdquo; because if Members look at the Bill itself, it is neither a particularly complicated nor a particularly innovative nor a particularly complex Bill.  It is a very minimalist Bill.  It tells us very little about the National Development Corporation, other than the bare bones of its structure. Nonetheless, it has taken a very considerable time, far too long, to get this far and to get to the stage of having the Second <Col N="438" /> Reading of the Bill in this House.</P>
      <P>It reveals the very real difficulties of getting any kind of radical change in this country.  I am an enthusiast about the establishment of the National Development Corporation.  I have believed for a long number of years in the importance of the role it can play in our economy.  I have watched with a kind of depression and despair the political difficulties in getting the base of support for this measure. The establishment of the National Development Corporation has been a major economic plank of the Labour Party for a significant number of years. It was promoted by the Labour Party and has formed part of its strategy for a broad-based industrial policy.  It is evident that there has been much more reserve and much more ambivalence even right up to the moment on the part of the Fine Gael Party in its approach to the National Development Corporation. I very much regret this, although I can understand part of the reason for that reserve.  It is this ambivalence of approach and difficulty in endorsing fully what the National Development Corporation is about which has resulted in the kind of internal divisions which caused this unwelcome delay.</P>
      <P>That delay is regrettable, not only for the reason I have already stated &mdash; that it means that the National Development Corporation itself, its staffing, accommodation and the way in which it will approach the formulation of its objectives as set out in section 10, the assessment of various projects that may be put forward to it, that all of that is delayed and is unlikely to be in a productive stage during the lifetime of this Government &mdash; but also for the reason that a good deal of the impact of the Bill and of its leverage in the economy has been lost or has faltered because of that delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people who felt this was a very important lever and a great way of making progress in the economy have lost some faith in it.  Many young people who were aware that this was one of the commitments of the Coalition Government when it came into office, became disillusioned by the lack of progress on <Col N="439" /> this measure.  Many have questioned why it has not been pressed more strongly and why greater efforts were not made to ensure that the clear commitment was fulfilled within the first year of the Government.  There is nothing in that Bill that required any long period of complicated drafting.  It is a very simple, minimalist Bill for what it sets out to do.</P>
    <P>The structure of the Bill is in a standard format, establishing a limited company. The Bill provides for the formation, registration of the National Development Corporation, provides that it will have a memorandum and articles of association but these are not before Members of the House.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of recent examples of this kind of legislating.  It is about time we questioned it.  We had it in the Postal and Telecommunications Bill establishing An Post and Bord Telecom, The same minimal structure in the Bill and Members of the House did not have sight of the draft memo and articles of association of those two major State companies. We should have sight of the memo and articles of association of the NDC at this stage.  They should be circulated to Members so that while we are discussing the NDC we know at least structurally and from an administrative point of view, what the format of the corporation will be.  It must fit into the general structure of the Bill itself but that structure is set out in very broad, minimalist terms.</P>
    <P>There are three key sections to the Bill. Section 10 sets out at some length the principle objects of the corporation, and I will come back to some of those.  Section 13 sets out two overriding duties of the corporation, which must colour its own approach to achieving the objectives. These are:</P>
    <P>(a)  to assist in the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State, and</P>
    <P>(b)  to carry out its objects which shall include the realisation of investments made by it as soon as it is financially and commercially prudent <Col N="440" /> in such a manner as to enable the corporation to earn a reasonable return on any investment made by it and ensure that the funds are available to the revolving investment fund for employment.</P>
    <P>The third section, which tells us a good deal about the way in which the corporation will operate, is the control over the maximum amounts of investment.  I think those three sections taken together are really the heart of the thrust and viability of the National Development Corporation. Before I come to the objectives in detail I think it necessary, in the light of what I have been saying and other contributions on the Bill in this House, to pose the question: do we in fact need a National Development Corporation? Is it a measure which is required and justified?  Is it to be welcomed as I have already indicated I welcome it?</P>
    <P>Even a superficial glance at our overall industrial performance over the last few years and our population structure to the end of this century &mdash; which is probably far enough for us to look &mdash; reveal that we have what I would describe as horrendous problems.  We have problems of a quite staggering nature and we do not seem to want to face up to them seriously and to realise what a responsibility this places on us.  If we look at our overall industrial performance in general terms we see, despite very considerable State incentives, State incentives of approximately £3 billion between 1970 and 1980 to the private sector, that employment in manufacturing industry is now slightly lower than it was in 1973, the early part of that period which I took.  Manufacturing industry has contributed only marginally to the creation of new sustainable employment in other sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>We have not seen an imaginative response from the private sector to the major social problem facing us, the problem of creating and sustaining lasting employment, notwithstanding very substantial incentives.  Possibly the greatest incentives were during that period in 1977 and that did not result in any dramatic <Col N="441" /> increase in employment in the private sector.  On the other side of the equational picture, we have to look at our overall population structure and in particular our current unemployment levels. We have to realise that the situation is not static.  It is one which is putting more and more pressure on the system, because we are going to see over the coming decade &mdash; each year estimates vary from between 20,000 and 30,000 new people looking for employment &mdash; a worsening of the already staggering unemployment figure of in or about 240,000.</P>
    <P>That figure has been mentioned by almost every Senator who has spoken in this debate and has been deplored. Words are easily come by.  I do not think we have in fact an appreciation of the seriousness of our overall unemployment problem and of the fact that it is no longer to anything like the same degree a youth unemployment bulge.  We still will have, and continue to have, a high percentage of young people who are unemployed; but the really serious bulge now and over the next ten years is going to be in the older group in their mid-to-late twenties, early thirties, mid-thirties.  These are the people, men and women who are going to be in very substantial numbers and who are already unemployed.</P>
    <P>How do you sustain family life in those circumstances in a country where we try to pay a lot of lip service to family values and family life?  How do you sustain it? How do the young couple with children engage in normal social relationships and social encounters?  The answer is that very many cannot.  There is private misery and within families a breakdown of marriage relationship purely because they cannot afford to sustain that relationship and are deprived of the kind of opportunities to participate which are vital to their own well-being and that of their families.</P>
    <P>We have an enormously difficult problem in this country and I find it very interesting that there still seems to be such unqualified faith in the possibility of enormous movement coming from private <Col N="442" /> enterprise.  I want to make it very clear that I am not an absolutist on either side.  I am not somebody who believes that we can only make progress by it all being done by the State or public investment.  Nor, as is obvious from my contribution, am I a believer that we must roll back the role of the State &mdash; is that not the language at the moment?  &mdash; and create the tax incentives to give the initiative to private industry.  It is patently clear that that has signally failed, that either course on its own is not suitable to our small, open, island economy, and that in fact we need an intelligent and imaginative combination of public and private and proper linkages between them.</P>
    <P>It is fascinating.  It is very interesting at the moment to see hundreds of people going to political venues in various towns and cities around Ireland.  Hundreds, in some cases thousands of people are going to political meetings and they are being told by the new party that is attracting them &mdash; The Progressive Democrats &mdash; that that party stands for a change in climate.  We would all like a change in climate, even a change in the real climate, but it is not exactly very specific.  What do you mean, a change in climate?  Or, more specific still, the Progressive Democrats stand for change of environment.  I would not mind a change of environment either.  The environment in this House at times is very oppressive.  The scaffolding is very unattractive.  These are wonderful, broad statements to make and they are drawing the crowds, as I say.  None of this is for real.  None of this in fact is going to bring about the magic formula the people so desperately hunger for.  I appreciate why they hunger for it and that their interest is both a genuine one and a very strong desire for change.  In fact, they are tilting at windmills.</P>
    <P>We have had the experience of very substantial inventives to private industry and they have singularly failed to change the so-called climate, to make a substantial dent on our unemployment figures and to provide the sustained, long term jobs that are vital.  We need to stop codding ourselves and to stop seeking to fool ourselves that this is the way in which we <Col N="443" /> can make progress.  Nor, I hasten to add &mdash; and it was even more clear in the course of my contribution, do I believe that simply establishing something called the National Development Corporation and drawing a line under it is going to achieve very much.  It very substantially depends on the day in which the objectives established under this Bill for the National Development Corporation are approached by the personnel.  It depends on the political commitment behind the establishment of the National Development Corporation, the link which it forms throughout the country and the manner in which it is able to achieve its tasks.</P>
    <P>I turn now to some of the potential areas where the National Development Corporation is being mandated to promote activity and enterprise and to do so in the context of creating and sustaining employment.  Like other Senators, I am pleased to see that certain areas are mentioned specifically in section 10, not only that the corporation can either establish or co-operate with or invest in enterprise, but also that it can similarly co-operate with and invest in co-operatives.  This is a very important dimension of the National Development Corporation which has not been sufficiently discussed or considered up to now.</P>
    <P>Secondly, like other Members of the House who have already contributed, I welcome the fact that specific reference is made in the Bill to the development of our natural resources and tourism. Again, these tend to be the hackneyed areas that are trotted out as having great potential for employment, and yet the fact remains that we have appalling underdevelopment of our natural resources and we are doing the wrong things about it in many areas, one of the areas being fisheries and our inland waterway system.  We are failing to develop that in a way which could provide us with a job creating and enormously important tourist potential, apart from being financially rewarding for people within the country. <Col N="444" /> Similarly our forestry and our sea fisheries areas are still seriously underdeveloped and have the potential for further development.</P>
    <P>I believe, although it is not in the same way specifically spelt out in section 10 in regard to the principal objects of the corporation, that we need to have much more regard to the potential of the export of services from this country.  We do export services in a number of areas &mdash; specialist agricultural areas, medical services to various countries, the service contracts now being won by bodies like the ESB and others.  An Foras Forbartha, etc.  That is a fast growing market in the world, and Ireland, particularly because of our links with developing countries, is a country which is potentially very acceptable to provide services of this kind in developing countries which would be of benefit to those who do the work, of benefit to the economy of the developing country and of enormous benefit to this country as a growth area.  I do not think we have explored the full potential of that to anything like the degree that we should, and it is an area which fits into our own structure of having, by and large, a well educated, mobile, talented young population who should be encouraged to develop fully and to find opportunities in the export of their services for a number of years in positions of responsibility where they can bring their expertise and skills to the service of less developed countries or indeed equally developed countries but ones which have the need for the particular services.  I would like to see much more done in that area.</P>
    <P>There are other areas it is not too difficult to find.  For example, the next item on the Order Paper is the Committee Stage of the Chester Beatty Library Bill. This is a Bill to which a number of us contributed on Second Stage.  Everyone who contributed and who knows the resources of the Chester Beatty Library spoke about the most fantastic but underdeveloped resources.  It is an unbelievable library and yet most of it is uncatalogued, unknown, the world does not know about it and we do not know about it. <Col N="445" /> There is a huge market for developing a resource like the Chester Beatty Library. There is an absolutely huge market for something like this, particularly because the art of every description is of the highest quality and is worldwide, of every culture and of every country which has a major cultural tradition.  That is just an example of how, with imagination, a body like the National Development Corporation could be used.  After all the Chester Beatty Library is in trust to this nation.  This nation is getting probably a 1 per cent benefit from the library and it is about time we brought that up to 60 per cent or 70 per cent.  If we did so we would do so with remarkable benefit to this generation of Irish people as well as to the library itself and to the world of culture and learning.  It is not difficult to find potential projects if we wish to do so.</P>
    <P>This Bill establishing a National Development Corporation on its own is not sufficient.  It is not a magic formula.  The Bill must coincide with an injection of a new sense of both urgency and community involvement in tackling our industrial strategy and our programme for creation of employment.  The Progressive Democrats, whom I have been criticising earlier and whom I continue to find very strong on climate but very short on the specifics, have stirred up a hunger and a yearning for the kind of overall strategy and coherence which people desire.  They are prepared to put up with hard times if they believe that this will lead to greater opportunities and a greater future for their children and for themselves in the longer term in this country.  I believe that has to be part of the National Development Corporation.  It must link in with generating a broader interest in the country for its potential.  Therefore, the personnel of the board is absolutely vital. Ireland is a small country and, therefore, whoever heads up something like the NDC in fact not only personifies it but will determine the extent to which it will have a capacity to inject the kind of momentum which I have been talking about.  When the chairman and directors are being appointed by the Minister this <Col N="446" /> should be important, possibly even more so when the chairman and directors come themselves to appoint the managing director.  She or he will have a very vital role and responsibility and I believe will have to make up for lost time, will have to, in fact, accelerate the speed and the manner in which the National Development Corporation get their act together to make up for the unacceptable amount of political delay in bringing forward the Bill and having it passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It will be vital to see, in the first instance, the quality of the personnel involved at the most senior level in the National Development Corporation and I would hope &mdash; though again there is no reference to this specifically in the Bill &mdash; that the opportunity would be used to generate a very broad debate throughout the country because it is certainly true that in every county in Ireland at various levels there is the most serious discussion going on at county level and urban level about these issues of potential industrial location, potential job creation, potential for developing some resource in that particular locality and in particular the size and the way of trying to make some impact on the local employment problem.  So I think it will be part of the function of the personnel of the NDC, when it is established, to get out and link with people, to promote the NDC through being close to people who are involved on the ground and linking in with their ideas and listening to them and generating in that way the kind of response from the ground up which would be the basis for expanding and developing the objects as set out in section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The over-riding consideration is that we do not have any time to lose. Although we all in our contributions referred to the level of unemployment and to the seriousness of it, none of us do it in the kind of language in which we really should where we appreciate and spell out the dangers to our entire democratic system if we continue to have the kind of polarised divide that we have at the moment in our society.  We have <Col N="447" /> become two nations.  The gap is widening between those two nations and I believe it is the most serious threat to the entire democratic and social fabric we have inherited and to which we pay a great deal of lip-service and that we claim to cherish.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset and I say this unequivocally, I welcome the National Development Corporation.  While involved with my colleagues in the Labour Party I worked for more than a year on an economic committee examining and indeed trying to advance the proposals and the kind of approach and work which a national development corporation could do.  I have to express some of my frustration and disillusionment that it has taken so long to get this major piece of economic strategy into this House.  It is still not passed as a Bill.  The situation in the meantime has become more urgent and more demanding.  I hope this Bill will get a full debate in this House but also a speedy passage so that the corporation can be established and get under way and imitiate the kind of linkages I have been talking about in order to begin the process of genuinely raising the hopes of those people who are looking for this magical change of climate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always in a dilemma when speaking after Senator Mary Robinson because she leaves very little to be said.  I will endeavour to fill in any gaps that I thought she left.  She has said much of what I intended to say.  I want to congratulate the Government on this progressive piece of legislation. Having said that, I am not impressed by the delay.  This should have been number one priority for such a Coalition because there is a Labour input.  I will deal with the question of compromise.  It is not compromise, as I would understand it, between Fine Gael, on the right, and the Labour Party, slightly on the left.  Delay in this country seems to be inevitable.  In 1947 I proposed an economic council for Northern Ireland and an economic council for the Republic, with a liaison body. That was at the ITUC, as it was then, in <Col N="448" /> Waterford.  The two economic councils were set up in 1964.  That is how long I had to wait.</P>
      <P>I stand here with a certain amount of pride looking at this piece of legislation. Inside the executive of Congress for many years we discussed a national corporation to do exactly what is spelt out in the Bill.  In 1972-73 I presided over conferences and made my own contribution. I stand with pride looking at the results but they were not fast enough. Like Senator Robinson, I do not believe we will see any results in the lifetime of this Parliament.  We may see results between two and five years.  It will be a long haul and we should not be disappointed at having to wait.  The ingredients are there.  I have congratulated the Government.  I want to congratulate all the political parties since the State was founded and the men and women who had the vision to use the State apparatus and mechanism when the economic demand indicated what had to be done. The State apparatus was moved by men and women through all the political parties and we are a very young State. They saw what was required, they did it and had no ideological hangups about State enterprise or about private enterprise. Private enterprise is a funny animal today.  It gets so much State money that sometimes they do not know where the cheques are coming from or what they are for.  It is not private enterprise as we understood it.  When people get into arguments about private enterprise on the one side and the public sector on the other, they would be as well to identify what they are talking about.  Private enterprise is State subsidised to the very hilt.  The private sector has failed to broaden the base notwithstanding massive financial support and other kinds of support.  One of the reasons we have an Irish Productivity Centre is to teach them how to reduce unit costs by the use of work study and all the other various studies that are aimed at the reduction of unit costs.  That is imperative in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of the NDC was inevitable. Given the economic circumstances in the Irish Republic and the waste of <Col N="449" /> the potential contribution to the national economy and the well-being of the country, an unemployment figure of 240,000 is unacceptable, so the Government have moved.  It is an indictment of our managerial society.  Politicians are managers. It is an indictment of the politicians' failure. Financial handouts in the form of dole payments are no alternative to gainful employment.  The right to work is a human right.  There will be people who will argue that it is not and that society owes nothing to anybody.  I do not accept that.  Strangely enough if you examine the United Nations Covenant of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights and you will not find among all the rights the right to work. The reason I believe that they cannot enshrine it in these convenants and charters is that they have accepted their inability in western civilisation to implement the radical changes necessary, to give the right to work.  I believe it is a human right and as long as it is denied that is an indictment in itself.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore right and proper to approve of the measures proposed in the Bill aimed at the stimulation of job creation and the output of goods and services. This would be good for the economy. Even a child at school would know that. We live in a consumer orientated society and the demand has to be stimulated all the time for the goods and services that you create through job creation.  This is the cycle.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be seen as one of the most significant radical movements in the history of State involvement in the economic affairs of the Irish Republic.  It is a progressive piece of legislation, and the object is to create jobs and wealth. You can create jobs but you may not be able to distribute wealth on an equitable basis.  You can create too much wealth by too many people employed at doing one thing.  That is happening in Europe. The capitalistic intervention system is trying to control that.  You produce too little of something else and have so many people on the dole as well.  These are contradictions which, if not attended to <Col N="450" /> will lead to conflict.</P>
    <P>The new progressive movement and the euphoria about it is symptomatic of disillusionment only; it is not positive.  It is a barometer of disillusionment.  The traditional political parties should pay attention to what is taking place.  You will find that this splinter of a right wing party is still a right wing party so there is no change and there is no breaking of a mould, not in that sense.  They will find the same problems and difficulties if they take office or become part of a coalition as the Fine Gael and Labour coalition found and as Fianna Fáil find from time to time.  There is no miracle cure about unemployment unless radical changes and measures are introduced by the Government in power.  I hear people say: &ldquo;You will never see full employment again.&rdquo;  I always say that should be amended to read: &ldquo;You will never see full employment as long as we run society the way we run it&rdquo;.  That is different. There is a change in that; but everybody knows what it means because the words are simple.</P>
    <P>It should be understood that the State, which is the forum at the top of the political structure, is the servant of the people. The obligation is squarely on the State managers to deliver according to the needs and the wants of the citizens.  That is why they put themselves forward seeking mandates on various social, economic and political matters and they were elected to debate them in both Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>We are faced with a tremendous challenge to cure the cancer of unemployment &mdash; a cancer it is.  The Government have acted, albeit slowly, in a positive and intelligent manner.  It reflects the thinking of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and all its deliberations for some years back.  This is what we wanted.  Now that we have it, we congratulate the people who did it.  We believe it will work.  It has to work.  Otherwise there will be an explosion which can destroy democratic institutions and standards.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in the Bill is not a compromise.  The connotation of a compromise is a weakening of stronglyheld <Col N="451" /> views on one side or another, a watering down in the interests of peace or agreement.  This is not a compromise. There is no watering down.  A compromise is an agreed version for peace.  The substance of the Bill is a fusion of two strong influences &mdash; the private and the public sectors.  The entrepreneur who has all kinds of skills will be brought into play alongside the initiative taken by the Government to fund, to assist, to manage and to overlook.  Ministerial power is limited. Control between the Minister and the Government is there of necessity.  It is an overlooking body.  This is a simple Bill, as Senator Robinson has stated.  The two influences are fused, not in a compromising way, but in strength to produce the vital components that will bring us nearer the object of full employment. The full resources of the State &mdash; £300 million &mdash; are to be granted in the form of finance, managerial know-how, research and development.  Research and development possibly would be outside the abilities of the smaller business types.  Only the multinationals could provide this.  It is only right that we should do this research and development ourselves with our own indigenous materials, which is not to say that we cannot import materials if a person sees that by importing materials he can provide viable employment with his brain power, together with State assistance.  Then you have State assistance on the one side and private entrepreneurship on the other.  It is a fusion, not a compromise.</P>
    <P>There will be arguments, disagreements, discussions and debate about details of the National Development Corporation. This is rightly so.  There is nothing wrong with this as the Bill goes through both Houses and is debated publicly as well.  What is not debatable is the fact that the Government should have moved in this regard.  They should have moved.  No one can cay that the Government should not have moved.  Any Government, of whatever composition, would have had to so move, given the same economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>From the beginning of the State &mdash; not <Col N="452" /> so long ago in historical terms &mdash; the Irish people have lifted themselves up by their boot-straps by doing what they saw to be necessary for economic progress.  They had no ideological hang-ups about private or public sectors.  We had a narrow industrial base, which was broadened in the sixties.  It is neither broad enough nor deep enough.  Our mainly agricultural economy was widened by resourceful and thoughtful people who did not have the hang-ups I am talking about on what is commonly described as State intervention.</P>
    <P>I do not like the word &ldquo;intervention&rdquo;. I prefer to use State &ldquo;activation&rdquo; or &ldquo;participation&rdquo;. &ldquo;Intervention&rdquo; is like a referee who is not liked very much but it is necessary for him to come in.  This is the language of the free marketeer who does not like State enterprise.  He calls it &ldquo;intervention&rdquo;; I call it &ldquo;participation&rdquo; or &ldquo;activation&rdquo; by the State.  These are healthier words.  This is State participation, not intervention.  When economic necessity demanded an application of our resources &mdash; financial, manpower and indigenous material wealth in forestry, fishing, food and tourism &mdash; the Irish people acted.  Again, through the medium of the Government, they are acting.</P>
    <P>It is of paramount importance to recognise what is involved in the Bill.  The ideas of conflict between those who believe that the market economy provides the only and complete answer to our economic problems and the rigid and inflexible attitude of those who hold the view that total State involvement is the only answer is outdated.  I have explained the fusion of State enterprise and the private entrepreneural abilities which the people have.  They know when to use both and merge them into one strong influence, as they have done in the National Development Corporation Bill. The economy clearly demonstrates that what I have stated is true.  We have a mixed economy in the way I have described. A total State monopoly is out of date; it is old hat socialism.  Private enterprise, we know, has changed also, as I have stated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> The National Development Corporation is a further step in a synthesized process.  We are looking at a synthesis between public sector, represented by State activation or participation, and private enterprise, which has changed somewhat, into one format: we call it the NDC.  These ideological arguments and hang-ups are about nothing and they will have to be dismissed.  We have to go forward and do what is necessary, as the people have demonstrated to us in the last 60 years since the State was set up.</P>
    <P>The man or woman, the boy or girl, who is unemployed could not care less whether is it a private enterprise which is employing him or a public State body. They want work and are not impressed by any of the arguments I have been advising should be dismissed.  It would be foolish to dismiss entrepreneurial ability and the innovative skills of the people and it would be equally foolish to dismiss State activation &mdash; some call it intervention &mdash; and I have explained what that means.  I call it State activation and participation. It is positive, not negative. Dogmatic approaches to the unemployment problem are profoundly inappropriate. The well-informed unemployed will not thank those who deviate from the proposals in the Bill.  They will monitor what is going to happen in the next ten or 20 years, because with technological development the situation could get worse.  Senator Robinson has stated this. The National Development Corporation can handle situations which might get worse with the changes in technological applications to our industrial fields.</P>

      <P>When we adjourned this motion on the 18 December last, I was in the process of outlining the view of the Labour Party to the then ongoing situation regarding the teachers' arbitration award.  It is fair to say that much has happened since then.  I will take the opportunity now of updating the record of this House on the Labour Party's role to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had indicated to the House that an initial meeting took place between representatives of the Parliamentary Labour Party and the teacher's union last November.  That meeting was most productive and informative for both parties concerned.  We certainly learned with great interest the detailed position of the teacher unions.  I felt that we imparted to them the historic stand of the Labour Party on this issue, and issues like the one that we now face.  Those of us who were on the delegation reported back to the full Parliamentary Labour Party subsequently and sought the assistance of the parliamentary party and the four <Col N="455" /> Labour Ministers in Cabinet to have the Government position moved on.  We remind ourselves that the Government position at that time was a nothing on offer position.  The situation was that the Government felt that it was impossible to pay the 10 per cent award simply because the State coffers could not afford it.  It is fair to say that that position has altered dramatically.  Clearly, the Government have moved significantly from that initial hardline stand.  After an exhaustive reappraisal, the Minister for Education, the Minister for the Public Service and the Cabinet collectively offered to phase-in the 10 per cent award over a period of time.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Labour Party again met the teacher unions on Thursday, 30 January.  We had a long and detailed discussion that lasted most of a morning. It was our earnest wish to bridge the gap that still existed at that stage between Government and teachers and to arrive at a situation whereby there would be no disruption of our education system, of our classrooms, of our exams and everything that seemed to be looming up on the horizon at that stage.  Twice during that morning meeting the teachers' side requested an adjournment so that they could discuss among themselves their position, think about the information we placed before them and come back to us.  Twice the Labour Party delegation withdrew and returned after some time. It was the wish of the Labour Party that these negotiations would result in some middle ground position being arrived at whereby negotiations, between the teachers' union and the Department, then broken off, would be unconditionally reconvened.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the teachers could not see their way to embarking on further discussions unless the old issue of retrospection was conceded in advance.  We tried various packages to see if a neutral position could be arrived at which would encompass the principal wishes of the teachers and address the real financial situation of the country.  At the end of that meeting we had reached the crux of <Col N="456" /> the present issue, the teachers genuinely believing that the total amount awarded by the arbitrator must be paid, though in fairness the payment dates were negotiable. The final Government position was, having searched with positive goodwill for an equitable settlement, that there was an offer on the table at that stage which was the absolute limit which the country's finances could endure.  This impasse, therefore, led eventually to last week's vote in the other House and, may I say, to the total frustration of the Labour Party, caught between two conflicting and valid positions.  The vote of the Dáil is a matter of public record.  I wish, however, to state that exhaustive efforts were made by my party prior to that vote to work out a position which would accommodate the principal demands of the teachers within the financial realities faced by the Government. We must all now look to what can be done from here on.  Feelings are running high.  Many unfortunate things have been said and written with communications flying left and right between Members of these Houses, between the Government, and in the media.</P>
    <P>In the end this dispute will be solved by discussions, whether they take place next week, next year or whenever.  The situation is more difficult now that Dáil Éireann has taken a view.  I would earnestly have wished that an agreement, acceptable to both sides, had been arrived at in advance of last week's deadline. That, alas, was not to be.  I hope that we will not now be faced with the chaos that seems to be looming, disruption of classes, disruption of examinations, the mere thought of which has caused great anxiety among the pupils and most specially among those young people facing this years intermediate certificate, group certificate and leaving certificate examinations on which their futures depend. It is poor comfort to those students to state that the Minister for Education is to blame, or that the Minister for the Public Service is to blame, or the Government collectively are to blame, or that Fine Gael or the Labour Party are to blame.  The students want their chances. <Col N="457" /> They have a right to expect that their chances will be afforded to them.</P>
    <P>In that context I fully accept the motion before the House.  It is not too late for discussions to take place.  I renew my call for both the teachers' unions and the Minister to try again, to abandon any absolutist positions, to seek common ground and to reopen talks without preconditions. Let us not erect barriers before we get to the table.  Let us begin again in the interest of everybody to solve this dispute.  In the end this dispute will be resolved.  Nobody in this House or the other House would wish it to be prolonged. I hope discussions will begin in the immediate future which will create some sort of common ground.</P>
    <P>When I met the teacher negotiators two weeks ago I believed that there was goodwill on both sides.  I believe that that goodwill still exists.  I believed two weeks ago both sides were not far apart and, despite all that has been said, that the two positions are not fundamentally far apart and can be accommodated.  I still believe that.  The reality is that as the dispute escalates and involves more and more teachers, more and more parents and more and more pupils, so too will the bitterness escalate.  We have missed the first opportunity but it is still not too late.  No serious disruptions have taken place.  The position taken up by both sides, while firm, is not concreted in. There is still a possibility.  Please try again.</P>

      <P>In moving this motion Senator Mullooly quoted extensively from Labour Party policy documents on my party's support for free collective bargaining and free negotiating.  Yes, that is my party's policy.  We have in government, through the years, been responsible for enacting most of the legislation which today protects workers' rights and conditions.  I say that with pride and with conviction.  The record is there for anybody to check.  This dispute, therefore, is particularly difficult for my party.  That <Col N="458" /> difficulty no doubt gives comfort and succour to those who are unencumbered by such things as firm historic policies or principles.  Our role in this dispute has been an honourable one.  Our discussion last week was a heart-breakingly difficult one, whether that is accepted by all here or not.  Our motivation has been, and is, the national interest, the national good. Our numerical strength in these Houses may be explained by the fact that this has always been our bottom line.  For good or ill, popular or not, we made a collective decision on the basis of all the facts before us.  Our actions, may or may not endear us to the voters, but they are made with a clear conscience and with a clear view of where we, as a party, stand.  I support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to know what to say in three minutes.  I would like to pay tribute to the 40,000 teachers who are working with one million of our young citizens, forming their minds, moulding their characters, preparing them to take their place in Irish society.  We do not give teachers enough credit for the work they do in large classrooms with meagre resources.  Money alone cannot buy the dedication, patience and energy needed for this work.</P>
      <P>As a parent with five school-going children, I am very concerned about the strikes which will inevitably take place. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the teachers for the work they have done. Much of that work was unpaid.  This relationship now will be destroyed by these forthcoming strikes.  This is a tragedy.  The children will be frustrated, particularly pupils facing examinations this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Minister said that she wanted her proposals to be put before the teachers' union members, rather than the proposal for strike action.  I would not accept that the teachers are not intelligent <Col N="459" /> enough to know what they are voting on.  They are really voting on this question of salary.  When I was engaged in the Office of Public Works on a number of occasions when we had conciliation with regard to pay claims we had arbitration as well.  I never knew of a situation where the Government reneged on their commitments in this area or where the grounds were shifted afterwards.  It is very unfortunate.  No matter what way the present proposals by the Minister are presented, it simply means that the arbitration award is not being honoured. What is the use of promises of pay increases in the future to the people who are coming out of college?  As the previous speaker said, the problem will be resolved but many people genuinely fear that relationships between the teachers and the community will be broken.  This community owes almost everything to the teachers.  Society is really built on the work that the teachers have done.</P>

      <P>In deference to the wishes of the Leader of the House, Senator Dooge, and in deference to the wishes of the Minister for Education, we on this side of the House agreed to the suggestion that only one hour of the one-and-a-half hours remaining on this motion would be taken on 18 December.  In her contribution to the debate on that day, the Minister for Education stated at column 1043, Volume 110, of the Official Report of Seanad Éireann, 18 December 1985:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge on all concerned that the most important requirement at this point in time is that everything possible should be done to facilitate a resolution of the current dispute with the teachers' unions.  This applies to the Government and to myself as Minister for Education.  It applies also to this assembly and I believe that the views <Col N="460" /> I have expressed accord with the feeling on both sides of the House.  It applies to the teachers unions and to the teachers.  It applies to everyone with the interest of education at heart. I, and the Government, are firmly dedicated to the resolution of the dispute.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the least said about the situation at this time the better.</P>
    <P>We acceded to the wishes of the Minister in the hope and in the belief that she would enter into meaningful talks with the teachers' unions and that a settlement of the dispute would be achieved.  If that had happened, this motion would no longer have been relevant but that did not happen.  The sad fact of the matter is that the Minister did not make any real effort to reach a settlement with the teachers.  Last week when we asked that this motion be taken we were met with all kinds of fabricated excuses.  The real reason, of course, was that the Acting Leader of the House did not order this motion because he did not want it to be seen that the Labour Party had not the courage to defy the Fine Gael Whip and that they had earlier that day taken a decision to renege on their oft stated commitment to the principle of free collective bargaining.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business today, we on this side of the House were prepared to waive our right to the time remaining for discussion on this motion, provided that the Government side were agreeable to allow a one and a half hour debate on the closure of St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, and St. Dympna's Hospital, Carlow.  We took this decision because of the fact that the Government's position in relation to the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for teachers is now very clear after last week's vote in the other House.  The Government, by their actions last week, showed their contempt for teachers and for the teachers' conciliation and arbitration machinery.</P>

      <P>The Government have also shown that they are not interested in entering into meaningful discussions with the teachers' unions at this time.  During the debate on the Order of Business this morning, there were several references to hypocrisy.  I hope during the course of my reply to this debate on this motion to refer to some of the real hypocrisy which manifested itself during the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>More than two months have elapsed since the debate on this motion began.  I would like to remind Members of the terms of the motion, which reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government (a) to re-assert their commitment to the agreed procedures of Conciliation and Arbitration for teachers and (b) to enter into immediate discussions with the three teacher unions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The motion was submitted at a time when the dispute had already begun to escalate. What it sought was straightforward, clear and precise.  It did not seek to tie the Minister's hands.  It did not lay down any pre-conditions in relation to the talks or the discussions which it called for.  It was worded in such a way that all Members of this House would have no difficulty in supporting it.</P>
      <P>In proposing the motion I outlined the reasons for the series of one-day strikes which had closed down schools throughout the country during the months of October and November.  I gave a resume of how well the system of conciliation and arbitration had worked since its inauguration 35 years ago in February 1951.  I stated that I believed that the reason it had worked so well was that for all those 35 years the arbitrators' findings had been regarded as binding on all sides.  I appealed to the Minister and to the Government not to undermine procedures which had been so carefully built up over the years and which had withstood the test of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reminded the Government of their <Col N="462" /> obligations to pupils, parents and teachers, and particularly of their obligation to bring about a restoration of peace and normality in our schools.  I pointed out that if the Government had any interest in avoiding industrial strife in the months and years ahead they should not lightly cast aside the conciliation and arbitration system which had contributed so much to good industrial relations over such a long period.  I appealed to the Minister and to the Government to consider both the likely short term and the likely long term consequences of a decision not to honour the arbitrator's award.  I was supported by a number of other speakers.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to thank all the Senators who contributed.  It is very interesting, in the light of last week's events, to look back at some of the contributions which were made during the course of the debate.  Senator Ferris in his contribution at column 853, Volume 110, of the Official Report of Seanad Éireann for 11 December 1985 stated:</P>
    <P>It is imperative that everybody should know where the Labour Party stand in this particular issue.  We will fight for the principles of conciliation and arbitration.  We will also fight for the principle that the findings are final and should be accepted by both sides.</P>
    <P>Senator Howlin in his contribution at column 1057 of the Official Report of Seanad Éireann for 18 December 1985 stated:</P>
    <P>The use of conciliation and arbitration machinery for the processing of claims has always been supported by my party.  The present claim has gone through those established machineries. Therefore, as I have stated in public statements previously, the integrity of the arbitrator's award must be accepted by us.  To do anything else would be to devalue and, indeed, seriously damage the mechanism that was so carefully built up over the years and that has been in this case rigidly adhered to.</P>
    <P>I, too, would have a heavy heart if, like Senator Ferris and Senator Howlin, I, <Col N="463" /> having put such statements on the record of this House, had subsequently to bow to a Fine Gael Party decision which repudiated them completely.  I cannot understand the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the Labour Party because everything that the Labour Party ever stood for was at stake last week.  The eyes of the whole trade union movement were on the Labour Party last week.  The eyes of 40,000 teachers or 40,000 trade union members and their 40,000 colleagues in the trade union movement were on the Labour Party.  I could not help thinking last week of a most illustrious former leader of the Labour Party, the late Dr. T.J. O'Connell. He was general secretary of the INTO from 1916 to 1948.  He represented the Labour Party in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>It was with the help of the Labour Party that the Government motion was carried in the other House last Thursday.  I believe that time will prove that Government victory to be a Pyrrhic victory.  I believe that history will show that victory to be the victory on which this Government and Labour Party will have perished.  As a result of last week's Dáil vote, and knowing the mood of the teachers, I believe that this country is heading for a long and bitter dispute. The longer it drags on the more difficult <Col N="464" /> it will be to resolve and the deeper will be the legacy of bitterness which the dispute will leave in its wake.</P>
      <P>At their special conference at the weekend the three teachers' unions gave an overwhelming mandate to their executive to put preparations in train for a campaign of industrial action.  Over the next two weeks strike ballots will be held throughout the country and I have no doubt in my mind as to what the result of those ballots will be.  I have never known teachers to be as angry as they are at present because they see themselves having been forced into a position by the Government where they have no option other than to take strike action</P>
      <P>As far as the teachers are concerned, there are two simple, straightforward issues involved in this dispute.  I went into considerable detail in relation to both issues when I was proposing this motion and I do not intend to do so again today. The facts are simply as follows.  The teachers' unions lodged a claim for a salary increase in 1982.  This claim was processed through conciliation and arbitration over a period of three years. At the end of the day the arbitrator recommended a 10 per cent increase in two phases &mdash; 5 per cent from the 1 September 1985 and the remaining 5 per cent from the 1 March 1986.  The teachers' first demand is that the arbitrator's award be implemented in full.  This the Government are so far not prepared to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue concerns the system of conciliation and arbitration.  The teachers have had this system for the past 35 years.  It has worked well.  But it can only work if, first of all, there is a chairman of the arbitration board and, secondly, if his recommendations are considered to be binding on all parties. As matters stand at the moment there is no chairman of the arbitration board because of the Government's refusal to reappoint the public service arbitrator and, secondly, confidence in the system has been totally undermined by the Government's decision not to honour the <Col N="465" /> teachers' arbitration award.  The teachers' second demand is for the preservation of their conciliation and arbitration machinery.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to two of the more serious misrepresentations in relation to this dispute which have surfaced in recent days.  There have been references in the media and elsewhere to the Government's decision to phase in the teachers' arbitration award over three years.  This is a blatant misrepresentation of the true situation.  The facts are that the Government have rejected the teachers' arbitration award and, instead of the award recommended by the arbitrator, the Government proposed to grant an increase to teachers of 3? per cent in December, 1986 and a further 3? per cent in December 1987 and a further 3? per cent 1988.  If there was a proposal by the Government to phase in the arbitration award over three years, I am sure that such a proposal would find favour with a great many teachers and would certainly be a proposal which the teachers' unions would wish to discuss with the Government. At this stage there is no such proposals. What the Government are proposing is something very different indeed, to the phasing in of the arbitration award.</P>
    <P>This evening the Members of this House must take a decision on whether to support or oppose this motion, because I would submit that the amendment tabled by the Government side is no longer relevant.  To vote for the amendment would be vote for a nonsense.  This House can by supporting this motion indicate to the Government that even at this stage the threatened strikes can be averted.  The Government may not listen to our call but the Members of this House by supporting this motion will have discharged or will have attempted to discharge their responsibility to the pupils, the parents and the teachers.  To oppose this motion is to vote for chaos in our education system and to vote for industrial chaos in the years ahead.  I would urge all Senators to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

      <P>Just to put the record <Col N="466" /> straight on behalf of the Government side of the House, I am asking the permission of the House to withdraw the amendment. As has been said, it is now irrelevant. As far as we are concerned, we would welcome a situation where the teachers and their representatives would have discussions with the Minister and I think that is the spirit of the motion that has been put now.  I have no problem with it and I recommend the support of the House for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of Report No. 77 of the National Economic and Social Council entitled &ldquo;The Criminal Justice System: Policy and Performance.</P>
      <P>I would at the outset like to pay tribute to the NESC for producing almost 9 Reports on very important economic and social matters over the past 12 or 13 years.  I think their continuing work is something which we in public life all too infrequently pay tribute to.</P>
      <P>I should also like to welcome the fact that the NESC have commissioned and produced this report on the criminal justice system with particular emphasis on the policy underlying that system and the performance of that system to date. It is extremely important the the criminal justice system of any country should be under constant scrutiny and the fact that it has been examined from a performance point of view is, I think, a very very good thing.  The fact that there are difficulties inherent in effecting that examination are highlighted in this report and I think that the difficulty is, perhaps, one of the reasons why the report has made difficult reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I pay tribute to the NESC for commissioning this report, it is only fair to be critical of the manner in which the <Col N="467" /> report is written and, indeed, the manner in which the report is put together.  The report identifies certain central problems in the criminal justice system but in the presentation of those problems they have not been presented in any uniform or coherent way.  Therefore, one of the problems that one has in reading this report or in addressing oneself to this report is the fact that many issues which are central to the problem we are talking about are raised continuously within the report but are not addressed specifically in a coherent way or in a way which allows in-depth examination.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that one of the problems we have in this country with our criminal justice system is the fact that it is built upon centuries of law and tradition and of social understanding of what is criminally acceptable and unacceptable and built, above all, upon the way in which society should deal with criminal matters.  The fact that we have experienced such amazing social change in Ireland in the past 25 years is something which few will dispute. At the same time, I think it is regrettable that our criminal justice system has not updated itself and has not geared itself to deal with the problems of the latter part of the 20th century.  The fact that we have a system in operation which from a legal point of view is based by and large on the common law and on statute law, which are certainly pre-20th century creates, difficulties.  The fact that in the administration of that system our criminal courts still operate within the framework of the Courts Act, 1924, is also something which must be regretted bearing in mind the changes which have taken place in criminal procedure in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales.  Above all, the unsatisfactory situation exists in regard to the very central role of the Garda Síochána within the criminal justice system.  The fact that we as a State and a society have not addressed ourselves to the resolution of these problems and to attempting to update the roles of the various pieces that form the whole of the criminal justice system is something that must be regretted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> Certainly, changes have taken place in the past few years and certainly the present Minister for Justice indicated his determination to see that there are changes to make the criminal justice system both in its administration and in terms of the <i>corpus</i> of law existing and in terms of the prosecution of the system. The fact that the Minister has a commitment to these changes is welcome but the fact that so little has happened is on, the other hand, to be regretted.</P>
    <P>We are also faced with the fact that our system derives from a society that was basically authorative, a society with a pyramidal social system, a society which defined roles for people.  The system we have inherited was based upon that type of society.  The fact that we now experience a more democratic type of society with a less pyramidal class structure and with a more fluid sense of attitudes, the fact that we do not have a criminal justice system to fit in with that type of society is something that must be regretted.  We have, on the one hand, the question of maintaining the rule of law and maintaining law and order and we have, on the other hand, the question of ensuring that the right of the individual is protected. To get that balance right can, indeed, be very difficult.  The fact that we have experienced the kind of change I am talking about can be identified if one refers to the fact that the last hanging in Ireland took place 30 years ago and that was punishment for a crime, punishment on conviction for a crime.  As recently as 1964, a mere 20 years ago, we still found it socially acceptable and, indeed, legislated for the death penalty in respect of certain types of crimes in the Criminal Justice Act, 1964.</P>
    <P>The fact that our attitudes to the penalty for particular types of crimes have changed so greatly in 20 years is illustrated by the fact that we have on the Order Paper of the Seanad today a Bill entitled the Criminal Justice (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill, 1984, and the fact, of course, that there is a commitment and a determination by the Government to ensure that the death penalty is abolished. I use the word &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; because <Col N="469" /> we must ask ourselves if the criminal justice system is meant to be a penal system.  Is it meant to be a system which simply punishes somebody who is in breach of the criminal code; or, on the other hand, should it be a system which operates in a preventative sense and should it be a system which operates in a rehabilitative sense?  Should our criminal justice system see itself as having a role in preventing crime?  Should it see itself as having a role in rehabilitating people as distinct from punishing people who have been in breach of the criminal justice system?  I would say, as somebody who has experience of the law operating within the system, that certainly there is a very definite and welcome movement towards the latter concept: that the criminal justice system and the courts in particular, and indeed, the Garda to a lesser extent, should play their role to ensure that the system is a rehabilitative and preventative system.  That would make the system relevant to our economy, because every crime that is committed is not merely a crime against an individual, it is not merely a breach of criminal law, but it is an act which damages the whole fabric of our society in a social sense and in an economic sense.  For that reason we have to ensure that the criminal justice system operates to prevent the commission of crimes and to help those who have found themselves in a situation where crime was being committed.</P>
    <P>One of the central problems identified in this report is that we have so little information available on how the system works.  That is one of the most unfortunate findings of this report.  In so far as the report addresses itself to the operation of the Garda and in so far as the report addresses itself to the operation of the courts, the point comes across very clearly that there are absolutely inadequate statistics available to gauge the performance of the Garda, in terms of investigating crime, in terms of ensuring that the criminals are brought before the courts and, above all, in ensuring that, following the courts' dealing with criminals, <Col N="470" /> satisfactory steps are taken in relation to those criminals.</P>
    <P>The same point comes out in relation to the court system.  There is a completely inadequate back up there to provide the essential statistics.  Of course, if that type of data is not available it is extremely difficult for the Government of the day to ensure that the necessary steps can be taken to make the criminal justice system more beneficial to our society.  I would urge upon the Minister of State tonight firstly to ensure that her Department take steps to see that the statistics of crime which are published by the Garda Commissioner are made relevant and, secondly, that the statistics which emerge in relation to the dealing of criminal matters by our criminal courts are also made more relevant.</P>
    <P>One of the more interesting aspects of this report is appendix 2, which is The Galway District Court study carried out by Professor Kevin Boyle into criminal matters that came before the District Court in Galway between 1978 and 1981. The interesting fact that comes out in the overall report is that the Galway survey is, perhaps, the only survey of its kind existing, the only in-depth survey of people who came before the criminal system, in-depth examination of the types of crimes with which they were charged and an in-depth examination of how the District Court which, of course, is the most important criminal court of all, disposed of those matters.  The fact that that is the only in-depth examination and the fact that the extant court records and current court records do not make available that kind of information is extremely unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Chapter 5 of the report, which is the most important and most helpful chapter of the report. This is the chapter entitled &ldquo;The Performance of the Irish Criminal Justice System: the Garda Síochána and the Courts&rdquo; and, in referring to the chapter, I should like to deal with the Garda Síochána first and the courts secondly.  Let me quote from page 122 of chapter 5:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> There is a substantial gap in Ireland between objectives, as given in Chapter 3, and what we can in fact measure. In particular, we lack information on the decisions made within the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>That, again, confirms the point I made about statistics and about the difficulty in assessing what our criminal justice system is doing for us.  I should like to quote from chapter 3 entitled, &ldquo;Evaluating Criminal Justice Policy and Performance&rdquo;.  On page 73 are set out seven objectives of clear relevance to social policy which should be part of the process of assessment. These are as follows.  The first is:</P>
    <P>... the full utilisation by the courts of the range of options for case disposition, linked to the range of offences so that the minimum stigma and punishment is imposed as is necessary in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that the minimum stigma in punishment be imposed. It is also important that the full range of options be availed of.  It is also important that we have some idea of what options were availed of and of what success or failure was achieved in the use of any particular option.  That is where the system at the moment falls down, in so far as we have an ability to evaluate the end result.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the avoidance of unnecessary delay in case proceedings.  This, of course, is a desirable objective.  I am glad to say that it is certainly one which appears to be increasingly achieved. Increasingly our civil courts and criminal courts are getting through their workloads more speedily; and I welcome the steps taken by the Minister for Justice in the recent Courts Bill to appoint additional judges, particularly to the Circuit Court, to ensure the more speedy dispatch of criminal business in Cork and elsewhere.  It is extremely important that criminal matters be dealt with speedily because once a person is suspected of a crime, once a charge is preferred, then a question mark hangs over that person until the matter is finally disposed of.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> Thirdly, &ldquo;The courts should make full use of the advice available from Probation Officers and other professional groups who are able to provide the Judiciary with evaluations prior to sentencing&rdquo;. I agree with that.  It is important in criminal matters that the court and judges should take full cognisance of whatever professional information is available in so far as that information can help the accused person without in any way damaging society as a whole whom the criminal justice system is there to protect. It is extremely important in so far as probation officers can help people who come before the court that the Judiciary take cognisance of what they have to say.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, &ldquo;consistency in sentencing&rdquo;. This is an issue which has given rise to much thought.  It is an issue that has given rise to an amount of discussion in recent years following a number of contentious cases where, in apparently similar circumstances, differing sentences were imposed by judges in the same level of court.  Obviously, there is a desire that there should be consistency in sentencing. The legislative obligation that is imposed on the President of the District Court to ensure that his justices meet at least annually to discuss matters such as this should also be imposed on the President of the Circuit Court and on the President of the High Court to ensure that the members of their respective benches also meet for that purpose within the criminal sphere.  Having said that, I have to accept that the Judiciary do meet on an increasingly regular basis, but there should be a statutory obligation to do so, particularly in so far as criminal matters are concerned.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, &ldquo;The courts of law should convey by their physical appearance and the manner in which they conduct their proceedings, the seriousness, dignity and openness of their work.  Conveying such an atmosphere is one objective of the criminal courts&rdquo;.  In so far as that objective is stated in the NESD report, it is certainly one where we have dismally failed.  The demeanour, the physical appearance, the atmosphere existing within most of our court buildings are <Col N="473" /> absolutely appalling.  There is no dignity whatsoever attached to the administration of justice in this country.  There is no solace or comfort available to those who come before the courts.  The courts physically operate in the most appalling surroundings. It is no answer for any Minister to say that the obligation lies with local authorities to ensure that their courthouses are kept in a proper condition. That should not be the duty of local authorities.  The Government should make substantial funds available for the purpose of putting our courthouses into proper repair and condition.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister of State has made a special commitment to the whole area of family law.  If the Minister of State realised the courts' physical conditions within which family law matters are dispatched, she would agree with the points I am making in relation to the criminal courts also.</P>
    <P>The sixth objective is &ldquo;That all persons involved in a court proceeding should be able to hear what is being said and to understand the terminology and procedures&rdquo;. It is important that the criminal courts operate in a way that is meaningful and understandable to John Citizen and that does not happen at the moment. The structure, the physical layout of our courtrooms, the way in which people are accommodated within courtrooms make it difficult for them to hear what is happening in most courtrooms but, secondly, the language, the terminology, the procedures make the entire thing extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>The final point that is made in Chapter 3 is one of the objectives relevant to social policy, that is, &ldquo;The importance of access to legal assistance attuned to the needs of all groups&rdquo;.  There is a system of legal aid available in Ireland, it operates reasonably satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I should like to return to chapter 5 of the report, the question of the performance of the Garda and of the courts.  Page 123 deals with the whole accountability of the system.  It states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> ...There is an abundance of statistical tabulations, produced annually, but the information provided fails to meet the three essential criteria for information on criminal justice: (1) that it provides the public with an accurate indication of the problem and of what is being done about it, (2) that it allows for accountability and evaluation of what the police, courts, prison service, and Department of Justice have done, and, (3) that it allows for rational planning.</P>
    <P>Let us deal with the first point which is to provide the public with an accurate indication of the problem.  The public are aware that we enacted the Criminal Justice Bill last year.  The public are vaguely aware that the courts have power to order somebody to do community work in lieu of going to prison but the public have no overall awareness of the operation of the criminal justice system. The public have no appreciation of the operation of the system.  Increasingly the public regard the criminal justice system as something which operates in a very inadequate manner and the public, above all, do not see Government at either executive or legislative level tackling the problem of crime.</P>
    <P>In so far as the public are made aware of what is being done, it is important that a realistic public relations exercise be embarked on.  I underline the word &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; because we have had unrealistic public relation exercises embarked upon by people with responsibility for the Department of Justice in the past.  It is important that the way in which the problem has been tackled, both from a police point of view, and how the courts consider the matter, should be conveyed to the public at every level, in the media, on television and through the schools so that our young people can see in a real way how justice is being administered.</P>
    <P>The second point is to allow for accountability and evaluation of what the police, courts, prison service, and Department of Justice have done.  Accountability is a very big problem.  The Garda must be accountable to us and they must, above <Col N="475" /> all, be accountable to the people.  In this regard I welcome the Bill being introduced by the Minister for Justice to ensure that a proper and adequate complaints procedure exists in so far as the public have complaints against the Garda.  At one level that introduces the question of accountability.  It is right that a procedure like that should be available and I compliment the Minister for making that procedure available.  On another level it is important that we respect the discretion which a garda should have in discharging his or her duty.  It is extremely important, in so far as accountability is concerned, that the discretion which a garda should be trained to have and which anybody admitted to the Garda should naturally have, is discharged in a reasonable way but also in a way that makes the Garda ultimately accountable to the public.</P>
    <P>On the level of accountability in so far as the courts are concerned, it is also important that the manner in which defendants pass through the courts system from beginning to end should be made clear to the public as to what may happen somebody within the courts system.  In that regard I draw the attention of the House to page 31 of the report which is the flow chart of the criminal justice system.  It is a very helpful chart in relation to the District Court criminal jurisdiction indicating all the options, all the positions in which somebody who comes within the system may find himself at any time.  That is something which should be got across.  It should be a measure of the ultimate accountability of the courts to the public.</P>
    <P>The third point from the quotation I read is that the system should allow for rational planning.  I have already laid substantial emphasis on the question of statistics at the commencement of my contribution to the debate.  It is difficult to plan rationally for the criminal justice system when we do not have proper statistics. To plan for the future we must ensure that the statistical data is available at all levels; secondly, we must ensure that our judges meet, by statutory obligation, <Col N="476" /> on a regular basis; and, thirdly, we must ensure that the Garda are properly trained &mdash; at senior level in particular &mdash; for the job which they have to take on.</P>
    <P>The first page of chapter one of the report makes interesting reading when it refers to the development of the crime problem.  It gives interesting statistics in relation to robberies, and I quote:</P>
    <P>There were 55 robberies in 1932; 43 in 1942; 23 in 1952; and 39 in 1962.</P>
    <P>Then in the mid-sixties a fundamental change took place, evident in the 622 robberies of which the Garda were aware in 1972, and more evident still in the 1,883 robberies entered in the 1982 crime statistics.  The number of gardaí has been increasing dramatically.  In 1951 we had 6,904 gardaí stationed in 810 stations; in 1961 we had 6,612 gardaí in 758 stations; in 1971 we had 6,612 gardaí in 697 stations; in 1981 we had 9,722 gardaí in 700 stations and now we have approximately 12,000 gardaí.</P>
    <P>The report makes a valid point that increasing the number of gardaí is not necessarily going to decrease the level of crime; it may decrease the level of certain types of criminal activity.  The question has to be asked: are our gardaí being properly deployed?  One of the problems facing us is the fact that they are not.  I raised last year in the House the question of the accountability of the gardaí to the people that they serve following a spate of rural robberies, and the fact that so many of our gardaí do not live in the area they serve, including many of our superintendents who are fly-by-night people, people who arrive on Monday morning with their lunch baskets and leave again on Friday evening for Dublin or Cork.  At that time the then chief superintendent of County Mayo expressed horror at my allegation that five out of the seven garda officers lived outside the county, most of them in Cork or Dublin.  He, of course, said that he lived in the county.  He claimed this by virtue of the fact that he had a flat there where he stayed during the week, but he lived elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If the gardaí are to be effective they <Col N="477" /> must live in the area they serve.  I have asked the Minister for Justice on numerous occasions to ensure that there is a statutory obligation on every garda to live in the area for which he is responsible. As politicians, we are aware that there are hundreds and hundreds of people trying to join the Garda and if that minimal requirement, which is, for instance, imposed on a community welfare officer, cannot be imposed on the gardaí, then they should be asked to resign from their positions.  In so far as the more senior ranks of the Garda are concerned, there should be a much keener scrutinty of the administrative ability of the people who achieve superintendent or chief superintendent rank.  It is not evident from my experience of the Garda officers appointed to the more senior ranks that they have that ability. It is important that the Garda achieve a better sense of public relations by developing the ability to deal with people on a personal level.  The Garda are, increasingly, failing in that task.  We can increase the number of gardaí but we are achieving little unless we ensure that they live in their areas, that they have a closer relationship with the people they serve and, above all, that they have a better PR sense.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the criminal courts.  The report is scathing in regard to the manner in which records are kept in the criminal courts.  It is important that a number of things emerge from the criminal court records.  First, there should be definite statistics of the indirect monitoring by the courts of criminals &mdash; for example, cases that are adjourned or adjourned generally to allow the courts to review in an indirect way the performance of a particular defendant.  Secondly, there should be specific statistics as to the success or otherwise of the community work scheme.  Thirdly, there should be definite figures available dealing with the court welfare service, which is doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I see the criminal justice system as being basic to our society.  The question of accountability is what must be determined.  The central issue which <Col N="478" /> the report brings up is the fact that by virtue of the basis of the operation of the system it is difficult to determine that accountability.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the Department introduces the necessary disciplines in the Garda and within the court system to ensure the kind of accountability which will allow us in both Houses to evaluate the success or otherwise of the system.  I ask her to see to it that those disciplines and systems are introduced.</P>

      <P>In what will be a brief contribution on the motion, first, I welcome the opportunity given to the House to discuss the National Economic and Social Council's report on &ldquo;The Criminal Justice System: Policy and Performance.&rdquo; The question of the administration of the criminal justice system is a most important one in the light of the breakdown, if you like, in law and order when we are having new types of crime and where society as a whole is having to face and grapple with sophisticated systems of crime which were unheard of just a few years ago.  In the context of these developing situations it is important that these systems are looked at critically and that we examine them to see in what way we can try to improve the administration of the criminal justice system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm to say that it is an archaic, slow and sluggish system.  This is borne out by the NESC report.  It is not alive to the changing trends in society.  The legal profession, in the manner in which they operate these systems &mdash; though it may not be their fault entirely &mdash; have almost a vested interest in ensuring that the public never come to understand what is taking place.  The language that is used in the presentations in our courts and the regal dress and garb are relevent to the era when landlords and power and privilege dominated.  I would like the honourable member from the Mayo constituency to talk to his colleagues about opening out this system and helping the public to have <Col N="479" /> greater confidence.  Knowledge is confidence and without it &mdash; and the lack is prevalent in the public &mdash; we are at a distinct loss.  That kind of vested interest travels down the road to senior counsel, the necessity for junior counsel and the necessity for rakes of money to be found to piece together a combination of advisers and consultants which nearly necessitates the ownership of a bank before an individual can go to court to have his rights decided.  In the event of his losing he could lose all that he has.  It is time, in addressing this question, that we all spoke out our minds in a way which would help to create a fairer, more open and more understandable system.</P>
    <P>We could also say that the court system operates almost in isolation from the forces which create the crime and in isolation from the system which harbours the criminals after the court decision is taken. What I am saying here really is that the forces in society which dictate levels of crime are not being properly combatted. Take a part of this city with 60 per cent unemployment and the consequent frustration.  Do not think that I am trying to justify crime or justify developments of that kind.  But in view of the forces that are there with that predominant problem of unemployment &mdash; in some parts of our country up to 60 per cent &mdash; in almost no-go areas, where the illiteracy and the domestic problems are so great, if the court just deals with the situation of crime on that day and we ignore the forces which created it and then ignore the rehabilitation process which should take place in the prison system subsequently, we are continuing that vested interest and we are not really attacking the real base problems that are there.</P>
    <P>It is costing £30,000 to keep a prisoner for one year at the present time.  We have seen the demand for prison space grow, the opening of Spike Island, the dismantling of some educational and other services that have taken place in order to accommodate rising numbers of people who for one reason or another are brought before our courts and are criminally inclined.  I think the number of prisoners <Col N="480" /> has increased by about one-third in the past three or four years.  With such an investment in that area it is crucial that the rehabilitation, training and education, both within the prison and also the system that we operate in the community as a whole, whether it is neighbourhood watch, community workshops or youth development, should be carefully examined. I admire the Garda junior liaison officers who are trying to grapple with the problems and deal with families at risk and children from broken homes.  I agree with Senator Higgins when he talks about the familiarity and the question of confidence in the gardaí and the efforts they make to work in the community with the leaders in the community to identify these problems before they arise.</P>
    <P>I believe that nobody sets out in the first instance to become the confirmed criminal that they end up in being.  We must take cognizance of the fact of the number of people who go to prison and go back to prison again for a further crime.  As I see it the overall system ends either at the stage of preventive effort, community activities, and workshops of that kind.  It would be far better if used in trying to invest more resources, limited as they are, in dealing with the problems on ground level within the community than trying to find the astronomical sums necessary, as they will be in some cases no matter what we do, to keep increasing numbers in prisons, if that can be avoided by better management from all of us within the community.</P>
    <P>The Garda are in the front line and they obviously have a major role to play. We are all prepared to spend more money on security in our homes.  We are all extremely worried about old people being attacked and, God knows, we had a spate of such a attacks in recent years. The fact of the matter is that we do not even visit our own relations in hospitals. We do not want to mind our own parents in our own homes.  How are we going to reach the stage where we will be concerned about our neighbour down the road when we have allowed the creeping paralysis of selfishness to bite into our system until we do not give a damn?  We <Col N="481" /> would spend £1,000 on security to protect our homes.  You cannot protect your homes with money and security.  You can only do it on a very temporary basis. Unless society addresses the fundamental questions which force people down that road &mdash; well, &ldquo;force&rdquo; is a strong word &mdash; which sometimes leads people down the road into the depths of criminality, then we are going to have to find more and more from our scarce resources to deal with the end result without attention to preventive efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are lucky to have the opportunity of discussing the National Economic and Social Council Report No. 77, entitled &ldquo;The Criminal Justice System: Policy and Performance.&rdquo; In discussing reports like that which runs to hundreds of pages all we can do really is extract from the report what we consider to be the relevent highlights of the report.  There are many matters in the report about which I and, I am sure, the other speakers have views; but in the limited time available to us it would be impossible to do justice to the many important arguments which are contained in the report.  I, therefore, decided to confine my comments to a few headings rather than to range over the whole area covered by the report.  Before going on to consider them one by one I would like to indicate to you what they are.</P>
      <P>The report has quite an amount to say about police; it has quite an amount to say about prisons; it has quite an amount to say about courts; and it has a lot to say about statistics and knowledge of the origins and recording of crimes which is of assistance to us in examining the reasons for our problems.  They are the four headings to which I would like briefly to refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to start off by talking about the question of statistics.  I am not saying this because statistics give me any particular pleasure but because we can learn from them.  Within this report there is information available which would not otherwise be available to us which should indicate why our crime rate is rising and <Col N="482" /> has risen and which give us some indication of when we might expect to stop rising.  First of all, at page 190 of the report, in paragraphs one to three, the authors set out recommendations with regard to improving the quality and range of criminal justice statistics available both to decision makers and to the general public.  It recommends the way in which that can be done.  Those three recommendations, which are too long to be read into the Official Report, have my support and approval.</P>
    <P>But the reason behind and the fundamental purpose of these recommendations can be seen by an examination of the table in the report which is presented to us on page 115.  It is a very startling piece of information.  It may not be very surprising to know that the percentage of the population in 1979 that was under ten years of age was 20 per cent and that they committed only 2 per cent of the crime. It also might not be very surprising to know that 45 per cent of the population were over 30 years.  In so far as we have been able to ascertain in respect of people apprehended, they committed 15 per cent of the crime.  So, 45 per cent of the people committed 15 per cent of crime. There are variations in the other age groups.  But there are two age groups which are particularly important: the 15 and 16 year olds represented at that time 4 per cent of the population, but they committed 20 per cent of the crime.  That is a staggering figure.  In addition to that, the 17 to 20 year olds had 7 per cent of the population, but they committed 24 per cent of the crimes &mdash; over three times what one would expect.  Between 15 and 20, in that six year group, there was 11 per cent of the population but there was about 43 per cent of the crime.</P>
    <P>That shows one of the reasons why our crime rate has been increasing, because with the age structure of our population an increasing percentage of our population has in the last few years gone into that slot between 15 and 20.  A person between 15 and 20, on the basis of that information, is four times as likely to commit a crime as any other person.  It is <Col N="483" /> not surprising then, that we have experienced a considerable increase in the amount of crime.  Portion of the increase in crime, if not all, can be directly attributed to the fact of the change in the age structure of our population.  It is thus a temporary phenomenon and one to which we must respond; but at the same time it is not justifiable to use that situation to justify scaremongering tactics with regard to the population at large and with regard to the way in which crime is going.</P>
    <P>I recall on the Second Stage discussion of the Criminal Justice Bill listening to Senator Michael D. Higgins discussing the importance of crime statistics.  Anybody who was here at the time could not fail to be impressed, first of all by his grasp of the problem but also by the direct relevance which it had to the problem we were discussing at that time.  He realised the problem that if we do not accurately and properly collect our information then we may have a knee jerk reaction to increasing crime statistics based on emotion rather than on logic.  As a result of that we might be tempted to pass into law legislation which would not be justified in the longer term.  That is why I so strongly support and why I am taking more than a proportionate amount of my time in considering the importance of statistics as an adequate basis for the consideration of our future problems, of our future policy in the criminal justice area.  The recommendations in the report and the information contained in page 115 and pages before and after it are very important in the context of our future criminal policy.</P>
    <P>The second matter to which I would like to refer briefly is the question of the courts.  It is open season on lawyers by non-lawyers at present.  Apparently, lawyers have for some reason offended the rest of the population.  The earning of their living is in some way the subject of constant attention.  I find that quite surprising, because since I changed my profession and became a lawyer I find that the level of earnings which my colleagues have is not out of line with what one <Col N="484" /> earns in other professions.  The traditions and standard of professionalism which I have seen among both the solicitors and barristers compares very favourably with what I saw in my previous profession.  It is easy to get a cheap thrill by mocking the wearing of wigs and gowns.  I do not care whether I ever wore a wig or gown. The gown is certainly irrelevant; the wig is performing a more and more useful function as time goes on.  If somebody decides that it would improve the public perception of the dignity of the law for me not to wear my wig and gown, then I would be happy to do that.</P>
    <P>More important, within the report, on pages 186 and 187, there are a list of recommendations concerning the court which should be taken seriously.  They refer briefly to an extension of the amount of consultation within the Judiciary. Senator Durcan properly made that a central theme on his moving of this motion.  This kind of consultation is adding to one aspect of the judicial process which is important, that is the question of certainty.  Nothing will create more work, whether it be on the civil or the criminal side, than uncertainty.  If people think that by going before a particular judge they will get a lenient sentence, then that kind of uncertainty creates work within the judicial system. That leads to complaints of inefficiency in due course.  Uniformity outside the question of the justice of it, which is also the paramount consideration, there are very practical reasons why consultation is a good thing.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation is on the question of the publishing of reports of appeals in criminal cases.  This is an excellent idea, adding to the general information. Thirdly, there is the question of consolidated statute law and published appeal decisions.  It is important that sufficient money would be made available in order to ensure that the wide range of judicial decisions, which are of importance in court cases, can be published quickly and efficiently through the various statutory and non-statutory bodies whose function it is to do so.</P>
    <P>There are other recommendations with <Col N="485" /> regard to the promptitude of the court in dealing with various matters.  The recommendations with regard to the probation and welfare service are very worthwhile.  Finally, the question of the prosecution function being placed under the effective control of the DPP is a matter which requires careful consideration.  The role of the Director of Public Prosecutions, since it was established &mdash; I am not talking about the individual, because it would be inappropriate to do so, I am talking about the office &mdash; has been a considerable achievement in Irish judicial life.  It is a monument to the 1973-1977 Coalition because it removed the question of prosecutions quite clearly from the political sphere.  It has been one of the success stories of Irish criminal law over the last ten years.  I would also like to refer very briefly to the other matters to which I made reference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two matters to which I would like to refer.  One is the question of the size of the police force. The increasing size of the police force, to which reference has been made by Senator Durcan and which is referred to at page 127-129 of the report, is something to which we should give serious consideration.  I will not repeat the figures which he mentioned there.  Suffice to say that it has gone from 6,900 over a 35 year period to something over 12,000.  That is a dramatic increase of course, some increase, because of the increase in the size of the population and the age structure of the population, is to be accepted. There appears to be no co-relation between an increase in the size of the Garda Síochána or of any other police force and the rate of crime.  Future recruitment to the Garda Síochána should bear that in mind.  The most important matter to be dealt with in the report is the recommendation concerning the training of police officers.  That is contained in pages 184 and 185 of the report where reference is made to an extension of the training <Col N="486" /> period for recruits in Templemore, followed by further training at the end of the recruit's probationary period in the force.  Certain changes have taken place which are to be welcomed but further changes are necessary in this regard.  A greater use of a probationary period in a new garda's training is a very important portion of the new training atmosphere which would exist in the Garda Síochána. I will not make reference to the Ó Briain report and whether or not it has been implemented.  That would be reploughing and reharrowing ground that has been well ploughed and well harrowed previously. The recommendations contained at pages 184 and 185 report should have our serious consideration.</P>
      <P>I would like to make very brief reference to the question of the prisons and the effect of prison on people.  If the report is slightly inadequate in any way it is in the examination of the effect of the prison system on the making of better citizens.  Whether it does make better citizens is the one of the criticism of the report that I would like to make.  There are recommendations contained at page 189 of the report and at page 37 concerning the prison system to which other Members referred in the course of their contributions to this debate.  What they had to say in regard to education and training, with regard to prison rights, with regard to the educational and developmental role of prison officers, all have extreme relevance in the present time and should be carefully taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking all these matters together, I think the report is a good report which could properly take its place alongside the other excellent reports of the Economic and Social Research Institute, Nos. 121 and 102, which dealt with the question of crime, statistical information and crime victimisation in the Republic of Ireland.  These reports taken together should be a useful addition to the library of information which we are gathering concerning the criminal in Ireland and what society's proper and adequate <Col N="487" /> response to the criminal's behaviour should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, the House and the Minister for giving me the opportunity to speak on this very important matter.  I believe it is one of the most serious motions I ever had the opportunity of speaking on before this House.</P>
      <P>The first question I want to ask is what is the exact position with regard to these reconstruction grants.  I am not completely sure.  I know that a registered builder should be employed.  There is space on the application form to give the income tax number of the builder and the VAT number.  I know of one registered builder who was not allowed to build an extension to his own house.  He gave his registration number and his VAT number.  I also heard of a director of a building company who gave the registration number and the tax number and was not accepted as suitable to carry out the works.  I understand this stipulation will be extended to new houses shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an area I know very well, having been involved in it for a long time.  The impression I and most people get is that the do-it-yourself house builder, so far as reconstruction grants are concerned, is finished.  This is a complete departure from the tradition we had in this country. The history we have in this country is of people doing their own works, extending their own houses, in some cases building their own houses and, in the old days, thatching their own houses.  Suddenly it seems that this comes to an end.  This is wrong.  If that is the situation I would ask the Minister to seriously reconsider it.  As I have said many times in this House, in this country we have class distinction.  In my own experience the possibility that people had to build a house or to extend a house of their own gave them an opportunity <Col N="488" /> to improve their position.  People could buy a site and they could build a new house on it with their own hands. They were able to improve themselves in this way.  They built their own house, they were proud of it and they were entitled to be proud of it.  I lived in a labourer's cottage and back in the 1950s we got a small grant to provide a bathroom and a kitchen.  Some of the materials we used were from an old house.  I must say that the grant inspector was a kindly man who overlooked a few details.  Had he not done so it would have been impossible to do it.  We were not different from other people.  There were very many other families in the same position.</P>
    <P>I recall about eight years ago a middle aged woman calling to my office.  Her concern was that she wanted to build a house with her own hands and the blocks were too heavy to handle.  I spent an afternoon helping that lady and advised her to use bricks.  She thought that was a great idea.  She told me she would build with bricks.  Unfortunately, I never heard from her again.  It would have been nice to have got a postcard to say that she did so.  The point I am trying to make is that people were able to use their own hands to improve themselves.</P>
    <P>I want to say with regard to this matter I am not anti-builder.  I realise the value of builders, particularly the small builder. I know what they have done.  They were committed people.  They worked hard and in many cases without the small builder extensions and new houses would not have been possible because people had to wait a long time for grants and in many cases the builder himself was the financial institution.  These people could not and did not get bridging loans.  The builder had to wait.  Nobody is more aware of the value of the small builder than I am.</P>
    <P>I realise the problems of the black economy.  I must make that clear.  I understand the anxiety to eradicate this problem and I am totally behind that. But in trying to get rid of the problem in this way the Minister is throwing out the baby with the bath water.  There is no question whatever about it.  In filling up <Col N="489" /> the application form it is necessary to give the builder's income tax number and his VAT number.  For most builders it is very difficult to refuse people when they look for his VAT number and his income tax number.  In many cases the builder is working in a small community and most of the people would be his friends.  I have no doubt that no builder would be able to cope with all the work he would get if he was successful in all his tenders.  I know one builder who has given his numbers to over 20 people and there is no way that he could cope with that number if he were asked to do so.  It would be a sheer impossibility.  I want the Minister to realise that it is very difficult for a builder in a small community, if somebody approaches him and asks for his numbers, to refuse.  Under the old system the contractor's name and address was asked for and in most cases people put down &ldquo;not yet selected&rdquo;.  Even in this system where a builder's name is given that builder would not have quoted for the works and if the person were tied to that builder he could ask for any figure he liked.</P>
    <P>There will be very long delays in payment with this new grant system. Bridging finance is very expensive and it is the poor who will suffer.  It is those most deserving and those least able to afford to do the works and perhaps those with large families who will be affected mostly.</P>
    <P>With regard to direct labour, the Fourth Report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses had this to say on page 44 paragraph 7.4:</P>
    <P>Claims forms for housing grants and mortgage subsidies in the case of work undertaken by direct labour should include the names and PRSI numbers of those employed in the construction work.  In the event of this information not being supplied properly a deduction of 50 per cent should be made from the grants and subsidies until this information is forthcoming.  A receipt of payment to the builder should be produced.</P>
    <P>That seems simple enough.  That is <Col N="490" /> reasonable and that is fair.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that.</P>
    <P>I understand the position with regard to registration for VAT to be that if a builder has a turnover under a certain figure &mdash; I think it is £18,000 &mdash; he does not have to register.  I know of one case where a small builder whose turnover was under the stipulated figure &mdash; he had paid his income tax &mdash; had not registered.  In order to do these works he had to register. There are many elderly people, people who do not want to get involved in filling up VAT forms, and they must register to qualify to do contract works for these grants.  I think that is unfair.</P>
    <P>I do not condone the black economy but with regard to the unregistered builder the State does not lose out.  The registered builder pays 23 per cent VAT on the materials which he buys.  He recoups that 23 per cent VAT and in some cases he qualifies to get back more at the end of each month.  Therefore he does not charge the customer the 23 per cent VAT.  He bases his price on the materials, less the VAT.  He charges 10 per cent VAT on the job.  If we take it that labour and materials work out about fifty-fifty, an unregistered builder pays 23 per cent VAT on the materials.  He cannot recoup the VAT.  Therefore, he charges the VAT to the customer and it goes to the State.  In my estimation the State does better from the unregistered builder because he cannot claim back the VAT.  That is a very important point which the Minister will have to consider.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this system will make unregistered contractors register.  These jobs simply do not pay.  The contractor has to keep his price too keen, he has to wait too long.  Therefore he does not want to do the works.  There is no chance of forcing people to register in this way. They will not.  The situation in other countries is that people can do the work themselves and qualify for grants.  From any of the literature I have read it appears to be possible to do that.  We are in a unique situation now in this country. With our history and the special problems we have, I think it is wrong to prevent people from doing their own work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> There have been criticisms of the buildings in this country, the houses, extensions and so on.  In general the form of a building is determined by three things &mdash; the requirements of the builder, the skills of those involved on the buildings, and skills would include knowledge and tradition, and materials used.  I believe that our requirements change.  We need bigger houses.  Our skills are improving and, particularly because of the teaching in vocational schools, people have become very proficient and skilful.</P>
    <P>Over the years young people have called to my office who had just left school and were planning to marry and to buy a site and build and furnish a house; and old people who have retired have come to me.  They are ambitious. All such people will be frustrated now if that is the situation.  I hope the Minister will tell us here tonight that this is not the situation.  I hope there will be allowances made for situations where there may be a large family, where people in that family want to work and where they can do a certain amount of the work.  I hope the Minister will tell us that that is to be permitted.</P>
    <P>With regard to the PRSI contributions, in one sense it is unfortunate that we do not have the old system whereby people stamped a card, because it was very handy.  If that were the situation now when hiring a worker to do this kind of job it would be very simple to put on a stamp.  Perhaps a special stamp could be organised for that situation.  There will be big delays with the grants.  At present there is a waiting period of maybe up to six months before people are notified of what grant they are entitled to.  The inspector has to call on them and there is a certain amount of clerical work; I know of one instance where there was a delay of over four months with that.  The Department can, if they want to, prolong payment.  If the inspector is told that money is scarce he can ask for a few screws to be put in a downpipe, he can look for something insignificant to be <Col N="492" /> done.  Building was a hobby for many people.  Large families shared the workload. They were proud of their achievements. People had something to live for. They were proud of their own work.  Now all that is changed.  There are problems with houses all over the country.  Deal windows are rotting and have to be replaced.  It is not a difficult job for somebody who is handy.  Overall in changing the system we are going backwards.  We are hitting those who are most vulnerable. We are preventing them from working and I would ask the Minister to look again at that situation.</P>
    <P>The grants are generous to a certain extent but it must be remembered that in getting the services of a contractor it will be essential to pay at least one-third of the cost of the works because the grants only amount in most cases to two-thirds. With regard to the pre-1940 house I understand the position is as follows.  I got this information from <i>The Irish Press</i> of last Friday, 7 February.  If your house was built before 1940 you could in theory qualify for the grand total of £8,600 in grants but to claim this maximum figure you would have to do work costing a total of £12,900 on repairs and improvements as no single payment can amount to more than two-thirds of the total cost.  To qualify for £8,600 you would be claiming £400 to install a water supply, £400 for sewerage facilities, £800 to install a bathroom, £2,000 for a livingroom, kitchen or bedroom extension plus the new £5,000 grant for repairs and reconstruction of older houses.  As the owner of a house built since 1940 you could receive a maximum of £6,400, £400 for a water supply, £400 for sewerage, £800 to build a chimney if the house has no existing chimney, £800 for a bathroom, £2,000 for an extension, £2,000 maximum for necessary works to the fabric of the house including the £800 maximum for the replacement of windows.</P>

      <P>To qualify for this <Col N="493" /> amount the work would have to cost at least £9,600 as no grant can exceed two-thirds of the cost of the work in that particular case.  What I am saying to the Minister is that there is a considerable amount of money involved in all those cases.  The people who will be victimised will be the poorer sections, the people with the large families and on lower incomes.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that these people will not be barred from doing some of the work themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I respect Senator Fitzsimons and I take the points he has made here tonight but basically I want to say that we introduced this very generous grant scheme for a number of reasons.  One would be to generate employment, generate activity in the building industry, and the other to preserve, particularly with regard to the pre-1940 house, the housing fabric of the country which in a lot of cases was deteriorating.  I am happy to say that this has been an outstanding success by way of application.  I am not talking about the actual number of application forms that have been taken up which is something over 100,000 but the number of grant application forms completed and returned to the Department is 36,000. That gives a clear indication of the popularity of this despite the problems the Senator mentioned.  He raised one issue with regard to the registered building contractor who wants to build an extension or refurbish his home or whatever. He is entitled to do that once he is registered. He can go ahead, fill up his application form and once he puts the required numbers down he will qualify. That is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator talked about the person who wants to do his own work.  Grants are not a right, they are something which Governments look at and take a hard decision on.  We have allocated £24 million for the year which is a fairly sizeable sum of money for home improvement <Col N="494" /> grants.  We did this to stimulate the economy and to develop it.  I think it is recognised by all that the black economy was literally running riot in many ways but certainly in that area.  As to whether to allow the man who wants to do it himself to do so, if an inspector goes down and the work is done all the man has to say is that he did it himself.  He could have people doing it who might be signing-on at the local unemployment exchange.  If he is doing it himself he has to give names. If he says &ldquo;I have done this job myself&rdquo; he may only have lifted a brick on a brick, but he says he did it.  The inspector has no way of knowing.  There is no way around this.  It is more than desirable to ensure that in this area of activity registered contractors do the job.  People have come to me in my own constituency and asked me how can they get registered. Up to now they were floating in the great black economy.  Now, because they want a piece of the action, they have to register.  It is bringing people into the system.  These people may have just drifted into the other system, not out of any malice or wanting to do anybody down, but it was the easier way to do it. By getting them back into the system they are at least making their contribution.</P>
    <P>To most of us who pay tax, if we want equity in it, that is the best way to do it. Prior to this builders have come to me and said they were forced out of business into the black economy because when they priced a job somebody else using all sorts of labour undercut them.  One must ask if a Government have the right to subsidise this type of activity.  I say &ldquo;No, positively no.&rdquo;  If people feel so strongly that they want to do it themselves, then they have to forego the grant.  We are using this money as a pump-primer.  That is what Governments are for.  They must try to stimulate the economy.  We are putting this type of money in-to prime the pump.  The person concerned has to spend at least one-third, and in some cases he must spend more.  He may not have spent a bob.  The property may have deteriorated.  We are generating a lot of activity in the industry.  We are refurbishing and restoring housing stock, which is <Col N="495" /> of tremendous economic benefit to our society.  In doing that we are doing what I believe is right.  I take the point you are making.  One can have a degree of sympathy for it.  I see no way of stopping the black economy unless we do what we are doing.  People have great ingenuity in getting around whatever routes are provided.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear that.  It is important that such news should get around.  We have all been lamenting the decline of the industry over the past couple of years.  It only affects the small man but it is an important aspect of the building industry.  The small man employing two or three people is now back in business.  I was speaking to contractors <Col N="496" /> recently who were involved in this grant system and they are very happy about it. They see it working effectively.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of delays, given the number of applications, unfortunately there will be some delay.  We took on additional staff.  We took on nine to ten inspectors initially.  We are taking on another 30 within the next ten days to tackle this problem in order to ensure that there will be the minimum of delay. This scheme is excellent.  It will have a tremendous effect on the employment situation within that small end of the industry.  It will have the effect of preserving and consolidating the fabric of the houses in Ireland.</P>
