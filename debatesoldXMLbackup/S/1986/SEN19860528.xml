      <P>I have notice from Senator Killilea that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to accede to the request of the board of management and teachers of Currandulla National School, County Galway to enable the amalgamation of the two schools there to take place in September of this year and that the eight teachers be retained to take into account the special circumstances of the location of the two schools.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 4 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, and 3 in that order.  It is proposed to adjourn for lunch from 12.30 to 2 p.m. and we will take no new business after 3.30 p.m. in view of the Adjournment Matter.  I wish to advise the House that representations have been made to me about next week's sittings.  In view of the coming bank holiday week end it is not <Col N="102" /> proposed to sit on Tuesday but to sit on Wednesday and Thursday of next week. It is appropriate this morning, the 25th anniversary of Amnesty International, that we as a House should request the Minister to apply himself to taking No. 15 as quickly as possible.  I hope with the permission of the House to request the Minister to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I wonder if the acting Leader of the House would be prepared to give time today to debate the situation with regard to the agricultural officers' strike, which has totally paralysed the whole agricultural industry.  If he is not prepared to do so, would we be entitled under Standing Order 29 to have the matter debated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to protest at the fact that it is proposed to take No. 3, that is the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Bill, 1985.  That is a very technical measure even though it is short, it is a complex and technical measure.  Very inadequate notice was given to Members of this House that it was proposed to take that measure today. I would ask the acting Leader to reconsider the question of whether that matter should be taken today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Ferris in sending good wishes to Amnesty International.  Amnesty International have done fantastic work throughout the world in the last 25 years. At a time when there must be monitoring of the atrocities that are being committed throughout the world by governments, it is appropriate that we would convey our congratulations to Amnesty.  We met some people from Nicaragua yesterday. Amnesty are afraid that the situation in Nicaragua is deteriorating to the extent that the American Government are using the Contras to kidnap people who are working in Nicaragua on a voluntary <Col N="103" /> basis.  Four German volunteers are missing in Nicaragua, having been kidnapped by the Contras.  There is no doubt that these kidnappings were carried out in collusion with American forces.  I would appeal that every effort should be made by the German Government to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whatever I wanted to say on the Order of Business, my breath has been taken away by the acting Leader of the House.  It is the first time since I became a Member of this House that the Leader of the House or anyone deputising for him actually announced, without being asked, that a Private Member's Bill was going to be taken very quickly.  Since I am co-sponsor of the Bill I am very grateful for that.  Can I beg your indulgence to associate myself with the congratuations to Amnesty International. Without being contentious may I also remind this House that it is not just far away countries that Amnesty International have been critical of.  They have been critical in very trenchant terms of the way in which we deal with our prisoners under certain circumstances.  As well as examining the conscience of the world we should also examine our own conscience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ellis's view on the agricultural dispute.  It is very important and perhaps the Leader of the House might consider taking it up under Standing Order 29.</P>
      <P>There was very little notice about the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Bill being taken today.  When the Order of Business is decided here do we adhere to it?  For example, we had a situation yesterday where Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were ordered but then later in the day No. 4 was ordered.  It is very unfair to Senators that business can be ordered in their absence.  They could be attending meetings or meeting deputations and would not know what was happening. That was an important item.  It related to the work being done on this House.  Some Senators missed it and others could have missed it who were anxious to contribute to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unusual for the Order of Business to change.  It can change at any time during the day, so I suggest that Senators watch the monitors and stay in touch with their Whips or with the Party Leaders.  I cannot talk individually to 60 Senators.  I do try to reach agreement and did in fact reach agreement.  I could speak further on why No. 4 was taken but I will not.  I think Senator Kiely should have discussed it with the Leader of his own party.  It was done by agreement and by agreement of the House afterwards.  I already apologised last night to Senator Kiely that he was unaware of the change.  It can happen and if it requires to happen at any particular time during any day I hope we can reach an agreement.  We must run the House as efficiently as possible.  I shall communicate with Senator Durcan about his concern in that regard but again that was discussed last week by the Leader of his group that it should be in the interest of the House to take it.  I discussed it with the Minister and the Minister of State for Women's Affairs who is ready to take it. It is a short Bill.  I also discussed it with <Col N="105" /> the spokesman on Justice for the Fianna Fáil Party who was aware of the possibility that it might have been taken either last night or today.  We may not get to it today in time but it is appropriate to order it.</P>
      <P>Standing Order 29 is a matter for the Chair.  I share the concern of the House about the ongoing dispute.  It is very serious and I will be availing of the opportunity today to discuss it with the Minister for Labour.  That is another matter and not on the clár of this House.  It is within the jurisdiction of the Cathaoirleach to decide on Standing Order 29 and he will duly come back to us with a report if it is considered that the appropriate notice has been given.</P>
      <P>Senator Killilea asked the question about the Committee Stage of the Bill on CIE re-organisation.  It is proposed to take it next Wednesday, 4 June at 2.30 p.m. and it is hoped that the Minister will be available.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Combat Poverty Bill, which passed through this House and which had two technical amendments made to it in the Dáil will be the first item on next week's sitting.  It is an important Bill and the Dáil amendment has to get this House's approval.  That will possibly be No. 1 and I expect that the CIE Bill will be next.</P>
      <P>I want to thank Senators Lanigan and Ryan for their support of Amnesty International. I join with Senator Lanigan on his comments about Nicaragua.  We might have a resolution we could put down in this House to which every party could subscribe and not just make it a party political issue.</P>

      <P>With regard to the request from Senator Ellis.  I have nothing in writing on Standing Order 29.  If it comes to me in writing I will consider it. I have committed myself and the House to Senator Killilea's request.  However, if Senator Ellis's motion is taken Senator Killilea's motion cannot be taken.  It is a pity this was not mentioned in the office <Col N="106" /> before we came in and made the commitment to Senator Killilea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill which provides for the establishment of a new statutory body &mdash; the Dublin Transport Authority &mdash; is to radically improve the planning and operation of the road and rail transport and the management of road traffic in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for substantial improvements on all of those fronts is apparent and urgent, especially to the many thousands <Col N="107" /> of people who have to travel miles to work every day and all other people needing to do business in the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order may we have a copy of the Minister's speech?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand copies are on the way, I apologise for the delay.</P>
      <P>More importantly, our capital city needs to be relieved of the now severe road traffic congestion so that its vital commercial social and cultural functions can be restored and animated.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives to the new Authority the mission and the necessary statutory powers to get to grips with the severe road traffic congestion especially in the centre city areas.  The Authority will therefore be developing and implementing a comprehensive traffic management strategy aimed at keeping Dublin's traffic flows moving, swiftly but safely, while seeing to the provision of adequate short term car parking facilities for persons doing business in the city.  Of greater importance, however, are the provisions of the Bill giving to the Authority other major new functions &mdash; functions which no other body has at present &mdash; namely, to assess and rank public needs and expenditures as far as public transport by road and rail is concerned, and to secure better physical planning so that public transport needs can be better met in the future and at least cost.  The establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority is, of course, only one of the vital elements in the far-reaching programme of transport reforms which I have launched as Minister.  This programme requires a very substantial volume of new legislation as evidenced by the fact that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;three transport Bills have already been enacted this year: the Canals, Free Ports and Air Transport Bills;</P>
      <P>&mdash;three further transport Bills are now before this House, The Dublin Transport Authority, CIE Reorganisation and the Harbours Bills;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;three further transport Bills are now <Col N="108" /> before the Dáil and will also come before this House soon, the Road Transport, B &amp; I and Air Navigation and Transport (Preinspection) Bills.</P>
    <P>Further substantial legislation will arise from decisions in the White Paper on Transport Policy which I am now preparing for publication later this year.</P>
    <P>The need for a new legislative framework to meet current needs in transport matters give the Members of this House and the Dáil a wonderful opportunity to review national transport policy and to contribute to its development.  I am glad of that opportunity and look forward to participating in the process.  I know that this House is particularly appreciative of the fact that of the nine Bills mentioned, I initiated four in this House and it is my intention to initiate further Bills in this House as the opportunity presents itself.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority will: (1) be connected to the new local authority system for Dublin city and county; (2) take over from the Garda Commissioner the role of road traffic authority in its functional area; (3) assume responsibility for all traffic management schemes, that is traffic lights, road signs, etc; (4) take over responsibility for the taxi service from the Department of the Environment and the local authorities; (5) have responsibility for the routing, pricing and licensing of all bus services; (6) be the adviser to the Government on transport infrastructure investment in the Dublin area on road, rail and bus; (7) have the right to make recommendations to the local authorities and to the Minister for the Environment about local authorities' development plans and road plans, and the right of consultation by the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála on all planning applications and appeals with significant implications for traffic management or provision of transport services; (8) have the power to direct local authorities to bollard roads, to convert long roads into a number of cul-de-sacs to prevent joyriding; (9) have power to direct local authorities to ramp roads to prevent speeding; (10) have control over the provision of public car parks in the <Col N="109" /> Dublin area; (11) have control over the timing and co-ordination of road works and vehicles serving construction sites in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>As far as transport planning for the Dublin area is concerned there is a clear need to ensure that public and private transport requirements are treated in in integrated and co-ordinated manner.  In particular, the development plans and road proposals of the local authorities must take public transport needs fully into account.  Secondly, co-ordinated planning should in turn result in co-ordinated assessment being made of the requirements for annual Exchequer funding of public and private transport.  This is vital if the limited Exchequer funds available are to yield the maximum benefits to the community.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, as far as public transport services are concerned, monitoring of CIE's performance and regulation of such matters as taxi services and the provision of bus services by private operators should all be entrusted to a body whose functions relate to every major aspect of private and public transport in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Finally, the regulation and management of traffic in the Dublin area needs to be put on a new statutory footing.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a Dublin Transport Authority was the principal recommendation of the report on Passenger Transport Services in the Dublin Area, presented by the Transport Consultative Commission.  The Dublin Transportation Task Force, the non-statutory forerunner of the DTA, has achieved quite a lot. I wish to record my appreciation of its efforts.  Comprised of senior representatives of the Government Departments directly concerned, the Garda Commissioner and the Dublin city and county manager, and with the assistance of CIE, the task force has achieved a number of important improvements in traffic management in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>These improvements have been secured as a result of the development by the task force of a strategy aimed at reducing traffic congestion at peak hours by getting commuters to switch from cars to buses. The strategy has involved a combination <Col N="110" /> of improvements to the bus services and a parking policy which discourages all-day parking in the city centre.  Among the measures implemented have been the following &mdash; over 600 new or re-engined buses are now in service in CIE's Dublin fleet, which numbers about 840 buses in all; &mdash; buslanes have been successfully implemented at 65 locations, covering virtually all of the main arterial routes into the city centre; &mdash; the traffic warden service has grown from a small number working on a part time basis to 109 full time and 16 part time wardens; &mdash; 1,700 on-street car parking spaces formerly available for all-day parking have been converted to short-stay use by the provision of parking meters.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these improvements traffic congestion persists as a very pressing problem.  The continuing lack of a single statutory body with responsibility, and the necessary powers, for traffic management in the Dublin area and the consequential complexity of arrangements has meant that traffic problems could not be tackled with sufficient speed, vigour or thoroughness.  A non-statutory grouping such as the task force, which is dependent on the combined efforts of its members agencies each of which has its own priorities and concerns, is not equal to the task except on an interim basis.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate at this juncture for me to indicate in detail how the Dublin Transport Authority proposed in this Bill compares with what was proposed by the Transport Consultative Commission.  As regards functions, as recommended by the commission the DTA will have functions in the areas of transport planning, funding and public transport services, in addition to traffic management.  However, the Authority's planning functions exclude a substantial element recommended by the commission &mdash; namely, that the Authority itself would draw up a comprehensive Dublin transport plan.  Such a plan, when approved by the Government, would be binding on all concerned.  This recommendation was not accepted because of <Col N="111" /> the risk of duplicating the on-going planning work of the local authorities and CIE.</P>
    <P>Instead, the Bill requires the Authority to assess the plans of those bodies and make recommendations to the Ministers for Communications and the Environment, as appropriate.  Any recommendations to Ministers by the Authority in relation to local authority functions will also be submitted to the Dublin Metropolitan Council when that is established in due course.  In these ways the integration of transport planning recommended by the commission will be achieved.</P>
    <P>In practice, the Dublin Transport Authority would have to operate having regard to the settled general planning strategy adopted for its functional area by the local authorities in question.  It will input into that strategy.  The Authority's planning functions will be reviewed in the light of how the Authority is operating. Additional functions in that particular matter, or in other matters within its remit, may be given by Ministerial Order under section 9 of the Bill, subject to Oireachtas control.</P>
    <P>As regards the structure of the Authority, the commission recommended an executive board below the authority itself.  The Authority would have 15 members including elected representatives of the Dublin local authorities and other relevant interests.  This would be too unwieldly an organisation and could not therefore be accepted.  Instead, the Bill provides for a more concise and unified Authority, with a maximum of 12 members, to be appointed by the Minister for Communications on the basis of appropriate experience and expertise in transport and other relevant matters. Four members of the Authority will be members of the four proposed main Dublin local authorities who are nominated by them for membership of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 of the Bill, the DTA's functional area will generally cover all of these areas of the three existing Dublin local authorities, Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún <Col N="112" /> Laoghaire Borough Corporation.  It may be desirable, however, that for the purposes of specific functions, for example, in relation to public transport services, the Authority's area should be somewhat greater than that.  Section 10 provides the necessary flexibility in that the Authority's functional area may be varied in respect of all or any of its functions by Ministerial Order, subject to Oireachtas control.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill is accompanied by an explanatory memorandum, it is not necessary for me to go through it in any detailed way.  I have already referred briefly to the planning functions of the Authority, which are set out in Part III of the Bill.  I indicated how the DTA will integrate the roads and land use planning of the Dublin local authorities and the public transport planning of CIE.  It will also have an advisory role in relation to planning applications and appeals which have major implications for traffic management or the provision of transport services.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, major road works in the Dublin area have included the Clontarf Embankment Road, development of the Airport Road, the construction of Templeogue Bridge and bypasses at Swords, Palmerstown, Cabinteely and Santry.  In recent years, three new bridges have been erected over the River Liffey &mdash; the Frank Sherwin Bridge at Heuston, the Matt Talbot Bridge at the Custom House, and the East Link Bridge which has facilitated some through traffic in avoiding the city centre and a substantial time saving is being achieved by users.  In the major road plans already approved by the Government, the road situation in Dublin will be completely transformed by the end of this decade.</P>
    <P>The Dublin rail rapid transit study of 1975 saw the electrification of the Howth-Bray line as the first phase in a city-wide electrified rail system.  The next phase recommended was the provision of electrified services between Tallaght and Heuston Station.  Discussions have taken place between CIE and the Department of Communications in recent years about <Col N="113" /> the question of providing electrified services between Tallaght-Clondalkin and Heuston Station with, initially, a feeder bus service to the city centre.  The cost of that proposal could be in excess of £100 million.  The possibility of various cheaper alternatives such as a busway to Tallaght, or diesel rather than electrified rail services, has been discussed with CIE but no definite proposals have yet emerged.</P>
    <P>The question of what public transport services are to be provided for Tallaght-Clondalkin and other developing areas west of the city, and whether such services should be provided by rail, road or busway, will require priority consideration by the DTA.  Consultation will be necessary with the local authorities and CIE.  Given the constraints on resources, the high cost of rail projects will require that cheaper bus-based alternatives are brought to the forefront in the DTA's consideration of these questions.</P>
    <P>As far as funding of transport is concerned, the Authority will make recommendations as to the priorities in annual Exchequer allocations, both capital and current, for roads and public transport to the Ministers for the Environment and Communications, respectively.</P>
    <P>The importance of striking the best balance between the transport modes is readily apparent.  In 1984, Exchequer grants to the Dublin local authorities for road maintenance and improvement works totalled £25 million, while CIE's Dublin services were subvented by the Exchequer in the amount of £34 million.</P>
    <P>Section 21 should provide the Authority with an effective budgetary role to complement their planning role, without the additional procedures which would be necessary if the relevant funds were to flow through the DTA to the local authorities and CIE.  Again, however, the budgetary functions of the Authority merit re-consideration when experience of the working of the Authority is gained. The ministerial order mechanism under section 9 of the Bill provides the necessary flexibility.  In the area of traffic management, where a more direct regulatory <Col N="114" /> role is proposed for the Authority, the DTA will disburse Exchequer funds under section 43 of the Bill to the local authorities to have specific schemes implemented.</P>
    <P>In the area of public transport services, which is dealt with in Part IV of the Bill, the Authority will set objectives in relation to the extent and standard of bus and suburban rail services to be provided in the Authority's functional area by CIE, within their Exchequer subvention. The Authority will also monitor CIE's progress on meeting such objectives.  This will impose a healthy discipline on CIE, and will enable value for money to be assessed as far as Exchequer subvention is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that CIE will not vary their fares for Dublin bus and suburban rail services, without the approval of the Authority given with the consent of the Minister for Communications. The DTA will also take over responsibility, from the Minister for Communications for the licensing of private bus operators to provide public transport services in Dublin if thought necessary and for the control of taxi services in the area.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of CIE will involve the separate administration by subsidiaries of Dublin city services, provincial bus services and the railway.  Links will therefore have to be established between the DTA and the new CIE subsidiaries with responsibility for Dublin city services and for the railway, which is likely to retain responsibility for DART, or directly with CIE.  While the preparation of the new CIE legislation is in hand, the restructuring of CIE will take some time to effect. The Government are anxious to get the DTA working as soon as possible.  The interface between the DTA and the new CIE subsidiaries with responsibility for Dublin bus and suburban railway services will broadly follow the lines of the interface between the Authority and the present CIE provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The new organisational structure for CIE will enable any management defects in the industrial relations area to be remedied. The DTA will be intensifying the pro-public transport traffic management <Col N="115" /> strategy begun by the task force, so that the operating environment for buses and trains will be further improved.  It is not too much to ask that the unions and management resolve the various defects on their sides, particularly that of unofficial or unballoted industrial action on the union side.  I think the Government and the general public are entitled to demand good industrial relations in order to aid the major efforts that are being made to help CIE.</P>
    <P>The DTA are being given the function, now the prerogative of the Minister for Communications, of licensing private bus operators to provide public transport services, subject to the Minister for Communications having an appelate function in the matter.  The licensing question will therefore be one for the Authority in the first instance.  While there may well be scope for the provision by licensed private operators of limited or specialised bus services in the Dublin area, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the likely extent of such provision.  As I have said, the establishment of the DTA and the re-organisation of CIE will provide the environment in which CIE management and staff should be able to deliver an efficient and reliable service.  It would be inconsistent at the same time to permit private operators to provide scheduled services on any extensive basis, even if they were in a position to do so.  CIE must avail of the opportunity being provided for them, however, and no doubt the DTA will keep the licensing question under continuous review.</P>
    <P>The DTA will be the regulatory body for taxi services in the Dublin area.  Matters such as the licensing of vehicles and drivers and the approval of maximum fares will be controlled by the Authority. Taxi services are part of the public transport system and should be consciously developed as such.  They should be an element in the overall traffic and transport strategy for Dublin.  Taxis should provide a flexible service to complement the bus services, for example, in the city centre areas to meet the needs of business people and shoppers particularly.  Such a <Col N="116" /> service, particularly if attractively priced, would make it easier for people to leave their cars at home.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the Authority will approve maximum taxi fares and also any change in CIE fares.  This Bill also provides that the Authority will control charges for public car parking, both on-street and off-street, in the Dublin area. The involvement of the National Prices Commission in settling these various transport-relation charges and fares will cease.  This is not a removal of price control, of course, but a transfer of that function to the Authority from the NPC. This is in view of the overall nature of the Authority's role in transport matters and in the interest of minimising the number of agencies required to be involved in those matters.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill sets out the traffic management functions of the Dublin Transport Authority.  The Authority will both devise traffic and parking measures and make by-laws to give effect to them. These functions have heretofore rested with the Garda Commissioner acting either on his own initiative or at the request of the local authority.  The Minister for the Environment's consent will be required for the Authority by-laws.  This will ensure the necessary degree of compatibility with the national &ldquo;rules-of-the-road&rdquo; regulations made by that Minister, and with other local traffic and parking by-laws throughout the country which will continue to be made by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The Authority will also regulate public car parks and roadworks under powers being provided in legislation for the first time.  The other important new power which is being provided in section 32 will enable the Authority, by means of bollards, to restrict, wholly or partly, the use of public roads by vehicles and, by means of road ramps, to restrict vehicle speeds on public roads.  This power will have particular relevance for controlling traffic in built-up areas and housing estates.</P>
    <P>This new power will be an extremely important one.  Unfortunately, due to the alarming growth of what has become known as joyriding, many residential <Col N="117" /> roads have become dangerous racetracks where life, limb and property are constantly endangered.  Moreover, with the growth of vehicular traffic, many motorists use residential roads as &ldquo;rat runs&rdquo; or short-cuts from one arterial road to another.  It will now be possible for the Dublin Transport Authority to decide, where appropriate and suitable, to make existing residential roads in whole or in part, into cul-de-sacs, by means of bollards.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this power will be warmly welcomed by many communities throughout the city as a means of making their roadways safe once again.  We are also providing power for the Authority to arrange, where suitable, for ramps on Dublin roads in order to inhibit joyriding or excessive speeds.</P>
    <P>The traffic warden service will be transferred to the Authority under section 15, but otherwise the Garda will continue to be responsible for traffic law enforcement.  The traffic and parking schemes will be implemented by the local authorities on behalf of the Authority with funds provided for by the latter.</P>
    <P>The objective of traffic management is to make the optimum use of the existing roads network for the movement of people and goods.  Traffic management is vitally important.  Traffic management works can yield significant returns, in terms of alleviating congestion, from relatively low levels of expenditure.  In 1986 £3 million approximately will be made available by the Exchequer for such works in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I will be looking to the Dublin Transport Authority to re-vamp and intensify the traffic management efforts of the task force, and to examine afresh existing traffic arrangements.  In particular, I wish to see the Authority develop a comprehensive parking strategy in favour of the short-stay parker, as against the all-day parker.  Such a strategy would embrace off-street and on-street spaces, charges, parking periods and types of parking controls and, in particular, effective measures against illegal parking.</P>
    <P>No traffic management strategy can succeed without proper enforcement. <Col N="118" /> The transfer of the traffic warden service to the DTA should result in a more effective and professional service.  The provisions of the Bill dealing with the transfer include guarantees against any worsening of the wardens' pre-transfer pay, conditions of service and superannuation entitlements. I would like to see the development of a supervisory structure for the Dublin traffic warden service which would improve efficiency and also provide incentives for advancement for the traffic wardens.  The Garda too, I feel, could step up their traffic law enforcement efforts considerably, notwithstanding the many higher priority demands that are made on them.</P>
    <P>In addition to the specific functions I have outlined, the DTA will have the general functions under section 8 of the Bill of ensuring, in so far as they can, the proper planning and efficient operation of road and rail transport in their functional area and of promoting and engaging in public education and research related to road and rail transport. There should be no overlap or duplication between the education and research functions of the Authority and functions of An Foras Forbartha and the National Road Safety Associations, and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>The maximum penalties for offences under the Bill when enacted are set out in section 53.  The actual penalty imposed in any case will, of course, be a matter for the court.  Maximum penalties of £1,000 and/or one year's imprisonment on summary conviction, or £50,000 and/or five years' imprisonment on conviction on indictment, are provided for in respect of three types of offence.  These are unauthorised disclosure of information by a member or employee of the Authority, failure of an Authority member or employee to disclose a beneficial interest in matters being dealt with by the Authority, and unauthorised roadworks.  The maximum penalties provided for in these cases are high, but rightly so I believe, in view of the potentially very serious nature of the offences.</P>
    <P>Section 53 also provides that the same penalties as apply under the Road Traffic <Col N="119" /> Acts for the country as a whole will apply to other offences under the Bill, namely breaches of the Authority's by-laws under sections 31 and 36.  Under section 44 of the Bill, the levels of the fines-on-the-spot imposed for parking offences will continue to be set in regulations made by the Minister for the Environment.  He is currently reviewing the levels of these fines.</P>
    <P>As far as the Authority's running costs are concerned, the Bill provides for financing of the Authority by the Exchequer, and that staff numbers and salary levels will be subject to ministerial control, in the interests of economy and efficiency.  I can, if necessary, avail of the flexibility provided by the commencement provisions of the Bill to assign functions to the Authority on a phased basis.  I can assure the House that the Authority will be a lean and fit body. With this approach, the running costs of the DTA will not be permitted to exceed £400,000 in their first full year of operation. This figure is net of the costs of the traffic warden service, the transfer of which will merely result in a re-allocation of Exchequer funds between the Vote of the Garda Commissioner and that of my Department.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions of the staff of the Authority will be analogous to the terms and conditions of staff in the local authority service.  I am hopeful that the Authority will be able to select staff among existing competent and experienced public service personnel.  This should enable some offsetting staff savings in other local bodies, but, at this stage, it is not possible to quantify the likely level of such savings.  After their first year of operation, the staffing of the Authority will be reviewed in the light of experience, and in the light of any additional functions which might be given to them and of their capacity to bring about worthwhile savings to the Exchequer or to the community.</P>
    <P>It is very clear now that traffic and transport problems in Dublin are currently imposing massive hidden costs on industry, public transport and private <Col N="120" /> motorists and will continue to do so until the problems are properly tackled.  I am convinced that the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority, with the comprehensive range of functions and powers contained in this Bill, is the way in which to tackle those problems.  I am confident that the benefits which will accrue to the Exchequer and to the community from the establishment of the Authority will greatly exceed their costs. I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Let me say at the very outset that I am rather shocked and horrified that even at this stage in this Bill we have not had the common courtesy of the Minister's speech.  I am not one who has recourse to the other House to get memos or to get inspiration from what is said there but any Bill arriving in this House should have with it, by way of the normal courtesy that has always been applied in this House, a copy of the Minister's speech, at least for the Opposition spokesman.  I still have not had that courtesy. We are talking about the Department of Communications who have failed even to bring across a photostat of the Minister's speech to this House.  I am rather disappointed and disgusted at it.  I protest in the strongest possible form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter we are talking about it might be worthwhile to raise another aspect.  When I was in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as it was known then, we allowed the Front Bench spokesman in the Dáil a prior knowledge of what we were going to talk about so that they could investigate the issue and prepare for the debate.  There was nothing wrong with that.  I always ensured that Deputy Deasy, the present <Col N="121" /> Minister for Agriculture, who was then the spokesman opposite me in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was extended the courtesy of having a look at the speech.  It was an agreed courtesy where he could have at least the opportunity of understanding what we were trying to do.  Regardless of whether there might be criticism of or praise for the issue in question, my opposite number had advance notice of my speech.  I have no copy to refer to.  I know it may not be his function to provide a copy but it is his responsibility at the end of the day.  I am rather disturbed about it because this House has been under much threat and much abuse, particularly from outside it, and especially over the past weekend.</P>
      <P>The Minister can see the condition of the House we are in.  We had here yesterday evening, a motion providing for moving us out to the annex in order to have this Chamber brought back into condition.  Senators in general are being hit at a very difficult time.  I make those remarks and I will say no more about it. I will try and manage without a copy of the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this Bill before the House, dates back to March 1980, when the MacCormac report or the report of the Transport Consultative Commission was presented to the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  I recollect quite clearly the rapidity of his response at that time.  The Government acted on what was then and what still is on many occasions, a chaotic situation in this city.  I remember distinctly the Government, three weeks after that report being presented to them, moving on it.  They moved in two ways.  They accepted in full the recommendations within that MacCormac report and, secondly, they acted on it by setting up the task force to try to resolve as quickly as possible the short term projections to give a reasonable flow of traffic in this city, if my memory serves me correctly, under the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Transport, Mr. Fitzpatrick. I remember that there was a great response at the time to this report.  This report said many things.  The general <Col N="122" /> summary of that report is something that we should skim through before we talk about this Bill.</P>
    <P>May I comment further before I do that?  It is a long time since the autumn of 1980.  We are now in the supposed summer of 1986 and I am rather disappointed that it took so long for the Minister to act.  Six years was a long time to leave the recommendations of that report standing there with nothing operating but the task force.  I do take exception to the remark in the Minister's speech today that the task force is now obsolete.  The task force was meant to be obsolete a long time ago.  It was only a response to try to give immediate relief to a very pertinent problem around this city at that time.  It was never intended to be in operation up to 1986.  At the longest it was envisaged to be in operation until 1984 because there was only a certain amount of work the task force could do. They did that.  I would like to compliment them, particularly the chairman, Mr. Fitzpatrick, for the wonderful work they did around this city in giving immediate relief.</P>
    <P>In the general summary of the MacCormac or the Transport Consultative Commission report to the Minister for Transport in 1980, the objectives are clearly outlined.  There are references to the problems, to the transportation authority, to the short term strategy, to a new deal for the Dublin city bus service, to taxis and private bus operators, to enforcement of regulations, to environmental aspects and to rapid rail transit and the roads.</P>
    <P>On page 9, paragraph 1.4, of the report, outlines the three main factors creating the problems as follows:</P>
    <P>We were satisfied that the lack of action was in large measure, a consequence of the varying statutory functions and responsibilities of the three bodies most directly concerned, CIE with responsibility for public transport, the local authorities, with responsibility for road construction <Col N="123" /> and implementation of traffic management schemes and the Gardaí with statutory responsibility for road traffic matters and for enforcement of road traffic regulations.</P>
    <P>They went on to say:</P>
    <P>The three bodies report to three different Ministers, the Ministers for Transport, the Environment and Justice and there is no integrated or co-ordinated assessment, planning or implementation of measures, short term or long term, which would improve transportation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The pinpointed the main problem but it also pinpointed the main frustrations. The report outlined what was needed for this Authority.  What they regarded as a fitting Authority, a Dublin city transport Authority, is certainly not what we see in this Bill today.  Pressures were put on the Minister by the Department of the Environment because they were losing control of the road schemes and CIE, who were to be an agent of the transport Authority, are not an agent now.  In fact, the transport Authority are an agent of CIE.  The pressures brought to bear on the Minister and the Government have won.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill without teeth.  The headings of the Bill are the same but the contents are reversed.  The Bill is way off course from what I expected it to be.  It does not have the provision for a proper Authority in this city.  The Department of the Environment will still be responsible for all road networks, planning and so on.</P>
    <P>Taxi services are mentioned in the Bill. It is proposed that the co-ordinating of all these services will be done by the authority.  I understood from the MacCormac report that the Authority would distribute out responsibility for these services in the form of agencies.</P>
    <P>The functions of the Dublin Transport Authority are outlined in page 44 of the report where it is stated:</P>
    <P>We concluded that what is required is an agency with overall responsibility <Col N="124" /> for ensuring the integrated planning and operation of transportation in the three administrative areas in the Dublin region, an agency which would be the channel for submissions to Government of all plans and budget proposals in relation to Dublin transportation, an agency which would be responsible for supervising the release of all Government funds for transportation in the Dublin area and for monitoring the expenditure of such funds.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of that in the Bill. The reason is that the Department of the Environment fighting out of their own corner, stuck to their guns and were not giving any of their functions to the Authority.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>...an agency with responsibility for co-ordinating traffic management in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We see what happened to that.  CIE are no longer an agent of the Authority, rather the Authority are an agent of CIE. That is where the festering problem will remain.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>...an agency with public education, promotional and research responsibilities in relation to transportation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is part of that aspect written into the Bill.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>...an agency with responsibilities in relation to the licensing of road passenger and taxi services in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>At that time a number of scavengers were working with licence plates at Dublin Airport.  They called themselves taxi operators.  They did untold damage to visitors at that time.  The MacCormac report highlighted that problem.  Therefore they were saying that the then licensing authority were not doing their job properly.  What they were allowing happen was to the detriment of a very fine profession in this city.  That matter has been put right.  It was a problem that <Col N="125" /> was highlighted at the time by the task force.  It was brought to the attention of the Carriage Office who took steps to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I recall an outcry at that time from the present Minister in regard to the matter. He was urging that something be done to deal with the problem.  Only a very small number, perhaps 2 or 3 per cent of licence holders were involved in that abuse.</P>
    <P>Today's taxi services may be expensive but at least we know the system is not being abused.</P>
    <P>The MacCormac report recommended that the structure of the Dublin Transport Authority should be a policy making board, named the Authority, that there should be a managerial board termed the executive board and that there should be a full time staff of the Authority reporting to a chief executive. This is not what is happening.  The then Government accepted the MacCormac report but the present Government have wandered along way from it.  Paragraph 5.8.5, page 50 of the report states:</P>
    <P>We would envisage the Authority, acting in effect as a Board of Directors, being concerned with board policy questions and laying down guidelines for the operation of the DTA.  In accordance with such guidelines, the Executive Board, meeting perhaps weekly, would effectively manage the normal business of the body.  We would envisage the Executive Board being comprised of, say, five members.  As well as the Chief Executive who would chair the Board, membership might include the City County Manager, a senior official of CIE, an Assistant Garda Commissioner and a senior executive of the DTA.</P>
    <P>Maybe I am misreading the Bill &mdash; and I do not want to misinterpret it &mdash; but I do not see anything in the Bill to provide for that function as envisaged by the MacCormac report.  When the Minister and the Government yielded to the pressures of the Department of the Environment, Dublin County Council and other authorities in the city, all the good envisaged in that report was lost.  We are now setting <Col N="126" /> up another type of an assembly which can be blamed publicly and will degenerate into bureaucracy and will not have a strong and proper organisation.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe &mdash; maybe I am misguided that the battles for power within the Departments were lost by the Minister. The Department most responsible for that was the Department of the Environment.  They failed in the past and continue to fail.  We have an authority now who have no teeth.  We are going to have a situation in Dublin where instead of business resuming and a thriving business community being built up there will be chaos with nobody able to co-ordinate or do much about transport other than produce press releases as to what should or might be done.</P>
    <P>I distinctly remember when it would take one hour to get from Lucan to the inner city.  I am sure anyone coming into the city at that time blasphemed profusely at the delays in going from A to B, particularly on the western road.  If business returned to the same level as it was then, we would have exactly the same problem or probably a worse one.</P>
    <P>There are a few other questions I would like to ask.  We are as the Minister rightly said, dealing with other Bills in the other House and here.  We hope to deal with the Bill on the re-organisation of CIE next week.  Envisaged in the MacCormac report was the Dublin city transport service. DART was mentioned many times in that report.  It envisaged Dublin city services but they included DART as an integral part of the whole operational situation.  There will, of course, be a Bill coming in soon &mdash; Committee Stage will be reached next week &mdash; which will be doing exactly the opposite to what the Dublin Transport Authority wants.  The legislation we are dealing with next week regarding the re-organisation of CIE is doing absolutely the opposite to what was envisaged in this report of Professor MacCormac.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask another question. There was much controversy at that time concerning the diesel and bus service to Tallaght and such places.  Mention was <Col N="127" /> made of it today has the Minister discussed the proposals he outlined today with CIE.  Has he personally taken up this matter with CIE and has he any proposals or plans to ease the traffic congestion in that area?  This is an important issue.</P>
    <P>I believe it was envisaged that the board would be larger, if my memory serves me right, in the original Bill prepared by the Fianna Fáil administration. The number of members was increased from nine to 12.</P>
    <P>I like the last phrase about how the Minister will appoint members to the board.  He outlines three or four necessary ingredients concerning the functions and experience of board members and ends with the beautiful phrase that they will be experienced in those fields and &ldquo;other relevant matters&rdquo;.  We know what they are.  We know the intepretation of the Minister for Communications for &ldquo;other relevant matters&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>His history is well known. The only reason this Bill is before this House is to fulfil that statement by the Minister that those people will be appointed to the board with those qualifications and other relevant ones.  Apart from that, I cannot envisage this new Authority as being of any use in the future. It has not got the &ldquo;bite&rdquo; where it should have it, for example, in planning and in the expenditure of major road work funds around the city or with CIE.  It is only proper and right that CIE would run and organise the transport of this city.  The trouble is that CIE will do as they wish and not as the Dublin Transport Authority would wish.  Therein lies a major problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly, when this Government are forgotten about, after the forthcoming general election, and when this city returns to the thriving community that it used to be prior to their arrival, we will go back to the same chaotic traffic situation, with congestion, blockages, uprooting of the streets all over if not by Dublin Gas, <Col N="128" /> by Dublin County Council or Dublin Corporation. We shall have all the hazards that we know about and all the unco-ordination.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not adhere to Professor MacCormac's report and stick with it.  Had he done that and only then, he would have proved to me and to the public in Dublin City that the report was a most valid proposition and contained strong recommendations to resolve the major traffic problems of this city.  I will not go through the Bill now section by section as we may leave that to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed by the Minister, who I know understands the complications of the city, allowing us to be put into this situation by introducing a Bill today which I believe cannot resolve the problems. The Bill will have very little significance to anybody except those 12 members who are to be appointed to the board.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to join in the Minister's apology about the speech.  It is appropriate that Members of the House should have it in good time. I am sorry about the delay: I have only received a copy myself.  I listened to the Minister and tried to absorb what he was saying as it is a major speech on an important piece of legislation.  No matter what reservations one might have about individual sections, the concept of an overall transport Authority for the city of Dublin is to be welcomed.  It was almost inevitable that an Authority such as this would come into being particularly having regard to the report from the task force that Senator Killilea has referred to.  This Authority will replace the Dublin Transport Task Force which was a non-statutory body set up only to make recommendations.  It is the duty of Government to look at recommendations, not necessarily to accept them in total, and finally, consider, the overall problems and see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to set up the task force and it is important to have regard to what they have said.  It is also important that the Government should govern and respond by way of legislation and this is what they have done.  It may not be the be-all and end-all of everything that we want.  The Bill was amended in the other House and it could be subject to amendment here and rightly so but it is important that we take account of the findings of the task force.  The task force pinpointed some problems within the transport system in the city but there are so many different bodies involved in the regulation of transport in the city that it is appropriate that we would have an overall statutory Authority with representation on it from the various interested bodies &mdash; CIE, and certainly the local authorities.  Like myself, Senator Killilea is a member of a local authority and I want to defend their right to have an input into matters that affect them and their budgeting.  If anything reflects the budgeting of local authorities it is transport policy particularly as it can create tremendous demands on the financial resources of local authorities.  For that reason I am pleased, to say the least, that there will be local authority representatives on it.  I would even go so far as to say there should be more on it because 50 per cent of the decisions of this Authority will have an impact on the local authority and on the infrastructure that it provides and particularly when any movement one makes regarding the regulation of transport within an urban area has such an impact on everyone else in the city, whether they are business people or citizens. It is important that in considering <Col N="130" /> the impact the reorganisation of transport in an urban area would have all those problems taken into account.</P>
      <P>The Minister in publishing his Green Paper on transport policy, which is a major document and one I would like to commend the Minister on, has pinpointed many of the areas that for years have been neglected by many Governments in this country and that is the whole range of transport facilities whether it is land, sea or air.  Addressing ourselves to this particular urban transportation problem is something that should commend itself to the House and to Members of it.  In quoting from the Green Paper produced by the Minister on urban transport problems he says in section 4.</P>
      <P>While every city is unique in its character, local geography and communications needs, urban traffic problems tend to have a common structure.  As cities grow in size and affluence the population tends to spread outwards into increasingly dispersed suburbs. Traffic growth places a considerable burden on the capacity of the road network, especially where a city lacks the road network necessary to divert through-traffic (particularly commercial vehicles) away from the city centres. Traffic problems in cities tend to be most acute at peak commuting hours, but off-peak traffic problems tend to arise according as short-stay parking accommodation becomes eroded by the parking of commuter cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that section sums up in total what has happened to this city.  A few moments ago we had visitors from the city of Boston, Massachusetts.  Boston was the first city in the world to have an underground system and that underground system, old as it is, is today probably one of the most efficient in the world.  It still operates efficiently and is widely used by 85 per cent of the commuters in Boston who can go about their business in a very quick, efficient and cheap manner.  We should not leave it too late to address the <Col N="131" /> problem of the possibility of an underground system in this city which would be in line with its prospects for future development.  It is not too many years ago that the city of Brussels had to address the problem and have now come to grips with it and have installed a very modern underground city transport system.  I am mentioning these for the Minister's interest, that we should not rule out that in the future if we are really to tackle the problem of urban traffic and congestion it would have to be considered that an underground system is a possibility.  It would be expensive from a capital point of view but certainly it would be economic taking account of future running needs and future overall costings from management to maintenance.  The extended usage would be very popular and would eventually justify the capital investment of putting in an underground system.</P>
    <P>Commuting from the suburbs, it is said in section 4.2 of the Green Paper, tends to be increasingly based on cars partly from choice and partly because the public transport system fails, or is unable, to provide a sufficiently attractive alternative. Public transport problems can arise from both external and internal sources. increasing car use and poorer services resulting from increased traffic congestion adversely affect the numbers using public transport.  There are times in the city when we see buses lined up behind one another because they are unable to move forward and it was only with the introduction of city bus lanes that any real movement took place in getting buses from one side of the city to the other.  Unfortunately, as more people opt to use their cars congestion increases and this reduces the effectiveness of public transport even further.  The failure of the public transport system to provide a flexible, reliable and attractive service can also adversely affect patronage levels.</P>
    <P>In the Bill itself we have sections which deal with the possible membership of the Authority.  I welcome the fact that it would incorporate members of local <Col N="132" /> authorities because of their input as the providers of the road network.  Anything that is done by way of reorganising transport or ensuring that there is an efficient transport system will have a direct bearing on local authorities.  I notice also that the Minister envisages the maximum number of members as 12 to be appointed by him by virtue of their experience and he hopes that there will be not more than four members of the authorities in the area of the local authorities or new restructured local authorities in Dublin. Members would also, I hope, include some who are presently on the board of Coras Iompar Éireann and other interested people.  Apart from the remarks of Senator Killilea there are people in all parties who have an interest in public transport and I would say particularly that the trade union movement should be represented on this Authority as they have a contribution to make.  In a moment I will quote some of the submissions they have made in this regard.</P>
    <P>Could I just draw the Minister's attention to section 16 of the Bill which mentions membership of the Authority in relation to the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly members who have been nominated to contest Seanad elections.  I did not think that we would have further legislation which would contain the same clauses as have been contained in past legislation relating to membership, or nominated membership of this House.  I hope that the Minister when he looks at this will see that all other legislation which contains this provision has already been amended, the Dentists' Bill, the Nurses' Bill and a more recent Bill.  Certainly three Bills under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Health have been changed because they contained a clause which precluded members who were nominated to Seanad Éireann or to contest Seanad Éireann.  They were amended on the basis that candidates could be nominated without their knowledge or approval and one could thus ensure that they could not take their place on a particular board.  I hope the Minister can change section 16 accordingly in line with the agreement we have in this House <Col N="133" /> about changes to meet the particular, special procedure for nominating Seanad candidates as opposed to the other House.</P>
    <P>The Authority will deal with all areas of traffic &mdash; road traffic, rail, buses, taxis, traffic wardens and all involved in traffic management.  It would be inappropriate to allow this occasion to pass without a special word of praise for DART which has received widespread favourable comment from users.  It is certainly something that should be considered for extension where appropriate because there is no doubt in my mind that since its inception, despite all the people who were inclined to knock it in the beginning, it has proven itself by popular use.  I hope sincerely that the possibility of extending it will be considered actively by the Minister and his Department.  This Bill which will establish the Authority is at present before us and we hope that with whatever agreement we can reach on it and the amendments that the Minister might consider, it will soon be up and running effectively so that we can co-ordinate the whole transport system within this city. That will include, planning and funding. In that regard I would join Senator Killilea in suggesting that a figure of £400,000 would certainly not be enough if we felt the Authority was to have some direction in its planning because planning involves funding and I feel that it is an area that we should leave open to suggestions in the future if this Authority is to do some of the things that we would like it to do.</P>
    <P>The traffic management will also be under its jurisdiction and in this regard consultations will have to take place with the Garda authorities and other people who are responsible for law enforcement. The trade union movement have reservations about it but I must say that first of all they welcome the Bill if only because it is better than no body with overall responsibility for traffic management. So, let us at least compliment the Minister on making an effort to have some authority that would be responsible for overall transport management.</P>
    <P>In a submission to the Minister from the Irish Transport Union which is my <Col N="134" /> own union, on page 6 referring to urban transport, it states that bus lanes and more effective implementation of parking controls in Dublin have helped to improve traffic flow.  However, it says, the proposed Dublin Transport Authority which is still to be set up is a disappointment largely because it lacks teeth where it matters most and that is financially. That is also the comment of Senator Killilea.  It will only have a consultative role on transport funding instead of controlling the budget of Dublin city services, the traffic departments of the four local authorities, etc.  As I say, they said it is welcome only because it provides something that is not there and which is needed.  It is hoped that the Dublin Transport Authority will have trade union representation on it.  I have mentioned that on the basis of having local authority representation, possibly CIE representation, it is appropriate that there should be trade union representation also.</P>

      <P>In view of the present position of the dispute between the agricultural officers and the Department of the Public Service which has disrupted all agricultural production in this country, I feel that the House should give time to debate this urgent matter.

      <P>This is a difficult situation.  Senator Ellis raised this matter here this morning when the Seanad sat. Prior to that, two minutes before that, I <Col N="135" /> had told Senator Killilea I would take his motion on the Adjournment.  If I take Senator Ellis's motion now as a matter of urgent importance I cannot take Senator Killilea's.  I am going to leave it to somebody else to decide because five Senators have to stand.  If five Senators stand up I will take Senator Ellis's motion.  If five Senators do not stand up, I will then take the matter Senator Killilea wishes to raise.  It is an unfortunate situation. Naturally, I am sorry for Senator Killilea because if Senator Ellis had mentioned this to myself or any of the officials before we came in, we would not have given the commitment to Senator Killilea.</P>

      <P>I am a democratically elected Member of this House, like every other Senator and we all have our rights. I have abided by the rules of this House consistently and persistently since the first day I came here.  I have never tried in any way to do anything other than by the norm.  I had raised a matter here before concerning the Letterfrack group water scheme.  It happened on the day of the Chernobyl disaster.  Again, we had this major problem and I was hijacked and thrown outside the door with my proposal.  Chernobyl was a terrible disaster and I must admit that the disaster that my follow Senators here on this side of the House are talking about today is also a major disaster.  It shows that this most inept Government we have is not performing its duties in a correct and <Col N="137" /> proper way.  I want to endorse what my colleagues have asked for in the sense that what they are seeking is absolutely correct.</P>
      <P>I came to Dublin in the normal way this week.  I had a matter of major importance &mdash; a most particular and peculiar amalgamation of a school in my adjoining parish, which has eight school teachers in it.  I asked for conformation to allow amalgamation which the former Minister, Deputy Donal Creed, told me about this time last year would proceed in 1985. If that Government had worked properly in 1985, as was promised to me and as is reported in the Official Report of this House, that amalgamation of the Currandulla National School would have taken place.  As they did with the farming community, they did not do their job.  This week I am beseeching again through the normal channel.  I have a motion on the Adjournment of major importance to the community I represent.  I do my best to represent them.</P>

Motions on the Adjournment are not, generally speaking, matters of grave public urgency. They are matters of local importance.</P>

      <P>There is a need for a total overhaul of the procedures of this House.  The sooner all the procedures of this House are gone into the better.  I would suggest that at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this item be dealt with.  The inference is that the Whip or I should raise the matter.  It is not a matter for the Whip of this party or any party to raise.  It is a matter for the House.</P>
      <P>What happened here today just shows that this House has not been able to deal with matters of urgency and matters of normal business under the Adjournment procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the recent media attention to this House has been very bad.  Possibly <Col N="146" /> one of the reasons is that the regulations under which we operate are outdated. We should have a question time here so that matters can be dealt with on a daily basis when the House sits and that matters such as the matter raised by Senator Ellis today, can be dealt with as matters of urgency.  There should not be any suggestion that because Standing Order 29 is brought in that does away with the motion on the Adjournment.  It should not happen.  We must address ourselves to these problems.</P>

    <Title>Dublin Transport Authority Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was dealing with the Bill this morning I was quoting from a document submitted to the Minister in response to his Green Paper on Transport Policy.  The document was submitted by the Irish Transport and General Workers Union.  This is a very responsible union. Many of its members are involved in the transportation services in the city and working within CIE.</P>
      <P>On page 30 of the Green Paper it stated that the so-called &ldquo;deregulation&rdquo; of bus services has not worked well in Britain and has led to poorer services, increased fares and cessation of certain services. The Congress went on to say that they were opposed to the proposals for an inner tangent ring for Dublin because the union favoured public transport over private transport.  They say that a good public transport system would encourage people to leave their cars at home.  I refer to that type of internal transportation within the city.  If we could address ourselves to that problem &mdash; I hope this new Authority will address that problem &mdash; we could make a major contribution to ensuring that the city service runs efficiently and to the satisfaction of people who want to get to and from work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The union went on to point out the success of the DART.  The success of the DART is proof of what people can do in the transport service.  The tangent ring <Col N="147" /> will and indeed, clearly has already destroyed parts of the inner city, forcing people and businesses out of many of the existing areas.  It will encourage more use of cars and will further lead to traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>The union want to point out to those with a bookkeeper mentality that the cost of the inner tangent road will probably far exceed the cost of extending the DART to Tallaght.  It is recognised that much of the cost has already been incurred, particularly the social costs but it is not too late to stop the lunatic policy of destroying the inner city, people's homes, businesses and public transport.</P>
    <P>The union go on to say that bookkeepers with their narrow vision, refer only to the financial cost of the DART.</P>
    <P>I said this morning that there was criticism. But the efficiency of the service and the welcome it has received from its users will contradict most of the criticism.  It is worth pointing out, the union says, that much of this infrastructural spending will last a long time and will have to be undertaken anyway in the future because of the huge growth in Dublin's population which is one of the fastest growing cities in Europe and that we have to do something about it.  When compared with the cost of major road improvements, such as the Naas by-pass or the Templeogue-Tallaght road, its price per kilometre is not high.</P>
    <P>Other regions have suffered, as a result of this extraordinary development in Dublin city.  My own region, the south-east region, has suffered, particularly Waterford city, which is the main city in the south-east region.  There are proposals from SERDO to the Government on how we, in that region, feel.  It is that the other regions should not be neglected.  It is our belief that Dublin should not be developed at the expense of the rest of the country.  If we put everything we have into the Dublin city area, the rest of the country will be attracted to that centre. That is very bad for the infrastructure of the region.  It is very bad for the economic development of the regions.  I hope the Minister and the Government will bear this in mind when talking about a redistribution <Col N="148" /> of some of the development that is taking place.</P>
    <P>I look forward to increased industrial development throughout the regions as opposed to having it all centred in Dublin.  Many problems are created, particularly problems in the area of transport. The Irish Transport and General Workers' Union at its annual conference called for the extension of DART to Tallaght and other parts of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4.2.3 of the Green Paper indicates that the DART might not be extended.  I am making a case that because of its success the Government should seriously consider extending it.  I would hope that this transport authority will also look at the necessity of having such a service extended.</P>
    <P>The union feel that the Green Paper should be a discussion document.  They hoped that because of some of the comments contained in it that it would not pre-empt discussion.  The union would challenge the cost of extending the DART which has been mentioned as being in the region of £750 million.  The union contend that that is a grossly exaggerated figure for the development of what is a tremendous service.  If the DART service was extended and there was integrated rapid transport system, the numbers of passengers using any one section would increase.</P>
    <P>Dublin has a lower population density than many European cities apart from its astronomical growth now.  This is cited against the extension of the DART system together with the cost of the first phase &mdash; the Howth to Bray line.  However, even New York and Stockholm and other lower density cities than Dublin had extensive rail systems.  Furthermore, of the £114 million cost of the DART £10 million was recouped in VAT, £16 million recouped from the European Community and £27 million went in rolled up interest.  The Government might consider what the unions say is a cheaper, lighter rapid rail system when they are extending the DART.  However, in the meantime diesels should be run on existing urban lines.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that there have been <Col N="149" /> some improvements in the control of city centre parking in recent years, the Irish Transport Union believe that that is not enough.  Now that this Dublin Transport Authority Bill comes under discussion in both Houses of the Oireachtas, it should be established as quickly as possible in the manner is which the Minister indicates and in accordance with the suggestions which this House will make to ensure that there will be a properly planned development of transport within the city.  There must be vigorous control of city centre parking with total metering between the canals to guarantee business people parking for limited periods only and future surplus carparks should be curtailed combined with an extended DART and bus service.  This carrot and stick approach should greatly improve the movement of people within the city.</P>
    <P>The union welcomes the Dublin ring-road which will draw traffic away from the city centre and facilitate its flow around the city.  It also urges that access to our ports will be improved.  Anybody who has an interest in the infrastructural development of a major city like Dublin, would try to ensure that proper access to the ports, particularly for heavy articulated container traffic, should be made available.  That is where the demands would be made on the local authorities, who would have a statutory role in the provision of such roads.</P>
    <P>The Dublin city bus service receives one of the lowest subsidies, the union says, compared to most European cities. The union believe that fares in Dublin City are too high.  It urges that fares be cut and that the subsidy be increased on Dublin city services to make up any deficit and to pay for the expanded service which will be needed.</P>
    <P>Nobody who favoured public transport especially in urban areas could oppose increasing the subsidy to the Dublin city services which was less than 20 per cent of its revenue in 1984.  That compared very poorly with the 50 per cent subsidy given to London Transport or the 60 per cent or 80 per cent subsidies which were given to other city operators.</P>
    <P>I hope that when we are dealing with <Col N="150" /> the Bill section by section we will be able to point out to the Minister some of the problems that may arise out of it.  I must certainly commend the Minister not alone on this Bill but on the whole transport policy to which he addresses himself. He has done more in this area than many of his predecessors.  When an attempt is being made to do something, naturally there will be people who want to make suggestions and people who will oppose what the Minister is trying to do.  Overall, there will be a consensus among all of us who have an interest in developing our transport system throughout the country, not alone in Dublin City, but at least the Minister is addressing himself to the problem.  It is a matter for both Houses to assist the Minister to bring to fruition legislation which will deal with various sections of the restructuring that is needed in CIE, and, indeed, this Authority that the Minister wants to put in charge of the total transport system within the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>This is a major piece of legislation.  I hope that the Minister will take on board my suggestions on section 16 regarding the membership of this House and particularly in regard to those who are nominated to contest membership of this House, that in the process of nominaiton they would not be discriminatied against in the formulation of this legislation.  By so doing, we should adopt the same attitude as we did to previous legislation which took account of this peculiar situation regarding being nominated to contest the Seanad election.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope the Minister will deal with some of the points that have been raised from this side of the House and, indeed, from the Opposition side.  Senator Killilea obviously has quite an interest in this legislation and had an interest in quoting from the report of the task force which was set up.  I note that, when this Authority is in place, it will supersede the task force who have done a useful job while they were there but who had no statutory powers.  This Authority will have statutory powers and for that reason will have some &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; to be able to address the problems.  I hope that <Col N="151" /> the financial arrangements, which are being made to fund this, will be sufficient and if not, that if they need additional financing to run the business in the way we want them to run it, he will be favourably disposed to concede that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The very useful explanatory memorandum which we got in connection with this Bill starts off by telling us that the Bill provides for the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority for the purpose of improving the planning and operation of road and rail transport and the management of traffic in the Dublin area.  It is something with which we would all have to agree right across party lines irrespective of whatever allegiance we might have.</P>
      <P>From that point of view, I welcome the Bill.  The success of the Bill cannot, of course, be judged form the extent of the Bill as we see it before us complicated as it appears to be.  Only time will tell whether the Bill has been a success or not.  It is very difficult to look into the future and see the type of developments that will take place and be prepared for them.  In that regard and to that extent the Bill will be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, we are dealing with the re-organisation of CIE, which is another important aspect in the transport area, and underlines the importance of this whole area at present.  The motor car has had a very big impact on society.  It could be claimed that to a large extent planning rotates around the motor car rather than around people.  While, of course, the car has been of benefit and a great leap forward, it presents considerable problems.  Planning in this respect is not confined to urban areas but also involves rural Ireland where people commute from houses in the rural area to urban areas, and this is possible only because of the car.  To that extent, the local authorities have problems with regard to the infrastructure in the provision of raods, telephone communications, water and sewerage facilities in all of these areas.  From another point of view, people living in the country find <Col N="152" /> the running of a car expensive and some families may need two cars.  This extra expense leads to demands for wages.  It is tied up in a whole sociological problem which is a very large area.  Of course, we are only dealing with the traffic problem in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area the problem has grown over the years.  For those of us who look back, it is easy to identify the problem and see it growing.  I realise that great efforts have been made to deal with the problem but nevertheless it seems that to some extent the problem was solved simply by the provision of traffic lights.  They are encroaching further into the country and I believe that instead of solving the problem they have in many cases helped to make it more severe.  I have not been out of this country very often, unfortunately, but on the few occasions that I have been abroad I have wondered at the flow of traffic in other cities, particularly in London, as compared with Dublin.  There seems to be an easy flow of traffic and I am sure this would be due to good organisation and experience gained over a long time but there must be more to it than that.  I am sure the Minister considered details of traffic organisation in cities abroad and had the benefit of these studies.  That fluid movement that prevails in London should be possible in Dublin also.</P>
    <P>One of the things I noticed in London was that the traffic lights caused shorter delays.  The lights seem to change more often and there is less of a hold up at them.  This in itself seems to help with the movement of traffic.  Of course there is the underground rail system in London. Perhaps Dublin is too small for that sort of system but in any event underground rail is a very important part of London transport.  The movement of traffic in the streets seems so easy in London.  I am sure the same could be achieved in this city as a result of this Bill in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>When I approached this Bill I found the Green Paper on Transport Policy which was published in November 1985.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Col N="153" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move under Standing Order No. 29 that the House be adjourned to debate the following matter: the present position of the dispute between agricultural officers and the Department of the Public Service which has disrupted all agricultural production within the country.</P>
      <P>It is not with any great joy that any of us has witnessed the coming about of the impasse between the agricultural officers and the Department of the Public Service which has led to the strike that has been in force since Tuesday evening and also with regard to the escalation which is to take place as and from finishing time Thursday evening.  It is only fiar that we should as Members of the House debate the matter.  It caused some concern to one of my colleagues that his motion on the Adjournment had to be waived so that this matter might be taken, but I think he also recognises the extent of the damage that is being done to the agricultural industry at the moment.</P>
      <P>If anybody looks at the farming scene they will see that farmers are going through their toughest time ever in the history of the State.  They do not need any disruption of the method of disposal of their produce and I feel that we, as Members of the Seanad should ask the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister of State to go back and sit down and talk with the unions.  We should appeal also to the union's leadership, in view of the crisis they have caused, to sit down with the Minister for the Public Service and try to resolve this matter.  In doing so they would be showing both sides a gesture of good faith so far as the problem is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to maintain order the Minister has introduced members of the Army to carry out certain functions of departmental officers.  I suppose this has escalated the strike and escalated the resolve of certain members of the union with regard to bringing the strike to a head.  If we study it from the farmers' point of view, which I feel is the most important end at <Col N="154" /> present, the loss to farmers will be quite considerable if this strike is allowed continue. The loss and damage to the meat processing industry will be considerable also.  Many firms are committed to fulfilling contracts from Ireland on a weekly basis.  If they do not fulfil their contracts they will be fulfilled from other sources and the net result will be long term losses to the farmers which they will not be in a position to recoup anywhere along the line and particularly not in the immediate future.  The reputation of Irish suppliers of meat will be seriously affected right across the market places of Europe and especially in the UK.  The consequential loss to farmers will be quite considerable. The graders who are the principal people who have gone on strike, carry out a very important function.  They are the people who are responsible for the grading of livestock in our factories.  They are also the people who are responsible for the stamping of carcases for intervention and for export to the UK, in the matter of subsidies such as variable premiums.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not seem to be aware of the damage that will be done. Remember that once animals become over ready and over fat there is a consequential loss of enormous proportion to the farmers.  Every animal that misses the grade is a loss with regard to beef of 10p a pound approximately to the farmer.  It is also a loss with regard to premiums which they would receive on the meat leaving Ireland.</P>
    <P>The same applies with regard to our lamb exports which will be affected as and from tomorrow evening.  Remember that we are targeting our sheep and lamb production at the French market, a market which is very particular with regard to carcase quality and weight. There is no way farmers can stop animals from putting on weight and the net result will be that farmers will again be forced to take reduced prices for both their sheep and cattle which are going to be delayed from being slaughtered as a result of this strike.  The Minister must have been aware of this strike for quite some time.  He should not have allowed a breakdown in negotiations.  More resolve <Col N="155" /> and firmness on the part of the Minister for the Public Service would have resulted in this matter being ironed out round the bargaining table rather than being ironed out by means of a strike.</P>
    <P>We should remember also that 12 per cent of Ireland's production is from agriculture. That production is now being seriously affected and the loss to the Irish economy will be considerable in the next few weeks.  An amount of £2.5 million is involved in the dispute.  We are all led to believe that there had been an agreement between the officers concerned and the Department of the Public Service but as in the case of the teachers, the Government were not in a position to agree to the arbitration findings, I ask the Minister of State here today to let us know if this is the exact position.  It is very regrettable development from the farming point of view and from the agricultural officers' point of view.  There is no joy for them in being on strike.  There is no joy for them in preventing the people who provide their livelihood namely the farmers from selling produce.  That is what is happening at present.</P>
    <P>We in this House ask the Minister and the union officials to sit down immediately and set about trying to resolve the problems which they both face.  It is important that the Minister of State should convey to the Minister the position as we see it.  Remember that we are talking about our primary production, our prime employer, our prime source of foreign income.  Foreign currencies come into Ireland by means of our agricultural production.  We are also allowing a situation to arise in which the intervention system as proposed under the EC guidelines is being put into disarray.  We all realise that there will be further disruptions as this strike continues.  We should call on the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants and the Minister to sit down together today and resolve this problem.  The nettle will have to be grasped irrespective of how long the dispute may run.  But remember, those mainly involved, the Department and the civil servants, will not lose as much as the <Col N="156" /> farmers of Ireland.  We know that the officers involved will not be paid while they are on strike and perhaps this is the reason they are going to be allowed to go on strike.  While the teachers were on strike, the Government saved a considerable amount of money.  This House should ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister &mdash; and I feel that it is regrettable that the Minister could not be present; perhaps he has other commitments in the House on Question Time &mdash; our concern and the concern of the people involved in agriculture about this dispute.  It should not have been allowed by the Government to reach this impasse, because irrespective of what dispute takes place they all have to be settled.  It is always better to settle them in time when very little damage may have been done with regard to relationships between the workers concerned and the Department because all these disputes leave their scars.  The scars of this dispute will be felt by the hard-pressed Irish farmers. They will be the losers along with the economy.  I again appeal to the Minister of State to implore the Minister, as soon as he returns to him after this debate, to take immediate action to resolve the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to say something on a matter like this that concerns you without making the possibility of a settlement more difficult.  I want first of all to defend the democratic right of the trade union movement to strike as they see fit.  That is a right that the trade union movement, over the past 70 years, have fought for and established.  We must not remove that right because if we did we would have a dictatorship in this country. We have seen the results in other countries of the removal of trade union rights.  This matter is of such paramount importance that I was one of the people in this House today who was in favour of having it discussed to highlight to the public and to the Minister and to the union our concern regarding the possible effects that a continuation of this strike could have.  Anybody who has an interest <Col N="157" /> in agricultural production, in the development of agriculture and the system under which we work within the Community, that is, the intervention system, realises that anything that jeopardises that could have serious consequences for the producers, for the workers in the industry who are not directly involved in the strike action and for the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>For that reason I support the call to the people who are in dispute with one another, that is the Minister for the Public Service and the union involved, to get together to sort out the problem. There is no problem in any area, trade union or otherwise, that cannot be settled and this like every other strike will have to be settled.  What we are suggesting in this House is that it should be settled immediately or as quickly as possible having regard to the consequences that could arise if there is not a settlement or if there is an escalation of the dispute to other areas of agricultural processing. Production will go on.  It is the processing we are concerned about.</P>
      <P>One can argue about the rights or wrongs of intervention or a particular system for the payment of the producer for his labour.  Many people within the Community are trying to remove the Common Agricultural Policy as we understand it.  Public opinion throughout the world condemns a system that stores food indefinitely just to maintain a price structure, when half the world on the African Continent are starving.  I suppose we should address that problem too.  I hope that that kind of problem will be addressed because we can no longer go on producing something that is not required. However, the process of intervention is a mechanism to protect the producers particularly in Ireland to contend with their partners in the European Community who have been in the Community longer than us and whose production is more efficient than ours.  As a result they do not depend as much as we do on the intervention system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of milk, milk powder and <Col N="158" /> butter and indeed beef that is in intervention at present is of staggering proportions. The problem about putting this produce into intervention is first of all that we protect the price structure, second, that the farmers are compensated by the Common Agricultural Policy through FEOGA for the goods that are in intervention.  The last and most important reason is that it protects the food from being ruined or poured down the drain or from other drastic measures that would have to be taken if this process of intervention was not there.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is of paramount importance that a settlement should be reached in this dispute.  In fairness to the Minister, he is on public record as saying as late as yesterday &mdash; and indeed I have had discussions with him following this matter being raised &mdash; that he is prepared, and has called on the unions to this effect, to sit down with him to iron out the problems that still exist.  The Minister has said that all the avenues available to reconcile the differences have not been fully explored and if this is the case I would call on the union involved, as a very responsible union, to accede to the Minister's request to continue discussions until all avenues have been explored so that any outstanding problems between the Minister for the Public Service, the Government and the union themselves can be isolated and arrangements made to overcome them.  The economic consequences of not so doing are too great for any of us to contemplate.  It would not be helpful to take sides in this dispute but it would be appropriate that the parties in dispute sit down around a table so that everybody concerned can get back to work pending a resolution of the problem.  Unfortunately the Army have had to be deployed to deal with the first two or three stages of the problem.  That is the actual checking in of the stocks. However if the strike continues for a few days longer it means that the testing process in the intervention system cannot be carried out because this must be done by qualified people.  For that reason I hope the matter is dispute will be settled.</P>
    <P>I listened attentively this morning to <Col N="159" /> one of the farming leaders who said the farmers might have to resort to means of protecting their livelihood.  If these kinds of situations are allowed to drift an escalation could take place which would put many jobs in jeopardy.  This is a matter of urgency.  It is a matter of supreme importance from the economic point of view.  The producers are extremely concerned because this is the month of the year in which they might have something to call their own.  They have had such a desperate situation with last year's tragic weather, bad winter and late spring. There were signs of an improvement and a return to the type of milk production that we would be accustomed to in June but now this threat hangs over the end product of milk production which could extend into the beef sector.  The consequences could be extremely serious so I hope the Minister or the Minister of State will address themselves to the difficulties. The Minister for the Public Service who has direct Cabinet responsibility in this issue advised me that he had priority Parliamentary Questions in the Dáil and that he was unable to be with us at the time the House decided to adjourn so it is not the Minister's fault that he is not present. I want to thank the Minister of State for coming in to listen to the Members speeches, who have an interest in this area.  The Minister's absence is not to be taken as an indication of his lack of interest.  He is acutely aware of the problem and has issued a public invitation to the union concerned to return to the negotiating table with him as he feels there are areas available to them yet that can be overcome and that they can reach agreement in the areas that are presently in dispute.  If there is that kind of goodwill on the part of the Minister the same goodwill should be shown by the trade union movement.  Let us proceed down the road of negotiation, discussion and dialogue until we exhaust all the avenues open to us.  If agreement is not reached then it will be a matter for the Government to decide what action they should take.  The Government have the responsibility to govern and to ensure <Col N="160" /> that this important sector is adequately catered for particularly as we are in the area of perishable produce which must be handled and dealt with properly if major losses are to be avoided.  Naturally if the producer can get his produce into the processing plants he will not be compensated for its production.  It would be unfair if that should happen in the case of a sector who are the innocent party in this dispute.  As in any other strike situation there are always innocent people who suffer.</P>
    <P>We all agree that the farmers are not to blame in this instance.  It is a matter of trade union dispute about an arbitration award.  I think all the Members of this House would be at one in asking both sides to move to negotiate a settlement. From my knowledge of the Minister for the Public Service and his application to his post it will not be beyond his capabilities to achieve a settlement of the dispute. He has been instrumental with another Minister in achieving a settlement in another dispute.  That is the role and responsibility of a Minister for Labour and the Public Service.  There can be calls at times for his intervention in all sorts of strikes.  It is not the function of a Minister to intervene in strikes particularly when we have so many structures set up, including the Labour Court, to deal with them.  I understand that this dispute is beyond that stage and that it needs ministerial intervention because of the implications that would be involved in conceding in full on the disputed area.  These consequences, I understand, would have extensive implications.  For that reason I know that settlement will not be easy but I know that settlement will have to come about.  Settlement is inevitable.  Milk and beef are both perishable and need to be processed: otherwise the producer will not be compensated.  That makes the matter urgent and one that this House should and has addressed itself to.  I am sorry that in the process of trying to do this that we were in contravention of a Member's right to have a matter raised on the Adjournment but what allowed that to happen is a question that can be dealt with elsewhere.  It is a pity that it <Col N="161" /> should have happened in that way because I would not like what happened here today to be taken as lessening in any way the problem we are addressing ourselves to.  I hope the Minister will use his good offices to achieve a settlement of this dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of speaking on this important matter.  It is unfortunate that it has come about by way of a strike.  It is unfortunate for Irish agriculture.  I am delighted to see that the Minister of State is present to hear our comments.  Senator Ferris has explained the absence of the Minister for the Public Service.  I accept that explanation. We must admire Senator Ferris for the manner in which he defends Ministers when they need defending in this House. He is always very willing to come forward to defend a Minister and explain why he could not be here.</P>
      <P>This strike is caused by members of the public service who classify produce for intervention.  It will have a definite effect on Irish agriculture.  Anything that has an effect on Irish agriculture affects the whole economy.  Agricultural exports have a great bearing on the balance of payments.  This strike is not helping that situation.  I do not know what was involved in the strike or what negotiations took place prior to these people going on strike but as has been said by other speakers, there will have to be negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to hear Senator Ferris mention that the Minister for the Public Service has issued a public invitation to meet him to discuss the impasse.  It has an effect on the economy as a whole and especially on farmers who have already been severely affected this year and last year by the bad weather we have spoken about so often in this House on other emergency motions.  I was present last Monday at the mart in Kilmallock when bales of hay saved last year realised £3 per bale.  Imagine, at the end of May hay which was saved in 1984 and 1985 realising £3 per bale.  Farmers should be harvesting their hay crop now.  Late sowing of cereals will result in lower <Col N="162" /> yields for the cereal farmers this year. They are very vocal about the adverse effect on their incomes of decisions other than the weather this year.</P>
    <P>I was listening to the radio when it was stated that a factory in Clonee had to put 135 workers on protective notice from this evening because of this strike.  I know that the Army are carrying out the work of the agricultural officers.  The Minister for Agriculture, in order to save money for the economy, thought fit to introduce the Army NCOs to carry out this work.  But this aggravated the situation. There will have to be some other means of communication with these people to see if something can be done besides resorting to something which aggravates matters.  The people on strike are extending their industrial action because of this.</P>
    <P>The dispute will also affect lamb products. Lamb is cheap enough at present and this strike will not help in this regard. I understand that factories could carry out the classification procedure quite satisfactorily.  There is no need for personnel from the public service to do this work.  To ensure that this classification is carried out properly there could be spot checks carried out by the Department on occasions.  It is done in other businesses. I do not see why it could not be applied in this case.</P>
    <P>The workers who have been put on protective notice are very upset.  They have been put on protective notice because of the actions of the people who are on strike.  The Government must also take some blame because they did not take action to avert the strike.  They should do something now to ensure that work is resumed and the strike called off. Our meat exports realise £100 million a year.  That is too big a sum to be put in jeopardy by what is happening at present. I know there is panic selling at present because of the bad weather and poor growth in grass.  At Kilmallock mart last Monday there were 250 cows sold.  Some of them had to be sold because there was nothing to feed them with and also because of scarcity of cash.  If the people <Col N="163" /> on strike had to take a reduction in income as the farmers had to, they would be disappointed.  Farmers have no strike weapon like those in other professions.</P>
    <P>There were never so many cattle in Kilmallock mart as there were last Monday for this time of year.  The number was up by between 30 and 40 per cent on this time last year.  Prices were down for smaller cattle.  The fact that slaughtering of cattle has been affected by this strike, means that there has been an adverse effect on the price of those cattle.  This is a very serious problem for the farming community.  Everything should be done to ensure that the strike is ended.  It has put the intervention system into disarray.  The intervention system is very important for Ireland under EC regulations.  Milk and milk products are perishable goods.  It is important that everything possible is done to ensure that whatever surplus we have goes into intervention and is not lost to the Exchequer and to the farmers.</P>
    <P>We have had a sequence of strikes, this strike, the teachers' strike and others, all of which have caused unrest among the public, especially those most closely affected.  Is our industrial relations legislation adequate?  Perhaps the Government should consider updating it to ensure a better core of discipline.  The lack of discipline is not helping the progress of the economy.</P>
    <P>Innocent people are suffering.  Those most severely affected are the farming community.  Whoever decides to go on strike, let it be the workers from the ESB, from factories and so on, the farmers suffer the greatest.  This dispute needs ministerial intervention immediately.  I appeal to the Minister to take whatever action is necessary straight away to end this strike so that the agricultural officers will be able to carry out this necessary work to ensure that exports continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with the other Senators I am very concerned about this dispute.  Its effects on the agricultural sector in particular and on the overall economy could be extremely far-reaching. As has been said we are dealing with perishable products, particularly in the dairying sector where it was necessary for the Minister for Agriculture to involve the Army to make sure that the processing of dairy products continued.  The situation now affects the beef, mutton and other meat sectors.  When we consider that our total food exports &mdash; beef and dairy products of the order of £2,500 million, we realise the magnitude of this problem.  It is no harm to recognise the fact that efforts have been made by the Government since last January on an ongoing basis to endeavour to resolve this dispute and to head off the strike.</P>
      <P>There were various concrete offers put forward by the Minister and the Government to the union concerned.  I understand there were settlement proposals offered without any prejudice to the question of retrospection either on the part of the Government or of the unions and then there was a suggestion of <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  The Minister and the Government were prepared to take specific aspects of cases and to examine them.  All those have failed.  It is important to know that the Minister has made it quite clear that he is prepared to be available at any stage to talk further with the unions and to have meaningful discussions with them.  I urge that those discussions take place sooner rather than later because the continuation of this dispute can lead to nothing but aggravation of the entire situation and that would be very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to place on record that agriculture was never in a worse position to take a knock than it is at present. Because of bad weather conditions the industry has been through a very difficult time in the past 18 months.  There are other factors but weather has contributed enormously to the difficulties that now confront all those in agriculture.  I do not think that agriculture is out of its troubles because we still have a winter weather in <Col N="165" /> the midst of summer and the prospects, unless the weather changes quickly, for the forthcoming winter are very bleak with regard to saving fodder and hay with regard to silage.  When the dire prospects that exist in agriculture are coupled with the serious over borrowing by most farmers, their indebtedness to banks, to coops, to the ACC and the other lending institutions, one can perceive quite easily that many farmers during 1986 will have a nil income position.  This might be borne in mind by people in pursuit of the best deal they in justice feel they should get.  There are many farmers who will have no income during 1986.  There are figures to prove that.  This has arisen because of a number of factors but mainly because of the bad weather that has continued for so long.</P>
    <P>Any action taken by the Minister for Agriculture or any other Minister to head off losses in this area are totally justified. The involvement of the Army in an endeavour to save £40 million per week in the dairying sector is fully justified. There is no question that anybody could make a case against that.  It might be a sensitive area but nevertheless we are dealing with a lot of money at the peak time of production in that area.  Milk is very perishable.  The other products we are referring to like beef, mutton, bacon and pork are all very perishable and animals very quickly get too advanced for slaughtering purposes in order to grade well.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, the Minister of State, Deputy J. O'Keeffe and all others concerned will be successful in the very near future in bringing about a solution to the problem. Any action that is needed on the part of the Government to minimise and eliminate where possible any losses to our farming community, who cannot afford to take any more setbacks, is totally justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be uncharacteristically brief.  There is no doubt that a crisis of enormous proportions has befallen agriculture over the last two years.  While all of us would have enormous sympathy <Col N="166" /> with the people who are at the receiving end of that it is also true that agriculture is of its nature cyclical, it is of its nature at risk from climatic and other conditions and, therefore, we as a community have endeavoured to build into policies to do with agriculture what are deemed to be adequate by the Community protections against the wilder fluctuations in agricultural production in particular, through the operation of the common agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>As a Socialist I am always amused at the extent to which people, who ostensibly are committed to the free market and the private enterprise defend the most extraordinary level of State intervention when it comes under the heading of the common agricultural policy.  The further to the right in terms of general economic policy people are the more enthusiastic they tend to be about the common agricultural policy.  I would identify in particular the current president of the IFA as a particular proponent of free market economics for everybody else except himself.  He is very much in favour of intervention on a grand, glorious and enormous scale.</P>
      <P>It is true that the current predicament is threatening the livelihood of a large number of people.  I will not say that I support the introduction of the Army because it is like saying to somebody who sets his house on fire: &ldquo;what am I supposed to do now?&rdquo;  The wiser course would be to take the necessary precautions to ensure that these things do not happen.  It brings us back to the question of public service pay and the Government's policy on it.  It also brings us back to a profound miscalculation which the Government made, that they assumed, particularly in the case of the teachers, that the level of award made by the public service arbitrator would be far less than 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suspect that the teachers unions did not expect a 10 per cent award from the arbitrator and that what happened was that the Government, instead of refusing to go into conciliation and arbitration and special claims, because they feared the consequences, found themselves in a <Col N="167" /> much more difficult position when the arbitrator made awards well above what the Government anticipated he would make and where the Government presumed, far too generous to themselves that the arbitrator would listen to the Government's argument on public service pay and on the state of the public finances.</P>
    <P>When people who everybody has admitted have done their job extremely well and who I gather all of the Ministers involved in Government have acknowledged as being efficient, flexible and having contributed considerably to the operatons of the Irish agricultural industry, are forced to go on strike, you have to look at a more deep-seated malaise than just the usual image of greedy public servants who should in the popular parlance be thankful for their jobs.  There is a profound sense of grievance there because when people go on strike for one, two or three weeks they will probably lose more money in the process than they would gain from the payment of many of these awards.</P>
    <P>What you are actually seeing is not so much people on strike about payments, as people on strike about their rights to be treated the same as everybody else. What is happening in this country is that the public service employees, by and large &mdash; we can see it on a grand scale in Dublin and Grafton Street is highly illustrative of the state of industrial relations in Dublin Corporation at present&mdash; have come to the conclusion that they will not be listened to about their right to be paid properly unless they exercise their considerable muscle.  We are seeing now the early parts of what could be a very long, hot and restless summer in the whole area of public service pay.</P>
    <P>I regret that agriculture is particularly vulnerable to industrial action at present because of last year, because of what could properly be described as the still present winter, I was nearly knocked down by hailstones when I was coming in here at lunch time, so we still have winter and this has devastated agriculture.  I do not have as much sympathy for farmers <Col N="168" /> as perhaps other people would have because I believe they defended themselves very effectively against contributing to the national Exchequer in the good years, and postponed all efforts on the part of the rest of the community to extract a proper level of taxation.  They are now in a state of increasing frenzy because of the deprivation of income that has resulted from weather and other conditions and the current strike.</P>
    <P>The simplest solution for the Government would be to pay these people their proper award made to them by the public service arbitrator.  If the Government do not want to operate proper industrial relations in the public service, then let them stop working through conciliation and arbitration and decide to do it some other way.  You cannot use the rules because they suit you and then suddenly change the rules when they no longer suit you.  This is what the Government have done in the case of the teachers and brought us to the brink of chaos.  They are now doing it in the case of the agricultural community and bringing us to the brink of perhaps not as much immediate human damage but enormous cost in financial terms to the agricultural community and consequently to the community at large.</P>
    <P>My view is that the Government should pay this award and if they do not want to pay public service awards and do not want to pay a special pay award made by arbitrators, they should cease to gamble on the arbitrator hearing their side, should scrap the whole conciliation and arbitration scheme and try to deal with industrial relations in another way.  Conciliation and arbitration has worked extremely well over the years for Government in terms of minimising industrial relations problems.  It is regrettable, because it did not work the way the Government wished that they have effectively jeopardised the whole of the public service conciliation and arbitrations scheme.</P>
    <P>I regret that they have walked us into yet another crisis, that there is another one brewing in Dublin, and suspect there will be a succession of these crises as people in the public service, particularly <Col N="169" /> those who are very poorly paid at present, begin to realise that their scope for free negotiation is being increasingly restricted. We have a major crisis on our hands. My solution quite simply would be that these people are entitled to be paid what was awarded to them through the normal procedures of conciliation and arbitration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions to this debate.  At the outset, it might help if I recounted, briefly, the background to this dispute.</P>
      <P>During the negotiations earlier this year with the Civil Service unions on an agreement on the 25th round and related matters, all outstanding arbitration findings were discussed in a working party.  The Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants (UPTCS) were concerned in nine of these findings.  Certain proposals were put which took account of the special factors which existed in the case of some of the UPTCS findings, for example, that offers had been made prior to arbitration but had been rejected by the union.  In the event the UPTCS did not accept the package of proposals then offered.</P>
      <P>On 5 May the UPTCS gave formal notice of industrial action beginning on 12 May in the Department of Agriculture. My colleague, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, Minister for the Public Service, met representatives of the union on Saturday evening, 10 May, and confirmed the offers made at the earlier talks on the 25th round which went some way towards recognising the special position of the UPTCS arbitration findings.  He also indicated that he was prepared to enter into negotiations with the union with a view to securing a settlement on the same broad lines as had been agreed with the teacher's unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>UPTCS would not agree to continue negotiations on the basis which the Minister had outlined and unfortunately the industrial action went ahead.  The union maintained that their arbitration findings were unique and they were pressing for <Col N="170" /> a commitment to full implementation in all cases.</P>
    <P>We have consistently asked the union to reconsider their position in this case. The present and potential damage to the economy of their action is out of all proportion to the alleged scale of their grievance. We have indicated that we are prepared to be flexible with a view to finding a negotiated settlement.</P>
    <P>I would like at this stage to reiterate in full the statement made on Friday last, 23 May, in relation to this matter.  In that statement it was made clear that we were quite prepared to accept that the position of each side should be recognised by the other, that is any settlement should be without prejudice to the rights of UPTCS to pursue their claim for full payment and equally without prejudice to the Government's position that payment of full retrospection or commitment to such payment was not possible.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we indicated that we could offer UPTCS <i>ex gratia</i> payments on the same general basis as other groups had got.  Thirdly, we also indicated that we were prepared to explore further the union's contention that there were features in the individual findings which would merit special treatment.  Indeed, as far back as January last various offers on the individual findings had been made, including an offer to implement in full the finding in the case of the beef classification officers because of the special features of that finding.  UPTCS, however, indicated that they could not agree to anything less than virtually full retrospection for all groups.</P>
    <P>We consider that we have made very reasonable overtures to the union to resume negotiations with a view to secur ing a settlement to this dispute.  We reiterated our position in this regard as late as yesterday in the Dáil in response to Private Notice Questions.  I want to state clearly in this House on behalf of the Government that we are willing and ready to resume negotiations with the union.</P>
    <P>While I have stated the factual basis on which we are prepared to negotiate I am not laying down any pre-conditions for <Col N="171" /> discussions with the union.  I feel sure that we have not exhausted the room for manoeuvre in negotiations.</P>
    <P>Once again, therefore, I would ask UPTCS to reconsider their position before major damage is caused to the agricultural industry and to return to the negotiating table with a view to securing a settlement of this dispute.  I think that the House will agree that the general basis which I have outlined for such a settlement cannot, by any standards, be <Col N="172" /> described as ungenerous.  I sincerely hope that the union will take up my offer.</P>
