      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter: The delay by the Department of Health in extending the provisions of circular 6/85, dealing with the discharge of homeless persons from hospital, to cover the discharge of such persons from general hospitals.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 10 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on the Order Paper.  The question of the order in which they will be taken is a little complicated. No. 1 will be taken first and No. 2 will be taken second.  Due to the non-availability of the Ministers responsible, No. 4 will be taken not earlier than 2 p.m. and No. 5 not earlier than 4.30 p.m.  If Nos. 1 and 2 are completed before Ministers are available for Nos. 4 and 5, then No. 3 will be taken.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Leader tell me when it is proposed to take the Committee Stage of the Harbours Bill? It is quite a detailed, complicated and controversial Bill.</P>

      <P>Before the Leader answers I should like to indicate that I will be putting down amendments to this Bill, that is, if the Minister has not got the good sense to do so before then.  Unlike Senator Ferris, I intend to do the business in here and not out in other places.  I presume that we are not taking all Stages of the Harbours Bill today?  I am sure my close colleague from Clare would not be agreeable to taking all Stages of that Bill today either.  Perhaps the Minister will come in with the amendments.  I am sure Senator Howard has brought him up to date.  I will not agree today to taking all Stages of this Bill if I have the permission of my Leader in the House in that respect.</P>

      <P>I understand that there is some possibility of the Committee Stage of the Harbours Bill being taken today.  I see the Leader of the House indicating to me that it will not be taken.  I am glad to hear that because we do need time between Second Stage and Committee stage of that Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure all Members who expressed anxiety that there never was any intention to take other than the Second Stage.  The length of the debates that have been going on in the House now has reduced quite substantially the optimism of the Leader of the House in regard to the amount of business that can be done in a day.  The only point which needs to be considered, and should be considered, is whether it could be taken tomorrow.  I would ask Senators who are contemplating amendments to consider that question during the day and discuss it with me.  It might help the House to clear the business it has if we took it late on the order, say, tomorrow afternoon.  If the Senators wish to have longer time, I will not press that <Col N="837" /> point.  We can leave it over to next Tuesday or Wednesday.</P>
      <P>There are two minor points.  A long time ago we agreed that we would be taking No. 6 with No. 5 in a single debate. I forgot to mention this on the Order of Business, so I suggest that it be added.</P>
      <P>The other point is in regard to the question as to whether we are to suspend our sitting temporarily for meals.  I would prefer to let this be a matter for decision during the day.  We will see what progress we have made by 12.30 p.m. and what point of business we are at, and equally at 5.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>On the point in connection with the Harbours Bill, there is no way that we would like to see that Bill proceed to completion tomorrow. Because of certain implications which have arisen in the last few days, we would need the weekend to consider that Bill and then we could take the next Stage next week.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that in this and the previous section and some following sections we are dealing with designated areas, which is an important part of the Bill.  I do feel, personally, that before I could speak in any meaningful way regarding designated areas, it would be necessary not alone to examine the development plans in the corporation offices but also to examine the actual situation on the ground.  Unfortunately, I did not have an opportunity of doing so because of the time constraints.  I am sure I could say in passing that many Senators would have the same problem.  When people are critical of the role of Senators, <Col N="838" /> this is something that should be taken into consideration.  With the amount of legislation that is coming before us at the present time &mdash; all important legislation &mdash; it is not possible to have enough time to give to all these important statutes.</P>
      <P>I would also like to say, in relation to amendments which I tabled for this section, that I appreciate your courtesy in informing me by letter yesterday that Nos. 1 and 2 were out of order.  This was mainly due to the time problem because I only had the weekend to table these amendments.  There was not sufficient time to check that everything was in order in the way I would like.  Possibly if I had more time, I could frame the amendments in such a way that they might not necessarily be out of order.  Nevertheless, I hope the Minister, when I make passing references to these now, will favour the spirit in which they are intended.</P>
      <P>I would like to express thanks for the very helpful maps which were made available to us in the Library through the courtesy of the Minister.  Although I did not get time to examine the designated areas, I did spend a short period in the Custom House Docks area, which I felt was most important.  I am also very grateful to Mr. Kealy who, without notice, facilitated me for a short while in looking around that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the rates situation and the remission over ten years, the Minister told us that there will be a full remission of rates for ten years on new buildings constructed in a designated area between 23 October 1985 and 31 May 1989, and full remission of the rates on any increase in the valuation of enlarged or improved buildings.  Under this section the Minister for Finance may make a scheme providing for the remission in whole or in part of rates leviable in respect of premises in the Custom House Docks area and in any of the other designated areas.  I would like to ask the Minister specifically in this regard would it not have been possible to include in the Bill the specific details regarding the length of time and the amount of rates which would be remitted? In other words, by not having it in the Bill, is it possible that at some time <Col N="839" /> this could be varied?  Will it be necessary to bring this in in other legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normally done like this.  The Minister may make a scheme with regard to rates remissions as soon as the Bill is passed. As soon as the Bill is passed, the scheme will be made.  As indicated last night with regard to further designated areas that can be done only on the basis that we, under this provision, can give rates remission only.  I explained that last night.  That is as far as our terms of reference go.  If we wanted to change the financial arrangements, that would mean an amendment of the Finance Act.  I indicated quite clearly that there was no intention to do that or that was not a proposal.  The Bill was published on 25 March and maps were lodged in the Library then.  It is a reasonable time for Members of both Houses to examine the various proposals.  I understand also the time constraints that there are on public representatives, particularly Senators. We believe that we gave reasonable time for discussion and gave Members an opportunity to look at all aspects of the Bill.  With regard to the rates remissions, they are clearly and only applicable to the areas that are designated.  The actual areas are set out quite clearly in the Schedule to the Finance Bill, which states, nearly road by road, what they are.  Only those will qualify for both the tax breaks and the rate remissions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear about my comments on the time constraints. I am not at all critical of the Minister in this regard.  I am simply saying this is an important Bill.  It would be necessary before anyone could speak in a meaningful way about this to examine it in very considerable detail.  I am simply saying from my own point of view, I did not have the time to do that.  I realise that the Bill is an important Bill and the time factor is also important.  I am not complaining in any way about the lack of time.  When this Bill came before the <Col N="840" /> House we seemed to have a number of other very important Bills at the same time.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 1, which was out of order, could I ask if the Minister could, in some way, cope with the spirit of the amendment or if it would be helpful as regards the Bill that he should do so?  In the 1981 Finance Act, section 23, as I understand it is concerned with residential areas, houses and flats. This is an area that many Members of the House have said should be encouraged. In respect of the floor area of houses and flats, there is a limitation &mdash; I am not saying that in itself is wrong or that I disagree with it.  With regard to the Custom House Docks area there is freedom for the planners there.  I would like to refer in particular to the proposal to bring people back to live in the designated areas, apart from the Custom House Docks area.  Many people might feel that area might not be suitable for the municipal type buildings.  With regard to the other areas, would the Minister not feel that perhaps some freedom should be allowed to developers with regard to these specific areas, with regard to the floor areas and with regard to other matters which were dealt with in this very considerable section 23 of the 1981 Finance Act?  If the Minister did so feel, would it be possible for him or for the Minister for Finance to issue an order making that variation or making it possible to have that variation?</P>

      <P>I want to make the point, a Chathaoirligh, that you ruled these out and I do not want to get into debate on these points but just as a passing reference the answer is no you cannot vary financial measures by order.  It would have to be done by an amendment to the Finance Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just make one further passing reference to my amendment No. 2?  I feel that in these areas where rates are concerned they will benefit the commercial buildings and concerns of that nature.  We are trying to encourage people to come and reside in those areas.  I am not sure &mdash; and again it was something I did not have an opportunity of checking over the weekend &mdash; whether a waiver might be considered or whether a charge for services might be considered as rates?  I was simply attempting in this amendment to give in this regard to dwellings an incentive which apparently is not there though there is such incentive for every other type of premises.  There will be a waiver of rates for the ten year period.  I wonder if it would be possible in some way or whether the Minister would consider it to be desirable, to provide a waiver in order to bring some kind of balance to the situation which would give the incentive with regard to the development of residential property.</P>

      <P>There is one further part in subsection (6) regarding evaluation where there is a problem with apportioning this and where a valuation <Col N="842" /> has not been completed.  The Commissioner of Valuation may, on the application of the local authority within whose functional area the premises are situated, apportion to the premises such parts as he thinks proper of the rateable valuation of the property in which the premises are situated.  My experience where valuation is concerned, and particularly of new buildings, is that many people might not be satisfied there is provision for an appeal within a certain time. I want to ask the Minister in this situation if there is provision for an appeal where somebody might not be satisfied?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), line 34, to delete &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;not less than six nor more than ten.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention is that the authority shall consist of a chairman and four ordinary members.  My amendment is to delete four and substitute &ldquo;not less than six nor more than ten&rdquo;.  I do not want to make any long issue out of this.  I know that it has been debated in the other House.  I have a fair idea of the Minister's viewpoint. Nevertheless the authority are intended more or less as an executive to see that this work is carried out.  The Minister obviously feels that the smaller number will be best in this regard.  I feel that four is too small a number.  I feel that to give some scope within the numbers that I suggest, six and ten, would be better.  It should be attempted to get, on this authority, people with experience in different areas.  From the experience we have gained here on committees I could not envisage any satisfactory situation with a chairman and four members.  Anybody would agree that increasing the number above four must be beneficial <Col N="843" /> and must bring in experience and viewpoints and widen the whole scope of the authority.  Four is an arbitrary figure.  The case could be made that by having a smaller number or by having just the one individual it would be far more straightforward to get the work completed.  The number is too small and it would be to the benefit of the Bill if the Minister would agree to leave some scope for increasing that number if he is not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator knows my mind with regard to the numbers. I take his point.  Whatever figure one arrives at one can argue whether it should or should not be so.  I remember somebody indicated once that his idea of a committee would be a committee of three.  The reason he had three was on the basis that one would be out sick sometimes or one would be on holidays.  That was the basis of the committee of three. What we are talking about here, as indicated by the Senator, is an executive committee or an executive board charged with moving and getting on with the development and planning.  In that they will have recourse to calling in or employing consultants or expertise from the local authority, or whatever.  They will have a wide remit in doing that.  There will be no question of the board being the only people whose ideas will be taken into account.  As broad a view as possible will be obtainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I would like to see is a sharp edged board with people who are involved in that kind of development. It is a huge site and is a development that was never undertaken in this city.  The local authorities admit this.  It requires the kind of methods we are using.  We need a small board giving them reasonably wide powers outside the Planning Act so that they can proceed to encourage and develop ideas.  By having a tight knit, small board I believe we would achieve what we want.  I understand the Senator's point of view as well.  It is just that I favour this approach.  We have thought <Col N="844" /> about it and I believe that will achieve what we want.  There will be a total of five members on a board.  When you think of what we are about, developing a 27 acre site, it is enough.  If we had any more than that, argument and disagreement would come into it.  I believe our approach is the right one.  I am afraid I cannot accept this particular amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I realised the Minister would not accept the amendment because I understand his mind on this, in other words, I read the report in the other House where the Bill was debated at some length and got an insight into what the Minister said.  While I agree that tight knit membership of this kind has its advantages and that it may be the result in making faster progress and fewer disputes I do not think that different points of view should be ignored.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about this area as a jewel.  We all hope it will turn out to be that.  While, as they say in architectural jargon, time is of the essence, a small membership would possibly be helpful in this regard, nevertheless I feel time spent in discussing the scheme, in coming to conclusions and considering options, is not time wasted.  I simply say that four people and a chairman will, the Minister says, be a tight knit membership.  I do not have any great experience of committees except in this House but I feel, by increasing the number, it is bound to bring in other points of view.  There are bound to be more questions asked and a more critical approach adopted.  While I agree with the Minister that the authority will be dependent on the input of professionals nevertheless to argue from that point of view is in my estimation to downgrade the authority.  That could also be said if there was only a chairman and that the line taken will be strictly the line suggested by the professional people and the experts.  I would not accept that point of view.  The authority will have to make decisions and stand on their own feet apart from the reports they get from professionals. It is a pity a larger number were not included on the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite <Col N="845" /> clear that while the board is a board of five members the whole consultation process is important.  It is not a question of this board putting up a plan and that being the end of the matter.  That is not the case.  First of all, they must take into account the draft development plan. They must also take into account any observations which the local authority make or indeed that the general public might make.  They do not have to take it on board but they have to take account of it.  Then it goes to the Minister and he may vary the plan.  There is the consultation process.  The planning authority have a consultative role in all of this as do the public if they wish to participate.  There is then the Minister.  It is not a question of giving all power to a small board. Basically, while the board is small, it is a board that will be able to get things moving pretty quickly and come back with the proposals, which will then go into the whole consultation process.  That is where you will see whatever changes and disagreements there are coming to the fore.</P>
      <P>I want to make the case quite clearly that there is no question of any small board operating as some sort of dictatorial unit, that they come up with a plan and it does not go beyond that.  That is not the way it is envisaged, as is clearly indicated in the Bill.  The smaller board is for efficiency, to be sharp and get things moving because of the size and the kind of development we are talking about.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) At least one of the ordinary members shall be a person nominated by the Dublin City Manager.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The city manager and the corporation have a very important role.  Senator McMahon went into some detail regarding the undemocratic aspect of this where <Col N="846" /> the power is taken out of their hands.  I would be very sympathetic in that regard as well.  If it were possible I would like to see the Dublin City Manager involved in that authority but clearly that would not be possible.</P>
    <P>The corporation have a very important role to play here.  It might seem that it is because of their failure that this Bill is necessary.  In reality it is not the failure of the corporation.  With regard to the development plan it is simply a matter of zoning and considering applications which are made to the corporation for planning permission.  As I said on Second Stage the problem with development plans is that the local authority do not have any power or any obligation to see the development plan completed.  It is only a matter of ensuring really that development which takes place does not contravene the development plan.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other Bill which the Minister has mentioned, the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Bill, which I warmly welcome, it seems that this area is taken out of the hands of the corporation and the city manager.  I would like to see the situation where the corporation would be actively involved, because while the Minister says it will be necessary to consult with the corporation and to have regard to the development plan there will be no obligation on the authority to incorporate in the plan anything the corporation might suggest. They could take a completely different line.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Minister will have the final say.  With regard to a plan which is finalised and obviously at that time will have taken a long period to bring to that stage, it would not be possible for the Minister to make changes except in minor detail.  Clearly, at an early stage, the authority will have to decide on the specific role and line they are taking and where the commitments are.  From that point of view and from the point of view of involving the corporation and the city manager in this very important area, if the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment a way should be found for <Col N="847" /> the city manager to be actively involved in some particular area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the intention behind this amendment is to strengthen the involvement of the Dublin Corporation in the development of the site.  The approach of appointing a nominee of a city manager would be wrong.  When we are talking about an ordinary member are we talking about a member of the city council?  If we are, under the Bill members of the local authority are excluded from being members of the authority.  As the corporation have an input in a consultative role regarding the drawing up of the scheme and with regard to the development plan, the ordinary member might be compromised.  If he is on the statutory body but is in conflict with his own authority, whether it is in relation to the general plan or some contravention of the draft development plan or whatever, there would be problems. That is the reason I do not think it would be wise to accept this amendment. The city manager cannot be a member of the board.  He could not be a member of the local authority who exercise the right over the draft development plan and the planning authority and then be involved in another planning authority as well. That could cause conflict.  I cannot accept the amendment on the grounds I have stated; that an ordinary member of the council is prohibited from being on the board under the Bill and that an ordinary member could find himself compromised if he were on the statutory body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see any compromise in a situation where, for example, the city manager would have the right to nominate an individual to have a particular concern from the corporation's point of view.  I am not totally clear on the exact functions of the authority. A scheme will be decided on; the content of the scheme as regards the balance of housing in the commercial areas will be decided on.  I am not sure if the authority will also be responsible for some of the construction work.  I assume they will not, apart from the infrastructure <Col N="848" /> and the roads etc.</P>
      <P>The result of this Bill will be that this 27 acre site will be developed.  We all hope it will be a great success.  In any event, it will be handed over to the corporation at that stage.  It is a pity that with this jewel, as the Minister referred to it, which the corporation will have to take over after a certain period, it will be done without any direct input by Dublin Corporation.  While the Minister says that the corporation will be consulted and that he will have the last word, taking everything into consideration &mdash; the initial scheme, the difficulty in varying a scheme &mdash; once a definite line is taken, except in peripheral areas it will be very hard to change that.  The corporation should have a direct input into that scheme quite apart from being consulted because there is no bite in consultation. I feel, as far as consultation is concerned, there is zoning and the development plan for that area already, so presumably it will be simply on those lines.  I accept that this amendment in the Minister's view might not make any improvement to the Bill.  The one great problem in this country is to have an input from ordinary people.  Would the Minister not feel that the Dublin City Manager and the corporation should have a direct input at all stages of this scheme.</P>

      <P>A number of questions were asked.  The Senator questioned what the authority are all about. The authority on their establishment will publicly invite submissions from any interested parties including Dublin Corporation. The authority will also undertake whatever research, discussion or other inquiries appear to them to be necessary to assess the best manner in which the site should be developed.  The authority will prepare and publish a draft of a planning scheme for the site which will indicate the authority's view on how the site should best be developed.  All interested parties, and Dublin Corporation in particular, will be invited to comment on the draft scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authority will review it and if <Col N="849" /> appropriate amend the draft planning scheme, make a formal scheme and submit it to the Minister for approval.  A copy of the scheme made by the authority will be sent to Dublin Corporation.  In consideration of the scheme the Minister will be required to take account of any objection made within one month by Dublin Corporation.  The Minister may approve or modify the scheme as made by the authority.  The individual development projects which are in accordance with the planning scheme will not require planning permission in the normal way. The variations of the planning scheme will be subject to the same procedures as the making of the original scheme.</P>
    <P>The corporation have, in my view, a reasonable input into all of this.  It is quite clear that they have a role to play.  The authority may, if they wish, second members of Dublin Corporation planning department to act as consultants and planners within this.  That is not ruled out at all.  We should not always think that the planning authority are sacrosanct in what they do.  We are all aware that the same planning authority gave permission for a very over-developed use of this particular site a number of years ago.  The Senator talks about what is in the best interest but I believe we are getting a reasonable balance.  We are not excluding the local authority from making their point of view.  Any statutory body with a sense of responsibility would have to take into account any suggestions from the planning authority.  The scheme as proposed is in the best interests of the city and having had discussions with the planning authority about this matter I know they are quite happy with the role they will have in it.  They do not feel excluded or isolated in any way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> In page 7, subsection (1), between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) In performing the functions assigned to it, the authority shall, as far as practicable, maintain a balance, not only within its functional area but in relation to development plans for contiguous areas, as between housing, industrial, commercial, social, amenity and other development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment was taken from the 1982 urban renewal legislation.  It is a good one.  It will be necessary to maintain that balance not only within the area to be developed but also with regard to the development of the entire city.  For that reason this amendment should be incorporated in the Bill so that there will be no doubt about the kind of balance and development that is envisaged.  While the Minister is critical of the planning authority I am sure he would agree that in many areas this balance has not been established.  The Bill would be improved by the inclusion of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too happy with this amendment because I am not sure what its effect would be.  For example, it might require the authority to prepare a planning scheme which contained all of the elements mentioned.  This would reduce the planning scheme to an almost mathematical exercise.  It would also undermine the ability of the authority to respond to the views of Dublin Corporation or, indeed, other interested parties in relation to the overall planning scheme.  I do not see a lot of merit in establishing an authority to prepare a planning scheme and provide for an elaborate process of consultation and ministerial approval if the authority are to be handcuffed even before they addressed themselves to the problem.  The authority will have no function whatsoever in the contiguous areas so they will not have an input of those areas.  It is important that we are as open as possible on this if we want to see a low density and open plan development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> I would have no objection to the issue of general policy directives under subsection (6) along the general lines of the amendment.  When an authority are formed we will have to give them some broad parameters to work on.  We cannot handcuff them totally because it is their job to plan.  If we write too many restrictions regarding them into the Bill we are really handcuffing them but if we issue general directives they will have to take those directives into account in the formation of any plan.  That plan has to go back to the Minister who has issued the directives.</P>
    <P>There is a wide safeguard in all of this and I am reasonably happy that the way in which we are framing the legislation is the better way rather than handcuff the authority by telling them that they must adhere to certain restrictions.  A general directive to the authority saying that, broadly, such and such is the kind of development we would like to see on this site and they having to plan it and then market it is the best approach.  There is no shortage of planning schemes but they must ensure that it is a marketable project. The authority will have to bear this in mind in any development.  Writing constraints into legislation can have inhibiting effects on possible developers, not that the developers will call the shots in this but they may look at the legislation and say that there are too many restrictions and they are not interested in looking at the site.  I do not want that to happen.  There are enough safeguards in this Bill to ensure a good planning development on this particular site and this is what the Senator is looking for.  He wants to see a good planned development on this site.  We all want that.  I believe the way we are doing it is the best approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy enough with the power the Minister has.  He mentioned the issuing of a general directive. With regard to the contiguous areas, where the Minister says the authority will not have any power, I had in mind when I drafted this amendment that it would not be a case of including housing, industrial, <Col N="852" /> commercial, social amenity and other development in some kind of mechanical arrangement but that we would have regard not only to the area and the requirements of it but to the development which is there at the moment in the bordering areas.  I hope when directives are issued that they will be in a very general way and that they will not constrain the authority in any way.</P>

      <P>The quorum for a meeting of the Authority shall be three or such other number as may from time to time be fixed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Where there is such a small authority the Minister will not have any great choice in this regard.  Could the Minister, for example, change the quorum to two? A quorum of three should be the absolute minimum.  My other question relates to subsection (7) which states:</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection (3), the Authority may act notwithstanding a vacancy among its members.</P>
      <P>Is there any provision for filling vacancies within a certain time?  What would happen if there were two or more vacancies? This subsection refers to one vacancy.</P>

      <P>Vacancies can be filled at any time.  There is no question about that.  The Minister may decide from time to time to change the quorum.  He might decide that a meeting of the authority to approve a planning scheme for submission to the Minister would require a higher quorum.  In other words, the Minister might decide that full membership is required to approve such a plan.  For ordinary meetings, the quorum shall be three.  Given that the board is an executive one I accept that three out of five is a reasonable number to attend board meetings.  However, when finalising plans it might be necessary that the full board be present rather than have a quorum of three and that is why we have included the provision.</P>

      <P>In page 10, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  the scheme will have regard to the requirements for Development Plans, Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, Part III, Sections 19 to 23, including the Third Schedule.</P>
      <P>(b)  before the Minister approves any scheme a scaled model of the proposal shall be put on public display for a period of not less than one month and full consideration shall be given by him to any objections or submissions made within a further period of not less than one month.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is in relation to development plans for local authorities.  The authority will <Col N="855" /> have a very free hand.  While I do not disagree with that, there should be some kind of springboard or datum level to start off with.  Sections 19-23 of the 1963 Act and the Third Schedule set out the objectives which a local authority may strive to achieve in its development plan. This amendment would be helpful with regard to the development of this area and, therefore, the Minister might consider including it in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see the relevance of the requirements proposed in part (a) of the amendment to the scheme proposed in the Bill.  The provisions referred to deal with general obligations of local planning authorities as regards the making, contents and review of their departments' plans and general objectives for their area which may be included in the development plan.  These requirements relate specifically to a broad range of factors which must be considered by the planning authority in making a develpment plan for their whole area.  In this Bill we are talking about making a plan for a small scheme.</P>
      <P>Many aspects of the Third Schedule of the 1963 Act are irrelevant to this site. Section 12 provides in some detail what the planning scheme for the site should contain and the interests which must be taken into account.  I am happy that this format is the most appropriate one for the scheme and will cover adequately all points which, I am sure, is the intention behind the Senator's amendment.  The second part of the amendment requires that a scale model of the planning scheme be out on display.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to part (a) of the amendment I agree with what the Minister says but I feel that although this is a localised proposal it will be important for the whole area.  I realise that the Minister will have power to issue guidelines and I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to part (b) of the amendment, a scaled model of a considerable area of the city was prepared for Lichfield's proposal before 1962.  Drawings <Col N="856" /> are not very helpful for people who are not in the habit of reading drawings. Indeed, many who are in the habit of reading drawings do not always comprehend them.  There is only one way to get people interested in the proposal and that is by preparing a scaled model.  As regards areas of Dublin which have been developed and are now the subject of criticism, for example, Wood Quay, if scaled models had been put on display showing the way these areas would turn out, people would have objected in a stronger manner.  Some of them did object rather strongly and rightly so.  In an effort to get the people involved a scaled model should be prepared, when the drawings are completed and when everything is ready, for the Minister's consideration.  It may take a little extra time to do that but it would be well worthwhile. By putting it on display for a period of one month, all the people who are interested could examine it and make suggestions.</P>
    <P>I have said before on many occasions that it is surprising how ordinary people, if there are such people, can have a great insight into matters which might not be considered to be relevant to them.  In relation to housing schemes I have heard men digging with spades and shovels make suggestions which the person in charge of a scheme would be proud of. What I am saying to the Minister is please give people who cannot read plans an opportunity to contribute.  It is one amendment that the Minister should agree to include.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a lot of merit in what the Senator said about having a scaled model prepared for illustration purposes, as long as it is clearly understood that it is not a definitive plan. Scaled plans are a good idea.  When I see them I always admire the lovely job but when I see the finished product I am never as impressed.  The Senator talked about building on a particular quay. There was a scaled model of that on view to the public.  There was not any great hassle at the time about the actual building but we see the general furore about <Col N="857" /> it now.  However, in issuing a directive to the authority, I will ensure that this suggestion forms part of it.  The way to do it would be to have a scaled model on the site for people to see.</P>

      <P>This section is the nub of the Bill, the really important and critical part of it.  I thank the Cathaoirleach who allowed me in my Second Stage speech to deal, very strictly within the confines of the planning scheme under this section, with Le Corbusier and the other architectural historians that I quoted.  We should learn from the costly lessons of the past.  What I wanted to say really was condensed in one part of my contribution where I quoted from <i>Utopia on Trial, Vision and Reality in Planned Housing</i>, London Shipman, 1985 which stated:</P>
      <P>...most of the design features that have failed our tests prove, in retrospect, to stem from this Utopian vision. He was fundamentally right in one respect &mdash; that design can affect the character of a community &mdash; but whether the effect will be good or ill is something that can only be determined from factual evidence.  Creativity is not enough.  It should also be rooted in reality....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central point I want to make was that creativity will not be enough.  Neither will flair nor ingenuity.  Realism is necessary. With regard to the scheme for this site &mdash; I am speaking of the 27 acres &mdash; it seems unlikely that housing can be fitted into it. We can fit houses and offices into many inner city areas.  The suggestion has been made with regard to this area that we provide an entertainment complex which would have a cultural influence.  I am sure that is something that should be considered, something along the lines of the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen which attract visitors from many countries.  We <Col N="858" /> have no major centre of that nature.  Perhaps with regard to the docks area we could include a maritime museum.  The idea of a museum which would be relevant to the walled area of the city was discussed in great detail.  Something on the lines of the Pompidou centre in Beaubourg, Paris, for the performing arts which attracts visitors and is stimulating for the city, could be considered.  Of course, there are developments such as Disneyland which attracts large numbers.</P>
    <P>The vast bulk of the site we are talking of was zoned for industrial use.  The Amiens Street strip and the ramp up to Connolly Station would seemingly preclude residential development.  In this section there is only an obligation to consult Dublin Corporation.  I would prefer if there was some greater input by the corporation and if they ensured that no encouragement was given to build offices across the street.  Anything that could be built anywhere else in the city must not be built on this site.</P>
    <P>There should not be too much emphasis on what is known as municipal housing because we have that all around us.  With regard to the development the Minister spoke about, it is generally felt it is possible to have a six storey development in some areas before running into trouble. Of course, great care is necessary in the Custom House area.  The Minister referred to a scheme which had eight storeys in parts.  I recall that it was decided that no other building as high as Liberty Hall would be allowed in that area.  Yet afterwards Irish Life got permission for a building 14 storeys high, almost directly opposite the Custom House.  The Minister said that there is an interesting old warehouse there, the Crimean, where a banquet was held to celebrate the end of the war of the same name.  I am glad that it may be considered desirable to retain that building.</P>
    <P>It is important to think big.  Without doing that we cannot achieve the success we want.  When something is done properly it is appreciated.  There are very many examples.  Everything connected with DART was done well and I am not just talking about the carriages and <Col N="859" /> engines.  A new image was created and the public response was good.  A large amount of money was very well spent on the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.  The private toll bridge linking Ringsend with the North Wall built by the Roche concern is commendable.  As regards most of the inner city housing development, even though it might have been copied directly from London, I do not condemn it on that account.</P>
    <P>Other examples are the parks, and Malahide Castle.  Marley Park on the south side of Dublin has a high standard of landscaping and on that account there is very little litter.  The Bray Road is pleasant to drive on and looks so good. We have the Powerscourt Centre, an attractive modern shopping complex, and the Irish Life Centre in Abbey Street. Design is important,</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to sacrosanct rules.  These should not exist.  There are many areas where things do not work out.  In my own town of Kells &mdash; I just mention this in passing &mdash; we have a mix of houses and flats for the elderly in the same housing scheme.  The case was made by planners that this was the correct thing to do.  One of the big headaches public representatives have in relation to elderly people living in those flats is that they complain about the problems they have with young people.  The drawing board should be clear to start off with. The basic rule should be applied and that is that function comes first.  Aesthetics are important as well but if the functional end is not achieved the whole scheme will be a mistake.</P>
    <P>With regard to my amendment about retaining features, it is a basic rule in designing not to interfere with contours and features or to interfere with them as little as possible.  This is always a problem.  In rural areas the general guidelines are not to interfere with banks, hedges or ditches.  People who build houses and develop around them want to have those removed.  In the housing <Col N="860" /> scheme in Kells when a beautiful bank and hedge were left as a feature, representations were made to the local authority to have them removed.  They were removed unfortunately.</P>
    <P>Consultation is very important. Depopulation of the inner city was mentioned. It is easy to get people out and to force them out but I am not sure if it is as easy to get them back.  A culture has been lost there.</P>
    <P>We do not have costings for this scheme but it would be helpful if we had some.  Senator McMahon referred to the Minister's commitment with regard to this Bill.  I do not doubt that in any way. When problems arose in the past I could not complain at the reception I got from the Minister.  He was always understanding and as helpful as possible.  I hope that while the Minister was not able to take on board any of my amendments he will accept them in the spirit in which they were offered.  I am very pleased that he accepts the general idea in amendment No. 7.  Perhaps in his guidelines he will be able to incorporate the spirit of some of my amendments.  I take this opportunity to wish the scheme great success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased at having the opportunity of initiating this Bill in the Seanad and I look forward to a thoughtful and well considered debate on the issues embraced by the Bill.  This is about the fourth or fifth Bill that I myself have actually initiated <Col N="861" /> in the Seanad and, considering the fact that I have not initiated many Bills anywhere, that, I suppose, is a reflection of the esteem that I have for the Upper House and the result as far as the Bills are concerned has been a very mature, thoughtful and well considered debate. It may be purely coincidental with your presence in the Chair, a Leas-Chathaoirligh but I notice that many of the Bills also have to deal with Shannonside or generally that area of the country.</P>
      <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to provide for the setting up of a unified harbour authority, to be known as the Shannon Ports Authority, which will take over, manage and operate the existing harbours at Limerick and Kilrush together with publicly-owned piers at Tarbert, Saleen, Kilteery and Clarecastle in the Shannon Estuary.  The proposed new authority will exercise jurisdiction over all the waters of the Shannon Estuary from Sarsfield Bridge in Limerick to a line drawn from Kerry Head to Loop Head excluding Foynes Harbour. The Bill provides enabling powers for the future amalgamation of Foynes with the new authority.</P>
      <P>The Bill also proposes to provide powers to enable the Minister for Communications to dissolve, reconstitute or amalgamate any of the harbour authorities specified in the First Schedule to the Harbours Act, 1946.</P>
      <P>The principal provisions of the Bill are to be found in the following sections:</P>
      <P>&mdash;section 3, which provides for the establishment of the proposed Shannon Ports Authority and defines its jurisdiction;</P>
      <P>&mdash;sections 4 to 7 which set out the membership of the authority and frequency of authority meetings and provide for the establishment of a board of management to carry out, with certain exceptions, the functions and duties of the authority;</P>
      <P>&mdash;sections 8 to 10 which provide for the transfer of staff from the present authorities to the new authority; preservation of their terms and conditions of service and pension rights;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;section 13, which enables the future <Col N="862" /> amalgamation of Foynes Harbour Trustees with the new authority; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;section 15, which enables the Minister to reorganise the various harbour authorities scheduled to the Harbours Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>The concept of a single authority for the Shannon Estuary is one which has been the subject of debate for many years.  It may be of assistance to Senators if I outline briefly the background to the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of amalgamating the various harbour authorities in the Shannon Estuary has been raised periodically from 1958 onwards and in 1977 a Bill designed to establish the authority was introduced but lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil that year.  Since then successive Ministers have entered into consultation with the various interests concerned with a view to trying to reach agreement on the composition and establishment of a Shannon Ports Authority.  Development over the last few years have confirmed the enormous potential of the Shannon Estuary for heavy industry. These include the ESB coal burning power station at Moneypoint; the Alumina project at Aughinish and the oil jetty at Shannon Airport.  These developments have given a great impetus to the establishment of a Shannon Ports Authority.</P>
    <P>Since assuming Ministerial responsibility in this area, the Minister for Communications has had many detailed discussions with the various interests concerned in the region and, with some notable exceptions, a broad consensus has emerged among interested parties in favour of a single ports authority which, it is generally believed, would lead to a more economical development of port facilities and facilitate the further development of the already recognised advantages of the Shannon Estuary.  These advantages include its geographic location, its width and its natural sheltered deep water which can at present cater for vessels of up to 200,000 tonnes deadweight and, with dredging, could cater for vessels of up to 400,000 tonnes deadweight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> This, then, is the background to the present Bill.  It is essentially a Bill to enable us, the legislators, to meet the wishes of local interests in the estuary region in regard to the management of what is probably their most valuable natural amenity and, as such, I am sure it will be welcomed by the House.</P>
    <P>The main advantages that can be expected to flow from the establishment of a unified ports authority for the Shannon Estuary are that it will bring about a more cohesive approach to the future planning, development and promotion of the estuary.  It will also help to eliminate the possibility of undesirable dissension between different harbour authorities in the estuary, particularly in relation to questions of jurisdiction and entitlement to harbour dues.  Unnecessary and costly duplication of facilities and services can be more easily avoided, leading to a better overall deployment of financial resources.  I also believe that the existence of a unified ports authority will have a crucial role in helping to attract further industrial development to the estuary.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that the view that a unified ports authority for the region is the best solution is not unanimous. Foynes has been historically opposed to inclusion in the proposed Shannon Ports Authority and they are supported by Limerick County Council and by the Foynes and District Community Council. They are anxious to maintain their independence and believe that their present set-up with a &ldquo;small competent board&rdquo; is the best arrangement for their purposes.</P>
    <P>In approving the establishment of the Shannon Ports Authority in August, 1985 the Government had decided that Foynes should be included in its scope from the outset.  However, following intensive consultation with local interests the Minister came to the conclusion that, however desirable the inclusion of Foynes at this stage, their forced inclusion could prove counter-productive and the Government subsequently decided to establish the authority excluding Foynes at this point in time but making provision <Col N="864" /> in the legislation for their inclusion at a later date.  The Minister recently performed the official opening of the east jetty expansion in Foynes and was most impressed with the drive and determination of the Foynes Harbour Trustees to see their port thrive and expand.  However, he still remains convinced that it is in the best interest of the Shannon region as a whole that Foynes should be part of the Shannon Ports Authority.  I hope that the Foynes Harbour Trustees will soon come to see the new authority not as a threat but as an opportunity and that they will take steps to join the authority in the very near future.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's consultation with various local interests about the Bill, it is safe to say that no issue has aroused more comment and I might add, controversy, than the question of the size and membership of the proposed authority. Many people have advanced cogent reasons as to why one area should have greater representation than another and so on.  It must be accepted ultimately however, that a successful ports authority for the entire Shannon Estuary can only be built on compromise and in today's competitive environment must act commercially. There is no end to the possible number of permutations of representation and size of the proposed authority. Ideally the Minister would wish to have an authority of 10 members or less which seems to be the maximum size for the most efficient conduct of its affairs.  However, it must be borne in mind that Limerick Harbour Commissioners alone, as at present constituted, is a 27 member body with wide representation, including local authority interests.</P>
    <P>The legitimate desire for representation of a wide variety of interests along the estuary makes it all the more difficult to contain the size of the new authority. Bearing in mind these factors, the Minister has decided that the proposed authority should have 21 members and that the composition should be on the basis of eight local authority members, divided equally between the counties of Clare, Kerry and Limerick as well as Limerick <Col N="865" /> Corporation, two chamber of commerce members, two members from the Confederation of Irish Industry, two elected shipping representatives, two representatives of labour interests and five Ministerial nominees.  This is provided for in section 4.  It is the area that aroused more comments than any of the other provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am also taking the opportunity of the establishment of the Shannon Ports Authority to make provision to change from the traditional structure under harbours legislation of a single harbour authority comprising, as in the case of Limerick Harbour Commissioners as at present constituted, 27 members, appointed mainly to present sectoral interests, which has full responsibility for the management and operation of the particular port or harbour.  This structure originally emanated from a recommendation in the report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, 1930, which considered that the management of a port was primarily a matter for the local bodies and that the citizens of the locality should be responsible for its operation, subject always to the supervision of the State in the public interest.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's view that present day commercial considerations and the competitive requirements of a modern port require a less unwieldy and more dynamic structure than that enshrined in existing harbours legislation which has now operated for 40 years.  He has decided, accordingly, that, while responsibility for overall policy and future planning and development of the Shannon Estuary will rest with the proposed new Shannon Ports Authority, responsibility for the day to day administration of the estuary will be delegated by the authority to a smaller board of management.  Section 5 of the Bill provides for the establishment of a board of management comprising the chairman and vice chairman of the authority, three members of the authority, the chief executive and another officer of the authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes that the proposed two-tier structure will be more in <Col N="866" /> keeping with the modern-day requirements of a major harbour and that the new arrangements will have the effect of facilitating efficient operation and administration.  They should enable the Ports Authority to divorce itself from the execution of settled policy in most areas, thus allowing it more time to concentrate on policy formulation and overall direction and control of the Shannon Estuary. The Minister believes that the smaller board of management will be able to deal more effectively with the various pressures and problems which will undoubtedly arise in the early years of the new authority and that it will be less subject to potential conflict of interests which can so easily arise in a large representative body such as the proposed Ports Authority.</P>
    <P>In formulating these proposals for the establishment of the Shannon Ports Authority, one of the Minister's main concerns has been to ensure that the interests of staff being transferred will be fully and totally protected.  Section 8 of the Bill provides for the transfer of staff from the existing Limerick Harbour Commissioners and any staff in the service of Kerry County Council and Kilrush Urban District Council at any pier or harbour to be covered by the proposed authority to the new authority on terms or conditions not less favourable than those which they at present enjoy.  Sections 9 and 10 provide for the interim continuation of existing superannuation schemes and the introduction of new schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister would now like to deal with those provisions in the Bill which will enable the Minister by order to dissolve, reconstitute or amalgamate a number or any of the harbour authorities specified in the first column of the First Schedule to the Harbours Act, 1946, as amended. Section 15 of the Bill deals with this.</P>
    <P>In the Green Paper on Transport Policy, published in November, 1985 reference was made to the need for the rationalisation of the organisation of ports.  It was stated that rationalisation of the structure of harbour authorities to prevent unnecessary competition for <Col N="867" /> scarce Exchequer resources is desirable and that the overall concern must be to ensure that there are sufficient and adequate portal facilities nationally and for each of the regions.  The Green Paper went on to state that local loyalties, however, sometimes cloud commercial judgment and rivalry between neighbouring ports sometimes acts as the main spur to unnecessary and costly portal development.</P>
    <P>In recent years many comments and criticisms have been made with regard to the structure and membership of the scheduled harbours.  The Dublin Docks Review Group, for example, in its report of October, 1984 stated that the structure of the Dublin Port and Docks Board was no longer attuned to the competitive requirements of a modern port and that a new Dublin Port Authority should replace the existing board.  The Green Paper also pointed out that some ports are clearly dominated by user interests, which, particularly in the case of increases in rates, have an inhibiting effect on the harbour authorities.  The Minister is convinced that large representative authorities are not the most efficient way of managing ports and harbours. He indicated in the Green Paper that he proposed to introduce amendments to harbours legislation which would provide for the disbandment of existing boards or authorities and their replacement by smaller boards some of whose members would be appointed by the Minister, that the Government had decided that legislation should be prepared for the reconstitution of the Dublin Port and Docks Board and that the management structure for the new Dublin Port Authority, as well as for Cork, Waterford and the new Shannon Ports Authority would be a two-tier structure, modelled on the lines of the division of responsibilities in local authorities between executive and reserved functions.  Accordingly, the opportunity presented by the current Harbours Bill is being availed of to provide the necessary enabling statutory provisions in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> In the case of Dublin, the Minister has already indicated publicly that he envisages early reconstitution of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  This is in line with a previous Government decision in the context of the financial restructuring of the Dublin Ports and Docks Board.</P>
    <P>One final point in relation to the restructuring of harbour authorities should be mentioned.  The Government have already decided in the context of devolution to local authorities that harbours, which now cater for little or no commercial traffic, would be handed over to local authorities.  It is intended that this decision be catered for in the present Bill and section 15 makes enabling provision accordingly.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill before the House is concerned with tidying up minor matters and standard provisions which are in the main self-explanatory.  In particular, section 16 of the Bill implements standard provisions in relation to the remuneration of officers and servants of harbour authorities in accordance with Government policy.  Section 17 deletes the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Kilrush Urban District Council as harbour authorities and inserts the Shannon Ports Authority in the First Schedule of Harbours in the 1946 Act.  Section 18 rectifies a technical drafting defect in the Harbours Act, 1976, which established the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners. Section 19 provides for the repeal of the Clare Castle Pier Act, 1933 on the establishment of the Shannon Ports Authority. Section 20 provides that every regulation made under the proposed legislation will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and will be subject to annulment and section 21 contains the short title and collective citation.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as I have stated, is primarily designed to give statutory effect to the wishes of local interests in the Shannon Estuary region to establish a unified harbour authority for the geographical unit of the estuary and to enable the structure of harbour authorities generally to be made more appropriate to the needs of the closing years of this century.  I have confidence that, as such, it will command <Col N="869" /> the full support of the House and I have no doubt also that, now that the local interests in the Shannon region are about to achieve their long-sought objective, they will unite in their efforts to ensure that the new authority becomes the dynamic force it is expected to be in meeting the needs for a developed portal infrastructure in an expanding local economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals before the House are the result of 20 years consultations and discussions.  The measure is a major disappointment and will not assist in the development of the estuary.  Therefore, we can only give the Bill a guarded welcome.  There is one section which I am extremely concerned with and I will deal with that later.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill points out the main purposes of the measure are to provide for the establishment of a harbour authority to take over, manage and operate the harbours at Limerick and Kilrush as well as certain other small harbours and public piers within the Shannon Estuary with provision for the future amalgamation with the Authority of Foynes Harbour Trustees; and to enable the Minister to effect a reorganisation of other harbours scheduled in the Harbours Act, 1946, in accordance with Government policy.</P>
      <P>I have always given encouragement to any effort by any Minister of any Government to develop and make progress on behalf of the people of that region and the nation as a whole.  This I would do having regard to the fact that we have about 240,000 people unemployed and any effort to provide additional employment is to be welcomed.  I have studied the Bill, as published by the Minister, to see if there is anything in it to help in this regard and, as yet, I have not found anything definite or concrete that would give the many young people in Counties Limerick, Kerry or Clare the least hope of employment in their own environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister wants the establishment of a single harbour authority to operate <Col N="870" /> the ports of Limerick and Kilrush.  I will deal, first of all, with Kilrush and give a Limerick man's view on the operations there as I see them, and I stress that and I am open to correction from anybody who would have a greater knowledge of the operations there than I have.</P>
    <P>Kilrush is a small port which can handle only smaller vessels up to a maximum of 700 or 800 tonnes because of the difficulty of access.  In the past, it has played an important role in County Clare and its future role is something which I am sure we are all concerned about and is open for discussion.</P>
    <P>I would welcome any development which would provide additional employment, additional business or anything which would improve the standard of living for the people in the western part of County Clare.  I will help them in any way I can by speaking for them and giving them my support and help as a public representative for the Clare area.  It is not necessary to have legislation enacted in either the Dáil or Seanad for the purpose of providing a management structure for the development of Kilrush.  The people who have been already nominated to look after the pier at Kilrush are well able to do so with what is involved and are more familiar than any outsider who would be brought in.  I would like to know what the present operations at Kilrush Harbour are and I would like to know the tonnage and frequency of vessels so that Members of this House would be aware of its role in the present day trading in the Estuary of the Shannon River and what, if anything, Kilrush can expect from an estuarial authority on which County Clare would only have two representatives. I am not certain that there was need to introduce legislation for the purposes of doing anything to provide management for the Limerick Harbour. Indeed, anyone who is familiar with the situation in Limerick will readily know that the general impression of management structures in the Limerick Harbour is that they are top heavy.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to individual members of the Limerick Harbour Board and what I learned from them would indicate that <Col N="871" /> the management team there are doing the job as best they can.  Nevertheless, the numbers employed to do what has to be done in Limerick Port must be adding additional cost to the running of the port and, therefore, may be making it less competitive than it would be if it were to succeed on its own merits.  I should like to hear from the Minister or somebody who supports the Department's view of the situation in Limerick Port.  For instance, I should like to know the number of ships that came up the estuary into Limerick Harbour, the tonnage of these ships, the volume of shipping and the actual revenue turned over during the operation of the port and docks at Limerick, and, more importantly, the House is entitled to know the actual cost of running Limerick port itself and the income from ships docking there.  These figures should be circulated as a matter of urgency by the Minister's Department to Members of both Houses.</P>
    <P>The development of the Shannon Estuary as a major port must be welcomed. It has been the subject of much discussion over the years.  The proposals before us are a result of 20 years consultation and discussion and are a major disappointment to all in the region.  The people on both sides of the Estuary in Counties Kerry, Limerick and Clare are fully aware of what has to be done to make the port successful.  Much criticism has been levelled at the agencies of Government, in particular the IDA and SFADCo on the question of greater efforts by them to promote the development of the estuary but, in fairness, it is not altogether their fault.  There are already facilities at Moneypoint in County Clare where large ships up to 200,000 tonnes can unload coal for the ESB and there are berthing facilities at Tarbert Island where the ESB also import large quantities of oil for the oil generating station there.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous, to say the least, that the docking charges to shipping lines for the use of these facilities both at Moneypoint and Tarbert Island go to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners 40 to 50 miles up river who have not spent one <Col N="872" /> penny of their own in providing for the building of any of the facilities which I have just mentioned.  Perhaps the Minister would explain why this is so.  Why, for instance, could not the moneys being generated as a result of the docking facility at Tarbert Island be used by Kerry Council for the purposes of providing roads, communications and improvements in this area?  I am sure the same applies to Moneypoint in County Clare as well as to the Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not provide for major industrial developments in the region and will not create any new jobs or investment in the Shannon Estuary. There are specific problems resulting from the construction of the major generating station at Moneypoint in the Clare region of the estuary has damaged roads. The project interfered with the running of farms and created local environmental problems.  All the dues and fees from that development, are at present being paid to the Limerick Harbour Commission, which sustained most of the inconvenience and destruction of community life but there are repercussions in Clare.  The Clare County Council have to maintain the roads and uphold the environment structure and they could do with the moneys.  The same would apply to Kerry as regards the fees for docking at Tarbert terminal.  I have no doubt that the members of Clare County Council would have little or no difficulty in determining for themselves how best the moneys could be spent in the improvement of the facilities of County Clare rather than the present situation, which allows no money whatsoever for the development of County Clare, County Kerry or County Limerick.</P>
    <P>A similar situation exists at Aughinish Island in County Limerick, 12 or 15 miles from Limerick, where Aughinish Alumina have ships bringing up raw materials and are processing them in the smeltering plant of Aughinish Island.  Even though Limerick Harbour spent none of their money &mdash; if they had it to spend &mdash; on the development of this facility, nevertheless they have taken the moneys there for the berthing or the docking of ships at this <Col N="873" /> harbour.  This is wrong.  Limerick County Council, the taxpayers and the ratepayers of the county have been involved in the colossal expenditure in this area by way of road construction, by way of supply of colossal water supplies on a 24 hour basis to the island and many other improvements such as bypasses.  I saw the water supply being constructed and it definitely interfered with many farms and was a source of hardship during the course of construction.  I know the farmers were adequately compensated; nevertheless the Limerick County Council should be rewarded with any berthing fees in that area.</P>
    <P>Only recently I was present at the opening of a £2.5 million bypass which Limerick County Council had to provide to facilitate the extra traffic on the stretch of road in Askeaton because of the development at Aughinish Island.  The water supply, which I mentioned, has cost something in the region of £6 million, but not one penny being generated as a result of the provision of these facilities is coming to the local authority to relieve the burdens of the taxpayer.  Instead the money which is generated by these facilities, provided by State expenses from the Exchequer, is going straight up the river again.  This is totally unfair, unjustified and should not continue in the future.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there are sufficient bodies, costing a lot of money to the taxpayers and working at State expense, in operation who can promote development of the estuary of the Shannon River. I am talking about the IDA, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, Kerry County Council, Clare County Council and Limerick County Council. These bodies have all the expertise available to them to examine the many plans, reports and studies already done on the estuary; they would have little or no difficulty in sitting down with officials from the Department of Finance and working out the best development necessary for the area generally.</P>
    <P>I do not see that the Minister has any hope of succeeding in making the progress we would all desire in the development of the estuary as we would want it <Col N="874" /> developed under the new type of board which he seeks.  Surely the Minister has enough sense at this stage to recognise that there are too many vested interests represented on the type of board he is talking about.  Is the Minister serious when he presents to us in his Explanatory Memorandum, a note to the effect that there are no Exchequer costs of staffing implications for the Departments of State, State bodies or local authorities as a result of this Bill.  It appears to me that we are creating just another level of bureacracy which cannot succeed because it has not been given the necessary finances to do whatever has to be done.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 13, which deals with the dissolution of Foynes Harbour Trustees we want the Minister, here or on Committee Stage, to make a firm statement to the effect that Foynes Harbour Trustees cannot be forced by the Minister into the estuarial authority unless they themselves agree.  I was in Foynes recently when the Minister visited the Harbour &mdash; the Minister of State mentioned it in his address here today &mdash; to open the extension at the pier.  I heard him say during the course of his speech that he could not force Foynes, against their will, into the estuarial authority. But who knows?  The present Minister might be replaced in office in the event of another Cabinet reshuffle.  Any personal commitment which he might have given in all good faith would certainly not have any binding effect on his successor in office.  I want the Minister to seriously consider an amendment to this section 13, to the effect that the Foynes Harbour Trustees cannot be forced against their will into the authority.</P>
    <P>In 1890 the Commissioners of Public Works made an order transferring the property in Foynes to the Foynes Harbour Trustees, who are established under the same order.  In 1932 a further order was introduced and passed by the Oireachtas. This was the Pier and Harbour Provisional Order Confirmation (No. 2) Act, 1932.  This empowered the trustees to construct new works at, and for the maintenance and regulation and <Col N="875" /> improvement of, the harbour and for other purposes.  It also defined the jurisdiction of the trustees.  In 1946 legislation was passed to make further and better provisions in relation to the membership of the harbour authorities and to the management, control, operation and development of their harbours; to provide for the charging of rates by such harbour authorities and to make certain provisions in relation to pilotage authorities and to provide for other matters.  The legislation in 1946 did not alter the jurisdiction of the Foynes Harbour Trustees as defined in the 1932 Order.</P>
    <P>I would like to make the point that Foynes Harbour has developed more rapidly than any of the other two harbours. The progress at Foynes far exceeded the development of any other harbour in this county in the same period. They have carried out improvements in jetties, roadways, land, plant and machinery, buildings, other equipment and services, dredging, reports, surveys etc., which cost a total of £6,250,000. After all that they only got in State aid and Government grants over 25 years, £570,000.  They got less than 10 per cent of the cost in Government grants.  That should let everyone know the work which has been done by the Foynes Harbour Trustees in developing that harbour to the fine port it is today.</P>
    <P>In 1963 when the proposed Shannon Ports Authority was being discussed the annual tonnage throughput at the port in Foynes was 41,394 tonnes.  It is anticipated that the tonnage for the current year, the year ending 31 March 1986, will be in excess of 800,000 tonnes.  It should be noted that progress is being made at Foynes and the port is being developed to the benefit of the local community. The number of trading vessels using Foynes in 1963 was 32 and the net registered tonnage of such vessels was 22,850 tonnes.  The number of trading vessels in the current trading year will be in the region of 300, which is an increase of 1,000 per cent, and the net registered tonnage of such vessels will be approximately 460,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> The numbers employed in the port, by ports users, ship agents and stevedores have increased substantially in the past 25 years.  The number employed on a permanent basis in 1961 was approximately 25 people while the number now employed on a permanent basis is in excess of 320 people.  It is also estimated that a further 100 permanent positions arise from spin-off services as a result of activities in the port.  It is envisaged that if trade at the port continues to increase the number of jobs will increase accordingly.  As a result of the development which has taken place and the employment which has resulted, the port of Foynes plays a major part in the welfare of this region.  It plays a significant role in the agricultural industry as it now provides the required facilities for the importation of all types of animal feed, molasses and fertilisers.  Substantial quantities of meat, sugar, cereals and ores are also exported through the port.</P>
    <P>The port also has facilities for the importation of all types of oils and domestic and industrial coal.  The port pays duties and it is estimated as a result of a recent survey that £1.5 million per annum is paid to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of PAYE and PRSI contributions on earnings in the port.  There are plans to further develop the port at a cost of £2,720,000.  It is imperative that there should be an amendment to section 13 to provide that Foynes Harbour Trustees will not be forced into this Shannon Harbour Authority without their consent.  All port users such as Foynes Harbour Board, Foynes Shipping Agents, Foynes District and Community Council, ITGWU, Molloy and Sherry Transport Ltd. and Floyd International Transport are concerned that the port remain independent.</P>
    <P>Section 4 concerns many of the people involved in this.  The total number in the authority is 21.  Is it balanced?  The Limerick Harbour Commissioners hold the view that the previous proposal submitted by them suggesting a main board of 30 members is the best way forward.  The importance of having adequate local authority representation on the Shannon <Col N="877" /> Port Authority they say cannot be over emphasised.  The four local authorities in the mid-west region together with Kerry County Council are closely involved in the planning and development of the estuary particularly in relation to major maritime industrial projects.  Tipperary North Riding County Council should be represented having regard to its present association with Limerick harbour and the considerable volume of exports emanating from the county.  Tipperary North Riding County Council have always actively helped in the development of the Shannon estuary and from the overall regional aspect should have representation as a right.  They are included in the mid-west region for other purposes and it would not be out of line if they got representation on this Shannon Port Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the Shannon Port Authority shall include two Chamber of Commerce members.  The feeling in Limerick is that the Limerick Chamber of Commerce should have these members.  The Limerick Chamber of Commerce are regional in composition with 300 members throughout the mid-west region.  They have been closely associated with the Shannon estuary since 1815.  Prior to the establishment of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners the Limerick Chamber of Commerce were responsible for all harbour operations. The Bill, therefore, should be amended to reflect the active and important role the Limerick Chamber of Commerce have played in the progressive development of the Shannon estuary over the years.</P>
    <P>With regard to financing, harbour authorities are expected to operate as commercial undertakings.  The Limerick Harbour Commissioners are seriously concerned at the proposed imposition of additional restrictive controls as set out in sections 6 and 16 which would further inhibit commercial operations.  It was hoped that this Bill would lift the minor restrictive legislative controls and update the outmoded provisions in the existing legislation particularly in relation to <Col N="878" /> financial matters, for example, the outdated provisions of section 120 of the Harbours Act 1946 which requires the consent of the Minister for Finance for borrowings of over £50,000 which is completely unrealistic in the light of changes in money values since 1946.  This is something that the Minister should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>We will be tabling amendments in relation to the representation on the board. Clare has only two representatives on the board which I think is unjust.  They have only two members of the county council. Kilrush Harbour Commissioners and Town Commissioners should be entitled to some representation as they are responsible for the port in Cappa.  I would like some clarification of this from the Minister in his reply.  I give the Bill a guarded welcome; we will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, as a Member of this House and as Mayor of Limerick I would like to welcome this Bill, the principle purpose of which is to provide for the setting up of a single unified harbour authority to be known as the Shannon Port Authority to take over, manage and operate the harbours at Limerick and Kilrush and certain other smaller harbours and piers within the Shannon estuary with further provision for the future amalgamation with the authority of the Foynes Harbour Authority if they so decide.</P>
      <P>I believe that the setting up of this broadly-based port authority offers the best way forward for the orderly development of the Shannon estuary.  In the words of the Green Paper on Transport Policy published by the Minister for Communications in November 1985:</P>
      <P>A single authority is necessary for the future exploitation of the Shannon Estuary and will lead to the more efficient use of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that this new harbour authority will facilitate the future planning and development of the estuary and will be a considerable help to the local interests scattered throughout the mid-west region in promoting the estuary <Col N="879" /> as a suitable location for further large scale industrial projects.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to recall here today that following the report by Dr. Nathaniel Lichfield, the regional planning consultant, in which he advocated the establishment of a unified, broadly-based estuarial authority, negotiations commenced in 1966 &mdash; exactly 20 years ago &mdash; under the chairmanship of Dr. Brendan Regan, who at that time was chairman of the Shannon Free Airport Authority.  Dr. O'Regan and his team put great expertise and effort into this concept.  As a result of that the Mid-West Regional Development Organisation took over from Dr. O'Regan in 1969.  I would like to pay a tribute to them also for the great work they have done in advancing and promoting this concept of a single ports authority for the area.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate all associated in the past 20 years with this effort for the setting up of a single estuary authority to administer port affairs in the Shannon estuary.  It is a matter of great regional and national importance.  I would also like to congratulate the Minister for Communications and the Minister of State for having this Bill introduced in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill I also have some reservations regarding certain of its provisions, mainly section 4 which deals with membership of the proposed new authority, section 5 which deals with the board of management, section 6 which deals with the restriction of the frequency of meetings and section 15 which deals with the dissolution, reconstitution and amalgamation of harbour authorities. With regard to the membership of the new authority, the view of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, the body who have a special standing in the region, is that a 30 member authority is the best way forward embracing all the interests in the area.  The importance of adequate local authority representation on the proposed new body cannot be over-emphasised. I support the case that has been so ably put.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> The four local authorities in the mid-west region, Limerick Corporation, Limerick County Council, Clare County Council, Tipperary North Riding County Council together with Kerry County Council are closely involved with the planning and development of the estuary particularly in relation to that important matter of the location of major maritime industrial projects.  I would also strongly advocate that the organisation specified in section 17 of the Bill to appoint the chamber of commerce members should indeed be the Limerick Chamber of Commerce.  Limerick Chamber of Commerce of which I was president in 1979 and 1980 is regional in composition. It has representatives from all over the mid-west region and from the Kerry area also.  It is for that reason that I think the Limerick Chamber of Commerce should be the nominating body and not the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Ireland for which I have great regard and respect.  A body such as the Limerick Chamber of Commerce which has been so closely associated with the promotion and development of the Shannon estuary since it was chartered, as far back as 1815, should be given due recognition in regard to their nominating right.</P>
    <P>Prior to the establishment of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners the chamber of commerce were responsible for all harbour operations in that area. Therefore the Bill should be amended to reflect the important and active role of the Limerick Chamber of Commerce in the progressive development of the Shannon estuary over these past years.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 7 the present relationship between the executives and the Commissioners of the Limerick Harbour Authority has worked very well over the years.  If anyone were to suggest otherwise, that there was friction or anything like that it has not existed between the general manager and his staff and the commissioners.  The Limerick Harbour Commissioners are noted for their decisiveness and united approach.  I would argue then that the insertion of an intermediate board could diminish the overall <Col N="881" /> effectiveness of a new authority.  I ask the Minister to have that matter considered.</P>
    <P>The development of the Shannon estuary is a matter of great national importance. For that reason the provision in section 6 of the Bill which purports to restrict the meetings of the authority to not more than six in the year except in exceptional circumstances is very restrictive. I suggest therefore that it should be deleted in the interest of the new authority because I have absolute confidence in their commonsense and commercial ability.</P>
    <P>I question the wisdom of section 15 in regard to the dissolution, reconstitution and amalgamation of harbour authorities. Reserving that power to the Minister is too far reaching.  Therefore the decisions concerning the reorganisation, dissolution or the reconstitution of harbour authorities is so important to the people of those areas that it should only take place after the circulation of a parliamentary Bill and full debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I know there are other Members of the House here who are anxious to get in on this matter.  I do not intend to detain them any longer except to say that these matters can be more fully discussed and debated at Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate all associated with its preparation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senators Kiely and Kennedy in welcoming this Bill in the Seanad as it means establishment of a Shannon Ports Authority which will take over, manage and operate the existing harbours at Limerick and Kilrush together with the publicly owned piers between Tarbert and Clarecastle in the Shannon estuary.  I believe, as Senator Kennedy has stated, that it is the way in which you will control the Shannon estuary.  I join with him in his tribute to Dr. O'Regan for his foresighted approach to Irish industry especially industry along the Shannon estuary and the way in which he has campaigned for many years to have one single Shannon <Col N="882" /> ports authority established.  I wish also to pay tribute to the Minister for taking this opportunity to bring this legislation before us.  However, the Bill misses an opportunity to review the Harbours Acts of 1946 and 1976.  Instead of one Harbours Act, 1986 we will have three Harbours Acts, one of which is nearly 40 years old.  However, we are dealing with a particular legislation now, the Shannon Ports Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Kiely, in regard to the amount of revenue that has passed through these ports and the amount of help that it gives to industry and agriculture in the whole area, that the new ports authority would stimulate industry and agriculture.  It would be a basis on which to attract industry to that region.  The number of employees it will have could be immense and the whole area could be rejuvenated.  I do agree that one cannot restrict an authority to having six meetings in a year.  The authority should have as many meetings as it wants.  Having the chairman and vice chairman and three members with the chief executive and an officer from the authority on the board of management working together is a very good and progressive way of dealing with the ports authority.  It brings people on to the management and the board.  First of all, there is the chief executive from one member of the authority and he is mixed with the chairman, vice chairman and the local members.  That is an integration and a very simple way of operating any body.  I hope that with the transfer of staff, whatever facilities they enjoy at present they will continue to enjoy under the new ports authority.  That is implicit in the Bill and it is also implicit in the Minister's statement which says this proposal goes back to 1958.  It could have gone through in 1977 except for the dissolution of the Dáil.  It is good that it is here before the Seanad.  It is non-contentious. I believe the reservations which Senator Kiely has are agreed.  He has a right to put them forward, as Foynes have historically opposed the inclusion of the proposed Shannon Ports Authority.  They are naturally supported by Limerick County Council.  This should be investigated by <Col N="883" /> the Minister to see if those views could be accommodated.</P>
    <P>The method of controlling the Shannon estuary through the Shannon Port Authority should rejuvenate the whole area and bring life and increased employment and trade.  For this I welcome the Bill.  I hope that it succeeds in doing what it has set out to do and that the staff are properly accommodated.  I would welcome this Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with sections 15 and 16 of the Bill.  It would be best if I began by looking at section 15.  This is the section which gives the Minister power to dissolve by order or to reconstitute by order or to amalgamate by order the existing harbour authorities. While it is true that any order made by the Minister under that section is subject to review by the Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 days, nonetheless, it does seem that this is a very sweeping power indeed and one that is undesirable.  I am thinking of the situation whereby it is clear to all of us that there should be a reconstitution of the Dublin Port and Docks Board. It does not seem appropriate that that reconstitution should be capable of being carried out by the Minister by order.  I wrote to the Minister some months ago asking if it would be possible to discuss with him his views on the reconstitution of the Dublin Port and Docks board.  It obviously has not been possible for the Minister to accede to that request to date. I hope that we can have discussions on this in the days ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the Dublin Ports and Docks board require reconstitution. A recommendation to do so is contained in the report of the Dublin Docks Review Group, chaired by the present Chairman of the Labour Court, Mr. Horgan, and published in 1984.  They come to the conclusion that I and many other people &mdash; indeed the Minister &mdash; had come to, that the present body is unwieldy.  It is too large.  Some of the persons on the board are in a position <Col N="884" /> where a conflict of interests is virtually inevitable.  By and large it is not the proper form of board to manage and develop a commercial operation the size of Dublin port.  The present membership of the board comprises of five persons nominated by Dublin Corporation, four nominated by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, four elected by port users, four appointed by the Minister for Communications, two representing livestock exporters, two representing trade union interests and two representing manufacturers. As the Dublin Docks Review Group said in their report, such a body is not suited to the task it is given. Instead, they recommended in that report that a new port authority, comprising of not more than eight members should be appointed by the Minister for Communications and that the new authority should be a commercial semi-State company.</P>
    <P>It is not for me at this point to say whether a commercial semi-State company is the only option available in relation to making Dublin port a dynamic and viable entity in the long term.  It is very clear to me and to everybody that the present arrangement is not suitable and is not acceptable.  However, that is a long way from being in a position to say that the Minister should have the power to change the situation by order.  Most Senators would be concerned about that power, not just in this legislation but in any legislation.  It does seem to be an excessively broad or extensive power to give to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In reading the Minister of State's introductory speech one can get the impression that the Minister for Communications may be considering a solution similar to the Shannon/Limerick estuary solution in terms of composition of the authority and that he may be thinking of a two tier system for Dublin also. I would question very much the idea of having a lot of user groups on the authority, either in relation to the Limerick estuary or Shannon or Dublin.  Apart from that I notice that there is no provision of any substance in the proposal in relation to the Shannon estuary which <Col N="885" /> may be the kind of formula which the Minister has in mind for Dublin for the work force.  One of the things that I, and my party, too, am very committed to is ensuring that the work force is adequately represented in any new arrangement for the management of Dublin Port.</P>
    <P>If the model which the Minister has in mind for Dublin were to be similar to the model he has proposed in relation to the Shannon estuary, then it is most unlikely that the work force would have any representation at all directly on the board of management, which will be the body charged with the administration of the port and which would be the more powerful of the two institutions proposed, in effect.  That is not acceptable.  It is also noteworthy that, in relation to the membership of the Shannon Ports Authority, that is, the larger body in the two tier structure, the body charged with long term policy development and planning &mdash; and again I am assuming that this model might be transferred to the Dublin Port situation &mdash; of the 21 members proposed for that authority, only two would be representatives of the work force, the same number as would be representative of the Chambers of Commerce or the same number which would be representative of the manufacturing community.  I do not think that is acceptable.  It is, of course, possible that representatives will emerge from the local authorities who would be representative of the labour interest generally.  Direct representation of two out of 21 seems to be an insult, to put it at its best.  As I said, when we come to the matter of the composition of the board of management which will effectively be the executive authority, it is most unlikely that there would be any representation at all on that body.  Despite the fact that it is conceived of as being largely an executive board that is neither here nor there, because the work force are quite as well able to make a contribution to day to day administration and to the execution of policy as any other section of society.  In many cases their contribution might well be better.</P>
    <P>I feel most strongly that when we get to Committee Stage we will have to look <Col N="886" /> very closely at section 15.  I can see that it would be appropriate, perhaps, to give the power of making orders to the Minister of the day in relation to smaller matters or the reorganisation or amalgamation or dissolution of certain authorities involved with smaller ports or harbours around the country where there would not be a great deal of national significance but the power to reconstitute by order the Dublin Port board &mdash; the port of Dublin is a multi-million pound commercial operation and carries about 40 per cent of the total tonnage coming through our ports each year &mdash; is an excessive power and one that we must look at.  It is a matter of debate whether it is best to opt for a commercial State company solution &mdash; and that I would expect would involve a one-third representation for the workforce on the board if the principles and spirit of the 1977 Worker Participation Act are applied &mdash; or whether we look at another form or organisation which might not be a commercial semi-State body but which would meet the criteria of a smaller board, a board which is competent, a board which does not include among its members persons representing, for example, livestock exporters who obviously could have a vested interest.  The size is important. The Minister is moving towards that idea here, correctly in my view.  Whether it is a commercial State body we opt for or some other institution comprising small numbers of relevant and competent people is something that would obviously be open to discussion.  I do not think giving the Minister power to do this by order would make good legislation.</P>
    <P>By way of a small point in passing but a relevant point in relation, certainly to the commercial port, it is a pity that the opportunity was not taken to repeal certain sections of the 1946 Act which put constraints in the case of the Dublin area on the Dublin Port and Docks Board in relation to its pricing policy.  If we are going to conceive of the port authorities as being in the commercial world and out there doing the business, then we have got to give them greater control and flexibility over the pricing systems which <Col N="887" /> they can apply, making them accountable, of course, in the long run if they fail to use the control effectively.</P>
    <P>I want at this stage, the Minister not having had the opportunity to meet me on the matter over the last few months since I raised the matter, to say that I feel most strongly that section 15 will have to be looked at very carefully indeed on Committee Stage.  From what has been said so far I think other Members of the Seanad share that feeling.</P>
    <P>I would like to move on to section 16. I do not want to labour the point greatly because the matter has been discussed extensively during the passage through this House of the Transport (Re-organisation of CIE) Bill, 1986 and the same arguments apply here.  Section 16 is the section which makes it incumbent upon a harbour authority in determining the remuneration or allowances for expenses to be paid to its officers or servants or the terms and conditions subject to which such officers or servants hold or are to hold their employment, to have regard to Government or nationally agreed guidelines which are for the time being extant or to Government policy concerning the remuneration and conditions of employment which are extant and in addition to the foregoing, to comply with any directives with regard to such remuneration, allowances, terms or conditions which the Minister may give from time to time to a harbour authority with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  That provision, as I argued during the passage of the CIE Bill is a recipe for industrial chaos because what that provision does is that it takes from both the union side and the authority the ability to negotiate in the end of the day the pay and conditions of employment and service of the employees.  As things now stand, it seems to me that a process which ends up at the Labour Court is an effective process by and large.  It has been proven to be a useful process over many years.  The injection of a section such as this into the existing industrial relations process will have a very detrimental effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> The correct approach for Government &mdash; and we all understand that there is not a bottomless pit and that Government cannot keep putting sums of money into any of its subsidiary agencies &mdash; is to set a financial framework within which the subsidiary agencies, in this case harbour authorities, must work.  Within that framework, dependent on their effectiveness commercially and their ability to exercise effective industrial relations processes, pay settlements will arise and will be dealt with.  To inject extraneously certain directives or guidelines in relation to pay from outside is to dismantle in effect the industrial relations system which has by and large served well in the area of public sector bodies generally.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister most strongly, between now and Committee Stage, to delete the provisions of section 16(2) on the grounds that I have given, and to allow to the harbour authorities the flexibility which one would normally expect in any commercial operation in terms of its ability to negotiate pay and conditions with its workforce.  I understand that this provision does not arise from within the Department of Communications. It is a provision that is included in all new legislation relating to State agencies or public authorities generally. That policy, which was adopted some years ago by the Department of the Public Service, seems to me to be the Department of Public Service in effect trying to evade its own responsibilities by having an ability to impose blanket directives, and it is not acceptable.  The provision has been taken out of the CIE Bill.  All of us were pleased to see that happen.  I have no doubt that if the Minister and the Government have time to consider the matter before Committee Stage the provision will be deleted from this Bill also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to establish an estuary authority has been under consideration since 1964.  All efforts before now to establish such an authority have run into difficulty mainly because there was never an agreement on the type of representation we would have on the said boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> The Bill introduced by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Peter Barry, when he was Minister for Transport and Power, fell with the last Coalition Government in 1977.  I wish to express now that the present Bill will have the same fate because, as far as can be established, the present Bill is unsatisfactory and is clearly the subject of widespread criticism in County Clare and, indeed, other counties.</P>
    <P>The main complaint in Clare is that only two nominees will be on the authority from that county.  The fact that no representative will be on the board from Kilrush harbour commissioners, who are being dissolved, is the subject of widespread upset in the west.  Mr. Jim Mitchell, Minister for Communications, who is not here, has me confused.  I am convinced that for some reason I do understand &mdash; because generally he is a nice kind of a guy &mdash; he is certainly determined to make as many mistakes as he can before he leaves Government.  The reason for my saying that is that we had the CIE Bill which had to be amended, watered down and changed.  Having listened to Senator O'Mahony I believe we are going to have a repetition of the &ldquo;Is, We's and Us&rdquo; in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this morning that there were consultations with various local interests about the Bill.  With due respect to the Minister here present, I would say that somebody should have talked to their own two Fine Gael TD's in Clare to know what was the Clare reaction to this legislation.  All I can do is come in here and say sincerely what I feel about this legislation.  In fairness, any Minister &mdash; and it would be a good exercise for the Minister Mr. Jim Mitchell, we are not supposed to make reference to persons in their absence &mdash; should get the map of the coastline that we are talking about.  I have one here and I will give it to the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, willingly if he wants it because he obviously did not see one.  He is talking about giving two representatives to Clare with a stretch there of water of the Shannon estuary and then he is going off and making five ministerial appointments. <Col N="890" /> We know where they will go.  He is making eight others &mdash; I do not know who they will be &mdash; and 13 only of local persons elected by the people.</P>
    <P>We have had praise given to another body &mdash; and I will get to it in a few minutes &mdash; and it is a pity that that was not continued.  In fairness, the Foynes body has been a success.  I do not know why it should be changed to a quite different composition of 21 members.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill gives far too much power to the Minister.  I am sure he will take another look at it before we take Committee Stage or on Committee Stage. I agree with Senator Kennedy.  The Shannon Estuary is not just a local facility like Kerry, Limerick and Clare.  The Shannon Estuary is a national asset.  I well remember the time of Dr. Lichfield, because my husband, Derry, was very involved at the time.  He would be better able to deal with this Bill if he were here today than I am, because the Shannon was sacred to him.  He understood it and knew it.  He knew the authority that should have been set up on the Shannon.  He was not small in his thinking about how many persons should be on that authority, but I could not, in his absence, agree to just two members.  While I accept that Limerick, Kerry and North Tippperary are well able to look after themselves and, indeed, should have higher representation and higher numbers, I do not like the composition of the board proposed, 13 of whom will be composed of &ldquo;these others&rdquo;.  That is a phrase which worries me, a Chathaoirligh, and you are in the lovely position where you do not have to comment but I am sure it would worry you too.</P>
    <P>We, on the Fianna Fáil side have been in favour in principle of a harbour authority. I cannot agree that the proposal is adequate or capable of meeting the development potential of the estuary.</P>
    <P>The shortcomings of this legislation are that it does not represent Clare or the northern bank of the river.  I have made reference to the map.  It proposes a board within a board which could lead only to conflict and disagreement.  There will be conflict and disagreement in a board <Col N="891" /> within a board.  There is little or no power in the Bill which would enable a major scheme of development to be undertaken. If such power is in the Bill maybe the Minister in his reply would tell me where it is.  There is an option to Foynes to stay out of the authority, which is the major weakness, and which will drastically reduce the effectiveness of the authority to plan the overall strategy for the area.</P>
    <P>Foynes Harbour is a credit to its trustees. They have opted to stay out of this. I hope they take note of section 13 of the Bill because they can be brought in by the Minister at a later stage.  The Foynes Trustees, I understand, are of the opinion at present that they are safe and may not be taken into account after this legislation is passed.  It should be noted that the Foynes authority is composed mainly of elected persons who have commonsense. Usually where there is commonsense there are good business results.  The Foynes Authority is most successful on the river and has been left out at their own request.  As I have said, the trustees are mainly composed of public representatives. It is regrettable that they have opted out but it would be better that the trustees of Foynes should be made aware that this Minister, granting unto himself the powers that he does in section 15, can do a lot of things when this legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>This is a poor Bill.  The Minister should take another look at many of the remarks that have been made and that will be made here today.  The board of management with a composition of seven members, two staff, a chairman and vice-chairman and a maximum of only three public representatives is designed to ensure that the real control of the estuary will not be left to the representatives of the people of the region.  This goes back to a remark made by Senator Kennedy early this morning.  Maybe I took him up wrongly.  In his contribution he asked that there be more discussion with the people before other decisions in the region are made.  It would be wrong for Senators to say that there is conflict between Kerry, <Col N="892" /> Limerick, Clare and the Limerick Harbour Board.  It is only together that we can make the whole Shannon Estuary a success.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Authority, as envisaged in the Bill, will be a policing authority and will regulate existing shipping traffic instead of being, as many of us had hoped, a developing authority whose main function would be to exploit the estuary for major projects in the future. When all the talk on this took place earlier on those living on the western coastline thought it was a developing authority.  Maybe I am reading it wrongly.  I do not think this Bill will give the power and the finance to the Authority for the future and for the major developments that are looked forward to by most of us.</P>
    <P>Clare County Council have done quite a bit of research on this.  They have stated that the Shannon Estuary is one of the finest national harbours in western Europe because of its deep water port facilities, availability of fresh water resources, availability of waste water disposal facilities, adequate road, rail and air communication systems.  The Shannon Estuary Industrial Location studies prepared by An Foras Forbartha indicated ten sites suitable for major industrial development of which four are in Clare on the northern shore of the estuary, three are in County Limerick and three in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>I am deeply worried about the representation. I am not saying that Clare should have so many, Limerick should have fewer and Kerry should have fewer still.  What I am saying is that 13 out of the balance of 21 should give more representation to people elected who know what is going on, not these presidents of chambers of commerce in Dublin or the Isle of Man.  All the mistakes have been made by past Governments and by this Government in giving the places on these boards to people who would not know one end of the Shannon from the other.  I am not asking for more.  I am quite happy about the representation for Kerry and Limerick providing Clare gets more than two.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> It is daft for a Dublin Minister to come in here and talk about an Authority like this and then give us two representatives &mdash; big deal.  I would like to know if it is true because it is fact in Limerick that the head office for this Authority have been located in Pery's Square, Limerick.  What is wrong with putting the head office of this Authority in Shannon Airport? There is no point coming in here one day with a Bill about Shannon and giving us nice talk.  The elected people in Kerry and Limerick would be quite happy if this office were in Shannon Airport.  Is it true that there are offices already earmarked? Maybe the name is not outside the door on a gold plate but is it true that the location of the head office has already been decided?</P>
    <P>The port authorities will not have the freedom to borrow in order to develop. Borrowing over £50,000 will have to get Government approval.  If a body like this who have been approved by the Government have to go to the Government for anything over £50,000 to do anything, what, in the name of God, are we doing? You would spend £50,000 on a small yacht that the big shots have, never mind developing some of what we think should be done when this Authority is set up.  It is leaving far too much power with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I see the structure, in the financing of this body, as being cumbersome.  You can only run into trouble.  Would the Minister tell us how this Authority will be financed?  Every Bill that comes into this House has to be cleared by so many Ministers after it has been passed that one is not too sure where it might end up.  I am quite sure that the people who are interested in this and who eventually will be on the Authority, elected or otherwise, will want to know how it will be financed.  It is from day one that you talk about finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister in talking about the background to the Bill said:</P>
    <P>It is essentially to enable us, the legislators, to meet the wishes of local interests in the estuary region in regard <Col N="894" /> to the management of what is probably the most valuable natural amenity and, as such, I am sure it will be welcomed by the House.</P>
    <P>Those lines in the Minister's address are fine but the local people are not happy with the Bill.  I accept that this type of legislation for the Shannon is needed.  I beg the Minister to let us take our time with it.  I have no worries at all that it will be one party against another in this House.  I am absolutely happy that once the right thing is done for the Shannon Estuary in this Bill that it will be a better Bill going out of here to the Dáil.  It is not right now.  That is not what the people on the west coastline want.  The Shannon Estuary is not just ours.  It is for the benefit of the nation as a whole.  I ask the Minister to redraft the Bill.  I hope that when it goes into the Dáil after leaving here that it will be a far different Bill from what is before us now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general welcome for the concept of a united harbour authority on the Shannon.  I welcome the Bill in general terms.  Basically it is a good measure that can be made better by improvements to it as we go along.  I was a member of a deputation from County Clare, the Clare County Council and the Kilrush Urban Council, who had discussions with the Minister yesterday.  It emerged from those discussions that the Minister was willing to consider suggestions as to how the Bill could be improved, how certain fears could be met and how certain additional safeguards could be included.  That is a welcome development and it is in that spirit that I intend to address my remarks this evening. While, in the course of my contribution, I may be critical of certain people and certain agencies, I will be so because of the obligation I have to ventilate the fears and concerns that are held by individuals and public bodies in relation to the implications of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on having brought this Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas after a lapse of 23 years since a unified harbour authority for the Shannon Estuary was first talked about.  The <Col N="895" /> Minister said this morning that he seemed to be coming here constantly with legislation relating to the mid-west.  He was in here yesterday with another very welcome measure in relation to preinspection. As I see it this Bill is a welcome measure which can be much improved by the contributions that are made in this House and the other House and particularly by the willingness, as expressed yesterday by the Minister, to consider objectively the views that are being put forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister this morning spoke of the developments in the past few years that have confirmed the enormous potential of the Shannon Estuary for heavy industry.  He referred to the ESB coal burning station at Moneypoint, the Alumina project at Aughinish and the oil jetty at Shannon Airport.  I, and I am sure many others, have for many years looked upon the estuary with its depth of water, its size and its shelter as being the greatest natural resource that the mid-west &mdash; if I might as a Clare man say this &mdash; and County Clare has available to it. Therefore, there is a coming together of minds as to how this great natural resource that we have in the mid-west can be developed to the advantage of the people of the region and of the nation.</P>
    <P>Clare County Council through their estuarial sub-committee, have certain reservations that I will be dealing with at length but, as is clear from the second paragraph of their report, they are in agreement with the concept of a unified authority to develop the estuary.  We have to concentrate on ensuring that the vehicle that emerges from this Bill is the vehicle best equipped to carry out the development that that estuary has the potential and capability of providing.  The concern expressed in County Clare is largely aimed at ensuring that the type of personnel who will be at the helm in promoting this project will be people with the capacity and the enterprise that is needed to get the best possible results. There is great fear that we may not get that type of personnel at the helm.</P>
    <P>The Minister and others may feel that <Col N="896" /> a lot of these fears are parochial.  There may be a certain amount of parochialism but that is on the other bank of the river and not on the northern bank.  The concerns that prevail in my county do not deserve to be classified as parochial fears. They are aimed at ensuring that the best possible management team are available as there is a possibility that we may not get the best management team.  To ensure that, the question of the balance of representation comes into it.  My argument will be based on the rights and potential of the north bank versus the south bank, although they are complementary to one another.  The northern bank of the Shannon has a potential that is equal to that of the southern bank, if not greater, and therefore in representation and the development of the estuary they must be balanced equally.  If the balance of representation proposed in the Bill remains unaltered there will be a serious imbalance and this will be against the northern bank.</P>
    <P>The northern bank extends for a total of 93 miles and it is under the jurisdiction of one local authority while the bank on the other side of the river is at least 20 miles shorter and is shared equally by two local authorities.  Nonetheless, the local authorities on the southern bank with 20 miles less of coastline are being given a total of six out of eight representatives. The river bank which is 20 miles longer is being given 25 per cent of the representation at local authority level.  The balance has to be restored in the Bill by the insertion of one or two amendments.</P>
    <P>I want to express certain criticisms of the Limerick Harbour Authority.  I have no personal axe to grind with the people who compose that body.  I enjoy a very good relationship with some of those people but I have an obligation to raise these criticisms that have been expressed to me and publicly around my county so that they can be ventilated, dealt with and proved either to be justified or unjustified. If they are not justified they can be eliminated from the balance we have to strike at the end of the day.  Either way I intend to leave many questions to be answered because that is the best way to <Col N="897" /> clear the air.  At the end of the day a clear course will ensure the successful development of the estuary.</P>
    <P>What are the criticisms being made in my county and, indeed, also in Foynes? I have with me a submission made by the Foynes Harbour Trustees and other interested parties to the Minister in January of this year.  There is a fear that the Shannon Estuarial Authority may well in the worst set of circumstances represent nothing more than a new title for the Limerick Harbour Authority, that it could consolidate the control that the Limerick Harbour Authorities have tried to exercise over the Shannon estuary in recent years and that by virtue of sections 8, 11 and 12 it is the same management personnel that will assume control, direction and development of the estuary under the new harbour authority.  I hope the Minister will clarify that point in his reply.  One of the principal fears prevailing in County Clare and along the northern bank of the river is that a management that would not appear to have distinguished themselves as far as development is concerned in the past 20 years in Limerick docks, will now have the responsibility of ensuring development of the entire Shannon estuary with the exception for some time of the Foynes harbour area.</P>
    <P>There are two other factors which are not helping to eliminate the fears I have referred to.  The first is the opting out of the Foynes Harbour Trustees.  There can be little doubt that the Foynes Harbour Trustees have been a most progressive and successful agency in relation to the development of that port.  The opting out of Foynes from the new estuarial authority plus the exclusion of the Shannon Development Company from having an effective role in the future development of the estuary is a cause of concern.  These two agencies have a track record second to none in their respective fields where development, promotion and the effective utilisation of resources are concerned. The fact that neither of these excellent agencies are to have an input into the development of the estuary is a matter that needs to be reconsidered. <Col N="898" /> An attempt should be made to establish whether an input can be arranged for both these successful development agencies so that they would have a role to play in the development of the estuary.</P>
    <P>The non-participation of the Foynes Harbour Trustees and the exclusion of SFADCo and the fact that the management personnel of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners could in certain circumstances be the promoters of the new estuarial authority is causing considerable concern in my county.  As Senator Honan mentioned, there are certain indications of a jumping of the gun going on at present by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners. She identified one example of that as the premature opening of the headquarters of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners with all the implications that this is to be the headquarters of the new estuarial authority.</P>
    <P>I wish, in amplifying that point of view, to refer to a meeting of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners as reported in the <i>Limerick Post</i> of Saturday, 14 June, 1986 and to quotations from members of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners as they appeared in this report.  One harbour commissioner criticised the intention of the Minister to reduce in the provisions of the Bill the number of the Limerick Harbour Commission from 29 to 21.  There is no doubt whatsoever in that man's mind that the new estuarial Authority is the existing Limerick Harbour Authority under a new name. Another member expressed the view that he was totally opposed to the Bill and failed to see how it had anything to recommend it to the harbour commissioners. Another member spoke of the harbour commissioners having worked very well up to now with the current structure and that it was hard to see what was wrong with that arrangement but apparently it has not worked so well in other areas.  The same member concluded by saying that the Bill inhibits the whole idea of harbour boards operating as commercial concerns.  Therefore, in that man's view, this Bill will inhibit the Limerick Harbour Commissioners at the <Col N="899" /> Shannon Estuarial Authority from operating as a commercial enterprise.  When statements like that appear in the public press giving the clear example that members of the Limerick Harbour Authority are satisfied that all that is involved here is a change of name for them with additional new controls over a waterway over which certain controls they have exercised have often been disputed, the level of fear which people have already is expanded.</P>
    <P>I wish to apologise for appearing to be anti-Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  I am not.  I am simply putting forward the reservations that so many people hold, as I feel it is my duty to do, in the expectation that these can be resolved and the fears lying behind them can be allayed. If the management of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners were to be the new management of the estuarial authority it must be said that they have not shown much interest in developments in relation to the northern bank.  I will be quoting some examples later of how they have shown that they have a capacity to frustrate and smother certain interests on the northern side who want to participate in the commercial activities on the River Shannon.  I consider it crucial that steps be taken to ensure that there is a balance in the representation of the northern bank on the new estuarial authority.  At its worst, the northern bank &mdash; which is effectively County Clare &mdash; could end up with just two of the 21 members of the new estuarial authority.  That is a possibility. If that happens the problems I have spoken about will not fade away.  They will grow and that will be to the detriment of the entire development.</P>
    <P>There are many examples &mdash; I do not intend to go into all of them but I will use one or two &mdash; of this capacity, as it is perceived on the northern side, to frustrate certain interests from participating in activities on the Shannon.  I read that one of the factors which gave rise to this legislation was the setting up of a tribunal of inquiry into the position in ports and harbours by the then Government in <Col N="900" /> 1926.  There is one significant column in the report which was issued three years later.  Page 199 dealt with pilotage on the River Shannon.  As far as that tribunal was concerned, they clearly stated that the limits of pilotage for the Limerick Harbour Authority were not defined. They recommended that these limits should be defined and that the jurisdiction of the Limerick Harbour Authority should be clearly established.  That has not happened.</P>
    <P>I referred to certain frustrations that private enterprise in the northern bank has encountered from the Limerick harbour Authority.  They have experienced a dog in the manager type attitude.  CW Shipping at Fountain Cross, Ennis, County Clare, are an Irish company. They recently purchased tugs for use on the Shannon in anticipation of the movement of coal from the Moneypoint station. They employed fully qualified staff. In fact, their vessel captain has the highest qualifications of any similar officer operating in the Shannon estuary. They applied to the Limerick Harbour Authority for permission to operate on the River Shannon.  They were led on a merry-go-round which brought them nowhere.  The Limerick Harbour Authority claim to have the authority to issue an exclusive licence for tuggage or towage on the Shannon estuary.  That is given to a company called Shannon Marine.  When one tries to establish what Shannon Marine is, one is led into a maze of associate companies &mdash; Marine Transport Services in Cork, Clyde Shipping, Irish Marine Holding.  It is almost impossible to discern which company is which, with overlapping shareholding interests and so on.</P>
    <P>The Limerick Harbour Authority claim total jurisdiction over the Shannon Estuary despite the recommendations of the tribunal of inquiry which was established in 1926.  Its recommendation was that the jurisdiction of the Limerick Harbour Authority over the Shannon should be clarified.  The harbour authority in Limerick did not respond positively to the application made by an Irish company on the northern bank to operate commercially <Col N="901" /> in the Shannon Estuary.  In fact there was indecent haste in providing, through one of these companies I have referred to, similar towing facilities on the Shannon, the aim of which would appear to be to eliminate the enterprise which was appearing on the northern bank.</P>
    <P>The concern in County Clare, therefore, is quite understandable.  There is also the saga in relation to harbour dues in respect of coal landings at Moneypoint. I ask the Minister to let me know, when he is replying to the debate how much has been collected, where these dues are now, under whose control they are and how much, if any, has been expended. Clare County Council are the legal harbour authority for Kildysart harbour on the Shannon.  They have operated since 1952 in that capacity.  Clarecastle harbour trustees, as reconstituted by the High Court two years ago, are a harbour authority also on the northern bank.  They are now determined to exercise their rights in the area of pilotage and towage on the Shannon.  We may be facing a situation where the justification of rival claims will be tested somewhere near Loop Head.</P>
    <P>I want to know what are the precise limits.  They are not defined in relation to the Limerick Harbour Authority.  How can harbour dues, in relation to harbours on the northern bank, be claimed by the Limerick Harbour Authority?  I appear to be quite hard on the Limerick Harbour Authority.  That is not my intention.  My intention is to bring out into the open arguments which are being made, for the purpose of clarifying where everybody stands in relation to rival claims.  It is only when we have such clarification and know precisely the limitations of the various agencies involved at present on the Shannon, that we will be in a position to argue and to debate the issue in a clear and open fashion.</P>
    <P>The refusal of Foynes to participate has caused considerable concern in Clare. For the last 25 years we have witnessed remarkable growth and development in Foynes harbour.  There has been a major investment in harbour facilities there with £6.5 million being spent.  It is planned to spend an equivalent sum in further <Col N="902" /> development over the next few years. Foynes will claim, as they do in this report, that during that period they experienced a steady decline in activity in the docks.  This has been complicated by restrictive practices among the work-force, the cost of redundancies and the fact that now only one-seventh of the workforce who were employed at Limerick docks 25 years ago are employed there today.  Of the 50 or so workers employed by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, 50 per cent are in a management or supervisory capacity.  The docks are witnessing a declining trade in cargo.  The tonnage capacity of the docks in Limerick was 495,000 tonnes during 1985, roughly half the total tonnage at Foynes.  I am sure Limerick Harbour Commissioners will refute that figure.  They will possibly advance a figure of about 3 million tonnes.  That, of course, is related to landings at Tarbert, Moneypoint, Aughinish and the oil jetty at Shannon.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to do down Limerick. There could be an excellent future for Limerick docks if it is understood that the Limerick Harbour Commissioners will not have total control over developments on the estuary.  The future of Limerick docks, the northern bank and, I am sure, the southern bank, which hopefully will include Foynes in time to come, can be assured provided that there is equal and balanced co-operation from all interests involved in the development of the estuary.  I am sure that, at the end of the day, Limerick docks may well experience very substantial growth, but that growth can only come in tandem with growth along both banks of the river.  It cannot and must not be achieved at the expense of growth on the northern bank.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed by other Members in relation to the two-tier management system.  That is a new concept. I am told that this has been successful in continental ports.  We have a lot to learn from our continental neighbours.  Perhaps there are advantages in that system. For it to win general acceptance it must have balance within it.  The estuarial committee of Clare County Council are totally opposed to the concept of a board of <Col N="903" /> management.  My viewpoint may not be on all fours with their's.</P>
    <P>The board of management will be comprised of seven persons.  These will be two officers, one the chief executive of the Authority and the other nominated by the chairman of the Authority following consultation with the chief executive officer of the Authority.  Therefore, we have two officers and five members. Senator Honan said that not more than three of these would be members of local authorities.  I admire her faith.  It might not even be as good as that.  I say that, because the board of management will be elected from an overall authority in which local authority members will be a minority of eight out of 21.  Therefore, it is conceivable that no elected member of a local authority would find their way on to the board of management of the estuarial Authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider amending this if it is his intention to proceed with that proposition.  The proposal could read: &ldquo;The Chairman of the Authority, the vice-chairman of the Authority, the chief executive officer of the Authority and three members who shall be elected by the Authority at least one of whom shall be from each county.&rdquo;  Other members may feel that it could be strengthened further by the addition of the words &ldquo;at least one of whom shall be a member of a local authority from each county&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to put the Minister on guard, as it were, so that he can anticipate some of the points that I will be making on Committee Stage.  It is in the interest of the northern and southern banks to achieve a balance.  As far as local authority members are concerned this could be done by having four from either side or by having an equal number from either side.</P>
    <P>As regards non-elected members, where will the two chamber of commerce members come from?  What influences will be used to ensure their election?  That provision could be tightened in order to ensure balance.  The words &ldquo;one from the northern bank and one from the southern <Col N="904" /> bank&rdquo; could be added.  In relation to the two manufacturing members and also the two elected members, who I understand represent shipping interests, again the same principle applies.  We have a mechanism in the Bill which would ensure a balance in representation and, through that, confidence and encouragement for the proposed Authority.</P>
    <P>I would also like to have clarification of what is proposed in section 7 because it relates to what I have just referred to; concerned shipping members and the manner in which these will be elected so as to constitute a balanced representation from both sides of the river.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the fears that exist concerning certain sections of the Bill particularly sections 8, 11 and 12.  It is feared that the Limerick Harbour Authority will attempt to use these sections to transform the control they presently exercise over the estuary into a permanent arrangement.  I might have been very critical of certain agencies and people but I have criticised them with the best of intentions.  It is necessary to clarify the matter so that interested agencies and parties can continue the debate in an atmosphere which is as free as possible from misunderstanding and ambiguity.</P>
    <P>The concept behind what we are seeking to achieve deserves support.  We can make the necessary improvements and the changes within the Bill which will be required to ensure the co-operation of all concerned in bringing about in the Shannon Estuary a development of commercial activities which will benefit not alone the mid-western area but the entire country.  Above all, we must be guided by a determination to ensure that the means, personnel and systems that are used to achieve the development of the Shannon Estuary are the best available and they are free of all constraints, parochial or otherwise, so that at the end of the day we will have an estuarial authority which will provide the employment, benefits and the many other good things that can come from such a development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChristyKirwan" hpid="Mr. Kirwan Mr. Kirwan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirwan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I heard of this Bill <Col N="905" /> it aroused my interest given that for ten years I served as a member of the Dublin Port Authority and had the honour and distinction of serving as its vice-chairman and subsequently as its chairman, throughout a difficult time for Dublin Port.  I was intrigued to see what would be produced by way of a Harbours Bill, 1986.  When I read the Bill it occurred to me that there was a major preoccupation with the proposed reorganisation of the harbour authorities in the Shannon Estuary. It may be highly desirable to weld into one single authority harbour authorities and bodies that service maritime requirements from the Shannon Estuary right up to Limerick.  When one reads the Bill carefully, one finds that many of the provisions which were technically designed to deal with Shannon could be applied with remarkable ease to all ports in the Republic.</P>
      <P>Sections 15 and 16 are relevant to all port authorities.  Section 15 is the most far-reaching.  It virtually allows for legislation by the stroke of a pen rather than by due process.  The Minister can, for example, by order dissolve, reconstitute or amalgamate any one or more of the authorities listed in the First Schedule of the Harbours Act, 1946, and in that order he may, if he so desires, specify the name of the new Authority.  He can specify the membership and constitution of that Authority.  Here the experience I had as a port authority member comes into high relief because I was a lone voice in proclaiming to all and sundry that the Dublin Port and Docks Board was the last vestigial reminder of Victorian England with representatives from almost every conceivable interest managing the board.</P>
      <P>We all know about the committee that sat down to devise a horse and because it was a committee surfaced with a camel. Section 4 of this Bill provides:</P>
      <P>The Shannon Ports Authority shall consist of the following members:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) eight local authority members appointed as to two each by the local authorities mentioned in the second column of the said Part I opposite <Col N="906" /> the mention in the first column of the said Shannon Ports Authority;</P>
    <P>That is language which is designed by parliamentary draftsmen to obscure one's normal view.  It also provides for two Chamber of Commerce members, two manufacturer members, two labour members &mdash; I suppose I could hardly argue about the addition of that element into the composition &mdash; two elected members and five nominated members. I recall telling everybody on the Port and Docks Board that to expect that kind of brew to effectively oversee and administer a port like Dublin, Cork or the Shannon estuary simply boggled the imagination, particularly bearing in mind that they merely attend port authority meetings at best for a couple of hours once a fortnight.  I suggested at that time that perhaps the Minister would be well advised to at least envisage a type of a board that could effectively guide, help, assist and direct the executive authority. Curiously enough the only catalyst which moved anybody in that direction was the claim that Dublin Port was the exemplar for industrial unrest.  The then Minister for Labour set up a group under the chairmanship of John Horgan, the chairman of the Labour Court, and he issued a report in which he stated that the Dublin Port and Docks Board as presently constituted was, to say the least, antiquated &mdash; I am taking some liberty with the language he used &mdash; and that a smaller more effective and much more dynamic board should be appointed.  I had the distinction and honour of being the only board member at the time who offered his resignation in order to give full implementation to that recommendation. Apparently there was some difficulty at ministerial level.  There appeared to be some discontent on the part of the Minister for Transport that the Minister for Labour should interfere in an area for which he was responsible and somewhere along the line the report prepared by John Horgan got buried and joined all of the other dusty tomes which decorate most of our Parliamentary buildings. Nevertheless, that report is still there. <Col N="907" /> The argument for the composition of the type of board which should service the various ports through the country is still valid.</P>
    <P>This Bill, for example, makes provision that the Minister has the authority, if he so wishes, to transfer the assets of the Authority and, indeed, the liabilities, to anybody he may specify.  It also provides that he can make an overall blanket provision for any matter he considers necessary or desirable in the maintenance of the operation of the authorities.  In fact, when I read the Bill, the only conclusion I could come to in respect of the only brake that appeared to be extant in respect of the exercise of the Minister's powers, is that an order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas before such an arrangement or such an order becomes effective, unless a vote to annul it is passed by either House within a specified period.</P>
    <P>Again, and I may be wrong on this, this is a subjective judgment, such an order can only be either effective or annulled.  It cannot be amended.  I stand correction on that but I searched long and diligently through the various documentation to arrive at that conclusion.  I hope I am right after all the work I put into it but if I am wrong, I will accept it. That is how I view it.  There is a body of opinion among constitutional lawyers, or so I am advised, that that type of broad enabling legislation is extremely dangerous, for reasons that should be clearly obvious to the Members of the House.</P>
    <P>If we take section 16 of the Bill, this is a section which affects all harbour authorities and, most particularly and, indeed, almost to the point of exclusivity, all of the employees of harbour authorities and makes provision for the alteration of the conditions of employment in so far as they will be inhibited from negotiating their contract of employment, their wages rates and their general conditions of services freely as they have been able to do up to now.  For example they can run into extreme difficulty in negotiating allowances and the terms and the general run of the conditions of service under which they work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> This proposal is to be achieved within the parameters of this Bill by an amendment to the 1946 Harbours Act and the logical conclusion to section 16 is that harbour authorities will no longer have the power to negotiate freely with their employees and that it would be as well for the Department of the Public Service to conduct all the negotiations in this area, particularly the negotiations on remuneration, allowances and conditions of service.</P>
    <P>Section 14, subsection (3), of the Transport (Re-organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Bill, 1986 had a virtually identical provision to the provision in section 16 of the Harbours Bill.  Section 29 of the Transport Bill and section 2 of the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition), (Amendment) Bill, 1986 are also identical in this area.  The passing of section 16 into the law itself represents a change in the conditions of service and the overall prospects of employees of the various authorities.  Notwithstanding that six months ago the Minister issued a Green Paper on Transport Policy in which there was a chapter relating to ports and on which I commented at the annual convention of the Chartered Institute of Transport. Apparently in general terms this had a forward looking perspective and was accepted by those who read it as an indication that Government thinking was to encourage commercial reality in port affairs.  The present Bill, in so far as I view it and in so far as I can understand it, enshrines regressive elements deeply reflective of current Government thinking. I am aware, for example, that the Association of the Irish Ports made a submission to the Department on the Green Paper and in that submission, I am advised &mdash; I am no longer a member of that body but I still have some friends who are members &mdash; the association welcomed the positive proposals contained in the Green Paper and, indeed, made further proposals which in their view would be of benefit to the commercial and trading life of the nation.  As far as I am aware and as far as I can ascertain, <Col N="909" /> there has been no reaction to these proposals. They would appear to have been ignored by the Department.</P>
    <P>There are implications for all harbour authorities in those sections of the Bill which relate to the Shannon ports in so far as they can be applied beyond the Shannon ports by order of the Minister. For example, the Minister may, by regulation, determine reserve functions to the new board or the board of a new authority. The exercise of the powers, duties and functions which are not reserved will be performed, according to the Bill, by a board of management.</P>
    <P>Other sections deal with transfers of staff, superannuation schemes and the continuation of legal proceedings, the maintenance and the devising of by-laws and various orders which go to make up the administrative ramifications of large and small ports.  Of particular interest to me is the aspect of the Bill as it affects those ports which operate pilot facilities, for example, the continuation of pilotage authority functions through existing statutory pilot committees which are of longstanding and, perhaps, to most outsiders, appear as convoluted as <i>The Irish Times</i> crossword.  Nevertheless, they exist on a substantially singularly, egalitarian basis in that the pilots themselves constitute 50 per cent of the dichotomy which determines the level of pilotage services.  These all appear to have been ignored in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the boards should be reorganised.  In my view and with respect, this is a view set against the backlog of some 12 years' experience in the administration of ports, occasionally stopping them but only occasionally, this is bound to give rise to some problems in complying with the pilotage orders which have been made and which, it was expected, would continue to be made under the Pilotage Act, 1913.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to again re-emphasise what many people have described as a mental aberration on my part, that the constitution of these various port authorities, as set out in the Bill, is merely an extension and a continuation of the Victorian <Col N="910" /> principle of paying obeisance to all of the various interests which allegedly use the ports.  For example, again if I take the metropolitan area of Dublin, for no reason other than that it is the biggest port and serves one third of the total population of the State, we have representatives of the Chamber of Commerce on that board.  They subscribed to the production of this document by John Horgan and actually recommend it as being their policy, the Chamber of Commerce policy, on which ultimately John Horgan produced his recommendation that as the board, as currently constituted, was antiquated, a vestigial reminder of imperial days it should be reconstituted on a much more efficient and businesslike arrangement.  Yet on that Dublin Port and Docks Board the Chamber of Commerce nominees voted against this document.  We have on the Port of Dublin representatives from the cattle trade.  It has been so long since a cow walked up the gangway in Dublin port that the marine employees there would not know what it was if they saw one coming up.  We still have two representatives of the Cattlemens' Association. One of them is the father-in-law of the Minister for Finance.  We also have on that board representatives of the Confederation of Irish Industry who continually and consistently over the years have complained about the level of service being offered by the port and who encourage their members to send all of their containers &mdash; more than 60 per cent of the total movement of container traffic in the State &mdash; out through land to Stranraer.  Apparently, they allege it was cheaper to meet the transport charges by sending containers or boxes by road to land and have them dispatched at Stranraer to serve the United Kingdom area.</P>
    <P>This is the type of people with their dual loyalties whom it is suggested that the Minister should continue as the bodies to maintain these ports.  There is an urgent need to dispense with the &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; mentality in the Department of Communications.  Somebody had better dig up people with sufficient vitality to say that if we are about to tell people <Col N="911" /> in the market place how to run their business, then we will have to have a go at it ourselves, if for nothing else but to demonstrate to those to whom we lecture that at least we can do it.  If you talk turkey to a port authority and say you should run it on a business basis, with due regard to all the dynamics and the movements of modern business, trade and commerce, you do not penalise them by producing a Bill which has deeply embedded in it the Dickensian appreciation of how a port should be administered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  This is something well beyond my normal area of interest.  I have had an interest in the constitutional operation of harbour commissioners since my period as a member of the Cork Council of Trade Unions and particularly my period as President of that body.  I have had my attention drawn to the same two sections that Senator Kirwan referred to at some length.  I will refer to them fairly briefly.  Neither myself nor Senator Kirwan has any objection to the involvement of the State in commercial enterprises.  Nor would we particularly believe that the involvement of the private sector necessarily enhances anything to any great extent.  It is one thing to have a position about the role of the State in the area of enterprise and development and another thing to identify what looks like a gratuitous transfer of power back to a central body for no particular reason.  In the context of a Bill which is identified as having a specific purpose to do with one area of development to stick in clauses which have enormously far-reaching implications for every harbour authority in the country seems to me to raise serious questions. To make a whole range of areas administratively and politically far less difficult for a Minister, whoever he might be, suggests that what we have here is an attempt to get rid of the inconvenience that is known as the Oireachtas in return for a far more convenient way of dealing with it.  I have a memo here from the Deputy General Manager of the Cork <Col N="912" /> Harbour Commissioners to the Commissioners dated 11 June 1986 which was supplied to me and which therefore I presume is for public use:</P>
      <P>...Section 15 has most serious implications for the Board as the Minister may, by Order, dissolve, reconstitute or amalgamate all schedule one ports which includes Cork.  The Bill does not specify the manner of such reconstitution but it is possible that the proposals for Shannon Port Authority might be used as a model for other ports.  This could result in a two tier system with reduced membership of the main board.</P>
      <P>...It will be noted also that the Minister may, by Regulation, determine reserved functions of the Board of a new authority and the exercise of powers, duties and functions, not so reserved, would be performed by a Board of Management.</P>
      <P>They go on to worry about the implications of section 16 of remuneration of staff.  It is quite astonishing that the section proposes to bring control of all rates of pay, conditions, etc. directly under the Department of Communications and the Department of the Public Service.  I have no great faith in the regulation of wages by central authority.  This is the second time inside a period of less than two months that we have been presented with legislation in which there is an attempt by central Government to interfere further in the remuneration policy of what are effectively delegated companies.  It was attempted in the case of CIE and it is being thankfully removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have it again here.  I find it difficult to understand that Governments which are in some part ideologically opposed to the principle of price control and regard it as a serious inhibition and interference with the operation of the market and have now abolished price control &mdash; and given the present rate of inflation that is perfectly justified &mdash; can apparently claim to themselves at the same time and retain for themselves the right to control the price of labour and <Col N="913" /> the right to insist on particular rates of payment for every schedule one port in the country.</P>
    <P>I do not have any particularly intense views about the composition of harbour boards, although as Senator Kirwan rightly says, there are certain anomalies in their composition which defy all logic in my view.  Nevertheless, it is not something that I feel strongly about.  I do feel strongly that any attempt to draw further powers into the Minister's office or to the Minister himself in the area of control of remuneration and any attempt to give the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> by way of statutory instrument to restructure harbour authorities, needs a good reason.  Convenience is not a good reason or the fact that it can be done easily is not a good reason.  Statutory instruments, in my view, ought to be methods of administering details and they would be inappropriately covered by legislation.</P>
    <P>It is a nonsense to regard as &ldquo;administrative details&rdquo; major vehicles for commercial development, industrial development and for transport development like harbours as big as Dublin or Cork to be regarded as a nonsense.  This is, in fact, a major instrument of policy being reserved to the Minister to be handled by statutory instrument.  I would be very interested &mdash; and we can come back to this again on Committee Stage &mdash; to know the reasons in detail if there are any reasons in terms of overall policy for the provisions of sections 15 and 16.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Mitchell for bringing this very important and vital legislation before this House today.  From the Kerry point of view, it is more than welcome and has been long sought for.  Unfortunately, having listened to previous speakers, I fear for the success of this Bill. Having listened to people even from my own side of the House speak about fears and suspicions before the proposed new body has even taken off the ground I genuinely fear for the future success of the proposed harbour authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the sentiments <Col N="914" /> expressed by both Senator Kennedy and Senator Howard today in that respect.  Given the Kerry point of view, I feel that in any future development along the Shannon Estuary we could only benefit.  It is well recognised that the Kerry coastline is probably the most suitable for development.  This is recognised in the Foras Forbartha report which was produced and presented in May 1983.  It recognised the Ardmore Point-Bally-longford area as an exceptionally good site and, perhaps, the only one capable of satisfactorily accommodating the most onerous industrial types, particularly oil-related. For that reason, I feel that if we had such a body to vigorously promote the Shannon Estuary abroad, and that because of our location and because of the advantages we enjoy along the Kerry coastline we would only benefit.  Since the Lichfield report in 1965 which recommended the establishment of a unified port authority, representatives of all interests on both banks of the estuary and various Ministers responsible for harbours, have favoured the idea of a single unified authority for the Shannon estuary. However, despite the efforts and goodwill and support of various Ministers responsible, no real progress has been made.  But for the 1977 Bill introduced in the Dáil by Deputy Peter Barry, which subsequently lapsed on the change of Government, there was no real honest effort.</P>
    <P>The present legislation, whereas it may not provide everything that was sought and it may not represent the single estuarial authority that was promised, is a positive effort and should be given a chance.  This is the first step towards the formation of the type of ports authority envisaged by Dr. Lichfield in 1966.</P>
    <P>Since pre-Viking times the Shannon estuary has been the centre of commerce and trade.  In his book, <i>Maritime Ports of Ireland</i> Anthony Marmion wrote:</P>
    <P>The immense capability of the Shannon will then be called into action, creating new objects of commercial and manufacturing enterprise, giving remunerative employment to thousands, <Col N="915" /> perhaps millions, of the population and diffusing over its contiguous districts animation, wealth and abundance where lately apathy, poverty and want so appallingly prevailed.</P>
    <P>Indeed, his words could be equally as applicable today to the current scene. Marmion also discussed the possibility of foreign capital being invested in the development of the estuary at that time. At that time also Tarbert was being proposed as a trans-Atlantic package station and there was considerable commercial activity along the estuary from Kerry to Limerick city.  Numerous historians of the time have commented on the amount of trade and commerce carried on between places like Saleen Port and Ballylongford and Saleen Pier and Tarbert with Limerick city.</P>
    <P>Marmion, although his dream is not yet fully fulfilled, would be rather happy with developments along the estuary over the past 20 years.  Since 1965 the development of maritime industry in the estuary has been quite spectacular.  In that year the oil terminal, which caters for 60,000 ton vessels was completed at Foynes Island for Irish Cement Limited.  This was followed in 1969 by the opening of Tarbert Power Station with its marine facilities which have accommodated vessels up to 80,000 tons.  In 1973 the oil jetty at Dernish Island was completed to serve the aviation needs of Shannon Airport.  This, no doubt, led to the decision by Aeroflot &mdash; the Russian airline &mdash; to locate their aviation fuel tank farm near the jetty, thereby giving extra employment and revenue to Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The construction of the Aughinish Alumina plant was completed in 1983. At full production the plant is expected to generate cargoes of 3 million tons per annum and give permanent employment to almost 800 people.  In 1979 the ESB commenced construction of their coal-burning power plant at Moneypoint. When completed, it is expected to consume 2 million tons of coal per annum <Col N="916" /> and give employment to approximately 350 people.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been a further extension to the east jetty at Foynes which will accommodate vessels up to 35,000 tons.  In 1983 Kerry County Council granted planning permission to Aran Energy for a refinery at Tarbert.  However, due to the absence of a commercial oil find off our coast, it is unlikely that any developments will take place at this location in the near future.</P>
    <P>The developments that have taken place in the Shannon Estuary are ample evidence of the many natural advantages the estuary possesses.  For example, since 1979 the amount of cargo coming through the harbours has increased from 1.6 million tons to 3.5 million tons at present level.  Prior to 1980, the largest vessel to enter the estuary was just under 80,000 tons.  In April 1985 the <i>Berge Master</i> a vessel of 143,745 tons berthed at ease at Moneypoint.  Both these aspects are indicative of the real potential we have in the estuary.  I will refer briefly here to the Lievense report prepared for the Limerick Harbour Commissioners which was published quite recently.  This report was set up to examine the feasibility of dredging a channel for large vessels.  I will quote from a report in the <i>Limerick Leader</i> at that time:</P>
    <P>The Shannon Estuary could be opened as a trans-shipment gateway to the rest of Europe if a £5 million dredging operation, which would allow access to ships of 400,000 tons, was carried out it was claimed this week by one of the top port designers.</P>
    <P>Mr. L.W. Lievense, who headed the team of Dutch consultants who completed a report on the estuary for Limerick Harbour Commissioners told the <i>Limerick Leader:</i> The Shannon Estuary is like a sleeping beauty awaiting to be kissed awake from the technical and nautical point of view.</P>
    <P>I agree totally with the sentiments expressed by Mr. Lievense.  If a channel was dredged to a depth of 25 metres, it would allow vessels of up to and over 400,000 tons to come up the Shannon quite easily. <Col N="917" /> The cost would be in the region of £6 million and for such a small sum of money serious consideration should be given to having this work carried out as soon as possible.  If it was carried out, the estuary would then rank among the finest in the world.  It would be a major attraction for foreign investment and would also become a major trans-shipment centre for bulk commodities from giant vessels to smaller ships which could enter the shallower European ports.</P>
    <P>In the past 20 years enormous sums of money have been spent by European and Japanese ports in dredging, land reclamation and ancillary harbour works to cater for the rapidly increasing ship sizes.  Rotterdam, Antwerp, Le Havre and Marseilles are specific examples.  As a result, Rotterdam has spent £30 million to raise its capacity in accommodating vessels of 250,000 tons to 350,000 tons.  When we consider the potential of the Shannon estuary <i>vis-a-vis</i> other ports, in particular Rotterdam, a case must be made for having the estuary properly dredged to ensure that ships of this size can come up along the estuary, thus making it more attractive for foreign industrialists to locate industry here.  It is against this background of growth and development that responsible and various groupings of people along the estuary have seen the need and promoted the concept of a unified and representative authority to promote and develop the estuary in the best interests of the region and the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that this Bill is before us to provide for the establishment of a Shannon Port Authority to take over, manage and operate the harbours at Limerick and Kilrush as well as the piers at Tarbert, Clarecastle, Saleen and Kilteery. As I have said, it is not the total or ideal solution as Foynes is not included &mdash; at least for the present.  Nevertheless, it will have the effect of setting up a unified and broadly based authority to control, promote and develop the great natural advantages of the estuary.  Hopefully <Col N="918" /> in time Foynes will see the advantages of joining the authority and will come in.  As has been mentioned already by Senator Howard and other speakers, Foynes has every right to stay out of the proposed new authority until the trustees are certain that it is workable and that it will operate in the best interest of the whole estuary not as in the past, when I feel it was associated too closely with Limerick and controlled too much by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Some criticism has been levelled at the Bill in general here this morning.  I have some reservations which I would like to state.  Some criticism has been made of limiting the membership of the board of the new authority to 21.  Limerick Harbour Commissioners in a submission to the Minister some time ago put forward the idea of having 30 members on the board.  But I feel that it should be pointed out that in the UK and on the Continent almost all the harbour authorities are small boards of eight to 12 members,. Belfast has 12 members, all appointed by the Government.  Copenhagen is an exception with a board of 19 members.  I feel that a large, unwieldy type of board would not be workable as has been proven in the case of many boards which have been set up in this country in the past.  A small board of interested members would be far more effective in vigorously promoting the estuary than a group of county councillors arguing over their respective sides of the estuary.  This was demonstrated here by some speakers this morning.</P>
    <P>The choice seems to be either a small board of eight to 12 members all appointed by the Minister or a large representative board with a smaller management board to look after the day to day operation of the port.  The Minister describes it as a two-tier system.  I feel the Minister opted rightly.  With his experience he, more than anyone, recognises the fact that large unwieldy boards are almost unworkable: smaller boards tend to be more effective.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed also about local authority representation on the port authority.  A case could be made for <Col N="919" /> having an extra representative from Clare County Council and from Kerry County Council to achieve a more even balance.  The point has been made that with four local authority representatives, two from Limerick County Council and two from the corporation, it will mean that there will be a balance in favour of Limerick.  A case could be made for having one representative each from Kerry and Clare added to the list of local representatives.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill the main board will meet every two months.  This is not popular with the local authorities. At a Kerry County Council meeting last Monday this point was raised.  Members felt that they would be left out in the cold as the management committee will be the real driving force.  A case could be made for having the main body meet at least once a month.  To go back to my previous point, however, I feel that large boards tend to be talking shops rather than sources of action.  Provision should be made on the management board for representatives from Clare, Limerick and Kerry County Councils.  This could allay some of the fears and suspicions that have been mentioned here today.  I would like the Minister to deal with that point when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to Chamber of Commerce members.  Senator Kennedy who was a former chairman of Limerick Chamber of Commerce made the case that Limerick Chamber of Commerce should have the power to nominate two members.  I think that this would be very unfair and I am rather surprised that Senator Kennedy should have made that suggestion.  A case could be made for Tralee Chamber of Commerce having a say in nominating someone from the Chamber of Commerce.  I do not think it would be right that members should be nominated by the National Association of Chambers of Commerce.  Nevertheless, if the members had to come from Kerry, Clare or Limerick there might be some justification for nominating these members by the Association of Chambers of Commerce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> Section 14 of the Bill gives the Minister the power to reorganise by order all harbour authorities without reference to the Dáil.  This point has been covered by Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator Kirwan today.  I think it is a dangerous provision which, I am sure, will be changed before the Bill is passed.  It is a rather controversial section and will be resisted as any future Minister could do as he wished with any port authority including the new Shannon port authority.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill will also be strongly opposed by the port authorities and the unions as it gives the last word to the Minister in regard to staff and wage negotiations.  Senator Kirwan made this point here this evening.  It could also have an adverse effect on industrial relations.</P>
    <P>However, having voiced some of my concerns about the Bill I feel that there is a great danger that if county councils and other interests start kicking up a row about the question of representation the Minister may decide to drop the Bill altogether and leave well enough alone.  This would be most unfortunate.  Surely some of the criticisms that were voiced about the Bill this morning could have been made before the Minister brought the Bill forward to this stage.  Ample opportunity was given by the Minister to all interested groups to voice their opinions.  It was as a result of taking all these opinions into consideration that the Minister came up with this Bill.  People who object so vehemently to the Bill should be aware that now is not the time to make these objections: now is the time to amend certain aspects of the Bill but not to oppose the spirit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the event of the Minister not going ahead with this Bill &mdash; which I feel will not be the case &mdash; the Limerick Harbour Commissioners would continue as they have done for the past 160 years to control and manage the estuary.  In this respect it should be pointed out that at present Limerick Harbour Commissioners have the right to collect ship dues from all ships entering the estuary, apart from ships bound for Foynes and Kilrush. Let me point out that not one penny, <Col N="921" /> apart from money spent on studies carried out might benefit the Kerry area in the long run, has been spent on the Kerry region.  This cannot be justified.  These dues which have been collected can only be spent on the development of Limerick port and the Shannon estuary in general. It has been pointed out by representatives that these dues should be spent on roads and hospitals and so on.  As we know this is not the case: they can only be spent on the development of the port.  In fairness to Limerick Harbour Commissioners they have spent over £1 million on the estuary in the past ten years.  However, as I pointed out, none of this has been spent in Kerry.</P>
    <P>The Limerick Harbour Commission is the pilotage authority for the entire estuary from Limerick city to the mouth of the Shannon, including Foynes and Kilrush. The Limerick Harbour Commission is also the lighting authority for all of the estuary east of Slattery Island.  I do feel that in the past too much power and too much control of the Shannon was vested in Limerick.  It was not their fault; traditionally it was their right and I understand that legally it has not been questioned. However, I feel &mdash; and to the credit of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners they feel also &mdash; that it is now time to spread this power over the various interests along the estuary and that the Clare County Council must have a say in the use of dues which are being accumulated from Moneypoint, and that the Kerry County Council should have some say also in the use of the dues collected from the Tarbert oil station.</P>
    <P>This effort is a reasonable attempt to satisfy many conflicting views.  If it is blocked at this stage it will be the end of many years of effort to set up a unified and broadly-based authority to control and promote the estuary.  Senator Howard made reference to the spirit of the proposal, that such an authority could act as a catalyst in all future development along the estuary.  It could promote the Shannon Estuary and sell the Shannon Estuary abroad at international level, in America, Japan and Europe.  It could also monitor pollution levels in the estuary. <Col N="922" /> This is very important with the coming on stream of Moneypoint power station.  I am not totally satisfied with the arrangements being made by the ESB to control emissions from that plant.  I feel that such an authority could act as a watchdog to ensure that the air will not be polluted to the level which is being threatened when Moneypoint is fully on stream.</P>
    <P>A new authority could avoid unnecessary duplication of facilities and services. It could also prove to be a vital co-ordinator of planning for the estuary.  The new board could ensure the deployment of financial resources and, most important, it could present a stronger position than at present in any future negotiations with governmental and EC funding agencies, towards acquiring further money for the development of the estuary.  This is vitally important.</P>
    <P>The Government have shown some awareness, by putting forward this Bill at this stage, of the great natural asset and national asset which is the Shannon Estuary. It is important that it will show commitment to the development of the Shannon Estuary, give it some concessions of the type recently given to Ringaskiddy in Cork and ensure that the vision of Mr. Marmion can now be realised.  Mr. Marmion wrote in 1860 that there was an immense future for the Shannon Estuary. Developments over the last few years have been indicative of the man's vision. Nevertheless, I feel there is a vast future for the whole area.  If this port authority can get off the ground and if it enters into its business in a very positive and objective way I see no reason why the Shannon Estuary cannot become, not only the major port in Ireland, but the major port in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to open my remarks on this matter by welcoming very warmly the concept of the establishment, as proposed in this Bill, of a Shannon ports authority.  It is a very welcome move and a very progressive step.  We can confidently look forward to the Authority as something that will give results in the region with very substantial spin-off <Col N="923" /> effects well outside the region.  It will help to bond together in a more cohesive way the various trade and other activities in the entire Shannon Estuary, embracing the various vital interests concerned there.</P>
      <P>It is very regrettable that the waters under the Foynes Harbour Trustees' jurisdiction are not included in the whole scenario at this time.  One can only hope that in due course the Foynes area will be included, giving us truly one single estuarial authority for that entire region. One does acknowledge that the fact that they are not involved at this point in time is totally and utterly a matter of choice on the part of the Foynes Harbour Trustees. One respects the right on their part to remain aloof at this stage but it is good to know that the Harbours Bill, 1986, does make provision for their inclusion at an appropriate stage in the future.  I would like to think that their inclusion will be totally and utterly on a mutually agreed basis, at a mutually agreed time.</P>
      <P>I believe that the estuary, in the context of this Authority which has been talked about today, will not have been fully realised until Foynes is included.  I want to make it perfectly clear, at the risk of being repetitive, that one does understand why Foynes are opting out just now and one acknowledges their position in that regard.  We are talking about a single estuarial authority or a single port but basically it is not that while we have a missing link, as it were, in the context of Foynes.  Foynes does represent a significant proportion of trading in and out of the harbour.  It is a vital place and its absence cannot be glossed over too lightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is encouraging to know that it is intended that the various interests throughout the general area, from the mouth of the Shannon up to Limerick city, should work as one single authority. While there may be some teething problems in the beginning everybody ought to be big enough &mdash; I would submit this thing called parochialism or localism must at all costs be avoided; we must not talk about Limerick, we must not talk about <Col N="924" /> Clare or Kerry; we must talk about the entire area and what the development of that entire area can do for the region itself and what advantageous effects it will have on the area generally that will be served by the port in Limerick and downstream also.  That is the sort of approach I am confident will be adopted by all concerned when the final points are being put together.  If one were to get hung up on local or parochial issues one would never make progress.  We might finish up with no change in the present position.  That would be highly undesirable.</P>
    <P>Limerick Harbour Commission has in fact up to now played a significant part in the operation of the entire region.  I am satisfied from talking with a number of persons in the Limerick Harbour Commission, a number of commissioners and others, that they are prepared to accept this Bill with certain modifications which I am satisfied can be agreed on.  It would be a tragedy if the potential for development &mdash; which I understand by the year 2000 would represent something like 20 million tonnes of cargo going through that general area &mdash; were to be missed.  We have at present something like 3.5 million cargo tonnes.  That figure may be disputed: I accept that that does include tonnage that comes to Moneypoint and other places in the general area. When I talk about 20 million I also talk about the total area, not Limerick or any confined area.  Ten years ago the figure was about 75,000 tonnes.  A significant number of persons are currently employed directly in operations there.  That area has enormous potential for development as the years go on.  Furthermore, we have the position where ancillary effects and industrial spin-offs in one way or another to this development will take place.</P>
    <P>The Limerick Harbour Commissioners were subjected to a certain amount of unfair criticism in the earlier part of our discussion.  While I want to make it very clear that I am not trying to represent the views of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners &mdash; they are quite competent and capable of doing that themselves &mdash; I feel it is relevant and important for the record <Col N="925" /> that there is recognition of the part played by that body in the years gone by.  Limerick Harbour Commissioners under legislation as far back as 1823 are responsible for the waters of the Shannon Estuary with the exception of those waters under the jurisdiction of the Foynes Harbour Trustees, the piers vested in Kilrush Urban District Council, the county council and the Office of Public Works.  The waters under the control of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners include Aughinish Alumina, the Moneypoint Power Station co-terminal, Tarbert Power Station oil jetty, Foynes Island Terminal Limited, Shannon Airport Oil Jetty and the Limerick Docks.</P>
    <P>There has been a good level of responsibility in the conduct of affairs in the past.  What we want to see is an improvement in that situation in the future.  I am quite satisfied that the Limerick Harbour Commissioners as part of an overall body will play their part in ensuring that improvement.</P>
    <P>I agree that the absence of SFADCo from direct involvement in the development of this new port authority is something to be regretted.  Equally, there is the matter of Foynes and other agencies such as the IDA, RDO and so on but particularly SFADCo which covers industrial development in that region.</P>
    <P>For the record, let us bear in mind that there has been in the last number of years approximately £1 million spent on the harbour there.  This money has improved matters very significantly.  There is no doubt that the potential for development is enormous.  We are talking about very large vessels coming into that estuary, vessels that will facilitate major industrial development.  This is something that we must strive towards very strongly.</P>
    <P>There are a number of advantages for a unified port authority.  Cohesive and progressive forces could be generated by a broadly-based port board fully representative of all sectors and both banks of the estuary.  That is vital.  It is not material what way things work out afterwards as long as we have this fully representative authority.  We would eliminate the undesirable dissension <Col N="926" /> between harbour authorities and others in the Shannon Estuary which, if allowed to continue, could have very adverse effects on industrial development.  Any acrimony or lack of harmony that is there must be eliminated and the way to do it is with the implementation of a Bill like the one that is before us here today, perhaps with certain modifications that I believe will be accepted.</P>
    <P>It is also very important to avoid unnecessary duplication of facilities and services.  A lot of time, energy and money is lost by duplication.  Where there is not a unified approach there will be lack of rationalisation in the true sense.  That is something to be avoided.  The whole question of co-ordination of plans, policies and so forth and the greater deployment of financial resources which is very important, will all lead to a stronger position in future in any negotiations undertaken. This is important when the Government may be engaged from time to time in talks within the EC context of funding agencies in the port or agencies proposing to establish bases there.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant to note that most estuaries in Europe have come under the control of one authority in the last 30 or 40 years.  There has been very positive evidence to show that that is the sort of thing that we ought to aspire to as well.</P>
    <P>There is a fairly long historical background to this &mdash; to which I have referred to already &mdash; but I will refer to a few points from it.  The Shannon Ports Joint Committee consisting of representatives from the Harbour authorities of Limerick, Foynes, Kilrush, the then Department of Transport and Power and Kerry County Council worked well for a number of years on a committee basis. Arising from this effort, legislation was presented in 1977 entitled the Harbours Bill, 1977.  This legislation contained provisions for the establishment of a Shannon Ports Authority.  That Bill was introduced in Dáil Eireann but it was not in accordance with the agreed heads of legislation submitted to the Minister in 1974 by the Shannon Ports Joint Committee. However, that legislation, due to a change of Government in 1977, was left <Col N="927" /> aside.  It is appropriate and important that an improved version of it be taken up at this point.</P>
    <P>After 1977, there were, as we all know, further discussions.  It is fair to say that nearly all Ministers for Industry and Commerce in the last number of years have favoured a single estuarial authority in the region.  It is correct to acknowledge that.  Some Ministers have perhaps been greater proponents of the concept than others but all Ministers for Industry and Commerce have been very well disposed to the general idea.</P>
    <P>In 1980 there seemed to have been a change of policy on the part of the Foynes trustees.  In October 1983 in a letter to the Kilrush Urban District Council they reaffirmed their previously declared decision not to participate in a unified estuarial authority.  They made that known to other persons as well.  From that time, there has been also a clear and definite position made known by the Foynes trustees. We look forward to the day when they will be included.</P>
    <P>Reference was made already to the representation which was proposed in the past, not the one for the future.  That had much merit in it, because it was more than the present number proposed.  The proposal put forward by the Limerick Harbour Commission in 1983, in consultation with a number of other bodies was that there should be 30 representatives made up as follows: Limerick Corporation, four; Limerick County Council, four; Clare County Council, four; Kerry County Council, four; Tipperary North Riding Council, one; Limerick Chamber of Commerce, two; Confederation of Irish Industry, two; labour interests, two; shipping interests, two; Industrial Development Authority, one and ministerial nominees, four.  That was significantly better, in terms of representation, than what is now being proposed.  I will come to that in a moment.  That, then, is a brief background to what happened before.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters in the Bill which deserve mention.  Again, I want to state categorically that the Limerick Harbour Commissioners are not acting <Col N="928" /> as dogs in the manger on this one.  They, as much as anybody else, are promoting the idea in consultation with the Minister. I understand there is a meeting pending between that body and the Minister some time later this month.  They have made it very clear that they welcome this Bill, but that they have certain reservations in regard to it.  I, too, share some of those reservations, but I am expressing them as my personal reservations, not as the views of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners. They will present their views in their own way.  These views should be taken on board.</P>
    <P>I referred to the membership of the board.  We had a proposal that there be 17 elected representatives on a board of 30.  Now we are talking about eight elected members on a board of 21.  The reduction in local authority membership by over 50 per cent, finishing up with eight members, ought to be changed. Tipperary North Riding Council are not included.  From many points of view Tipperary North Riding Council should be included in the representation.  They have played, and I am certain will continue to play, a vital role in the whole development of that region.  They have been served by the Shannon Estuary both on an outgoing trade basis and in the usage of incoming goods.</P>
    <P>There is the other question, to which reference has already been made, of appointments by chambers of commerce. There have been different views expressed, but I feel they should be appointed by the local chambers of commerce.  For example, Limerick Chamber of Commerce, as was indicated earlier, are very much on a regional basis.  They are in the mid-west region and it is not illogical to talk about representatives of the Limerick Chamber of Commerce being selected.  Other local chambers of commerce in that area such as Kilrush, Ennis and Tralee could also be looked at, in this context.  I do not think the representation from the chambers of commerce should come from any national body of chambers of commerce. It should come from the local area.  One might bear in mind that the Limerick <Col N="929" /> Chamber of Commerce are very much a regional body.  They are in no way confined to the local scene of Limerick itself.  They have a broader area of membership. To ensure the best possible balance of representation, one would be better with the larger number of 30.  This would accommodate the five local authorities of Tipperary North Riding, Limerick city, Limerick county, Kerry and Clare.  That can be best done on that basis.</P>
    <P>I have stated already, but I reiterate, that I believe very strongly that Tipperary North Riding County Council should have representation on the new Authority because they have contributed very significantly to the development of the Shannon estuary.  The overall regional development has been helped very much by north Tipperary which is a natural, logical part of that mid western region, joining Clare, Limerick and, in this context, part of Kerry.</P>
    <P>There are a number of sections in the Bill to which I have already referred dealing with membership.  Apart from the bodies I have mentioned &mdash; local authorities and chambers of commerce &mdash; more attention must be paid to the general make-up of that board.  I take the point that representations from the labour force are a bit weak.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points that would cause a certain amount of concern.  The proposal that the board should meet not more than six times in the year is one such point.  The Shannon Estuary is a national resource, the development of which obviously must be on commercial lines.  The estuary is of great national as well as local importance.  Against that kind of background it would be inappropriate that the number of meetings be specified and restricted to six except under exceptional circumstances.  It may not be necessary to have six meetings.  It may be necessary to have 12.  In any commercial operation it is only on an ongoing basis that the number of meetings can be correctly determined.  I appreciate there must be some broad guidelines but I believe it is very restrictive <Col N="930" /> to talk about not more than six meetings per year except &ldquo;under exceptional circumstances&rdquo;.  That is something that the Minister will have to look at very seriously.</P>
    <P>There is also the position with regard to the transfer of officers and staff there at present.  There must be a little more flexibility here and perhaps there are some aspects that would be better outside the Bill.  There are good relations with the existing authority and there is no need for a new authority.  I am not suggesting that we are only talking about an extension of what is there, I am talking about a new industry.  There will not be major differences in its business practices except an improvement on what is there at present.  What is there is a kind of guideline and we are not talking about an extension of that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the whole area of staff, there is a suggestion about having a board of management in addition to the board itself.  Quite frankly I do not think, in the context of a 21 member board or 30 member board, that that board of management is required.  The chairman of the board, the chief executive, or the vice-chairman would be sufficient to act on a day-to-day basis with matters that needed attention between board meetings. That part of the Bill does not really have a function.  I do not see what functions the management committee will perform and I suggest that that part of the Bill be deleted.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general staffing arrangements, I believe good commercial practices and principles must apply and I urge the Minister to ensure that a new Shannon Ports Authority should not tie the hands of the board, the chief executive and the staff they would be dealing with.  Much more can be achieved by a freer approach than exists at present.</P>
    <P>We must not look upon the estuary as Limerick, Kerry or Clare.  It is disappointing that so much emphasis has been laid on one bank of the river.  We are talking about an estuary and the development of that estuary.  Whether Moneypoint, Tarbert or Limerick Docks is developed to a greater degree than the <Col N="931" /> others, it must and should be because good commercial practice dictates it. Where the greatest emphasis on development comes should not be relevant.  I totally and utterly agree that there must be an even spread of representation.</P>
    <P>I share the view expressed by a number of persons earlier today that elected representatives from the various authorities must have reasonable representation but quite frankly I would not agree that it is of paramount importance as to where the headquarters of this new authority is going to be.  It should be in the most suitable place from an operation's point of view.  It is not vital whether it is in Limerick city, Shannon Airport or wherever. It should be in the most central place in the context of a business operation. This does not necessarily mean geographically central because one has to take into account people coming, going to and from the headquarters.</P>
    <P>I am confident this Harbours Bill, 1986, has a great deal to recommend it. Those people with a vested interest &mdash; and there are, of course, persons with vested interests in various parts of the region &mdash; must look upon it in its totality and not try to score points over one another.  There is probably a certain amount of sensitivity because the Limerick Harbour Commission have been the body &mdash; with certain exceptions to whom I have already referred &mdash; who have looked after this affair over the past 160 years.</P>
    <P>I referred to the chamber of commerce situation and it would be no harm to recognise for the record, that it was through Limerick Chamber of Commerce that Limerick port really came into being in the first instance.  That was back as far as 1815.  This was prior to the establishment of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  The Limerick Chamber of Commerce managed and operated the port at Limerick which served that entire area at that time.  When the Limerick Harbour Commission was established the chamber co-operated in the changeover of management and so on.  That happened many years ago but <Col N="932" /> it is a matter I want to put on record.  I should correct a point I made about 1815. Limerick Harbour Commissioners have operated the business of the estuary since 1815 but prior to that time Limerick Chamber of Commerce managed affairs.</P>
    <P>Finally, I say to the Minister that there must be a measure of flexibility, particularly with regard to representation on the board.  I appeal to the various interests in the area to avoid any element of parochialism about this.  It is not Limerick, Ennis, Kilrush or Tarbert that is important in this context: it is the development of the area generally and what it can contribute to the general development of Counties Clare, Kerry, Limerick, north Tipperary, south Tipperary and other regions.  I am confident that good and better judgment will prevail and obstacles that might seem to be there at present can be overcome.  They will only be overcome if people do not in any way try to score points over each other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the fact that this Bill is being introduced in this House. I thank the Minister and the Government for the continuous stream of legislation which is coming first to this House.  It is a development we could have done with a long time ago.  As the Minister said in his opening speech he expects a full and thoughtful debate.  This House is certainly worthy of this type of Bill coming before it first.  The Minister, in turn, could respond to this House by considering the points of view expressed here on Bills, accepting amendments and, possibly, introducing amendments himself on the basis of what is said here on Second Stage.  I do not know what the Government's attitude to this Bill is in terms of amending it.  I know Governments do not like amending Bills but I hope this Bill is more susceptible to amendment than others because the Seanad is here, presumably, to have a frank, less party political debate on issues of this type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not quite as uncontentious a Bill as are some of the Bills introduced in this House.  I do not want to become involved <Col N="933" /> in what is obviously the controversial element of the Bill which is the composition of the authority being set up.  I subscribe completely to Senator Hourigan's aspiration that the actual composition and vested interests involved will not take over and that there is not unholy war in this House or elsewhere about the permutations to be used in setting up the Authority. I hope &mdash; and it may be a vain hope &mdash; that Members of this House do not represent purely vested interests because the setting up of this Authority is quite obviously, as the Minister said in his speech, &ldquo;to set up a dynamic unified Authority which is for the good of the area&rdquo;.  It is difficult for that sort of hope to be fulfilled but I hope Members of this House will do all they can to fulfil it.</P>
    <P>What I would like to say is very brief. While I do not quarrel with the main thrust of the Bill, there are areas in it which are very dangerous.  I am talking first of all about ministerial power. Section 15 of the Bill is very far reaching and virtually allows legislation by the stroke of a ministerial pen.  This is not a precedent but I would have thought it is a dangerous procedure.  Section 15 provides that:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order dissolve, reconstitute or amalgamate as he may consider it necessary or desirable so to do any one or more of the harbour authorities specified in the first column of the First Schedule (as amended by this Act) to the Act of 1946.</P>
    <P>I would have thought this gives the Minister two all embracing powers in such order that he may specify the name of a new Authority, specify the membership and constitution of the Authority, apply, subject to amendment, any of the provisions of the Bill to the Authority, transfer assets and liabilies to a body he may specify and provide for any other matter he considers necessary or desirable. I see the reasons behind this.  Ministers do not want to have to come back to the Oireachtas to make changes of this type all the time.</P>
    <P>The powers which the Minister for Communications has in this Bill are far <Col N="934" /> too wide and should be reconsidered.  The only brake on the Minister's proposed powers is that an order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas under which arrangement the order becomes effective unless a vote to annul it is passed by either House within a specified period.  Such an order cannot be amended.  It can only be effected or annuled. There is a body of opinon among constitutional lawyers &mdash; not among general lawyers &mdash; that this legislation is extremely dangerous though not unconstitutional and that these types of powers are too wide for any Minister to hold. The reason behind them is administrative rather than anything else.  It is the power under section 15 which the Minister should think about again.</P>
    <P>The other section which I hope the Minister may consider for amendment is section 16.  This is a section which affects all harbour authority employees.  It alters their conditions of employment in so far as they will be inhibited from negotiating freely as they have been able to before on remuneration, allowances and the terms and conditions under which they work. This proposal is to be achieved by the amendment of the 1946 Act.  The logical conclusion to section 16 is that harbour authorities will no longer have power to negotiate freely with their employees and that it would be as well for the Department of the Public Service to conduct all negotiations on remuneration, allowances and conditions of services.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Transport (Re-organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Bill, 1986 is virtually identical with section 16 (41) (a) of the Harbours Bill, 1986, section 29 of the Road Transport Bill, 1985, and section 2 of the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) (Amendment) Bill, 1986. The passing of section 16 into law represents a change in the conditions of service and prospects of all employees.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Transport Policy was issued six months ago by the Minister. The chapter relating to ports had a forward looking progressive outlook and an indication that Government thinking was to encourage commercial reality in <Col N="935" /> port affairs.  The present Bill enshrines regressive elements of Government thinking.  The Irish Ports Authority Association in their submission to the Department on the Green Paper welcomed the positive proposals contained therein and made further proposals which, in their view, would be of benefit to the commercial and trading life of the nation.  I should like to know from the Minister &mdash; because I have had a submission from the Irish Ports Authority Association &mdash; what happened to these proposals, whether they were discussed, whether they were considered and why they were ignored, which undoubtedly they were?</P>
    <P>There are implications for all harbour authorities in those sections of the Bill relating to the Shannon ports in so far as they can be applied by order.  For example, the Minister may by regulation, determine reserve functions to the board of a new authority and the exercise of powers, duties and functions not so reserved will be performed by a board of management.  Other sections deal with transfers of staff, superannuation schemes and the continuation of legal proceedings by laws, orders, and so on.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider those points and to tell us when he sums up whether he is considering amending this Bill on Committee Stage or whether it is his intention to ignore the criticisms which have been made here on Second Stage.  As a principle, I welcome the fact that the Bill has come to the Seanad.  I welcome also the fact that past Bills of this type have been amended as a result of Second Stage debate in the Seanad. This is a credit to the Government and to this House.  I hope this Bill will be treated with the same seriousness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  I congratulate the Government and the Minister for, first, bringing this Bill before this House and, secondly, for presenting to the Oireachtas and the country a very wide ranging package of transport law reforms.  It <Col N="936" /> is interesting that this Government published the Green Paper on Transport Policy in the autumn of last year and that that Green Paper has been very swiftly followed up by a whole range of Bills dealing with every aspect of transport within this jurisdiction.  For that, the people, the country and the Oireachtas must all compliment and congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State and indeed the Department of Communications. It is interesting that we have so much legislation dealing with transport.</P>
      <P>One must comment at the outset that transport policy is something which has been totally neglected by successive Governments.  It is something which at present is in a complete shambles.  The fact that this Government under the dynamic ministry of Deputy Jim Mitchell assisted by Deputy Ted Nealon are introducing this Bill as part of a wide ranging package is something which must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The whole question of transport policy cannot be looked at in an internal sense. It is something which even for us as an island State must be seen in the broader sense of our membership of the European Community and must be seen in the sense of our role as a nation within the world community.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it is one segment of the broad range of transport policy reforms which have to be legislated for.  The Bill, in effect, as the Minister has said and as other speakers have commented, does two things.  Firstly, it provides for a single harbour authority to manage the harbours at Limerick and Kilrush with the enabling provision that Foynes may be included at a future date under the new Shannon Port Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Bill provides in section 15 that the Minister shall have very extensive powers.  I share very fully the reservations expressed by Senator Ross in relation to section 15 of the Bill.  In so far as the creation of the Shannon Port Authority are concerned I welcome that. I do not have any detailed knowledge of the current operation of the harbour authority within that area but it seems common sense that there should be one <Col N="937" /> authority to deal with what is a very important harbour area.  The fact that there may be local community interest, competing interest and that there may be differences of opinion as to the type of authority or the nature of the constitution of the Authority is a matter for debate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's opening comments whereby he stated that he would listen to the views of this House and those expressed in another place in relation to the constitution of the Authority and its general powers.  So far as section 15 is concerned &mdash; that is the section which prompted me to speak &mdash; it confers very wide powers on the Minister of the day. Subsection (1) says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order dissolve, reconstitute or amalgamate as he may consider it necessary or desirable so to do any one or more of the harbour authorities specified in the first column of the First Schedule (as amended by this Act) to the Act of 1946.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, one of the purposes of this Act is to include the new Shannon Port Authority in the schedule of the Act of 1946.  The Act of 1946 runs to almost 200 sections.  It is the governing Act in so far as harbour law in this country is concerned. We are now giving to the Minister of the day the power to bypass the Oireachtas, the power to decide without reason, without explanation whether the harbour Authority should continue, whether it should be reconstituted or whether it should be dissolved.  As a democrat I believe that that type of power is not the kind of power that is consistent with the kind of parliamentary democracy we enjoy in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Act of 1946 is historically interesting in that it provides the basis for the old statute law in relation to the small harbour authorities existing here.  As somebody who comes from a harbour town I was prompted to examine the old statute law and to see the old basis of the Westport Harbour Commissioners. I was rather interested to find that the Imperial Parliament, a parliament which was obviously very busy, had time in 1853 to enact in great detail for <Col N="938" /> improving and maintaining the port and harbour of Westport.</P>
    <P>In 1853 the Imperial Government were very busy because much of the globe at that time was red.  Despite the business and despite the fact that the Imperial Parliament had many matters to worry about it still had time to enact a very detailed Act dealing with a small harbour in the west of Ireland.  In 1986, a small country on the western edge of Europe, an island on our own, busy giving civil servants greater powers, busy ensuring that Ministers should not bring legislation before Parliament now decide in a Bill that we should remove from Parliament the type of power that the Imperial Parliament exercised despite their other worries and troubles in 1853.  Instead, we ensure that the mandarins whom we respect, whom I have already complimented, on the other side of Kildare Street should legislate in future for the harbour authorities of Ireland.  That is something I find totally unacceptable.  It is a section of the Bill which I hope the Minister will be persuaded to consider in greater detail between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 15 of the Bill if one looks at the Harbours Act of 1946 one sees that section 164 of that Act gives the Minister power to provide for the holding of local inquiries in relation to harbours.  Section 164 of the Harbours Act 1946 provides that:</P>
    <P>The Minister may at any time direct that a local inquiry be held into any of the following matters:</P>
    <P>(a)  the performance by a harbour authority of its powers, functions and duties;</P>
    <P>(b)  the finances of a harbour authority;</P>
    <P>(c)  the condition of the harbour of a harbour authority;</P>
    <P>(d)  the rates charged by a harbour authority;</P>
    <P>(e)  the accommodation and facilities provided by a harbour authority;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> (h)  any matter in respect of which the Minister is authorised by any other section of this Act to direct a local inquiry.</P>
    <P>That is the section which gives the Minister very substantial power in relation to harbour authorities.  In this Bill he decides that the Oireachtas should legislate that without the holding of a harbour inquiry, without the necessity of consulting with the harbour authority, without the necessity of consulting with local authorities, without the necessity of consulting with the Oireachtas he may by order abolish harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>I believe that before a harbour authority is dissolved, reconstituted or amalgamaged an inquiry of the type envisaged in section 164 of the Harbours Act 1946 should be held.  I want to give notice now that on Committee Stage I will be putting down an amendment to this effect.  I hope that the Minister and his Department will consider that amendment seriously.  I am giving notice of it now because I believe that if we are to legislate for the dissolution, reconstitution or amalgamation of a harbour authority then we should do so in a democratic way.  There is a need for the dissolution of certain harbour authorities. There is certainly an argument for the amalgamation of harbour authorities and that is what we are doing here today in so far as the Shannon estuary is concerned. I also believe that there is need for an amalgamation of other harbour authorities.  This must be done in a democratic way and after due consultation. It must not be done by the stroke of a pen which is announced to all the people concerned when the matter is a <i>fait accompli.</i>  I hope the Minister will take on board the idea of necessary consultation.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the dissolution specifically of a harbour authority.  Subsection (2) (b) says:</P>
    <P>in the case of the dissolution of a harbour authority without its reconstitution or amalgamation with other harbour authority, the transfer of the assets and liabilities of such dissolved <Col N="940" /> harbour authority to such local authority or other body as the Minister, with the approval of the Government, may specify;</P>
    <P>I would like to stress the words &ldquo;or other body&rdquo;.  This is a good provision.  It would not always be wise, when a harbour authority is dissolved that its assets and liabilities should be transferred to the local authority.  I can see many situations where it should be transferred to another body.  The Minister said today:</P>
    <P>One final point in relation to the restructuring of harbour authorities should be mentioned.  The Government have already decided in the context of devolution to local authorities that harbours, which now cater for little or no commerical traffic, would be handed over to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's statement because, despite what is provided for in this Bill, there is an attitude within the Minister's Department that when harbour authorities are dissolved their powers, functions, properties, assets and liabilities should be transferred to the local authority.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that I am prompted to move forward from the Westport Port and Harbour Act, 1853, to the situation existing within the Westport Harbour Board in 1986.  At the outset I want to pay tribute to the chairman and commissioners of that board who preside over a harbour which now does not carry on the commercial business which was envisaged in the 1853 Act.  I pay tribute to harbour commissioners who do a very worrying job in relation to a harbour which is heavily silted up, underfunded and whose potential is not utilised in the context of the 1980s.  I would be very worried and so would the Westport Harbour Commissioners if the Minister with a stroke of a pen could abolish them and transfer their functions to a local authority in the area.  I say that as a member of the Westport Urban District Council and as a member of Mayo County Council because I am not happy that they are the appropriate bodies to <Col N="941" /> whom the assets and liabilities of the Westport Harbour Board should be transferred in the event of dissolution being decided upon.</P>
    <P>I believe small harbours around the country have potential in relation to the development of our fishing industry and our tourist business.  In this context legislation should be introduced to provide for the establishment of a new type of harbour authority, not a harbour authority that is envisaged in the Westport Port and Harbour Act, 1853, but rather a Harbour Act for the small authorities which would provide for the tourist business, the leisure use of harbours and for the fishing industry which, hopefully, we will see further developed in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the number of bodies who have functions in relation to harbours and bays, I am amazed that somebody who is involved, for instance, in developing different types of fishing industries will be concerned with the harbour board, the county council, the urban council, the health board, in case of pollution, the regional fisheries board, the Department of Fisheries in relation to mariculture licences, with the Department of Communications for foreshore licences, with BIM, Údarás na Gaeltachta and with the IDA.  In terms of developing our harbours and the bays around them there should be single authorities which recognise the needs of our harbours and their modern uses.</P>
    <P>Those are my points with regard to the Harbours Bill, 1986.  I welcome the Bill as a further amendment of our harbours legislation.  I share the concern expressed by other speakers in relation to section 15.  I hope the Minister will take that concern on board between now and Committee Stage.  In so far as I express reservations in that regard, I want to conclude by complimenting the Minister and the Minister of State for the broad thrust and energy they have shown in bringing such a broad range of transport legislation before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, <Col N="942" /> may I say that I found the Second Stage debate to be very interesting and stimulating. I am grateful for the thoughtful and varied contributions of all the Senators who took part.  There was an extraordinary range of views from the point of view of Senators with a particular local interest, with great knowledge of the estuary and the surrounding area and also Senators taking on the larger canvass of the development of our ports in general. Overall, it is fair to say that there has been a welcome for the Bill in the House, an enthusiastic welcome by some with, naturally, reservations along the line but even where there were the strongest reservations there was still a welcome that the Bill had finally appeared after 30 years promise.</P>
      <P>I will deal with a number of the important points raised by the Senators in the course of the debate.  I can assure everybody now that the more detailed points raised during the debate will, of course, be considered.  There is no question of them being ignored as was suggested. The Minister has a very good track record in this respect.  A very good example of it was in a Bill concluded in this House a very short time ago and the major changes that have been made arising from the suggestions put forward by the Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my personal view that the general development of the Shannon Estuary can most effectively be achieved by the establishment of a single ports authority. There was a danger that the development of the estuary could have been inhibited by the present fragmented approach by the various competing interests.  That has been an inhibiting factor over the years. The question of jurisdiction can be a very difficult and emotive problem in the Shannon Estuary.  We had reflections of that today, where we had continual reference to the geographical location, and that is understandable.  We must ensure that control over the entire waters of the estuary is not handed over to one authority.  This is the only way we can get major results.  To proceed in this way would facilitate future planning and development of the estuary and would be <Col N="943" /> of considerable help to local interests in promoting the estuary as a suitable location for further large scale industrial projects. We cannot lose sight of the enormous potential that exists there.</P>
    <P>Senator Deenihan told of the prospects and the possibilities outlined by one authority in the middle of the 19th century. These, of course, have not been fully realised although great advances have been made.  We must keep in mind the enormous potential provided we can get the infrastructure right.  We are going a certain distance along the line with this Bill.  Once it has been enacted the Minister will be pressing ahead with the necessary back-up orders and regulations to ensure that there is no undue delay in the full establishment of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Some aspects, such as the division of responsibility and functions between the Authority and the board of management will, of course, require consultation and careful consideration.  I am confident, however, that this need not give rise to any undue delay in the assumption of their full role by the Authority.  I am sure that will be welcomed by all even by those with considerable reservations about what we are doing.</P>
    <P>I hope that before long a new environment will emerge favourable to the amalgamation of Foynes Harbour Trustees with the Shannon Ports Authority with no question of coercion and with a spirit of co-operation.  Only then will the true value and potential of the new structure which we are establishing be realised.  In the meantime this will be one of the goals of the new Authority with, as I have said, no question of coercion.  As far as Foynes is concerned everything has to be done in a spirit of co-operation; otherwise it will be counterproductive and only lead to difficulties instead of the progress we are seeking.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Transport Policy referred to rationalisation of the structure of harbour authorities to prevent unnecessary competition for scarce Exchequer resources which was pointed out as being a desirable aim.  The overall concern must be to ensure that there <Col N="944" /> are sufficient and adequate port facilities nationally and for each of the regions. The Minister will be addressing these issues in the coming months.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, one of the most controversial issues that arose in the course of consultations with local interests was the question of the size of the proposed authority and representation on that authority. That has been accurately and truly reflected in the debate here today.  A number of Senators have expressed views on the membership of the proposed Shannon authority set out in section 4 and have put forward various reasoned arguments as to why various interests should have a statutory right to membership or how the present Limerick Harbour Commissioners which amounts to 27 members should be incorporated.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the concern of Senators but I must emphasise that I am attempting to devise a new regime for harbours generally which will hopefully be more suited to the harsh competitive environment that exists today in contrast to what existed when the Harbours Bill was enacted in 1946.  This competitive environment exists not only between Irish ports but also between Irish and European ports.  This is something in which the Shannon estuary authority will be interested.  I am convinced that there is a need for change in that the smaller the Authority the more effective and efficient it will be.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that it is imperative that the board of management in the proposed two tier structure should be given a chance to work.  For this reason I feel it is desirable that only in exceptional circumstances should the authority have to meet more than once every two months.  After all, the full authority will be primarily concerned with policy formulation and will comprise five of the seven members of the management board.  Irrespective of how we manage it, there will be differences of opinion as to the size of the board and the representation on it.  We have heard about the north bank, the south bank and various other areas.  I do not think it is possible to get a board that will satisfy everybody.  The <Col N="945" /> Minister has had enormous consultations in the preparation of this Bill.  It is worth putting on record the number of local bodies that he met.  He met the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, the Foynes Harbour Trustees, Kilrush UDC, Clare Castle Pier Trustees, Limerick County Council, Limerick Corporation, Clare County Council, Kilrush UDC, Kerry County Council, Tipperary County Council, North Riding, Shannon Town Commissioners, Oireachtas Members from Counties Clare, Limerick, Kerry and Tipperary North Riding, the IDA, SFADCo and regional development organisations of the mid-west and south west.  He also met local associations, among them, the Tarbert Development Association, Ballylongford Community Association, Killimor Development Association, Chamber of Commerce representatives and he had a public meeting in north Kerry with Senator Jimmy Deenihan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>He met representatives of all these people.  He did not have a public meeting.  From the vast knowledge he acquired from all these meetings he produced the ideas for the authority we have proposed here.  Naturally it will not suit everybody but it is the Minister's evaluation of the situation.  It is as near as anyone can get to it.</P>
      <P>Senator Hourigan said that the proposed representation from the labour force might be a bit weak.  This was mentioned by other Senators also.  The proposal that there be two representatives of the labour interest is identical with that already provided for in respect of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners. Given the proposed membership is 21 as compared with 27, proportionately speaking, it would increase the strength of the labour representatives on the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions were also made that the Harbours Bill before the House should contain additional provisions amending the Harbours Acts of 1946 and 1976.  The <Col N="946" /> Minister will be publishing a White Paper containing his proposals for a general review of the harbours legislation.  The purpose of the present Bill is primarily to provide for the establishment of the Shannon Ports Authority.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan expressed concern that the Shannon Ports Authority would not be an authority to develop the area industrially. There are other agencies in place who are equipped to do the work and I expect the new Shannon Ports Authority to work closely with these agencies to develop the region.  With this in mind the Minister will consider the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and the Mid-West Development Organisation as possible candidates for places among his nominees on the board.  Senator Howard raised this point earlier as did other speakers as to the possibility of SFADCo or the regional development authority being represented on the board.  The potential is there and the Minister will consider such people for inclusion.</P>
    <P>Considerable opposition has been expressed with regard to the powers available to the Minister in section 15 of the Bill.  This relates to the dissolution, reconstitution or amalgamation of harbour authorities.  The powers enshrined in this section are enabling powers which will permit the reorganisation of harbour authorities scheduled to the Harbours Act of 1946, in line with Government policy, as has been done in the Green Paper on transport policy published last November.  It goes without saying that it is the intention of the Minister not to use these powers in specific cases without appropriate consultations in advance.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan brought up the interesting point incorporated in the earlier Act of the power of inquiry and examination and suggested that this kind of thing might be used before any of these powers are brought into operation.  It would be nonsensical to proceed without consultation. Furthermore, I would point out that subsection (4) enables either House of the Oireachtas to pass a resolution annulling an order made under the section within 21 days on which such House has sat after the order has been laid before <Col N="947" /> it.  This provides the necessary protection against any abuse of the powers under the section.</P>
    <P>I accept that the enabling powers under section 15 are very extensive.  It is necessary to have such powers available to enable the effective reorganisation of the scheduled harbours within a reasonably short space of time.  There is an accepted requirement for reorganisation within harbours at present.  We have to get on with the work.  This Bill is emerging after 30 years.  There has been considerable criticism that it has not come before this. Harbour authorities are intended to be commercial undertakings.  Given the very rapid changes that are taking place it is clear that a more efficient statutory mechanism is necessary to allow harbours to adapt to change.  The powers of annulment of any statutory order which I have just outlined made under the section represent adequate safeguards as far as the Oireachtas is concerned.  However, I note the very strong case made by Senators on all sides of the House and these are things the Minister will consider.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan asked whether it had been decided where the head office of the authority will be.  This will be a matter for the new Shannon Ports Authority to decide.  Senator Honan also raised the point about ministerial approval for borrowings of over £50,000.  Ministerial approval for borrowing by a harbour authority will be reviewed in the context of a review of the general provisions of the Harbours Act, 1946.  It is a rather small sum considering the type of finance that organisations such as the Shannon Ports Authority could find itself involved in.  The authority will be financed from its own revenue as a harbour authority. It will also have power to borrow and may be eligible for State grants in certain cases of capital development projects, subject to financial approval.</P>
    <P>Senators Howard and Kiely raised a number of points in relation to the collection and disposal of dues and the jurisdiction of the various bodies at present administering the estuary.  He will <Col N="948" /> appreciate that to give him the information he has requested in the short time available today would be very difficult.  I would be very grateful if he and Senator Kiely would accept that I will communicate with them separately on these matters in order to give the exact details.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard asked about the pilotage in Shannon harbour and estuary and the present limits of the harbour pilotage district.  They are specified in section 3 of the Limerick Pilotage Act, 1921 which states:</P>
    <P>The limits of the Limerick Pilotage District...shall be the waters of the sea and River Shannon bounded seawards by an imaginary line from Loop Head to Kerry Head&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The same is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>and landwards by the Wellesley Bridge at Limerick together with the navigable waters of the tributaries connected therewith and including all docks within this area.</P>
    <P>Wellesley Bridge is now called Sarsfield Bridge.  This area covers the entire estuary. The order also authorises Limerick Harbour Commissioners to be pilotage authority for that pilotage district.  The pilotage area equates with an area over which Limerick exercises control as a harbour authority, though there has been no statutory basis in the latter case.  The Shannon Ports Authority will be the pilotage authority for the estuary as well as having control of the estuary as harbour authority.</P>
    <P>Senator Kirwan mentioned the composition of the new Dublin port authority. It is too early yet to say what the final composition of the new port authority will be.  It will have to be decided by the Government following consultation with appropriate agencies.  I can only say at this stage that the new structure will be less unwieldy and, hopefully, more efficient.  He also mentioned the Dublin Docks Review Group.  The report of the review group must be considered in the context that it was not representative of the entire interests involved in the Dublin Port and Docks Board, let alone harbour <Col N="949" /> authorities in general.  Therefore, while the views it expresses in relation to the constitution of the Dublin Port and Docks Board are very worthy of consideration, they should not be taken as the only possible solution.  A decision has not been made in that respect but it is hoped that the new structure will turn out to be less unwieldy and more efficient than the previous one.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill was mentioned by Senator Flor O'Mahony and several other Senators.  This relates to the remuneration of officers and servants of harbour authorities.  It is a standard provision based on similar provisions in other legislation.  It provides for a system which has worked satisfactorily elsewhere and should work equally satisfactorily in the case of harbour authorities. Considerable reservation has been expressed on this item which I have noted.  Functions to be reserved to the ports authorities will be detailed in regulations made by the Minister in consultation with the authority.  It is not possible to be precise at this stage about the functions to be reserved to the authority but these will be in the general policy area of finance and planning.  This is dealing with the two tier system.  It would be inappropriate to go into any further detail in advance of consultation with the authority. Generally, however, it will provide a wide degree of freedom of manoeuvre to the board of management while retaining overall responsibility in major policy areas with the authority.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have expressed regret that Foynes Harbour Trustees have chosen to remain outside the scope of the proposed Shannon ports authority.  They recognised their achievements and paid tribute to the work done by them over the years.  I go along with that.  I, too, express my regret while appreciating what has been achieved in Foynes.  I outlined my position very clearly in my opening statement to the House.  I reiterate my view which coincides with the views expressed by many Senators that it would be preferable if Foynes were in from the outset but I respect their views.  I hope that they will come to see the new authority <Col N="950" /> not as a threat but as an opportunity and that they will take steps to join it in the future.  There can be no question of coercion.  To do that would be counterproductive.</P>
    <P>As is evident, the Minister for Communications is most anxious to ensure that legislative proposals, when enacted, represent the best formula available to achieve the legislators' intent.  Therefore, everything said here will be considered very seriously.  The Minister has a very good record as far as listening to and where possible taking on board, the constructive points put forward in this House or in the Dáil are concerned, provided that the overall evaluation of these would lead to better legislation.  That is what it is all about.  I assure the House that the Minister and I will be giving the most serious consideration to the views expressed by all Senators in what was an interesting Second Stage debate.  We will consider them before we take Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Fourth EC Company Law Directive which deals with the content and publication of the annual accounts of public and private limited companies.  The main impact of this Bill will be to increase the level of detailed disclosure required in the accounts of public and private limited companies and in particular to remove the current exemption under section 128 of the 1963 Companies Act whereby private limited companies are not at present required to publish their accounts.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that the removal of this &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; of non-disclosure, if I can call it that, will have an important bearing on the operation of private companies in the State.  Such companies have, for valid reasons, put some value on the fact that they do not have to publish accounts.</P>
      <P>There are times when disclosure of information is the best course.  Indeed some would say it is not non-disclosure which is the privilege, but limited liability, and disclosure of accounts to benefit creditors, employees and others is the price that should be rightly asked for this privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention these points only to show that there are differing views and philosophies; that disclosure of company information can produce both positive and <Col N="953" /> negative results; in short that in deciding on how to apply the Fourth EC Directive it was necessary to strike a balance, and that hopefully, Senators will agree with where the balance has been struck.</P>
    <P>These comments apply particularly in the case of small and medium sized companies. In recognition of the restricted economic importance of such entities and the disproportionate effect of the Directive on their activities, the Council of Ministers decided to allow certain exemptions from publication in the Directive for companies defined as small and medium sized.  These exemptions are contained in the Bill and I will go into these later.  The basic point I wish to make here is that, notwithstanding the exemptions which we have followed in this Bill, small and medium-sized companies will still be required to publish substantial information on their activities.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the small and medium-sized options in the Directive. Indeed in the Directive as a whole, because of the complexity of differing national systems, there are close to 60 options available to member states in applying the Directive.</P>
    <P>Many of the options relate to technical accounting matters and were included in the Directive to permit the continuation of accepted accounting practice in the individual member states.  The Bill avails of these options for that purpose.  Notwithstanding the many options, there is still a central core of basic provisions in the Directive which we have to follow in legislating here today.  I must emphasise, therefore, that in many respects the Bill now before the House is merely reflective of the mandatory requirements of the Fourth Directive and as such contains a substantial range of provisions which we are not at liberty to vary.  I would ask Senators to bear this in mind during the debate on the later stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the content of the Bill and its implications for change in the current requirements.  The Companies Act, 1963, and in particular the Sixth Schedule thereto, sets down the disclosure <Col N="954" /> requirements applicable to the annual accounts of public and private limited companies.  These requirements reflect the basic principle that such accounts should provide a &ldquo;true and fair view&rdquo; of a company's position and, subject to this overriding principle, the Sixth Schedule to the 1963 Act set out certain information to be contained in the balance sheet, profit and loss account, notes to the accounts, directors' report and auditors' report.  These provisions do not, however, lay down precise formats of presentation to be adopted in the accounts, but rather indentify the main headings under which disclosure must take place.  In practice, the requirements of the Sixth Schedule to the 1963 Act have been supplemented by companies' adherence to developments in accounting practice, as reflected in the accounting standards issued by the accountancy bodies in Ireland and the UK.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House retains the overriding principle of true and fair view. This is in line with the Directive, and indeed it as an achievement to have this provision built into the Directive since the true and fair view requirement was not generally part of the Continental practice.  However, the Directive and the Bill do not stop there.  The Bill specifies the format which the balance sheet and profit and loss account should take and prescribes rules in relation to the treatment of individual accounts items; the valuation procedures which can be applied to assets and liabilities; and the supporting information which must be provided by way of notes to the accounts. This specification of detail is reflective of the approach in some other member states, and taken together with the true and fair view principle represents a hybrid approach, with the true and fair view the dominant strain, as it were.</P>
    <P>Essentially, therefore, the Bill will have the effect of substituting the more detailed and precise accounts disclosure requirements contained in its Schedule for those currently contained in the Sixth Schedule to the 1963 Companies Act, in so far as the accounts of public and private <Col N="955" /> limited companies are concerned.</P>
    <P>In so far as the formats of accounts are concerned, companies are being given a choice in the Bill of one of two balance sheet formats and one of four profit and loss account formats.  The differences in either sets of formats are basically presentational. The Bill allows companies to choose so as not to upset whatever current format arrangements they may be using.  Once a company has chosen a particular format it must, with very limited exceptions, stick to that format in subsequent years and not chop and change.  In practice, the choice of formats is not of such diversity as would cause difficulty for people in understanding the accounts.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to particular provisions of the Bill and to offer some comments by way of explanation.  Section 2 (1) of the Bill proposes to exclude certain companies of a non-profit, religious or charitable nature from the scope of the Bill.  This proposal has attracted some comment.  What is proposed in effect in the large majority of cases is not an exemption from publication, since many of the companies involved are public companies obliged to file accounts, but an exemption for such companies from having to follow the detailed rules, formats <i>et cetera</i> of the Bill.  Senators will be familiar with the type of companies involved &mdash; social, cultural, community, educational, religious <i>et cetera</i> companies. The word &ldquo;company&rdquo; usually suggests a commercial connection.  However, the type of entity covered here is well described in L.C.B. Gower's <i>Principles of Modern Company Law</i> as:</P>
    <P>companies formed for purposes other than the profit of their members i.e. those formed for social, charitable, or quasi-charitable purposes.  In this case incorporation is merely a more modern and convenient substitute for the trust.</P>
    <P>I am certain Senators will agree with the proposed exemptions in section 2 (1).</P>
    <P>I am also proposing in section 2 a particular application of the Bill's requirements in the case of banks, other financial <Col N="956" /> institutions and insurance companies. Effectively, the Bill's proposals will result in such bodies having to publish their accounts by filing with the Companies Registration Office and to comply with certain detailed requirements in the Bill, for example, in relation to the directors' report and publication of information on subsidiary and associated companies. However, it is not proposed to require them to follow the specific technical, accounting and presentational measures contained in the Bill, since these are not designed for application to such companies.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the need for special accounting treatment of banks and insurers was recognised in the 1963 Companies Act and more recently in the decisions of the EC Commission to bring forward special directives for application to the accounts of such bodies.</P>
    <P>In so far as insurance companies are concerned such companies are currently required under the Insurance Acts to submit to the Minister their annual report and accounts laid before their AGM, and these reports and accounts are lodged in turn by the insurance section of my Department, together with other returns made by insurers, in the Companies Office.  The provisions of this Bill do not alter that position.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill sets out the basic accounting principles to be followed in preparing accounts.  These are essentially the principles of going concern, consistency and &ldquo;prudence&rdquo; which are part of present practice.  Directors may depart from these principles in drawing up accounts in special circumstances, but full details of the departure and the reasons for it and effect on the balance sheet and profit and loss account must be given in a note to the accounts.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill procures the publication of accounts by requiring them to be annexed to the annual return filed with the Registrar of Companies under the 1963 Act.  The provisions in section 7 mirror those in section 128 of the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 set out the criteria, turnover, gross assets, numbers <Col N="957" /> employed, for qualification as a small or medium-sized company.  The sections apply only to private companies.  The threshold levels used are those which follow the new figures for turnover and gross assets inserted in the original Directive by an amendment to the Directive in November 1984.  The rules for qualfication as a small or medium-sized company may appear somewhat tortuous.  They are but they are what is required by the Directive.  We can go into these rules in more detail on Committee Stage.  Sections 10 to 12 contain the exemptions for small and medium-sized companies.  I will come to those later.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill provides that the directors' report must give certain additional information to that required by section 158 of the 1963 Act.  The extra information now being asked is a fair review of the development of the company's or group's business during the financial years under review, particulars of important events since the end of the financial year, an indication of likely future developments and an indication of the activities of the company and their subsidiaries, if any, in the field of research and development.  This is important information.  Some of it already appears on a voluntary basis in the chairman's report of the larger public companies.  I feel it is useful information to have.  What has caused comment however is the requirement in relation to research and development which some seemingly feel obliges the company to lay bare their business research and development plans to the advantage of competitors.  I see no such implications in the section and a careful reading of the wording will confirm that.  It is up to the directors to decide the extent and nature of the comments they put in their report under this heading, as long as the comments are accurate and convey the information required.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill is a requirement of the Fourth Directive, and the Second Directive, for the directors' report to give details of acquisitions by a company of their own shares.  This is of limited effect in the Irish context.  Section 15 is new <Col N="958" /> and requires the auditors to testify to the consistency of the directors' report with the accounts being reported on.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill provides for the disclosure by companies of information on subsidiary or associated companies. The information required is the name and registered office of the subsidiary or associated company, the nature of the business carried on, details of the shares held, the capital and reserves and profit or loss of the subsidiary or associated company.</P>
    <P>Disclosure of this type is not new to us here.  Section 158 of the 1963 Act already contains such provisions, although these are limited to the name, registered office and the nature of the business.  &ldquo;Associated company&rdquo; is defined in the Bill generally speaking as one in which the investing company has a more than 20 per cent interest.  Certain exemptions from the disclosure rules in respect of the data on reserves and profits are provided for in the section.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill introduces a novel provision into company law in Ireland.  I referred earlier to the view that disclosure is the price for limited liability.  On the basis of that equation the assumption of unlimited liability, or some similar guarantee, should earn one the right of non-disclosure.  Section 17 follows this logic.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides a facility which is allowed in the directive whereby subsidiaries of a parent company in the EC may stand exempted from the requirement to file accounts once a number of strict conditions are fulfilled.  The subsidiary must be a private company, every shareholder in it must agree to the exemption, the parent must guarantee the debts of the subsidiary, the accounts of the subsidiary must be consolidated in the parent's accounts and the group accounts must be drawn up and published in accordance with the Fourth Directive.  The use of the exemption must be notified to the Companies' Office in the annual return of the subsidiary.</P>
    <P>The section as it now stands has been amended from its original form.  The procedures <Col N="959" /> to be followed are now spelt out with greater clarity.  The debts to be covered are specified precisely and the irrevocable nature of the guarantee in respect of those debts is firmly stitched into the text.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 contain provisions concerning the publication of accounts. The principal feature in section 18 is the special auditor's report to attest to the fact that a small or medium-sized company can avail of the exemptions in filing accounts in the Companies' Office.  This procedure is necessary since the registrar could not, nor would it be sensible for him to assume the role of, and become liable for, checking the annual accounts of companies to see if they were qualified for exemption.  The registry acts as a public filing office, not as a supervisor of companies.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 are relatively minor amendments to existing law required by the Directive.  Section 23 was inserted by amendment to cater for a problem which section 222 of the Companies Act, 1963 has caused for persons wishing to pursue rights under employee protection legislation in the case of insolvent companies.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill deal with the usual provisions of offences and penalties, power to modify the Act, and the citation and commencement clauses.</P>
    <P>The penalties for offences are substantial and the fine on summary conviction is set at a maximum of £1,000.  I feel these fines are adequate.  There is no need for draconian penalties.  For most companies the commercial consequences of preparing and publishing inadequate accounts will be a sufficient deterrent in itself.</P>
    <P>The commencement date for the Bill is not specified and will be laid down by order.  I want to give a reasonable period to companies to comply with the new requirements, but at the same time, the measures in the Bill are long overdue. Furthermore we are also being brought before the Court of Justice for failure to implement the Directive in the time laid down.  My options on the commencement date are limited, but I will exercise them <Col N="960" /> to give companies as much time to prepare as is reasonable.</P>
    <P>As indicated earlier, I now wish to go into more detail on the publication requirements for small and medium-sized private companies.  The precise size thresholds for qualification as &ldquo;small&rdquo; or medium-sized are set out in the body of the Bill and are based on the level of a company's gross assets, turnover and number of employees.  A company is required to satisfy any two of these three criteria for two years running in order to qualify for the reliefs provided and of course the extent of these reliefs is greater for small companies than for medium-sized companies.  The reliefs in question relate to both the preparation of accounts for shareholders and the publication of accounts through lodgment with the companies registration office.  In the case of preparation of accounts a small company is permitted to prepare a balance sheet in which certain individual accounts items may be combined under more general headings.  In the case of publication of accounts, a small company is permitted to publish this modified balance sheet and is not required to publish its profit and loss account or its directors report.</P>
    <P>A medium-sized company are permitted a more limited range of exemptions. They may prepare a profit and loss account in which certain information relating to costs of production may be combined under one heading.  This facility will also extend to small companies since a small company are also, by definition, a medium-sized one.  In the case of publication of accounts, a medium-sized company may publish their modified profit and loss account and also a balance sheet in which certain individual accounts items may be combined under one heading. The balance sheet in this case is, however, more extensive than that required of small companies.  With regard to the proposal to avail of the options for private limited companies of limited size, it is important to mention that in no case will the level of disclosure involved be less than that required under the Companies Act, 1963.  Indeed, even for small private <Col N="961" /> limited companies the requirement to publish a balance sheet, together with notes to the accounts, will result in the provision of important information on the affairs of such companies.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the approach adopted in this Bill for the treatment of small private commercial concerns represents a reasonable balance between the interests of users of accounts and the need to avoid an excessive burdening of small industry at a time when the importance of such industry to our future development is becoming more and more apparent. I know that Senators will be supportive of these proposals.</P>
    <P>The view has been expressed that the Bill ignores one important set of interested parties and that is the company's employees.  This is not an accurate representation of the position.  Employees, like others, will have access to the published information.  I am in favour of employees being given information on their work-place and their company.  Much of this data, however, can be sensitive.  In my view, it is best given by direct exchange, and not by filling in a public office.  There is nothing in company law to prevent employees, or their representatives, from seeking the communication of such data as part of the ordinary industrial relations procedure.</P>
    <P>Senators will also notice that the Schedule to the Bill contains information on staff matters of direct relevance to employees.  Furthermore, and this is not in the directive, I have inserted particular provisions requiring detailed disclosure of pension arrangements for employees, a topic of some importance.  I know that this type of information disclosure will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the Schedule to the Bill.  While the Schedule is of particular relevance, dealing as it does with the more detailed technical aspects, I must confine myself here to a general overview of it.  In addition to the formats of accounts, the Schedule sets out the procedures to be followed in valuing assets and liabilities under the historic cost and <Col N="962" /> current cost methods of valuation, both of which are permitted by the Bill, and itemises the matters to be covered by way of notes to the accounts.  It also contains requirements aimed at identifying the nature and extent of inter-company dealings and provides certain reliefs considered necessary to cater for the specialised activities of certain types of investment companies.</P>
    <P>The main disclosure elements in the Schedule are contained in Part IV.  This part sets out the information to be given by way of notes to the balance sheet or profit and loss account.  Under section 12 of the Bill small and medium-sized companies are exempt from having to publish the information required by certain of the notes to the accounts set out in Part IV.  These exemptions parallel those already described in respect of the balance sheet and profit and loss account. Thus, if one is exempt from giving certain data on the face of the accounts, a similar exemption will apply to any notes to the accounts concerning such data.</P>
    <P>Finally, the point has been made that companies should not be allowed to be remiss in fulfilling their statutory obligations. It must be said that failure to file accounts in companies offices is a problem which other EC registries also face.  For our part, I can assure the House that determined efforts are being made to remedy this problem and will continue to be made.  I realise that the disclosure requirements of this Bill are, to a large extent, only as good as what is ultimately filed in the companies office.  It is the Government's intention to make the Bill as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>From this review of the Bill, I am sure that Senators will appreciate that the subject matter is fairly complex.  In formulating the Bill, I had regard to the views of industry, the trade union movement and the accountancy profession and I should like to avail of this opportunity to thank all those bodies for their submissions on this subject.  I believe that this Bill has important consequences of benefit to many, and I recommend it for the approval of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, this Bill is a response in this country to the Fourth EC Company Law Directive which deals with the publication of the annual accounts of both public and private companies.  I understand there are ten of these directives, most of which I believe have been adopted by the EC, though I understand one or two are still under consideration.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these directives is to bring more consistency into the publication of company information and, on a more open basis, in the various member states. Other issues dealt with by the directives include the professional qualifications of auditors and cross-Border mergers of public limited companies.  The directives represent part of the EC strategy of creating a single market through the removal of non-tariff barriers between member states.  To that extent the Fourth Directive and, indeed, the other directives may be welcomed.  It is a small economy such as our own that suffers most from non-tariff restrictions.  Indeed, we have much evidence of that in recent months.</P>
      <P>There are aspects of the Bill which give rise to some cause for concern.  One of these would be the possible effects on our small firms and another, the extent to which complying firms would be penalised due to failure by other firms to make the required returns to the company's office.  I usually speak on behalf of the small firms here &mdash; I think I am right to do so.  I note that there are exemptions in the Bill for qualifying small private companies.  Section 10 provides that a small firm may return an abridged balance sheet showing only those items preceeded by letters or, indeed, Roman numerals in Formats 1 and 2 of the balance sheet formats set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  The information required on both formats is identical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference is one of layout.  Here are the information headings required of small companies.  Under Format 1 is the main heading &mdash; Fixed Assets and then there is a subsidiary heading which refers to intangible assets, tangible assets and financial assets.  Then there is the heading, Current Assets with subsidiary <Col N="964" /> headings of Stocks, Debtors, Investments and Cash.  Then there follows such headings as, Creditors, net current assets, total assets less current liabilities, Creditors, Amounts falling due after more than one year, provision for liabilities and charges, Under Capital and Reserves are the subheadings, called up share capital, Share Premium account, Revaluation Reserve and other reserves.</P>
    <P>There are 13 separate information headings. In addition, the debtors heading must be divided between debts due in less than one year and debts due after more than one year.  This level of public disclosure of information has no previous parallel for our smaller companies.  It has to be set against the 63 information headings required of larger companies and 33 items for medium sized companies.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect of this Bill is the exemption in section 10(2) to small companies from having to attach the profit and loss account and directors' report to the return to the companies office which the Minister mentioned in his speech.  While scrutiny of a small company's balance sheet in the Companies Office over a period of years would give a pretty good indication of their strength and performance, such a company would still retain some advantages in the matter of disclosure requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 8(2) sets out the qualifying conditions for treatment as a small company as fulfilment of any two of the following three conditions: the balance sheet total shall not exceed £1.25 million for the relevant year, the amount of turnover for that year shall not exceed £2.5 million, and the average number of persons employed in that year shall not exceed 50.</P>
    <P>The balance sheet and turnover requirements for classification as a small company are fair enough so far as I am concerned but I have a problem with the employment limit.  Section 8 (3) provides for the employment qualification for a medium sized company as a maximum of 250.  Medium sized companies also gain certain concessions from this Bill.  These conditions deal with an abridged balance sheet, a profit and loss returns are set out <Col N="965" /> in section 11.  At their very first meeting on 30 October, 1983, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Small Businesses of which I am vice chairman, after a long discussion between the members, opted unanimously for 100 employees as the maximum number for a small firm. Accepting that definition, the committee were conscious that European and American definitions of small firms tended to be more liberal than in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Is the limit of 50 employees, set out in section 8, an EC requirement?  If not, could the limit be increased to 100 in line with what the committee opted for?  We will be bringing forward a very important report soon on insurance.  It will raise some hairs in this House and in the other House too but I would remind the Minister that our four reports to date have been adopted by Seanad Éireann and have been welcomed.  Some of the recommendations have been implemented by Government.  The only disappointment we have is that more of our recommendations have not been implemented to date. In fairness, some of our recommendations, especially with regard to small businesses, have been adopted and I am sure will bear fruit in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am not against business disclosure in itself.  For example, more published information on all companies would be a safeguard to legitimate companies against the activities of delinquent directors who are one of the scourges of honest business in Ireland today.  In addition, a more open attitude on the part of all companies would force a wider public to realise that everyone in business knows that our small firms in particular have been living through very tough times in recent years.  As every bank manager knows, there is no gravy train for business in Ireland today.  If there was more disclosure, workers in formulating wage demands would have a greater awareness of economic realities facing all business. In the past the realities have not matched wage expectations.  However, greater information on the performance of companies should, in time, bring greater maturity to the particular area I <Col N="966" /> have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Discussing a Bill such as this, we must look at the EC as it is in reality.  Developments which reduce barriers and introduce a greater degree of harmony in member states are in themselves beneficial to smaller members in that they make the markets of the larger members more accessible to exporters in the smaller member states like Ireland.  The EC is made up of 12 states, with their own legal systems and traditions.  Some countries operate fairly full disclosure of systems and other countries tend to be less open. We have much evidence of this in recent months.</P>
    <P>Since we joined the Community in 1973 we have tended to comply faithfully with the implementation of EC requirements. Progress in the passing of the necessary legislation to comply with the Fourth Directive in other EC states has been uneven.  It is important in the interest of all our companies that there be a transition period to ensure that the Bill is implemented in line with actual implementation in other member states.  This is an important point that I would like the Minister to reflect on and to make his views known to the House when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>All firms affected by the Bill will in future have to make more detailed returns to the Companies Registration Office.  The reputation of this office in terms of efficiency is not of the highest, according to the information available to me.  How often have members of the public gone to the Companies Registration Office to seek information on a company only to find that the file was completely out of date and that no return had been made for a number of years? The most disturbing feature here is that follow-up procedures seem non-existent.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that the implementation of the provisions of the Bill would offer a measure of protection against dilinquent directors.  If we were in a situation where reputable companies only were making returns in line with the expanded information provisions of the Bill and other more marginal firms were not bothering to, then we are imposing a <Col N="967" /> relative penalty on complying companies in the absence of follow-up procedures. I acknowledge that there are substantial penalties for non-compliance, as the Minister has described and as set out in section 22 of the Bill.  I should like the Minister's assurance that we are not discussing one more item of legislation without the means to implement it. Unless the Companies Registration Office is fully geared to cope with the demands that the enactment of the Bill will make on it, I believe that no implementation at all would be more beneficial than full implementation.</P>
    <P>We need to consider the additional extra burden of bureaucracy the Bill will place on smaller companies.  We have discussed many aspects of the problems facing them.  The manager of a small firm and of the ordinary business establishment in many instances is the boss, runs the business from every level, mopping the floors, handling the cash and so on. He is over-burdened with this type of bureaucracy.  We made specific recommendations to the House in our four reports that have been dealt with to date. We recommended changes in that direction. The Minister should examine these recommendations once again.  Their implementation will cost nothing to the State.  They will relieve the small business manager of much extra hype, worry and bureaucracy that he or she is tied up in at the moment, therefore allowing them to devote more of their energies to running the business.  I ask the Minister to examine the recommendations and to bring them to the attention of the Minister for Finance, especially those regarding tax returns, including VAT, and adopt them.  I realise that we have to comply with EC requirements and, on balance, the harmonisation of Community policies in the industrial and services area will benefit our economy.</P>
    <P>As stated in our reports, one area that must be explored more fully is the service industry where there is great potential for employment.  We are turning our back on this.  I was speaking to somebody involved in this industry over the weekend. <Col N="968" /> He had a long list of complaints to relate to me, like being stopped by the customs men for carrying red diesel, which is fair enough as people should not be carrying it; that county roads are breaking up; like motor tax; insurance, taxation at all levels.  That is the commercial sector that can provide extra employment and shorten the dole queues.  It is the one sector which is totally ignored here.  The Minister has a deep interest in this sector. This area should be fully examined to try to alleviate many of the hardships that exist there.  We have to comply with EC requirements and on balance the harmonisation of Community policies in the industrial service areas will benefit the economy.  However, on each occasion that we pass a Bill of this type we are adding to the administrative burden on small firms.  It is a burden which was highlighted in the reports of the Small Businesses Committee.  Perhaps, in the interests of the real economy, wealth and jobs it is time that we brought forward measures to reduce the burden of regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not take long on the Second Stage of this Bill because the Bill is primarily a Bill to be considered in detail at Committee Stage.  I would like to make a few general comments about the Bill, and briefly, as the Minister has done, review a number of the sections of the Bill so as to give the Minister the benefit of our thinking in advance of Committee Stage so that he can focus his attention on certain areas of the Bill which I feel require expansion.</P>
      <P>First, the implementation of the Fourth Directive is long overdue as the Minister indicated in his speech.  In general, the manner of its proposed implementation finds support on all sides of the House.  The Bill, however, has, in addition to the important matters relating to the Fourth Directive, certain implications for the general body of companies legislation.  It is only right that it should be subject to the most careful scrutiny on Committee Stage, as I know it was in Dáil Eireann, before its eventual enactment in an amended or unamended form.</P>
      <P>It is welcome that more information will be available to the general public regarding limited liability companies. Limited liability companies are a privilege conferred on individuals for the purpose of easing the financial responsibility of undertaking risky ventures.  One of the earlier judges made the famous statement: &ldquo;all limited liability companies are a potential fraud on their creditors.&rdquo;  That statement has at least an element of truth in it while of course exaggerating the position slightly.  In that regard the protection to be afforded to the general body of creditors in a limited liability company must be under constant review and the initiative of the European Community in including in one of its directives information on the necessity for the enactment into legislation of information to be made public in respect of all limited companies is indeed welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, before dealing with the details of the Bill I will refer to a number of problems in that area.  Senator Lynch has already referred to the problem associated with the Companies Office.  It is important that the Companies Office <Col N="970" /> should be given the help and support of the House and the Minister in reinforcing the very difficult job it has of policing the enormous number of limited companies which now exist.  From my involvement in business over the years I am well aware that a proliferation of companies in a particular business enterprise is something which can happen very easily.  The paper work associated with keeping those companies right with the Companies Office is a very onerous responsibility. That responsibility is not being fully met by those responsible to the Companies Office at the present time.</P>
    <P>At present the requirement is to file an annual return and to make such further returns as are necessary with regard to security and so on.  The annual returns are not being made with the pace and consistency necessary in order to keep the files up to date.  In the past as long as the register relating to securities and the property of the company was up to date and the appropriate documents were lodged in the Companies Office then the failure to lodge an annual return inconvenienced those who were inquiring about the company rather than misled them, by and large.  We must recognise that with the enactment of the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1985 that will change and the responsibility of the directors and secretary of a company to make those returns will be elevated from a matter of mere administrative convenience to one where it will be a fundamental part of the permission which they have for the operation of the company to make those returns because on those returns certain credit decisions will be taken.</P>
    <P>We should point out to those involved in those companies that failure to make those returns may lead to a situation where directors will be personally responsible for debts.  That development in the law of equity, even though it is not a statute law is possible.  It is possible that a creditor who is aggrieved by not having his full repayment made on the liquidation or receivership of a company may be able to go personally against the directors of the company if those directors have not fulfilled their duty of filing <Col N="971" /> accounts, particularly where the filing of those accounts would have forewarned the general public and the creditors with regard to impending problems in the company.</P>
    <P>Given the right circumstances where a person did in fact make the inquiry and where the accounts were not properly filed and where if they had been filed the person would have been warned, a very onerous responsibility might rest with the company's secretary or the company's directors with regard to the failure to lodge those accounts.  I will deal with that and also with the problems with regard to accountants and their duties later on. It is no longer a matter of administrative convenience if a company does not file accounts; it will become a matter of absolute necessity that returns are made in time and as a result of that it will be a matter of necessity that an early warning system in the Companies Office would be used to warn the general public and those in authority in the Companies Office of the failure of certain companies to make returns.  In that regard the striking-off of companies who fail to make returns and fail to file accounts should be examined on a much more systematic basis than previously.  This is a very important development of this new companies legislation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the question of filing returns, there are tremendous duties which will fall on the officers of a company with regard to the various additional requirements.  The officers of a company in that regard include the directors, the secretary and, of course, the auditor of the company who in this Bill is elevated to a position of extreme importance to which I will refer later on.</P>
    <P>I do not quibble with the Minister &mdash; he has my full support &mdash; on his decision to have three categories of companies. That is right and proper.  I do not quibble with the Minister regarding the question of the division of companies into small, medium and large and the criteria he has used for the division.  The Minister has shown great flexibility in that regard and, while I will be interested to hear what <Col N="972" /> other Members of the House have to say, I am predisposed to accept the Minister's view and the decisions with regard to the various criteria to be adopted and the fact two out of three of them is the operative number &mdash; all these things &mdash; find support with me.</P>
    <P>The general principle of the Bill and, indeed the general thrust of the Bill is to be supported.  I would like to say that to the Minister because the Minister will be aware that it is normally the position in the Seanad that people from all sides of the House put down amendments, not to embarrass the Minister or the Government but to seek to improve the legislation &mdash; that is our responsibility.  The Minister can be assured that in this regard the principle behind the legislation is certainly enthusiastically accepted by all members of the Fine Gael Party on this side of the House.  Our comments will be constructive to try to improve the legislation if possible.  It may well be, as happens very often, that the discussion of a particular amendment shows that the Minister and his advisers have got it right.  In that case, of course, the amendments are withdrawn.  Very often amendments are withdrawn also because the alternative is to have a vote which might not be appropriate in the circumstances.  We are hopeful that the Minister would adopt the same constructive approach as we do. If this is a good Bill I am quite happy to see it come from the Seanad unamended. If, on examination on Committee Stage, we see any defect in the Bill I would hope the Minister would recognise that defect.</P>
    <P>I have read the Bill three times.  I read it when it came out first but by the time I read it again I had totally forgotten what it contained because it is so complex and complicated.  However, the Bill appears to be quite well drafted and the number of drafting points we will be talking about will be quite small.  There are, however, a number of points of substance to which I will now refer.  Before doing that, I should say that while I am now a lawyer I practised for some time as an accountant.  I am still a member of an accountancy body which is a member of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy <Col N="973" /> Bodies of Ireland.  There are three bodies who are members of that.  They are the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the Association of Certified Accountants and the Institute of Cost and Management Accounts.  I am a member of the latter institute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot afford these things.  One has to come from a wealthy background like Senator Conway to be able to afford that sort of thing.  So, a lot of what I have to say will be against the background of an accountant's perspective of the thing.  It is only fair that I should say that to the Minister and the House because I normally view things from a lawyer's perspective but in this case I will probably view many of them from an accountant's perspective.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the suggestion that had been made that certain charities should not be exempt from the provisions of the Bill.  I have no desire to have religious bodies included in the scope of the Bill but, with respect to charitable organisations, it could well be that people are advancing credit.  They are entitled to know from that point of view that the financial status of the organisation is in a way which is compatible with the remainder of the information which would be available in the Companies Office.  In addition to that it is a discipline which would not go amiss in certain charitable organisations.  While I recognise that there is no obligation on us under the Fourth Directive to make such a provision the option is open to do so if we so wish. While I am not excited about the prospect I think the Minister might have another look at that to see if it is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of the implementation period and said that he would be as generous as possible. I understand that there is under article 52(2) of the Fourth Directive an 18 month implementation period envisaged.  I wonder if, in view of the slowness with which we introduced our legislation, the Minister, when replying to the Second Stage debate, would indicate if that 18 <Col N="974" /> month implementation period is still available to us and if not can we jolly them along for 18 months even if that 18 month implementation period is not officially available to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that you are called before a court of justice but once we are doing it I do not think time will be of the essence.  The Minister confidently expects, as I do, that this Bill will become law before the end of the parliamentary session.  I suppose the Minister will have a very substantial answer to any legal cases which might be pending before the court.  I would like to hear the Minister expand more fully on that aspect of it.  If not the 18 month implementation period, what implementation period does the Minister envisage? The Minister is probably aware of the fact that one of the requirements in lodging the balance sheets and the various other things that have to be lodged is that the position in the previous year has also to be lodged at the same time.  The Minister will understand, of course, that if you had an implementation period of, for example, two or three months, in making your first lodgment you would have to restate the position with regard to the previous year when your accounts had not been prepared on that basis.  That was the original reason for the implementation period of more than 12 months &mdash; to allow these comparative figures to be phased in properly.  I look forward to what the Minister has to say about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to a discussion on section 13 of the Bill which deals with the fact that the report of the directors shall contain, in addition to the information already required, a fair view of the development of the business, particulars of any important events affecting the company or any of the subsidiaries, an indication of the likely future developments of the company and an indication of the activities of the company and its subsidiaries. The effect on the company of the non-inclusion of any of these items either <Col N="975" /> accidentally or deliberately by the directors, on a continuing basis, on the one hand, or in the event of insolvency on the other, is a matter I will be asking the Minister about when we arrive at section 13.  I am telling the Minister this now because it is only fair to give advance warning of this kind of thing.  Otherwise the Minister could not be expected to have all the answers at short notice.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also be aware of the representations he has received with regard to the fears of the combination of sections 13, 15 and 18 relating to the requirement that the auditors of the company must be satisfied that the directors are entitled to rely on the exemptions &mdash; this is in the case of small and medium-sized companies &mdash; and that the accounts have been properly prepared pursuant to these provisions.  The definition of what is meant in that case by &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo; is a matter on which I know the Minister will be well briefed because it has been raised elsewhere.  This is a matter to which I will be drawing particular attention.  The fear exists that there will remain under the Companies Act a duty on the auditors to present accounts that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs in the company at a particular date.  The fear is possibly exaggerated and a ministerial statement to that effect might ease a lot of problems.  These accounts will be the ordinary accounts of the company.  In the case of small and medium-sized companies these accounts will be truncated.  They will be summarised and certain notes will be eliminated. The elimination of these notes may affect the ability of any person to say that the truncated accounts continue to give a true view.  The Minister is aware of the problem.  I will be discussing this on Committee Stage.  No doubt, the Minister will be prepared to discuss that matter with us.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is an exemption for subsidiaries. I understand, agree and appreciate the Minister's reason for that exemption.  I support that exemption in general. I would like the Minister to explain &mdash;<Col N="976" /> because I do not really understand it &mdash; how this will affect the subsidiaries of international companies here.  I understand how it affects subsidiaries of European companies because that is specifically catered for.  I do not want to mention a particular company because that might be unfair but the Minister might indicate what the position will be in respect of a company which might have its headquarters in New York, Japan or any such place.  How will they be affected and how does the Bill deal with that matter?  I have no doubt that there is a very simple and satisfactory answer to it.</P>

      <P>Black holes can have their prospective points.  I would not be altogether against black holes.  They have a certain benefit to the Irish economy because while a company might be sending money out of the country it might be money that would not have come in here in the first place if they were not in operation here.  One can be a bit simplistic about black holes and make laws so tight that eventually people cannot operate here at all.  I do not want to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to discuss with the Minister during the course of the Bill, certain problems which may arise with regard to the analysis of tax which needs to be appended to the new accounts showing the amount of money due to the Revenue Commissioners under various headings. Is that still part of the Bill?  If so, the <Col N="977" /> Minister might like to explain the position with regard to it.  I am completely at variance with the Minister's Department and with the Government &mdash; and with the Opposition when they were in Government &mdash; on the increasing amount of protection being given to the Revenue Commissioners over and above ordinary creditors.  I am not against protection for the Revenue Commissioners but I am against it being done at the expense of protection for the ordinary creditors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out that this is primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, I understand that.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but, as I understand it, there are reporting obligations imposed in the Schedule.  These reporting obligations mean that one must lay out the amount of tax which is owed under various headings. I am not talking about priority of the tax at present &mdash; although in an aside I may have referred to it.  I am not expecting this Minister to solve that problem for me.  Note 7 of the Schedule to the Bill states:</P>
      <P>The amount for creditors in respect of taxation and social welfare shall be shown separately from the amount for other creditors and in respect of taxation there shall be stated separately the amounts included in respect of income tax payable on emoluments...income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, value added tax and any other tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like showing taxation separately from other people.  If one must show taxation separately from other people, to go into this kind of analysis is extremely difficult and tedious.  How beneficial is it? If somebody owes income tax, corporation <Col N="978" /> tax, how beneficial is it to know that it is income tax rather than corporation tax or <i>vice versa</i>?  I do not see why gratuitous information of that type could or should be made available.  The taxable profit of a company could be calculated from that also.  It has various other implications which I would like to tease out with the Minister during the course of discussion on the Schedule.</P>
    <P>As the Minister quite rightly said, we do not expect the Minister to solve the problems of the Minister for Finance because we know he cannot do that.  The Minister has a personal influence on Government.  We must use every opportunity to influence him and the Government to try to redress the balance which has now gone too far in favour of the Revenue Commissioners and too much against the ordinary creditors.  This is not the core of it but it is a symptom.  For some reason or other it seems to be more sinful not to pay your tax rather than not to pay the blacksmith down the road.  It is equally sinful not to pay both.  The blacksmith is as entitled to his money as the Revenue Commissioners are.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points which I would like to bring to the Minister's attention at this stage.  The general format permitted in respect of small companies where profit and loss accounts are not required is quite sensible.  The Minister has my full support in that regard.  It is a sensible use of the discretions which are available.  The information which will be compulsory in the case of the larger companies will make a valuable contribution towards our understanding of the performance of our corporate sector, the preservation of the credit rating and credit worthiness of companies who deserve to have their credit rating preserved and the signalling at an early stage, in other cases, of trouble allowing people to take action at that early stage.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, however, the Minister's Bill is welcome.  We look forward to discussing it in greater detail on Committee Stage and to considering the various points raised by both Senator Lynch and myself.  No doubt, further points will be raised by other speakers <Col N="979" /> during the course of this Second Stage Debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give this Bill a guarded welcome.  The whole thrust of the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1985, is to comply with the provisions of the Fourth EC Company Law Directive. With regard to Irish law it effectively means the repeal of section 128 of the Companies Act, 1963, under which private companies were not required to publish accounts and give detail of those accounts.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The removal of this &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; ... will have an important bearing on the operation of private companies in the State.  Such companies have, for valid reasons, put some value on the fact that they do not have to publish accounts.</P>
      <P>He also referred to limited liability being a privilege and possibly, disclosure then being the price of that privilege:</P>
      <P>...disclosure of accounts to benefit creditors, employees and others is the price that should be rightly asked for this privilege.</P>
      <P>I would agree with that.  I do not understand what the Minister is saying about the balance sheet.  To my mind the balance sheet takes into consideration other creditors.  One would have to have an analysis of &ldquo;other creditors&rdquo; on the basis of the amount of tax owing under the various headings.  I presume the Minister is referring to the amounts owing in terms of VAT, PAYE, income tax and corporation tax.  I see nothing wrong in having that outlined on the balance sheet.  It would be very important for people &mdash; especially employees, to know the situation and for the company itself to lay out for the Revenue Commissioners exactly what is happening.  I cannot understand why this burden should be put on small companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lynch has raised the point about failure by other firms to comply with the Bill.  Surely it is up to the <Col N="980" /> Government to provide that the Companies Registration Office ensure that the Fourth Directive is complied with.  It has to be mandatory in the same way as it is mandatory for a company to supply the Revenue Commissioners with a P35 at the end of the year.  I can see no reason why this should not be mandatory and why there should not be a fine if it is not complied with.  If all companies have to comply with it, there is no advantage from one firm to another.  I see that as a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The provision for the protection of the true and fair view of the accounts is a good one.  It is a true and fair appreciation of the accounts when written at the bottom of a balance sheet that what the accountant has seen and judged has been a true and fair view of the company concerned. The companies office will have to be more effective.  They are totally ineffective at the moment.  There is no question of getting returns from any company. If they were to inspect companies books they would probably find that there was nothing in the files of about 95 per cent of those companies already trading. The Companies Registration Office do not insist that the annual return should be filled up.  They may occasionally remind one to fill up the annual return but once that is ignored no further reminders are sent out.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary talked about the Revenue Commissioners and how they should rank in relation to preference over other creditors.  They should have preference but I believe also that they have been negligent in the manner in which they have been collecting their debts. They have been negligent for various reasons.  One reason is because they do not know exactly what is due to them. This Bill would ensure that they would know for the first time exactly what was due to them from various companies.  It would be of benefit to employees, to the Revenue Commissioners and to everybody concerned that this legislation would go through.</P>
    <P>If I were to criticise the Bill, I would criticise it because first you are bringing in elastoplast to tap the loopholes in the <Col N="981" /> Companies Act, 1963, and both the amending Acts of 1982 and 1983 which were passed by the Oireachtas.  That means there will now be four Acts governing companies in Ireland, none of which is adequately covering the territory of today's high standards.  The Oireachtas has lost a golden opportunity in this area to provide the country with an appropriately updated Companies Act instead of applying sticking plaster to the deficiencies of existing Acts.</P>
    <P>In any European country, one can get for about £3 a profit and loss account and balance sheet of any private company. I know, from dealing with the English situation, that we always have to lodge the profit and loss account and balance sheet of a company.  All companies dealing with the companies office comply with that.  In Europe the same position prevails. If one wished to get information on companies, one went into the companies registration office where the information would be on computer.</P>
    <P>In accordance with this Bill it is only the balance sheet that can be obtained. While it will be a full balance sheet, it does not give all the details of the profit and loss account.  It is falling short of that. I cannot see any reason why it should not produce the profit and loss account and balance sheet.  It means that effectively 2,500 companies out of the 110,000 companies registered may be required to give details of the balance sheet and profit and loss account.  I understand that there are certain loopholes in the Bill which could be used to avoid giving these details.</P>
    <P>The Bill means that 97 per cent of all companies in Ireland will not have to reveal the details of their profit and loss accounts with their annual return.  The figure is arrived at because 95 per cent of the companies in this country employ fewer than 12 people.  The Bill as presented to the Seanad seems to be extremely flawed.  In section 2, for instance, and I may have to be corrected on this, hire purchase companies, and companies such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Fóir Teoranta, the Industrial Credit Corporation and other such bodies are exempted.  These companies <Col N="982" /> should be brought within the provision in the same way as other companies because they are at the centre of activity in industry.  It should be mandatory that every company, big or small, produce its profit and loss account and balance sheet. There is no great extra effort needed because the accounts are already being produced for the Revenue Commissioners. There should not be any great problem in sending on a copy of those accounts to the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    <P>There is a problem of competition but I do not see this as a great problem.  All the banks produce their full accounts and there is massive competition there.  The fact of a bank knowing what is happening in other banks will not affect the trading of those other banks.</P>
    <P>The Bill should have gone further and included the profit and loss account.  In that regard the Minister talked about the employees of a company and expressed the opinion that there might be problems for the employers to issue whatever statements they wished.  The only way employees could get their information is through the Companies Registration Office.  It is only fair that they know how their company are doing from time to time.  Many employees go to work not knowing how their company stand, whether their PAYE and other contributions are being returned by the company, whether there has been a change of directors and so on.  Under this Act they will not get any further information.  They will get the information on the balance sheet but they will not get details of the profit and loss account which they should get.  They will not get this information from the management, either.  I can see no problem in regard to competition.  I know from private companies that they have this fixation about secrecy and possibly that is the reason they are excluded in this area, because of the pressure they have brought on the Minister to cover this secrecy business.  They are afraid that if they have to produce these accounts they will lose business and that the core of Irish industry will in some way be cut back.  I cannot see that happening.  If <Col N="983" /> companies are to publish balance sheets why not publish profit and loss accounts as well?</P>
    <P>Therefore in the matter of employees and creditors and of people who might be dealing with companies, it is important that the information be available.  I know of cases in which an individual and his wife are in charge of 16 to 18 companies, half of them in liquidation, a quarter dormant and one trading.  This depends on the climate and what is happening. Therefore, there should be a tie-up.  One should be able to name the director so that one knows what company that director is involved in, what shareholding he has in each company and how the companies are doing.  All of that should be available at the touch of a button.  At present one cannot get that information because, first it is not on file and, secondly, it is not computerised to the degree it should be.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction. It is a good first attempt.  It should have gone further.  There was the opportunity of revising the Companies Act, 1963, to review the position in the world of commerce in 1985.  That opportunity was not availed of for various reasons.  I do not know why it was not done.  That is why I give the Bill a guarded welcome. Nevertheless I welcome it.  I agree with the Minister about the price of limited liability.  The way limited liability has been treated by companies in Ireland is a disgrace.  There are cases of limited liability companies folding up one day and the next day starting up, not only on the sites beside them but in some cases in the premises they were in the day before.  They lease back the equipment from the liquidator and start off all over again.  That carry-on has to stop.  It is done to evade paying VAT and PAYE. All the other creditors have been fixed up before the company goes into liquidation because the company want their services after they go into liquidation.  They want a fresh start and with a clean sheet.  In some cases small companies owe £500,000 to the Revenue Commissioners. <Col N="984" /> How that could come about is unbelievable. Some companies have never paid VAT or PAYE and they have been trading for some five or six years.  How they could get away without paying for such a long time is beyond me.  How they can walk away from it all free agents and start up again next door or, in some cases in the premises they just left, is also beyond me.  It is a good thing the Government brought in provision for employees whereby they are protected, irrespective of the money being paid over.  Once the returns are made the employees are protected.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a first and fairly major step in that for the first time companies have to produce their balance sheet for the record for the Companies Office.  I would have liked the Government to have gone the whole way.  There was an opportunity to do that but for reasons of competition, sensitivity or whatever, the Government did not take that step.  Nevertheless I accept that the Bill represents a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few general comments on this Bill.  I will be relatively brief because, as mentioned by some previous speakers here, it is by and large a Committee Stage Bill.  Certain aspects of it need to be teased out in greater detail.  It is very much a noncontroversial Bill.  There has been, in general, a guarded welcome for it.  Nonetheless there is a welcome in varying degrees for it.  One could say it is a measure that has been forced on the Government due to the requirement to comply with EC Regulations or to comply with the Fourth EC Company Law Directive. Because of the requirement to bring in a measure such as this, the Minister obviously availed of the opportunity to bring other related matters within the scope of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister told us, the Bill is required to comply with the Fourth EC Company Law Directive which mainly deals with the content and publication of annual accounts of both public and private limited companies.  There is an increase in the level of disclosure <Col N="985" /> required under these regulations.  It is interesting to consider the extent of the Schedule to the Bill which sets out the details which have to be complied with in meeting this requirement.  The Minister mentioned that, in the course of the preparation of this measure, discussions took place with industrial interests, trade unions and the accountancy profession. He thanked them for their co-operation and help in bringing forward a measure which has met with a reasonable measure of acceptance and agreement.</P>
    <P>Apart from meeting the requirements of the Fourth EC Company Law Directive, developments in recent years have shown the need for a greater level of disclosure by creditors, shareholders and employees alike &mdash; a need which other Senators have pointed out.  It is in the interests of all three categories that there should be a better level of disclosure.</P>
    <P>A basic principle that has been long established is the need to produce and present &ldquo;a true and fair view&rdquo; of the financial and trading situation of companies. It is a term that has been used in the 1963 Act and it represents a basic principle that has existed for some time. The Minister referred to it on a number of occasions during the course of his speech. What I am concerned about in relation to the term &ldquo;true and fair view&rdquo;&mdash; I do not understand from reading the Bill or the Minister's speech &mdash; is who, at the end of the day, will decide or adjudicate what is a &ldquo;true and fair view&rdquo; of the position?  Perhaps there is a simple answer.  It may well be that it has evaded me but I would certainly like that point to be clarified.</P>
    <P>More detailed and precise disclosure will be required in the accounts of both public and private companies.  The Minister has given companies a choice of balance sheet and the format of the profit and loss account they may use &mdash; two choices of balance sheet and four choices of the type of profit and loss accounts.  It simplifies the requirement.  While I sympathise with the point made earlier by Senator Lynch that, in relation to the smaller companies and smaller business there will be a growth in volume of <Col N="986" /> requirements to be met, which imposes a growing burden on the time and resources of many of them.  I sympathise strongly with that point made by Senator Lynch.  Nonetheless I feel that what is required does not represent an undue addition to that burden.  The fact that these choices are being made available to a company does not impose what could be regarded as an objectionable additional burden.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that excludes from the Bill what are described as noncommercial companies, charitable and religious organisations.  &ldquo;Non-profit-making&rdquo; is the term that has been used. Senator Conway asked what are the limits and what is the point of no return in relation to deciding that a particular company is non profit-making.  Perhaps the Minister might like to comment on that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the exemption being provided for the small and medium size companies. This facility is available only to private companies and not to public ones. The qualifying threshold is based on assessment of company's gross assets, their turnover and their number of employees.  It is a reasonable yardstick to use in distinguishing between the small, the medium and the other ones.  The details are set out pretty clearly in the Schedule, the requirement for the small and medium size companies what they have to publish and the extent of what is required by them.</P>
    <P>The small companies are required to publish only a balance sheet; they are not required to publish a profit and loss account or a directors' report.  I understand a profit and loss account and the directors' report will have to be published by the medium size companies in a modified form.  I might find myself in disagreement with Senator Conway on this.  It represents a reasonable recognition by the Minister of what a small or medium sized company should be required to produce.  The Minister has recognised that there is a need to protect information relating to trading that could be useful to competitors of a company. This point was overlooked by Senator <Col N="987" /> Conway when he was expressing his views.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a constructive response to a situation that needed attention for some time.  I welcome the requirement in section 2 in relation to banks, financial institutions and insurance companies that they will be required to file more information in the Companies Office.  The additional detailed information which will be required in directors' reports to subsidiary or associated companies, is set out in the Schedule and is a requirement that experience has shown to be long overdue.</P>
    <P>Section 13 includes a requirement for information in directors' reports on the progress and development of a company particularly in relation to important events that have taken place from the end of the accounting year to the publication of the accounts.  Depending on the length of the period many important things can take place.  The requirement that important events should be included in the directors' report is a welcome development.  I am pleased to see it there as well as the requirement in section 15 for auditors to confirm the accuracy of the directors' report.  I regard the treatment of small and medium size firms as reasonable.  The Minister struck a right balance.  He referred to the need to have the correct balance and I believe he has achieved that.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary expressed reservations with regard to what would appear in recent legislation to be the continuing strengthening of the position of the Revenue Commissioners against the position of other creditors.  I sympathise with Senator O'Leary.  I assure him, without going into detail because this is a Committee Stage Bill, that I will be supporting him on that particular point.  I welcome the measure.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to Senators for their constructive contribution to the Bill and for the somewhat guarded welcome which they have given to it.  I should point out immediately that this directive was <Col N="988" /> adopted in July 1978 and it was expected that it would be transposed into national law in member states by July 1980 and, in effect, that it would be in place in all member states by February 1982.  One cannot say that we are in the vanguard of implementing the directive.  In fact the very opposite is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We never are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been taken before the Court of Justice, by the Commission for non-implementation of the directive.  In response to Senators' contributions, I would like to make the following points.  Senator Lynch, in his comment on small companies, referred to the information on the balance sheet. The information required on the balance sheet is the minimum required by the directive.  We do not have any latitude to reduce the information required in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment level figures are the maximum allowed by the directive, 50 employees for a small and 250 for a medium size company.  It should be pointed out that this employment criterion is only one of three criteria needed for a definition of small or medium size companies.  A company with more than 50 and up to 250 employees could indeed qualify as small or medium size depending on whether they meet the criteria in relation to turnover and in relation to gross asset figures.  A company must qualify on two of the three criteria over a period of two years in order to have a definitive position established.  We are being flexible and fair in the criteria we have adopted in the Bill.  As I said at the outset &mdash; Senator Lynch raised this question &mdash; the transition period is long since past and we do not have a period of grace, as the Senator was trying to suggest.  There should be no doubt about that.  However, I am anxious to give a reasonable period to allow companies to comply with the directive and with the terms of the Bill.  While a final decision has not been made in respect of bringing the Act into effect by order I am disposed to suggest that we would like the date of <Col N="989" /> implementation to be for the financial year commencing on 1 January 1987.  This would mean that the first accounts under the new Act would come on stream only in 1988.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Lynch that the companies should be given time to prepare at ease.  What I am suggesting here is a reasonable decision for me to take and it is one which would be just about tolerated at EC Commission level.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns regarding the comparability of accounts for first year under this Bill with the previous year.  For that reason I am inclined towards the first accounts commencing 1 January 1987 which would allow a further year to have the system going.  I must say that the accounting profession and industrialists are very much aware of the directive.  There have been many symposia and conferences and by now people are aware that this Bill is coming on stream and will become effective sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch referred to the procedures in the Companies Office.  I admit that there have been problems in relation to the non-filing of returns.  Files may not be available at particular times in the Companies Office because they are in use.  On the issue of non-filing the registrar has began an active campaign to remove companies from the register where they are in default filing returns. This procedure has been stepped up.  One can read on a regular basis in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of companies being taken off the register. As far as the unavailability of files is concerned the Senators will be pleased to know that the Companies Office are being computerised.  This is improving access to information for the general public.  I know we can do more and, as I said in my opening remarks it is intended to make this Bill effective, I will, therefore, be attaching quite an amount of importance to ensuring that the Companies Office procedures and availability of information are brought up to the standards that I require.  I would see that as ensuring that this Bill and all other Company Bills are seen to be established. I have no hesitation in saying that priority <Col N="990" /> will be given to this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch referred to the bureaucratic burden on small firms.  I acknowledge the point being made about lessening the burden on small firms. These burdens arise from many sources and very many of them are not under my direct control.  If we confine ourselves to considering the burden of filing accounts there is no direct evidence as to how great an imposition this will be.  It is interesting to note, however, that in a study prepared for the UK Department of Trade and Industry two years ago the burden of Companies Act requirements came thirteenth on a scale and figured well behind problems in relation to VAT returns, customs and excise, finance <i>et cetera.</i>  I do not think that the actual filing becomes a burden because, after all, the filing comes after the compilation of the accounts and after their auditing</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When all the VAT returns are included that is what I mean by the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only a priest over a little sum of sins.  I hope the Senator will forgive me?  In this Bill we have sought to keep the burden at a minimum.  A company generally will be able to look to their accountants to assist in meeting the requirements of the Bill.  Indeed there will be an auditor's certificate accompanying audited accounts.  It would seem that things will fall into place fairly simply and may cause no greater burden than already exists in relation to the filing of returns annually in the Companies Office.  I admit that there will be a greater onus and responsibility on directors and indeed on auditors.  This is what we are trying to redress.  This is the policy issue that is at stake here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thrust of the Bill is to have a greater freedom and a greater availability of information in relation to limited companies.  At the same time we have tried, especially in relation to small firms, not to make the provision in the Bill unduly burdensome on them.  The fact that we only require them to give a limited <Col N="991" /> abbreviated balance sheet is a reflection of our awareness of the burdens on small industry and indeed of our wishes not to impose an under burden on them.</P>
    <P>I am deeply interested in promoting the development of the services sector referred to by Senator Lynch and the matter will be devoted some time in my Department.  It is a very disparate section to come to grips with.  We must continue to use our best efforts to deal with its problems.  I am fully aware of them. Indeed in the reallocation of the portfolios last February, the question of the services industry was specifically raised and it is one which is currently being addressed by me in my Department.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary raised the question of the liability of the directors at law due to failure to file returns.  It is an interesting point which Senator O'Leary made and one worthy to note.  I referred in my opening remarks to the commercial consequences of failure to file or, indeed, the filing of inadequate accounts.  The penalties in the Bill are, of course, in respect of criminal offences.  One cannot rule out, as Senator Lynch said, the possibility of civil consequences.  This is primarily a legal matter.  There are, as I said, fines for non-filing of returns.  I also said the real effect of non-filing will be seen in the commercial sphere where other companies, perhaps who are trading with a company, will be demanding this information. The fact that it is not available will be a greater embarrassment to a company then any penalty that could be inflicted.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary raised the question of the exemption of charitable bodies.  The exemption of charities as such is outlined in section 2 (1) (c) which merely creates a similar exemption as exists in the 1963 Act.  It is nothing new.  There are only 23 companies covered by the exemption. The definition of &ldquo;a company&rdquo; is quite simple and quite understandable.  I am pleased to note that it has gained acceptance in the House.  In so far as exemption of quasi-charitable companies under section 2 (1) (a) of the Bill as far as nonprofit companies are concerned all but <Col N="992" /> two of 370 companies are public companies, so they must file accounts under the 1963 Act.  A list of these 370 companies has been placed in the Library by me a short time ago and is available for the information of the House.</P>
    <P>As regards the role of auditors in relation to the publication of accounts by small and medium-sized companies, I had representations on the lines referred to by Senator O'Leary and I am studying the matter.  The Senator may be right when he says that the fears in this regard are exaggerated but I would be happy to discuss this matter further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In dealing with legislation and in putting onus and responsibility on boards of directors to do the correct thing for the company and in requiring auditors to certify accounts so that they present a true and fair view of the companies, I am not doing anything excessive.  I am doing what is reasonable and what one comes to expect from directors and what one should expect from professional people such as auditors.  I am merely saying that where a person possesses professional qualifications and there is an onus in law on him or her to carry out that onus, that is what should be expected by the Legislature as well as the members of a company to whom the auditors are answerable.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary raises the question of section 17 in relation to US parent companies.  The exemption in the Bill and in the directive applies only to EC parent companies.  I interrupted the Senator to say it is essential that companies registered in Ireland must make returns. There is an exemption being granted in stringent conditions in relation to subsidiary companies of other EC parent companies. This does not exist for subsidiaries of parent companies outside the EC.  That is not an option that is open to them.</P>
    <P>In relation to comparable figures as required in the Bill, I realise that in the first year there may be some problem in compiling comparable figures and it is for this reason that I am anxious to allow <Col N="993" /> some latitude by bringing in the beginning of next year as the commencement date for accounts beginning next year.  I do not have any latitude in respect of comparability.  The companies must have comparable figures.  This is laid down in the directive.  It is not a major issue.  I am quite satisfied that accountants and auditors will be able to resolve the problem fairly easily and that only in a limited number of cases where there has been a drastic change in the direction a company have taken, where they have suddenly changed over from one type of business to another, for example, will there be a problem.  For the vast majority of companies I do not see any major difficulty in compiling comparable figures.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary raised the need for separate detail in taxation for creditors. We decided to require a further breakdown in this information under the different heads.  It is of relevance and of use in assessing the state of a company's affairs.  The amounts in respect of outstanding taxes can become quite high and they are indicators of a company's health. If we are trying to establish a system of greater transparency in the operation of companies and trying to establish a principle of greater flow of information within the commercial sector, the positive benefits for companies who are dealing with companies far outweigh the disadvantages.</P>
    <P>Senator Conway referred to the consolidation and reform of the Companies Acts.  There is a further major domestic companies Bill in the process of being drafted.  It is sometimes referred to as the cowboy directors' Bill.  It is a major Bill and it will be an important measure in updating our law.  Given this, and the probability of further EC directives affecting companies, it is difficult to contemplate a Consolidation Act at this point in time.  There is a great movement in relation to companies, how they act and the part they play in society.  The emphasis that has been given to companies within Europe is dynamic and to contemplate, at this point in time, a consolidation <Col N="994" /> Bill would not be practical until we have a more settled vision of the EC position.  The last <i>magnus opus</i> was in 1963.  I would contemplate at some future date a consolidation Bill but in view especially of the feeling in Europe about the role of companies and the need for such matters as transparency of accounts and accountability possibly in the context of the Vredeling directive which comes under the Department of Labour and which all show a dynamic movement within Europe in relation to companies, at this point I cannot contemplate consolidating legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the availability of accounts, there is no doubt but that we are behind in Europe in this regard.  In most continental countries accounts are available on demand.  The Companies Registration Office have looked at the system in Belgium where the filed accounts are available on a central computerised system.  We have not yet reached that stage, but we are moving towards it under the aegis of the Bill and within the philosophy of the directive we are dealing with.</P>
    <P>Senators Howard and Conway referred to finance companies.  These companies are not included so far as this directive is concerned.  Senator Howard specifically mentioned companies established by statute.  They are obliged to publish their accounts and to lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas. They are also obliged to return them to the Companies Office.  They are audited and are transparent.  The only difference is that finance companies do not have to comply with this directive.  This directive was not designed to apply to financial institutions, nor was it compiled with a view to having it applied to insurance companies.  In this country quite stringent compilation of returns are required by my Department.  They are published annually in the blue book and they form quite a comprehensive picture of the companies concerned.  We are not therefore dealing with financial or insurance institutions, but are primarily dealing with commercial trading companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard asked who would <Col N="995" /> adjudicate as to a true and fair view of a company's affairs.  In the first, instance, there is a responsibility on the directors in compiling their annual report. They have a duty to their shareholders and they also have a duty in law under the Companies Act to act in a certain fashion.  That position is reinforced by the responsibility which falls on auditors to certify a true and fair value and that the books of the company are being kept. Both of these are primary trusts on people which they must be seen to carry out.  In the final analysis a court would have to decide as a matter of fact if the accounts give this view or not.  Court cases are not very usual in this area.  One has a certain feeling that companies in Ireland are becoming more aware of their rights in law in relation to company matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard also asked what is a non-profit making company.  As I outlined in my introductory speech and as is enshrined in the Bill, the essential criteria for a non-profit making company is that there is no gain accruable to an individual member either through profit distribution or through the distribution of capital depreciation or in any other way.  Under section 15, which he also referred to, auditors must attest to the accuracy of the directors' report.  Senator Howard was correct in saying that this section is important.  It is an extra safeguard, as I have said, to those reading and relying on what the directors say in their report to shareholders.</P>
    <P>The Bill strikes a balance in the manner in which it is constructed.  It is transposing the EC directive into national law.  That onus is upon us and has been for a few years now.  We are carrying out our obligations under the directive.  In doing so, we are only following most of the countries in Europe.  We are not setting the pace.  From an industrial policy point of view, we are not doing anything more than what is being done in other member states.  There is one anomaly in relation to Germany which is currently being <Col N="996" /> addressed.  I will refer to that on Committee Stage at a later date.</P>
    <P>In relation to the national position, we have been at pains to ensure that what we are doing is seen to be reasonable.  I take on board Senator Lynch's remarks, especially in relation to small firms.  We have done our best with regard to them. I stress that all private limited companies of a trading and profit-making nature will have to make returns to the Companies Office over and above what they have been legally required to do up to now. The provisions of the Bill are reasonable. In the long term they will be seen to be constructive and equitable both in law and in practice.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Senators for their contributions. Some of the matters raised were of a slightly technical nature and more appropriate to Committee Stage.  I look forward to addressing them then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. A. Doyle) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. A. Doyle)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>From the beginning of history, air has been recognised as a primary component of our world.  One of the earliest Greek philosophers, Anaximenes, saw air as the primal substance from which all other <Col N="997" /> things has their origin.  His most celebrated statement was that &ldquo;air is the principle of existing things; for from it all things come to be and into it they are again dissolved.  As our soul being air holds us together and controls us, so air encloses the whole world&rdquo;.  The present Bill clearly does not lack for illustrious antecedents.</P>
      <P>The fact that our environment is a unique resource which requires careful management is widely recognised today. Air, water and soil provide the basis for life and for economic and social development. The simple fact that man exists and carries on economic activity in order to sustain life results in environmental pollution of one kind or another &mdash; and has done so since the beginning of time.  In our modern world, with increased population and urbanisation and rapid technological development, the problem of environmental pollution has assumed new dimensions.  It is now more important than ever that our natural resources are well managed if we are to protect public health, living resources and even property from the adverse effects of pollution and if we are to pass on a high quality living environment to future generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC Third Action Programme on the Environment states that &ldquo;the resources of the environment are the basis of &mdash; but also constitute the limits to &mdash; further economic and social development and the improvement of living conditions&rdquo;. Thus the interaction between environmental protection and economic development must be a guiding principle in our approach both to environmental management and the promotion of economic and social development.  The environment cannot be sacrificed to development and neither should development be seen as the enemy of the environment. Both are essential ingredients in our efforts towards economic growth and improving the quality of Irish life.  We must resist any temptation to look on environmental protection as a &ldquo;fair-weather&rdquo; programme to be cast aside in the more difficult economic conditions in which the Irish economy now operates. <Col N="998" /> On the other hand, there is an obligation on us to ensure that our environmental management systems make optimum use of available resources and do not give rise to unreasonable or excessive costs.</P>
    <P>It is against this general background &mdash; the protection of the environment linked with the improvement of economic and social conditions &mdash; that we have framed the provisions of the Air Pollution Bill, 1986, a Bill which, for the first time in the history of the State, will provide a comprehensive framework for dealing with existing and emerging air pollution problems.  The Bill will replace all existing statutory provisions and regulations on air pollution by a single enactment which should provide the State and local authorities with all necessary powers for air pollution control now and for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>By a timely coincidence, a motion to take note of Report No. 25 on Acid Rain, produced by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, is now before the Seanad. This motion is to be debated jointly with the present Second Stage.  I hope to deal with all of the main themes of Report No. 25 in the course of this speech.</P>
    <P>Like other forms of environmental pollution, air pollution is a problem which has been known to man for centuries. For example, smoke control regulation in England dates back over 700 years. Indeed, I am told that there are records of a manufacturer who, because he disobeyed a royal proclamation on coal burning in London, was tried and beheaded centuries ago.  It was not, apparently, considered necessary to introduce such draconian measures in this country &mdash; I do not intend to do so &mdash; and, even today, despite the absence of comprehensive controls, we still enjoy a generally high standard of air quality.</P>
    <P>Because of our geographical position and the prevailing westerly winds, we are not affected by transboundary air pollution to the same extent as other European countries.  Indeed, it is only when air masses which have originated to the east of the country &mdash; over continental Europe and the United Kingdom &mdash; pass over <Col N="999" /> Ireland, that air pollution arising from external factors is of any real significance. Because of the nature of our economic growth we have little heavy industry of any kind that in the past caused serious air pollution in other countries.  Our relatively low population density and our pattern of urbanisation have also served to delay the emergence of air pollution problems.  Besides, we must not overlook the fact that emissions from new industry have, for over 20 years, been controlled by conditions attached to permissions under the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>In recent years, however, air pollution as a topic has been attracting growing attention in the minds of the public and in the media.  The Joint Committee report on Acid Rain, together with a previous one on Air Pollution, Conservation and Protection of the Environment, have focussed these concerns in a very useful way.  To some extent, this increased environmental concern is probably due to a welcome growth in environmental awareness generally and, in part, to reports from other countries of serious damage which is being ascribed to air pollution.  At this stage, for example, there has been extensive publicity about acidification of lakes in Scandinavia, forest dieback in Central Europe and other kinds of damage attributed to acid rain.  But the increased public unease about air pollution cannot all be blamed on external factors.  Localised problems have emerged in recent years, sometimes connected with a particular industry, in other cases related to activities such as mining or quarrying and sometimes arising from changes in the traditional ways of doing things, as for instance, the increasing practice of straw-burning.  In addition, there is growing concern about the trend in air quality in the Dublin area, particularly the level of smoke at some periods during the winter.  I shall return to this last topic at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The common air pollutants are smoke, sulphur dioxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and lead.  The principal cause of all of these is the combustion of fuel in one form or another.  The main sources <Col N="1000" /> can be classified as power generation, industrial and commercial development the domestic sector and the transport sector.  The proportion of total emissions contributed by each of these sectors varies with the pollutant in question.  In 1983, 79 per cent of our emissions of sulphur dioxide of 140,000 tonnes arose from the commercial, industrial and power generation sectors, with emissions from the domestic sector amounting only to 17 per cent.  For smoke, the reverse was the case, with domestic sources contributing 80 per cent of the 100,000 tonnes emitted in the State as a whole in 1983.  In the case of nitrogen oxides, 68 per cent comes from the commercial, industrial and power generation sectors, with 27 per cent from road transport. Transport accounts for 81 per cent of carbon monoxide emissions and 53 per cent of hydrocarbon emissions.  It will be evident, therefore, that the preservation and improvement of air quality requires action on a number of fronts and that air pollution cannot conveniently be ascribed to a few large industries.  In carrying on our normal daily activities relating to work or the home, we all contribute in one way or another to the volume of pollutants emitted to the atmosphere.  It follows, too, that all sections of the community must play some part in resolving the problems involved.</P>
    <P>Apart from meeting our own national requirements, the Bill is intended to enable the State to meet in full the requirements of existing and likely future European Community requirements in the air pollution field.  To date, directives which set air quality standards for smoke and sulphur dioxide and for lead have been implemented by administrative means.  This Bill will enable us to implement these measures more fully and more effectively and, as well, to implement a more recent directive on air quality standards for nitrogen dioxide and a 1984 directive which requires us to introduce a licensing system for certain categories of industrial plant which may cause air pollution.  The Bill also contains provisions which can be used to give full effect <Col N="1001" /> to directives on matters such as the sulphur content of fuels and the lead content of petrol.  I might mention here that regulations which reduce the maximum lead content of petrol from 0.40 to 0.15 grams per litre came into operation on 1 April last, giving a reduction of some 60 per cent in lead emissions from motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>Ireland has, of course, obligations in relation to air pollution which extend beyond the responsibilities imposed by membership of the European Communities. The State is a party to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, commonly referred to as the Geneva Convention, which binds contracting states to limit and, as far as possible, gradually to reduce emissions of polluting substances into the atmosphere. Increasing concern over the severe problems from atmospheric pollution in continental Europe and in North America led to the signing in 1985 of a Protocol to the Convention in Helsinki when 21 countries undertook to reduce their emissions of sulphur dioxide by 30 per cent as soon as possible, and at the latest by 1993, using 1980 levels as the base.</P>
    <P>Ireland was unable to accede to the Protocol for a number of reasons, including the fact that our total emmisions of SO 2 are small, the lack of evidence to suggest that these contribute to significant transboundary air pollution and the fact that the cost of such a reduction would be greatly disproportionate to any possible benefit to our own, or the wider European environment.  We have, however, agreed to undertake all feasible measures to control air pollution and the present Bill is evidence of our commitment in that regard.</P>
    <P>The intense debate at international level on transboundary air pollution and the issue of acid rain have prompted the Commission of the European Communities to bring forward a proposal for a directive on the limitation of emissions from large combustion plant.  In Ireland, this would apply to most ESB generating plant and to at least one plant in the private sector.  Under the draft directive, <Col N="1002" /> new plant, authorised after an agreed date, would have to observe Community emission limit values for SO 2 and NO x and perhaps dust, and total emissions from combustion plant would have to be reduced substantially or limited, using 1980 as a base year.</P>
    <P>Originally, the draft directive envisaged uniform emission reductions in all member states of 60 per cent for SO 2 and 40 per cent each for NO x and dust. However, at the Environment Council in Luxembourg which I attended last week, the Dutch Presidency advanced new proposals based on a differentiated contribution by member states to an overall Community reduction of 45 per cent in SO 2 emisions.  For Ireland, this would have involved maintaining SO 2 emissions from power plant in future at a level not exceeding that of 1980.</P>
    <P>My response was to welcome the differentiated approach now proposed at EC level to the achievement of emission limitations by member states.  Ireland has consistently stressed the negligible transboundary impact of its emissions and the disproportionate burden for our developing economy of accepting uniform Community reductions on our low level of emissions.</P>
    <P>While this differentiated approach undoubtedly offers the best prospect for advancing the large combustion plant directive, I was not in a position at the recent council to signify Ireland's acceptance of the standstill of ESB emissions at the 1980 level which would be involved. The economic implications could still be quite onerous and require full evaluation by all our public authorities concerned. Other countries had to maintain similar reservations and the future shape of the draft directive is still uncertain.</P>
    <P>Irish emissions of SO 2 were comparatively low in 1980 and have in fact been falling since largely due to the use of natural gas for power generation by the ESB.  However, in accordance with EC energy policy, the ESB has undertaken a major fuel diversification policy and an important element in this is the Money-point plant.  As a result of the changeover to coal by the ESB, national emissions <Col N="1003" /> of SO 2 are projected to rise above the current low level.</P>
    <P>My earlier remarks were intended to sketch in briefly the general background against which Report No. 25 and the specific provisions of the Bill must be considered.  I turn now to the individual sections but I do not intend to comment on each of them; to do so would involve inordinate time and detail and, in any event, Senators will have received a copy of the Explanatory Memorandum which was circulated with the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill contains 22 sections but many of these are of a standard nature and require little comment or explanation. Section 4 defines the term &ldquo;air pollution&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill.  Its meaning is not easily captured because the concept of air pollution must be linked with a concentration of a substance in the atmosphere at a level harmful to public health, animal or plant life or the environment generally, rather than the mere existence of a substance in the atmosphere.  In some cases, too, it may be the interaction of substances in the atmosphere which may cause difficulties. The definition in the Bill refers therefore, to a condition of the atmosphere in which a pollutant is present in such quantity as to be liable to give rise to damage to public health, animal or plant life, property, amenities or the environment. There is an associated definition of the term &ldquo;pollutant&rdquo; in section 7 (1) and, of course, the main pollutants with which the Bill is concerned are listed in the First Schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 5 defines the term &ldquo;best practicable means&rdquo; which is used throughout the Bill.  For example, the occupier of premises, other than a private dwelling, is required by section 24 (1) to use the best practicable means to limit and, if possible, to prevent an emission from the premises and, under section 32, a licence may not be granted in relation to industrial plant unless the local authority is satisfied that the best practicable means will be used there to prevent or limit emissions.</P>
    <P>The best practicable means concept is <Col N="1004" /> well established in environmental legislation. It is used in EC legislation in both the air and water pollution areas, although different forms of words are sometimes employed, such as the best available technology which does not entail excessive costs, or the best technical means available taking account of economic availability.  In the Bill, the phrase is defined in such a way as to require, in the circumstances of each case, an appropriate balance between available technology, environmental demands and cost considerations.  I hope that the practical advantages of this approach will be apparent since in seeking to improve the quality of Irish life we must consider both the needs of development and the needs of the environment.</P>
    <P>Section 6, together with the Third Schedule, defines the industrial plant to which the licensing provisions of Part III of the Bill will apply.  &ldquo;Existing plant&rdquo; is also defined because, in accordance with the 1984 EC Directive on the combating of air pollution from industrial plant, it is intended that the licensing requirement will apply initially to new plant only. &ldquo;Existing plant&rdquo; is stated to be plant which has been granted a planning permission prior to 1 July 1987 &mdash; the date on which the EC Directive must be implemented &mdash; or plant which is in operation on 30 June 1987, or at any time within the previous 12 months.  The licensing requirement will, however, gradually be extended to cover existing plant.  In addition, the Minister will have power, by regulations made with the prior approval of each House, to add to the categories of plant specified in the Third Schedule, thus extending the scope of the licensing system, if this should prove to be necessary in order to control air pollution.</P>
    <P>The remainder of this first Part of the Bill contains general provisions needed for the proper administration of the new code.  These include provisions in relation to offences and penalties, the prosecution of offences, the powers of authorised persons to enter premises for purposes connected with the Bill and provisions designed to enable local authorities to acquire information necessary for the <Col N="1005" /> performance of the functions assigned to them.  There are provisions also in relation to research into air pollution and consultation by local authorities with other persons and bodies in the administration of the Act.</P>
    <P>The local authorities to whom responsibilities are being entrusted under the Bill are the 27 county councils, the five county borough corporations and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  Major organisational changes for local government in Dublin have, of course, to be legislated for later this year and these will naturally change the allocation of functional responsibilities for all services, including air pollution, in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Under section 21, provision is made whereby any function conferred on a local authority in relation to air pollution may, by regulations, be transferred to another person or body, including a corporate body specially established for the purpose.  This provision is included in recognition of the fact that some of the monitoring and other work which will arise under the Bill could require a high degree of expertise and access to specialised facilities which it might not be economic for the individual local authority to provide.  In such situations it might be convenient for the functions in question to be carried out on behalf of local authorities by a body operating at national level such as, for example, An Foras Forbartha.</P>
    <P>It may be opportune here to explain briefly why local authorities should carry the main responsibility for administering the present Bill.  This is relevant also in view of criticisms already made by certain commentators that the dependence of many of the Bill's provisions on decision or adoption by local authorities is a weakness.</P>
    <P>Environmental services and controls are the preserve of local authorities in most countries.  There are two main reasons for this.  First, because of their physical rather than personal nature there is considerable local variation in the need for and level of such services. Secondly, environmental services in the broad sense are widely seen as suited to <Col N="1006" /> some degree of local democratic decision.</P>
    <P>In Ireland these considerations have brought local authorities into the administration of physical planning, water pollution control and waste management in addition to their longer-standing involvement in sanitary services, housing and roads.  There is no reason why air pollution control should stand as an exception to these general principles and the Bill provides for a local authority involvement fully in line with that under other relevant codes.</P>
    <P>The need for national standards and guidelines and for central policy direction and co-ordination in air pollution matters has not, however, been overlooked, as the exposition of later parts of the Bill will show.  In particular, let me say that even where a local discretion applies, the Minister for the Environment will still have power to ensure adequate action under the Bill by any reluctant local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 22 takes account of the concept of controlling air pollution by economic instruments in addition to, or instead of, regulation.  It enables local authorities to make charges, in accordance with regulations made by the Minister, in relation to emissions.  Economists have argued that pollution arises from market failure, in that producers tend to ignore the external costs caused by their activities, and that this can be corrected by the use of emission charges.  There is, however, little evidence available regarding the use of emission charges in the control of air pollution.  There are some obvious disadvantages attached to this approach such as the difficulty of determining the level of charges which will ensure that emissions do not involve contravention of basic air quality standards.  It is possible, however, that emission charges may be found to have a role to play in the control of air pollution and, for this reason, the flexible provisions of section 22 have been included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Emission charges are, of course, only one way of applying the polluter pays principle on which environmental protection <Col N="1007" /> law tends to be based nowadays. Other provisions of the present Bill are grounded on this principle.  For example, section 24 (1) requires the occupier of any premises, other than a private dwelling, to use the best practicable means to limit, and, if possible, to prevent an emission from the premises.  Similarly, the licensing provisions in Part III are based on the principle that the industrial plant concerned must use the best practicable means to limit or prevent emissions from the plant.  In these cases, the costs involved in complying with the provisions of the Bill will have to be borne by those responsible for the relevant emissions.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill sets out general provisions in relation to air pollution control. It provides a range of powers which can be used by the Minister for the Environment and the local authorities to deal with a variety of situations &mdash; emissions of dark smoke, wind-blown dust arising from land used for mining or industrial purposes, smoke arising from straw-burning, or any other emissions of pollutants which may give rise to air pollution or to nuisance.  As I have mentioned already, there is to be an obligation on the occupiers of all premises, other than private dwellings, to use the best practicable means to prevent or limit emissions. There will also be a prohibition on emissions from any premises which may be a nuisance to any person.  There is power in section 25 to make regulations controlling emissions of smoke and prohibiting or restricting the burning of straw, waste or any other substance which may cause air pollution.  There is provision in section 23 under which the Minister may prohibit any specified emissions or prohibit the production, treatment, use, import, marketing or sale of any substance, other than a fuel, which may cause air pollution.</P>
    <P>To ensure compliance with these provisions, local authorities will be empowered under section 26 to serve notices requiring occupiers of premises to take specified measures to limit or to prevent air pollution and, where urgent measures <Col N="1008" /> are required, the local authorities themselves may take direct action under section 27.  In addition, to deal with serious situations, the High Court will be authorised, on the application of a local authority or any other person, to prohibit or restrict an emission.  I believe that these wide powers will enable local authorities to ensure the preservation of the air quality in their areas.</P>
    <P>EC Directive 84/360 on the combating of air pollution from industrial plant must be brought into effect by 1 July, 1987.  It requires that all new industrial plant, of a type specified in the directive, should be authorised before coming into operation. Prior authorisation is also required for substantial alterations to existing plant and the authorisation requirement is to be gradually extended to existing plant. In granting a licence or an authorisation, the competent authority &mdash; in our case the local authority &mdash; must be satisfied that all appropriate measures against air pollution have been taken, provided that the application of such measures does not entail excessive costs.  The authority must also be satisfied that the plant will not cause significant air pollution or contravene any applicable emission limit values or air quality limit values.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill will translate this directive into Irish law by providing a framework for the granting of licences broadly similar to that provided in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts.  The Bill provides for the making of regulations to govern the detailed procedure involved in the granting of licences. There is specific provision in section 34 for appeals to An Bord Pleanála against the granting or refusing of a licence or against any conditions attached to a licence. In practice, the board and the planning authorities are obliged, under planning law to have regard to the potential air pollution from a development and they attach conditions for the control of air pollution where appropriate.  It is desirable, and should be of assistance to applicants, that the one appeals tribunal <Col N="1009" /> should deal with appeals under the planning, water pollution and air pollution Acts.  The new licensing arrangements where they apply, will, of course, take the place of planning conditions relating to air pollution.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 33 for the review of licences at intervals of not less than three years, or at any time where the local authority have grounds for believing that an emission may constitute a serious risk of air pollution, or where there has been a material change in air quality which could not have been foreseen when the licence was granted.</P>

      <P>The categories of plant to which the licensing requirements apply are listed in the Third Schedule to the Bill.  These include the plants which are most likely to cause air pollution.  The Schedule is based on Annex I to Directive 84/360/EEC and on the Alkali, etc., Works Regulation Act, 1906.  It also includes plants covered by the Control of Atmospheric Pollution (Licensing) Regulations, 1985, that is, plants for the recovery of metal, as the nuisance and air pollution arising from such plants has indicated the necessity for control. Section 6 enables the Minister for the Environment to amend the list by regulations which must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas in draft form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill will enable a local authority, by order, to declare all or part of their area to be a special control area where the level of a pollutant, or combination of pollutants, requires special abatement measures to be taken and the requirements that will have effect in the area in order to prevent or limit the pollution in question.  It will be possible to consider using the provisions of Part IV in a situation, such as exists in parts of Dublin, where the air quality standards for smoke are exceeded on occasion.  But Part IV is designed to have wider application; it could, for example, be used if, in the future, nitrogen oxides were shown to be a problem in part of a <Col N="1010" /> built-up area or if other pollutants, arising perhaps from industrial development, were to become an issue in a particular district.  In spite of this, it is, I suppose, inevitable that Part IV will be seen primarily as a response to the Dublin smoke situation and so, before dealing with the sections concerned, it would be appropriate to comment on that situation.</P>
    <P>Smoke and sulphur dioxide levels have been measured on a regular basis in Dublin since 1962 and a more comprehensive monitoring network was established by the corporation in 1973. Sampling stations are located throughout the city in industrial, commercial and residential districts and there are further stations in the county area.  Results from these stations show that between 1973 and 1981, there was an overall decline in sulphur dioxide levels, and, to a lesser extent, in smoke levels.  However, since 1981, pollution levels &mdash; and particularly the level of smoke &mdash; increased substantially. This reversal in the earlier downward trend coincided with the large scale increase in the use of coal and other solid fuels for space-heating purposes and has created problems in so far as compliance with the smoke provisions of the relevant EC Directive is concerned.  There were exceedances of the daily limit values at a number of stations in the city in 1984-85 and exceedances also on some groups of three days.  However, the longer term values for the winter and for the year as a whole were not exceeded.  The exceedances involved smoke only and the requirements of the directive were observed in relation to sulphur dioxide.</P>
    <P>Action is required to deal with the smoke problem in Dublin.  It is important, however, that the extent of this problem is assessed objectively and that appropriate remedial measures are devised and carried through on a rational basis and in a cost-effective manner.  It is possible to identify a range of options which, either alone or in combination, could improve the situation.  These include promoting the use of natural gas and other cleaner fuels, prohibiting the use of certain fuels, requiring that appliances <Col N="1011" /> which burn solid fuels smokelessly, or with reduced smoke emissions, should be used, and so on.  I am confident that the Bill now before the House will enable appropriate solutions to be worked out and implemented.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the breaches of the air standards which occasionally occur in Dublin are unparalleled in Europe, that they are having serious adverse health effects of a kind which would justify the immediate introduction of dramatic measures and that the situation in Dublin now resembles in some way the situation which existed in London in the fifties.  For the record, therefore, I should point out that the EC smoke standards are being breached not just in parts of Dublin but also in large population centres in France, Federal Germany and Italy, and in Britain and Northern Ireland.  The most serious breach of the daily smoke standard of 250 micrograms per cubic metre which occured in 1984-85 involved a figure of 738 micrograms per cubic metre at one of the monitoring stations.</P>
    <P>This level is clearly unacceptable but, in order to put it in perspective, I should mention that the levels recorded in the London smog of 1952 were of the order of 7,000 to 8,000 micrograms per cubic metre and that a level of 4,550 micrograms per cubic metre was reached at a London monitoring station in December, 1962.  Let us therefore maintain a sense of proportion in discussing the smoke levels in Dublin.  As I stated earlier, action is certainly needed to arrest and to reverse the trend of recent years, but to imply that the present situation has reached crisis proportions is misleading.</P>
    <P>Under Part IV, it will be a matter for the relevant local authority, in the first instance, to decide whether a special control area should be established, although section 39 will allow the Minister to give directions in this matter, where necessary. This has been alleged as a weakness by some commentators, who seem to feel that the Bill should straightaway place an obligation on local authorities to set up special control areas.  There are a number <Col N="1012" /> of misconceptions here.  First, the Minister for the Environment has a reserve power, under section 39, to direct the establishment, where necessary, of special control areas.  Secondly, it would be inappropriate and impossible for the Bill to dictate in advance the extent to which special control areas will be necessary since this must take account of the circumstances prevailing in different areas and changes in those circumstances over time.</P>
    <P>But the Bill does not leave local authorities free of obligation to ensure air quality in their areas.  As soon as air quality standards are prescribed by the Minister &mdash; about which more later &mdash; local authorities will be under a duty to see that these are not exceeded and to take appropriate measures accordingly, which may of course necessitate special control areas.</P>
    <P>Where a local authority make a special control area order under section 39, they will be required to publish notice of this and allow for objections to be made within a specified period.  The local authority will then submit the order to the Minister and, where there are objections which have not been withdrawn, the Minister must hold an oral hearing before deciding whether to confirm the order. Where an order becomes operational, the local authority will have power to issue notices requiring the owners or occupiers of premises to take the necessary measures to comply with it.  Section 45 enables the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make grants towards the costs incurred by the owner or occupier of a premises in order to comply with terms of a special control area order.</P>
    <P>Section 40 specifies which may be included in a special control area order. These include prohibitions on the emission of certain pollutants and prohibitions on the burning of a fuel, other than an authorised fuel, except under specified conditions.  A local authority may specify the types of fuel which may or may not be burned in the special control area and may also prohibit certain operations or <Col N="1013" /> processes except under specified conditions. The intention in drafting these provisions was to provide a flexible framework which will allow maximum freedom in the choice of methods for meeting the requirements of a particular area.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the provisions of Part IV I would like to deal with the relationship between housing standards, which are of course the preserve of the Department of the Environment, and the possible requirements of clean air zoning.  Some people have professed to find a contradiction between the requirement of providing a chimney, which is contained in both the new house and the home improvement grant schemes, and the desirability from the point of view of air quality of reducing domestic use of bituminous coal in limited areas.</P>
    <P>It is fair to acknowledge this as an area of difficulty.  Indeed, as implementation of the present Bill proceeds, the need for closer harmonisation of housing and air pollution policies in certain areas may have to be considered more fully.  However, the apparent inconsistencies which I have just mentioned are by no means as irreconcilable as may at first appear. Domestic chimneys are necessary for many heating systems using smokeless fuels, including &ldquo;approved appliances&rdquo; within the meaning of this Bill for eliminating or reducing smoke.  Under the new house grants scheme, they can also be used with a gas heater taking the place of a normal fire grate.</P>
    <P>Housing policy has to have regard to an estimated house life-span of 80 to 100 years and to the likely availability of different heating fuels for the duration of that period.  Within this long term perspective, a fireplace and chimney represent an adaptable heating system to incorporate in house design, so that provision of them is likely to be generally justified for some time ahead.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill enables local authorities to make air quality management plans for the preservation or improvement of air quality in their areas.  The making of such plans will involve a local authority in assessing air quality in their <Col N="1014" /> areas and likely future trends and in identifying potential difficulties and planning for their avoidance.</P>
    <P>Significant powers are also conferred on the Minister for the Environment under Part V, including the setting of air quality standards and of emission limit values.  These powers are necessary so that full effect can be given to EC directives on air quality standards relating to smoke, sulphur dioxide, lead and nitrogen dioxide.  As yet, there are no Community-wide emission limit values, but the Commission has proposed such values as, for example, in relation to emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust from new large combustion plants. National conditions may warrant the setting of such limit values, either for the country at large or for specific areas or industries and, of course, limits set in this way at national level could bring about a necessary degree of consistency and uniformity in the administration of the Act throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As a further step towards this, section 52 allows for the issue of directions by the Minister for the Environment in relation to general policy on the prevention or limitation of air pollution.  Such directions must be taken into account by the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála in the administration of their functions. Section 53 enables the Minister to make regulations in regard to fuel for the purposes of preventing air pollution and governing such matters as the specification and contents of fuel and the production, treatment, use or sale of fuel.  This provision would be used to deal with such matters as lead in petrol or the sulphur content of fuels.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill provides for miscellaneous matters including the powers of local authorities and the Minister to monitor air quality and emissions.  Section 55 will enable the occupier of any premises who may not otherwise be able to carry out works required to meet the provisions of the Act to seek a remedy in the District Court.  There are also a number of transitional measures and savers in relation to other legislation and civil proceedings.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should make it clear that <Col N="1015" /> the present Bill, being a comprehensive enabling one, will naturally come into effect in a phased way.  Among other things, this should help to minimise staffing problems.  The obvious priorities will be to implement existing and imminent EC directives and to address the more serious instances of air pollution in the Dublin area.  Because of the uneven distribution of population and industries throughout the country, the impact of the Bill on local authorities will obviously vary very widely.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Senators will agree that this is indeed a comprehensive Bill and I look forward to hearing their views on the proposals it contains.  While legislation and regulations alone cannot guarantee a good quality environment, I believe that the Bill will be seen as a milestone in the development of environmental policy in this country.  I shall be looking to the local authorities and, indeed, to the community at large for support to securing its implementation and I feel sure that this support will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this is my first time on this side of the House since the Minister of State has become spokesman on the environment I would like to welcome her to the House.  We look forward to having very constructive debates on the various Bills she will be bringing before us during her term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until I read the Minister's speech I was not aware that this Bill would be taken jointly with item No. 6 on the Order Paper &mdash; Report of the Joint Committee on Acid Rain.  I am open to contradiction because I have not been in the House full-time since morning.  However, while the Leader of the House may have told us we were taking items Nos. 5 and 6 we were not told they would be taken together.  I know they are very relevant and, possibly, this is the best thing to do but we had decided the report on acid rain would be taken on another date.  If one looks at the monitor one will see we are dealing with the Air Pollution Bill, <Col N="1016" /> 1986.  If one was waiting for item No. 6 to appear on the monitor one would still be waiting.  I know there are Senators who intended to make a contribution on that item.  I know it was not the Minister's decision but I just want to record it in passing and I feel the Leader of the House will have something to say on this at a later stage.  As I said, both are relevant and can be taken together.</P>
    <P>Many of the Bills coming before this House, have not been demanded by the people and, in some cases, they have no urgency attached to them.  I would like to mention a few: the Litter Act, 1982, the Combat Poverty Agency Bill, 1985, the Urban Renewal Bill, 1986, and this Bill, the Air Pollution Bill, 1986.  There is no finance available to implement any of the Bills.  The Air Pollution Bill, 1986, is very wide ranging.  If it were to be implemented in full it would transform the whole environmental and industrial sphere in this small country where we depend so much on industrial development.</P>
    <P>With reference to the Litter Act, 1982, we are approaching a clean-up week.  This has been initiated by the Department of the Environment.  At recent local authority meetings some councillors asked who was taking responsibility for the financing of the Bill.  We were told by the managers of the councils that it would not be financed by the Department of the Environment and that moneys would have to be found within the system.  No county council has money available for that kind of work at present.  I welcome this clean-up week but we will have to depend on the rural organisations to finance it.</P>
    <P>I prefaced my remarks by saying that there is no money available for the legislation coming before us.  Today I had occasion to go to the passport office. There was a queue of people stretching down the street waiting to get passports to get out of this country as quickly as possible.  We should be bringing in legislation which would bring about corrective measures in that regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fall-out from Sellafield, we are lucky that our prevailing <Col N="1017" /> winds are south westerly and that any fall-out from Sellafield and the pollution of the Irish Sea as a result of that fall-out may not have the same impact because of the winds and the currents in the Irish Sea.  For that reason the fall-out may not reach our shores.</P>
    <P>I was not at all satisfied with the attitude of the Government to the leak at Sellafield.  Sellafield has leaked on more than one occasion.  This Bill covers acid leakage into our waters.  The Government did not protest when the leak threatened our shores.  They did not have compulsory monitoring.  They had casual monitoring to see how affected the waters were along the Irish coast and what damage the pollution and fall-out from Sellafield may cause to the health of the Irish people.  We took a softly softly approach to Sellafield.  We would have taken an even softer approach to it were it not for what happened in Russia.  The disaster and the many deaths as a result of that disaster scared many people.  It brought home to us what Sellafield could mean in our immediate vicinity if a similar fall-out came from there as had come from the Russian disaster.</P>
    <P>There is need to protect our coastline, our environment and indeed our air.  I am not against the Bill.  I welcome it.  It is necessary to take measures against the pollution which is causing serious damage in the city of Dublin and other cities throughout the State.</P>
    <P>People may not regard CIE buses as a health hazard.  I regard the CIE rolling fleet of buses as causing the greatest emission of pollution to the environment. During the break I had the pleasure of speaking to an EC environmentalist who works in Dublin.  I asked her what, in her view, was the single most dangerous emission she was afraid of in this city. She told me that smoke was the greatest cause of emission.  I know itinerant families who have lived in a smokeless atmosphere all of their lives.  I have never seen them going to a doctor because of any health hazard.  They are the healthiest people in Ireland today.  They have been <Col N="1018" /> living in an unpolluted, smokeless atmosphere all of their lives.</P>
    <P>If one accepts the scientific elaboration, scientific approach and results of surveys which are taking place then I have to say the oldest type of smoke is that which comes from the domestic chimneys which the Minister spoke about recently.  For hundreds and hundreds of years we have been burning solid fuel of various types &mdash; timber, coal, turf and other products.  Why is that now, after many centuries, coal, turf and solid fuels are dangerous?  Anyone with any common sense, who has lived any measurable length of time in this country, knows that solid fuels are not dangerous.</P>
    <P>People who are in the coal business welcome this Bill.  They welcome the monitoring aspect of this Bill.  If there was any danger to their trade as a result of that monitoring they would not be rushing in asking for a monitoring system. That monitoring system will bring out and identify the emissions which are causing the pollution of our atmosphere.  I have no doubt whatsoever that solid fuel is not a danger to the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>A letter from Coal Information Services Limited released today states:</P>
    <P>The third monthly bulletin on atmospheric pollution issued by Dublin Corporation shows that the March median smoke levels in Dublin are 35.4% lower than in the corresponding period last year.  The figures are based on data obtained at the Corporation's official monitoring stations.  The figures complete the air quality measurements for the winter period which extends from October through to March.  The attached graph compares the winter season from 1985/6 with 1984/5 and shows a reduction of 24% in the monthly winter medians over that period.  The figures are given in microgrammes per cubic metre (ug/m³).  The figures confirm the continuing decline in pollution levels in Dublin's air.  Smoke levels for the winter period were 60% below EEC levels.</P>
    <P>The level of 35.4 per cent recorded is well below the EC figure of 130.  That in itself <Col N="1019" /> does not give us any cause for concern and there is no necessity to rush into an Air Pollution Bill on the solid fuel smoke side.</P>
    <P>In my view there is a grave urgency for the Government to introduce legislation that will control the emissions from the rolling stock, especially in Dublin.  Some CIE school buses on the road are in a shambles. Many of them have no exhausts. One could hear them coming a mile away. I want to compliment the private bus contractors who always have good vans or mini-buses or buses on the road.  They give a very worthwhile service.  They are in no way damaging the health of the children they pick up on the way to and from school.  I could not say the same about the rolling stock of CIE, both in the school bus section and in the city of Dublin.  Most of you here had the opportunity of having to walk through the streets of Dublin.  I have done so recently.  The pollution from the bus fleet in Dublin is chaotic and dangerous.  That is something that is not being spelt out in this Bill.  The only reason that it is not spelt out in the Bill is that the Government have failed to provide rolling stock for CIE, or to make the necessary finances available to bring a new replacement fleet of buses into the service.</P>

      <P>If one goes along the roads one will see them pulled up in various places, out of commission.  It is possible to check the services and find out the ages of the rolling fleet of CIE. They have not been replaced.  They should have been replaced not today, but over the last three or four years.  That is <Col N="1020" /> the greatest danger to air pollution.  It is one we should tackle in the early stages.</P>
      <P>The Third Schedule to the Bill is a fascinating schedule.  It lists the industrial processes to which the Act applies:</P>
      <P>1.  The refining of oil other than operations solely manufacturing lubricants from crude oil.</P>
      <P>2.  The generation of electricity in plants with a nominal heat output exceeding 50 MW, other than hydro and nuclear plants.</P>
      <P>3.  The raising of steam in plants with a nominal heat output exceeding 50 MW.</P>
      <P>4.  The roasting and sintering of metal ores in plants with a capacity of more than 1,000 tonnes per year.</P>
      <P>5.  The production of pig iron and crude steel in integrated plants.</P>
      <P>6.  The production of ferrous metals in foundries having melting installations with a capacity greater than 5 tonnes.</P>
      <P>7.  The production and melting of non-ferrous metals in installations having a capacity greater than 1 tonne for heavy metals or 0.5 tonnes for light metal.</P>
      <P>8.  The production of cement.</P>
      <P>There is a need for control on cement. The Schedule also lists:</P>
      <P>9.  The production of a compound or alloy of magnesium.</P>
      <P>10.  The production of lime in a kiln.</P>
      <P>11.  The production of a compound or alloy of manganese.</P>
      <P>12.  The production and processing of asbestos.</P>
      <P>The production and processing of asbestos also requires control.  The Schedule continues:</P>
      <P>13.  The manufacture of asbestos-based products.</P>
      <P>14.  The manufacture of glass fibre or mineral fibre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> 15.  The production of glass (ordinary and special) in plants with a capacity of more than 5,000 tonnes per year.</P>
    <P>16.  The manufacture of coarse ceramics including refractory bricks, stoneware pipes, facing and floor bricks and roof tiles.</P>
    <P>There is a long list.  The last process to which the Act applies is the rendering of animal by-products.</P>
    <P>Why did they not include the rendering of a wax candle, a Christmas candle, or, indeed, a blessed candle.  These have not been mentioned in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If these were included, we would have none available for the Christmas.  If all the industrial processes to which the Act applies are put into operation, we will have no industrialists coming to Ireland.  We are giving them everything we can &mdash; incentive bonuses, two-thirds remission of rates &mdash; to try and lure them in.  Because there is a decreasing and folding up industrial atmosphere at present one would feel that the time was ripe for this type of development rather than for curtailing it. There are certain sections in this Bill and certain commodities that will have to be controlled.  I will have an opportunity of dealing with them when we will be going through the sections in more detail &mdash; the licensing of industrial bases and the duty of local authorities to monitor and appoint staff.  Local authorities are over-staffed and under-financed.  The power of the staff of local authorities to enter private domestic premises for inspection without a warrant will have to be deleted from this Bill.  The Minister may amend this before the Bill comes finally through this House.  I will be asking for that amendment. The Fianna Fáil Party will probably be putting down an amendment in that regard.  I ask the Minister to consider that part of the Bill.  It is an incursion on the privacy of the individual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the question of the delay by the Department of Health in extending the provisions of Circular 6 of 1985 dealing with the discharge of homeless persons from hospital to cover the discharge of such persons from general hospitals.  I am sure the Minister and his officials are aware that when I refer to the provisions of Circular 6 of 1985 I am referring to the check list which was a part of Circular 6 of 1985 which check list initially applied only to psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this issue because of the frustration of a number of people and, in particular, members of the Simon Community who over the years, along with other organisations, have documented the recurrent practice of a number of general hospitals of discharging homeless people into the streets with nowhere to go.  For the record yet again, the case histories cited include a man sent out from a Cork hospital in 1983 with severe back pain straight into a night shelter where somebody had to acquire a board in the night to put under his mattress to <Col N="1023" /> minimise the man's discomfort.  Another man who could hardly walk discharged straight into a night shelter had to be re-admitted to hospital in five days.  This was in Cork in 1983.  A woman under 20, pregnant was discharged from hospital in the winter of 1984 with nowhere to go and she slept rough.  Another homeless man was discharged early due to bed shortages who still had stitches in place; his wound got infected and he had to go back to the casualty department.  A homeless man in Galway, who fractured his skull was discharged and re-admitted four times.  His doctor would not keep him in.</P>
    <P>These and similar cases have been documented for years.  In 1983 the Simon Community produced a document called <i>Homeless and Vulnerable</i>, which reported on 110 cases of homeless men and women arriving at night shelters directly on their discharge.  In other words, they were discharged and came directly to night shelters.  This, incidentally, was without prior notification or any contact or consultation.  There could clearly be no greater contrast than that between the warm round the clock care of a hospital and the harsh reality of street life epitomised by the life of most of our night shelters.</P>
    <P>The Simon Community made a series of proposals to the Department of Health in 1983 based on their detailed case histories. They argued that a check list should be introduced and that homeless people should not be discharged until its details are complied with.  It seems perfectly reasonable, incidentally, that a hospital should not discharge somebody they know to be homeless unless they know where the person is going.  It seems to me to be a basic provision of any sort of concept of proper health care that people should not be discharged from a hospital to go nowhere.  It seems to contradict the whole operation and intent of hospital care.</P>
    <P>The check list would include a number of matters which are effectively self-evident such as arrangements for accommodation, arrangement for day care and <Col N="1024" /> follow up services, medication, arrangement for income and a letter for the labour exchange, the most important document perhaps a homeless person can have to minimise all sorts of subsequent bureaucratic obstacles.</P>
    <P>At a meeting on 29 May, 1984 the Department of Health agreed to issue a circular to all hospitals, general and psychiatric, which would require them to go through a detailed 16 point check list modelled on that operated by the Programme of the Homeless in St. Brendan's Hospital.  Dublin.  Despite that agreement in May 1984, the circular was extraordinarily slow in materialising.  I never have been able to find out quite why it took so long to issue a circular given that the draft existed when the agreement was reached.</P>
    <P>Repeated letters and telephone calls to the Department of Health throughout the summer, autumn and winter of 1984 produced no response.  I got involved at that stage in making a considerable number of representations to the Minister for Health, none of which immediately produced any response.  The long promised circular, promised on 29 May 1984, did not see the light of day until 23 April 1985 11 months later.  Called Circular 6 of 1985 it was quite different from that which it was understood had been agreed at the meeting in May 1984. The check list applied to psychiatric hospitals but not to general hospitals. These hospitals were required only to comply with a vague and general injunction to take the necessary follow-up action, but it was deemed inappropriate for reasons that were never made clear to give them a check list or to ask them actually to check out in detail that, for instance, a homeless person would have somewhere to go upon being discharged from hospital or a homeless person would have proper provision for after care, for the provision of medication <i>et cetera.</i> Apparently it was impossible to give a logical and intelligent explanation as to why a homeless person being discharged from psychiatric hospital needed all these protective processes but a homeless person being discharged from a general <Col N="1025" /> hospital needed no such protective processes.</P>
    <P>On 27 May 1985 the Simon Community requested a meeting with the Department of Health to discuss how the provisions of the checklist might be applied to general hospitals.  Again, throughout the summer, autumn and winter requests for such a meeting were made.  This is not with the Minister now, I hasten to add.  This is simply with officials of the Department.  Nobody was looking for a high level meeting with the Minister or indeed with any senior official of enormous rank.  It was simply a request to meet the officials of the Department of Health to discuss the problem of the discharge of homeless people from general hospitals.  It was hardly an outrageous request by any standards.  This meeting that was sought over three seasons of the year did not finally happen until 18 February 1986.</P>
    <P>It may have been long delayed but the outcome was quite happy.  At that meeting the Department of Health stated plainly that they accepted the case that homeless people being discharged from general hospitals should be cared for in a similar comprehensive way as discharged patients from psychiatric hospitals.  This, of course, was most welcome.  The Department agreed to issue a new circular and send a copy to the Simon Community for final consultation.  The new circular would incorporate a detailed 15 point checklist.  I must say, since I have no desire to take up the time of this House talking about a self-evident requirement to make sure that homeless people are not discharged onto the streets that this agreement was most welcome, I thought it was a sign of a very positive and healthy co-operation between voluntary and statutory services.</P>
    <P>The officials of the Department had made a detailed study of the case histories and considered them carefully and prepared as comprehensive and as administrative a response to this problem as could reasonably be done.  I would like to commend the Minister and the Department of Health for their willingness to respond, to listen and, as appeared at the time, to <Col N="1026" /> make a positive and intelligent response to a manifestly real problem.</P>
    <P>The Simon Community were enormously encouraged by the goodwill to help and by the co-operation extended to them by the officials of the Department of Health.  It was positive, helpful and encouraging and would have perhaps led many people away from the perceived obligation to make the maximum noise about every possible issue because there was an apparently perceived route of reasonable discussion with reasonable people to achieve reasonable results. However, since 18 February 1986 nothing has happened.  No circular has been issued despite a written commitment on 28 February 1986 by the Department that it would issue shortly.  Since then the Simon Community have contacted the Department &mdash; it is important that this should go on the record &mdash; on 21 April, 1 May, 3 May, 8 May, 15 May, 22 May, 23 May, 28 May, 9 June, 10 June and on one further occasion.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why there has been no progress on this issue.  Why is it that a small voluntary organisation have to spend such an inordinate time, effort and energy simply trying to ensure that a relatively small administrative issue is followed through and carried out?  The purpose of the circular is to bring to an end the situation in which homeless people are sent on to the streets with nowhere to go and without any arrangements being made.  It should not in a perfect world be necessary to issue a circular like that.  One would have thought it would be part of the natural protective instincts of people running hospitals to ensure that people were not discharged on to the streets.  The reality has been documented that it happens not occasionally but with appalling regularity.</P>
    <P>In May 1986 Galway Simon Community reported how a homeless man in his sixties, suffering from epilepsy and respiratory problems, was sent out without any after care arrangements being made. Notwithstanding the efforts so far the need for the circular is still quite evident. This need not have happened and could have been averted.  It was an entirely <Col N="1027" /> avoidable situation.  The extension of the checklist to general hospitals is urgently necessary, I would like to hear a firm commitment from the Minister tonight to issue it now.  I do not wish to hear excuses or bureaucratic explanations.</P>
    <P>The Minister is the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare.  On the last occasion on which I raised this issue of after care he was presented with a script by the Department of Health, the first words of which were &ldquo;I wish to refute&rdquo;.  The Minister who was present read that script in which he sought to refute all the allegations I had made about after care problems for homeless people being discharged from psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>Within four months of the Minister being presented with that script by the Department of Health, officials of the Department were accepting that, far from being capable of being refuted, the problem existed.  Therefore, I do not want to hear about the problem not existing. I do not want to hear about the problem of certain hospitals because people were told that this problem had been overcome.  I want to know why, notwithstanding contact in April, May and June on many occasions a circular that was promised five months ago has not yet been published.  I do not want to hear about the problems or of whether I am right.  I want to know why it is necessary to have such a long delay, such a history of non co-operation and such apparently insensitive intent on getting rid of the sense of enormous goodwill and of working together that the original agreement brought about.  Why have we to wait so long?  Why have people to be so frustrated?  It is a simple problem which could be solved in five minutes literally with the attention of the Minister and a couple of his officials.  I hope the Minister can explain the matter to me.</P>

      <P>It may be helpful to Senators if I set out the background to this issue.  In May 1984 a meeting was held with representatives of the <Col N="1028" /> Simon Community and the Department of Health for the purposes of discussing after care facilities and services for homeless people being discharged from general and psychiatric hospitals.  It was suggested at that meeting that a pre-discharge checklist system be introduced similar to one which had been operating in St. Brendan's Hospital.</P>
      <P>The question of circularising this type of checklist was examined further in the Department and it was felt that such a list was more appropriate to psychiatric rather than general hospitals.  In the circumstances a circular was issued in April 1985 to the chief executive officers of each of the health boards enclosing copies of the checklist to be used in respect of the discharge of homeless persons from psychiatric hospitals.  A more general circular was issued in respect of general hospitals which stated that it was essential to the successful rehabilitation of homeless patients that the special after care requirements of these patients be identified prior to discharge and be brought to the attention of the appropriate director of community care and a medical officer of health by the hospital authority to enable the necessary follow up action to be taken by the health board.</P>
      <P>To ensure this all hospitals were asked to adopt the following procedures:</P>
      <P>(1)  As far as is practicable homeless patients should be identified as such on admission to hospital and their status recorded and made known to the relative staff in the hospital, in particular to the social worker or staff responsible for discharge procedures.</P>
      <P>(2)  The discharging officer should inform the appropriate director of community care and medical officer of health who will take the necessary follow-up action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Simon Community subsequently wrote to the Department expressing disappointment with the circular as issued to general hospitals in so far as it did not include the predischarge checklist.  A further meeting took place in February 1986 between representatives of the Simon Community and the Department <Col N="1029" /> where it was agreed that the Department would issue a revised circular to general hospitals together with an amended form of the checklist previously issued to psychiatric hsopitals.  The very helpful suggestions made by the representatives of the Simon Community were included in the revised circular and checklist.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that this latest draft checklist is as comprehensive as possible it has been decided to consult with the individual health boards and voluntary hospitals, who are faced with this problem at local level, and, in particular, with other voluntary agencies such as Trust, who have a major input into providing medical and social services for the homeless.  May I say that I share Senator Ryan's concern on this issue.  I have been assured by the Minister and the Department that arrangements are being made to have these consultations shortly and that it is the intention to have an agreed circular and checklist issued to general hospitals as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senators will agree that whatever arrangements are made to deal with this problem should be workable and that it is essential to have the goodwill of those responsible for carrying them out.  The <Col N="1030" /> approach being taken by the Department to this problem will, hopefully, lead to a situation where every homeless person can be assured of proper follow-up care following discharge from hospital.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have been given the opportunity of speaking on this issue as I greatly admire the trojan work being undertaken by voluntary organisations in providing care and shelter for homeless people.  I know that this work can at times be very demanding and, on behalf of the Minister, I would like to pay tribute to the voluntary workers concerned.  The Minister is aware that there are certain shortcomings in the discharge procedures operated by general hospitals.  He welcomes the various recommendations to his Department by voluntary organisations who are concerned with the care of the homeless.  He is confident that these problems can be overcome with the co-operation of all concerned, the hospitals, the community care services and the voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 19 June 1986.</P>
