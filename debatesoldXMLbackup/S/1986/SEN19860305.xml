      <P>I have notice from Senator Jimmy Deenihan that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make provision for the Cappanalea outdoor centre in Killorglin, County Kerry, which is threatened with closure.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice of another matter from Senator Deenihan as follows:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Education to sanction proposals for (i) the new school, Scoil Mhiceasmainn, Tralee, County Kerry; and (ii) the extension of Coolard national school, Listowel, County Kerry</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Katherine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need to have Waterford city centre included in the recently announced major concessions in the income tax and rating code for the commercial redevelopment of specified areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator <Col N="1012" /> Deenihan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I regret, I have to rule that the matter raised by Senator Bulbulia is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground of advocacy of legislation.  I have selected Senator Deenihan's matter on Cappanalea Outdoor Centre for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Notice may be given another day by Senator Deenihan on the second matter.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, it is proposed between 2.30 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. to take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, all concerned with legislation.  It is proposed to suspend the sitting from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. From 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will take Item No. 5 which is Private Members' Business.  There has been some anxiety expressed by Senators in regard to the fragmented nature of some of our debates.  The experiment was made of carrying over any legislation on which discussion had been commenced until the Thursday.  This has the disadvantage that is interferes with the idea of leaving Thursday completely free for the discussion of reports of joint committees. I propose that we might experiment with an alternative.  It is that, if by 5.30 p.m. Items No. 3 or No. 4 has been commenced but not concluded, it may be resumed at 8 p.m. for an hour or so in order to finish it off.  A decision as to whether it should be done or not should be made on the suspension at 5.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the support for this experiment from the Leader of the Opposition.  It is something we can decide <i>ad hoc</i> on each Wednesday.  With regard to tomorrow it is proposed to take Item No. 6 at 10.30 a.m. the Report of the Joint Committee on the Irish Language.  It is proposed after lunch, irrespective of whether No. 6 has been completed or not, to take at 2.30 p.m. the continuation of the debate on report of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights in regard to social welfare and the report of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities: Crisis in Farming.  The latter two would have been ordered for tomorrow morning, again in the interest of avoiding any fragmentation of debate; but, unfortunately, the Minister for Social Welfare who wishes to contribute to Item No. 7, is taking the Combat Poverty Bill in the Dáil at that time.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, who has been taking item No. 8, has a long-standing engagement to visit the Lyons Estate of University College, Dublin.  That is the reason those are being taken in the afternoon but is is hoped most of them will be completed tomorrow afternoon.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, approximately a year and a half ago we had a Copyright (Amendment) Bill before this House.  This Bill was withdrawn from the House for very good and obvious reasons, the many defects that we saw in the Bill.  I pointed out to the Members of the House that the Bill was withdrawn for redrafting.  In view of recent reports that a member of the Fine Gael Party was acting as a paid adviser to the Performing Rights Society I would like to know would that have any bearing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wanted to ask the Leader of the House about item No. 10, the Air Pollution Bill, and to inquire when the Government expect to be able to deal with this matter because it does seem that it is a matter of at least reasonable urgency.  We have welcomed the introduction of legislation on that facet of our lives and I would be very anxious to see it making progress through the Houses.  I would like to know when we hope to take it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On the specific questions raised, there is, as Senator Lynch said, a difficulty in regard to the Copyright Bill.  I would like to make it quite clear that no member of the Government is concerned in any way with the Performing Rights Society but there does seem to be a connection of an individual backbench member of the Fine Gael Party. That fact has no bearing whatsoever on Government decisions in the matter.  In regard to the question of the Slaughtered and Detained Animals Bill I have made out a tentative order of Seanad business between now and Easter and according to this that Bill might be taken on Wednesday 12 March.  It is likely to be ordered as No. 4 on that day so it might not be reached.  It certainly will not be reached earlier than the 12th.  The probability is that it would be the 19th before it is reached.  That Bill and the Health Bill which is a small Bill, will be ordered before the Air Pollution Bill in order that we would get the small Bills out of the way so that we could settle down to a thorough debate on the Air Pollution Bill which I indicated earlier would not be unduly fragmented.  The position is that <Col N="1015" /> while the Air Pollution Bill might be taken on Wednesday, 19 March, it is more probable that Second Stage will not be commenced until Wednesday, 26 March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Senators will recall that when I replied to their comments on section 22 of the Bill on Committee Stage last Thursday I pointed out that the section, as originally drafted, was on the lines of what I might call the traditional provision for membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas by directors or employees of statutory bodies.  While I was aware that similar sections in recent legislation had, at the instigation of the Seanad, been amended, I had considered that the amendment to electoral procedures being examined by the Department of the Environment, which would apply to all enactments, would satisfy the House.  The responses from the Leader of the House and Senators from both sides clearly demonstrated to me that such a situation was not acceptable to them.  Having listened to their views, I readily agreed to move an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To meet the wishes of Senators I have, on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman, deleted the original section 22 in its entirety and substituted a revised section 22.  The kernel of the amendment, as now provided for in section 22 (1) (b) and, section 22 (2) (b), is that directors and staff of the NDC will be required to give up their directorship of the corporation <Col N="1017" /> or stand seconded from their employment by the corporation only on election to either House of the Oireachtas or the Assembly of the European Communities. The provisions contained in the original section in regard to nomination as a Member of the Seanad or entitlement to sit in the European Parliament, by virtue of being on the replacement panel of that Parliament, have been incorporated into the section as amended.  In drafting the proposed section 22 of this Bill, the precedent agreed to by Senators when debating a similar section in the Nurses' Bill, 1985, in October 1985 has been closely followed.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say &mdash; and I think I speak for every Member of this House &mdash; that we are grateful to the Minister for the manner in which he has met us on this particular question.  It is a matter of regret to me that the situation does remain that on every statute that comes in we have to raise this particular point.  This is not done in an attempt to embarrass the individual Minister that is concerned with the piloting of that Bill, nor is it in any sense an attempt to differ with Dáil Éireann in regard to the form in which legislation is sent to us.  But, as the Minister appreciated from our discussion on Committee Stage, it is now the firm view of all Members of the Seanad that this matter cannot be allowed to drag on further and, accordingly, that the Seanad will move to have an amendment similar to that now proposed by the Minister inserted in every statute to which it is relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to add to that that I agree with the view that the Minister expressed on Committee Stage, that the simplest thing to do is to amend the Seanad Electoral Acts.  I am already on record &mdash; almost two years ago &mdash; as even directing the parliamentary draftsman's attention to the fact that it would appear to this layman that a simple amendment of subsection (2) (c) of section 27 of the Seanad Electoral Panel Members Act, 1947, would do the job.  It is just a question of looking up that section and getting down <Col N="1018" /> to the matter.  I am sure every Member of this House and any Minister coming into this House would welcome a provision there that would govern this situation from now on.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I want to thank the Minister who is present with us in charge of this Bill for his appreciation of the fact that the impatience of the Seanad is well justified and has to be satiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the view of the previous speaker and to say, as he said, that it is with some regret that it had to come in the form of an amendment rather than in the Bill itself. The Minister has referred to the Nurses' Bill; and I think it was also a feature of the Dentists' Bill &mdash; those two in particular &mdash; and legislation of this type.  This amendment should form part and parcel of every piece of legislation of this kind.  The Minister has obviously responded positively, as we have seen here today, to the views of the Seanad Members on both sides of the House on Committee State and for that I would like to thank him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express the Labour Party point of view on this.  Last week when we joined Senator O'Leary, who saw the anomaly immediately, we called on the Minister to consider this matter and we want to thank him for responding positively.  It is extraordinarily that the anomaly was discovered only in the Seanad.  I am not casting any aspersions on the other House, but it is more than a coincidence that all the legislation with this anomaly in it has come through the other House, or, if it came from the parliamentary draftsman to us for initiation, we amended it before it went to the other House.  We want to compliment the other House for accepting our views at all times on it.  The Leader had indicated a way forward by an easier method so the draftsman will not have to be going to any rounds about it.  It could be done by making the other changes in the Electoral Act.  They say: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  When we have the grass before us we grasp it. We are glad that in this case it is not a nettle.  It is nice to know that the Minister <Col N="1019" /> responded positively to it.  It has removed an obvious anomaly which was in the legislation and could be discriminatory. Possibly someone later could have taken a constitutional case about it, but why legislate in that way when you can do it in a clean and efficient manner?  This amendment will meet our requirements. We have had the Nurses' Bill, the Dentists' Bill, the Combat Poverty Bill and now the National Development Corporation Bill amended in this House in this way.  Three times or possibly four is enough warning for the parliamentary draftsman as an indication that we would not like to see it again unless the Electoral Act is amended.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and it is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for Final Consideration&rdquo; the Minister may explain the purport of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as a report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matter therefore that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil.  For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of these amendments.</P>

      <P>Two of these amendments are very simple and are consequential on the changes in the functions and titles of the Ministers made recently by the Government.  The title of the <Col N="1020" /> Minister responsible for Fisheries and Forestry is now Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry.  That deals with two of the amendments, Nos. 5 and 7. Amendment No. 6 is put in to copperfasten the situation that was, we think, safeguarded strongly in the original draft; but it was felt by the Inland Waterways Association that there might be some doubt about it.  This refers to the right and power of the Commissioners of Public Works to draw water from the River Liffey and certain other sources for the canals.  It is something that goes back to legislation in 1771 and 1772 and repeated in many Acts after that.  It was felt by the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The original simple technical ones consequential on the change on the functions of various Ministers, are dealt with by Amendments Nos. 1 and 3.  The question of amendment No. 2, I was just dealing with.  This covers section 6 of the Bill which is the right to draw water for the purposes of the canals from the River Liffey and other areas. As regards Amendment No. 4 on your documentation, it is an amendment introduced on the Report Stage by myself in the House, where it was felt that excessive powers might have been given to the <Col N="1021" /> Office of Public Works in that where they made an order with regard to various uses of the canal, it was not required in the original legislation that that order should be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the ordinary way.  So, an amendment was introduced to cover that situation on the Report Stage in the Dáil. Amendment No. 5 is an amendment which deals with the power to close the canal temporarily in order to facilitate local authorities in doing particular work around the canal.  The main people concerned with this were the local authority in Offaly.  They expressed themselves as very pleased with this amendment.  It is desirable to have orderly work, but the emphasis is, of course, on only temporary closure.  There is no danger of this being used as a method of circumventing the rights that we have given, that the navigable parts of the canal will remain open, and naturally the ambition would be, if that were ever possible down along the line, to get parts of the canal that have gone dry in some areas back again.  As I explained to the Seanad earlier &mdash; and indeed it was very well received by the Seanad and their contributions greatly helped the idea &mdash; we think this is a major advance in a new era for the canals, getting them into an organisation that will be specifically charged with improving their immediate facilities rather than CIE, who really were concerned with them because of the transport facilities which no longer exist.</P>
      <P>The next amendment, No. 6, is a new section, now section 14.  The purpose of this is to formally involve the Commissioners of Public Works in the statutory consultation and consent arrangements for any bridge works relating to the Grand Canal or the Royal Canal that a road authority might wish to undertake. This we also regard as very important, because, as is known and indeed emerged very clearly there in the Seanad, there have been culverts over part of the Royal Canal and difficulty in getting them back to a navigable situation again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that the Commissioners of Public Works should also have a say as far as the spanning of the canals by <Col N="1022" /> bridges is concerned.  Indeed it becomes relevant straight away in regard to the new road in the Lucan or the Chapelizod area.  That particular road crosses the canal in the new ring, so it becomes relevant immediately.  The amendment copperfastens the assurance given by the former Minister of State, Deputy Joe Birmingham, to the Dáil on the Second Stage of the Canals Bill that the policy would be to ensure that no decisions were taken which would add to obstacles already in the way of restoring the Royal Canal's navigation.  The Minister for Communications who has overall responsibility for navigational matters nationwide will, of course, continue to be involved in those statutory consultation and consent arrangements in so far as the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal and other waterways are concerned.  The Bill as amended is a better piece of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the Bill was debated very thoroughly in the Seanad.  These new amendments will make it a better Bill.  I would like to refer briefly to a few of the sections. I recall section 3, which deals with the transfer of staff and which, caused concern to Senators on both sides of the House.  Senators were concerned about the rights of staff as a result of the transfer, that their rights would, at all times, be guaranteed in so far as salaries, terms of reference, pension rights and so on are concerned.  Having had discussions with unions and others, I presume the Minister has rectified that position.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 is obviously welcome. The following amendment, No. 5, is important for the local authorities.  In my county we are very conscious of the fact that the canal system should be improved, that it should be kept navigable at all times.  Under the social employment scheme we could give employment to people to maintain canals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 is very desirable.  It deals with the powers of the OPW in so far as bridges are concerned.  This amendment <Col N="1023" /> should ensure that overhead obstacles will not be placed on or near canals.</P>
    <P>All of the amendments are necessary and the Bill, as amended, should help to improve the canals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Dáil amendments.  They arose in the other House and here.  A number of amendments were accepted by the Minister which improved the Bill at two stages of its enactment.  I welcome the group of amendments before us today.  I understand fully the necessity for section 5 relating to the closing of a canal to navigation or altering the water levels of any part of a canal during improvements. That is an important enabling provision for local authorities while they are improving and maintaining the canal system.  It will enable the canals to be brought up to the highest level of navigation possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the spanning of sections of a canal by bridges and the need to have this responsibility divided between local authorities, the OPW and the Minister for Communications.  There will be supervision of works on bridges and I agree with the Minister that a move of this kind was essential.  My concern would be that the widening or improvement of a bridge would not result in road works encroaching on a canal section.</P>
      <P>We have not got just the navigation aspect of canals to discuss in this Bill.  We must also consider the protection of the vicinity of canals, the walkways, the cycleways, the whole environment of the canals.  I hope incursions will be kept to a minimum and that only incursions necessary to facilitate the improvement of bridges will be permitted or approved by the commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure Senator Fallen that agreement has been reached and negotiations are proceeding very well on the matter of staff.  I do not anticipate any difficulty.  There are 70 to 80 individuals involved.  The ground work has <Col N="1024" /> been laid and there seems to be general agreement.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald was concerned about the general protection of the environs of the canals.  The OPW will be able to safeguard the areas immediately close to the canals.  The local authorities will also be involved and, as far as roads and bridges are concerned, the Minister for Communications will have responsibility. Between them, it will be possible to do a good job.  Our main concern is to ensure future navigation on the canals and to prevent, even by accident, things which happened with full authority and permission in the past.  The object is to preserve the amenity as far as possible and to enhance it.  I thank the Seanad for their reception of the Bill, which marks a new era for our canals.  The Bill has an enormous potential not only for all of us but particularly for the communities adjacent to the canal network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing this Bill in the Dáil, it was indicated that its essential purpose was to close off a potentially serious loophole that had come to light in the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965.  That Act deals, <i>inter alia</i>, with the Minister's power to regulate air fares and it was to that area that the new legislation was addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say at the outset that a requirement for airlines to secure Government approval for international air fares is the accepted norm applied by aviation regulatory authorities world wide.  Because of the sovereignty which states exercise over their air space, traffic rights for scheduled air services are generally only available <Col N="1025" /> where a bilateral agreement or international treaty has been concluded providing for an exchange of such rights. These agreements generally include a provision relating to the approval of tariffs, and it was against that background and in recognition of Ireland's international obligations towards that end that the 1965 Act embodied in Irish law provisions giving the Minister statutory powers to control air fares.</P>
    <P>Over the years airlines have accepted without question that scheduled service fares require Governmental approval and carriers serving Ireland have traditionally submitted their fares for approval as a matter of course.  For practical reasons, control of air fares has been applied at the level of fares actually sold to the public.  This is the norm and airlines have consistently submitted their proposals on this basis.  It follows logically from this that if the fares approval process is to have any worthwhile meaning then the fares sold in the market must conform with the approved levels and conditions. This too has been accepted as a general principle by the airline industry.</P>
    <P>A challenge to those accepted norms manifested itself in the Irish market during the summer of 1983, but steps taken by my Department at the time resolved the then prevailing difficulties. Unfortunately, more serious difficulties emerged early in 1984 when a major Dublin travel agent widely advertised Shannon-New York services at fares which did not stand approved by me. Efforts to resolve the difficulties through consultations between my Department, the airline and the travel agent concerned failed and, since the stance taken by the other parties constituted an effective challenge to the generally accepted interpretation of the 1965 Act and since continuation of the malpractice could have seriously jeopardised the already precarious state of North Atlantic operations, the Minister sought and obtained a temporary High Court injunction restraining the airline concerned from selling either directly or indirectly via travel agents fares which did not have my approval.</P>
    <P>The injunction was to have effect until <Col N="1026" /> the substantive hearing of the case, but on appeal to the Supreme Court the injunction was lifted, the court taking the view that, given the terms of the 1965 Act, the airline concerned had an arguable case and that what the court termed &ldquo;the balance of convenience&rdquo; rested in not continuing the injunction.  I should add that both the High Court and the Supreme Court refused to grant an injunction directly against the travel agent, the view being taken that the scope of the 1965 Act did not extend beyond airlines.</P>
    <P>While the court decisions to which I have referred did not reflect a definitive judgment on the legal issues involved &mdash; that would have had to await the substantive hearing of the case &mdash; the Minister took the view, after consultation with his legal advisers and after weighing up carefully all of the implications, that the best course of action was to clarify the situation by way of our amending the 1965 legislation.  That was the origin for the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Publication of the legislation gave rise to a wide-ranging public debate and a prolonged examination of the measure in the Dáil.  I very much welcomed that debate, since I believe that it can only be healthy that our policies in any area are subjected to detailed scrutiny, both by the public at large and by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In that regard, I am sure that the Seanad will wish to avail of this opportunity to give me the benefit of its current thoughts on Irish aviation policy in general and specifically in the area of air fares.</P>
    <P>In that context, I would like to offer a few comments, first on my general policy stance; second, on my general philosophy towards air fares; and, third, to relate those to the measure now before the House.  In the process I would also hope to lay to rest once and for all some of the erroneous constructions that have been put on the legislation and to convince Senators of the merits of the measure.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Transport Policy which was published last November deals extensively with the aviation scene and I do not propose to go over all of that <Col N="1027" /> ground here.  However, as an island nation heavily reliant on good access transport links for business and tourism needs, continuity and reliability of services must be a first priority.  While low air fares and sea ferry charges are highly desirable, calls in that direction can be very academic if there are no services on which to offer the fares.  A balance has to be struck between what the airlines require to sustain services and what constitutes reasonable value for money for the several segments of the travel market.</P>
    <P>One can take the view that these matters should be left entirely to the free play of market forces.  That was the view taken within the United States when it embarked on its deregulation policy.  How successful that policy was I am not going to judge.  Deregulation certainly led to lower fares and greater carrier efficiency on many routes &mdash; generally the heavily trafficked trunk routes &mdash; within the United States.  However, deregulation also brought about substantial increases in fares on other routes, while many communities lost their services altogether. Therefore, it was not an unmixed blessing. These aspects have not received the same high profile publicity as have the lower air fares developments, but in my view, and bearing in mind the characteristics of the Irish market, including its size, seasonality and mix of traffic as between business and tourism travellers, I suggest that there are lessons there which one should not lose sight of.</P>
    <P>Those who doubt my views might care to read the Professor John Bristow report of 1985 on &ldquo;Aspects of the Regulation of Air Fares in Ireland&rdquo; or the articles by Mr. Melvin Brenner, an acknowledged expert on US deregulation, which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 31 December 1984.  Furthermore, anyone contemplating out and out deregulation might ponder on the pay-rate implications for workers in the industry and not forget either that the cut-throat competition has brought its share of collapses, stranded passengers and so on.</P>
    <P>If Senators are by now getting a view that I am totally against change, then <Col N="1028" /> they are wrong.  The Minister accepts without question that the present regulatory arrangements within Europe are too rigid and do not operate either to the best advantage of a carrier like Aer Lingus or to the maximum benefit of consumers. The Minister on several occasions has indicated that he would be quite happy to support an &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; regime in Europe, or in other words a regime in which carriers like Aer Lingus would have an opportunity to compete on equal terms for traffic between any two points in Europe.  Such liberalisation could, of course, only become a reality if European countries generally were prepared to move together in this way and in the absence of movement in that direction the Minister wants to make it clear that he has no intention of exposing Irish interests unilaterally to regulatory regimes that would not serve our national interest.</P>
    <P>In the matter of air fares, the Minister has consistently operated a policy of trying to keep fare levels as low as possible. He has on numerous occasions since coming into office rejected or modified fare increase applications put to him &mdash; often, I might add, in situations where the regulatory authority at the other end of the route, including the UK Civil Aviation Authority, saw fit to approve the increases in full.  He will continue to take a tough line on fares increases.  In order to do so, he must, of course, have the necessary statutory powers, and that brings me back to the current piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>Opponents of the legislation have classified it as a recipe for high fares. Comments have also been made to the effect that the measure is running against the trend of liberalisation.  I want to refute both charges.  On the first count, the Bill is in fact a neutral measure, which is not biased in favour of either high fares or low fares.  Accordingly, it is inaccurate to describe the Bill as an anti-consumer measure, with only one purpose in mind &mdash; to increase air fares.  The prerogative to submit fares proposals at whatever levels they wish will continue to reside with the airlines and the Minister will <Col N="1029" /> examine all proposals on their merits.  All he is seeking to do in the Bill is to ensure that, once an airline has received approval for its air fares proposals, it will stick to selling at those levels both directly and through intermediaries such as travel agents.  That, I suggest, is a perfectly reasonable approach.</P>
    <P>As to the allegations that we are running against the tide of regulatory change, may I say that it is standard practice for aviation authorities throughout Europe to have available to them powers to control air fares.  As I indicated in my opening remarks, the provisions of the several international treaties on which the whole operation of scheduled services depends require that such powers be available.  Furthermore, the various proposals brought forward by the European Commission in its Memorandum No. 2 are based on a premise that the bilateral system of regulation shall remain in existence and the commission's proposals in the air fares area provide specifically for the control of tarrifs by member states. Accordingly, the Minister is quite satisfied that the powers which he is seeking in the present Bill are compatible with the powers currently available to other regulatory authorities in Europe and are not inconsistent with moves which are under way either in the European Community or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the specific sections of the Bill and offer some comments. Section 1 of the Bill contains a number of definitions, including a detailed definition of what shall be regarded as an &ldquo;airline tariff&rdquo;.  The 1965 Act was deficient in this respect.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 should be read together.  Between them, they contain the provisions which will govern the scope of application of the Bill.  Only airline tariffs in respect of which a notice under section 3 is issued will fall within the scope of the legislation and in framing the measure in that way the Minister can at any time decide on the extent to which fares control should be exercised.  At the present time, for example, he exercises no control on charter fares and it would not be his intention to issue section 3 <Col N="1030" /> notices in respect of charter operations. In fact, the section 3 provision has been framed in such a way that its use can be modified according as the regulatory environment changes.  That, I believe, is the best way to legislate for a situation which is clearly going to change on an evolutionary basis over the next several years at a fairly fast pace.  I should add that during the course of passage of the Bill through the Dáil section 3 was amended by the Minister to include detailed criteria which the Minister must have regard to in considering air tariff proposals.  These are set out in section 3 (3).</P>
    <P>The Bill allows airlines to continue what is standard practice in the industry, namely to begin selling fares on a &ldquo;subject to Government approval&rdquo; basis.  This facility is necesary so that one carrier may not be placed at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> another.  Section 4 does, however, provide the Minister with machinery to intervene.  This he might wish to do where for example a carrier introduced what might be termed a totally disruptive fare.  Given the nature of the airline industry, I believe that it is important that the Minister should have this kind of power.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a section which did not exist in the Bill as initiated.  The section which the Minister introduced on Committee stage in the Dáil and which he further amplified on Report Stage makes provision for the establishment of a register in which details will be kept of applications for fares changes and for scheduled service route rights.  The public and other interested parties will have access to the register and can thus make representations on any particular submission as they see fit.  Details of decisions taken will also be filed on the register.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out what will constitute an offence under the Bill, while section 8 stipulates the maximum penalties that can be applied.  On the subject of penalties, I would like to remind the House that the penalties proposed for tariff offences have been scaled back considerably from those included in the original Bill.  The maximum fine has been halved <Col N="1031" /> from £100,000 to £50,000 while the jailing provision has been removed.</P>
    <P>With one exception, the provisions of section 9 merely reflect amendments that are necessary to the 1965 Act to bring its provisions into line with the present Bill. The exception relates to paragraph (g) and there I should explain that I am availing of the opportunity of the legislation to increase the penalties for other breaches of the 1965 Act from their present levels of £100 &mdash; summary conviction &mdash; and £1,000 &mdash; conviction on indictment &mdash; to £1,000 and £100,000 respectively.  Since offences under the 1965 Act can cover matters such as flying an aircraft without authorisation from the Minister, I believe that the penalties for such offences should be steeper than those for what I would term tariff offences.</P>
    <P>In explaining the penalty provision, I should also advert to the fact that in the course of the Dáil debate, the Minister agreed to the removal of a provision which established a clear linkage between the Bill and the licensing regime for the travel trade contained in the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982.  The basis on which the Minister made that amendment is set out in the Dáil Official Report for 12 February &mdash;(volumn 363, columns 2303-2305</P>
    <P>The sections of the Bill to which I have not made specific reference cover routine technical matters.</P>
    <P>Overall, I would suggest to the House that the Bill should not be seen as a draconian measure or as an instrument to encase in concrete the existing regulatory arrangements governing air fares.  Since coming into office, the Minister has endeavoured, both through his actions in dealing with fares proposals made to him and in the policies which he has pursued internationally and specifically within the European Communities, to bring about changes that will make airlines more cost and efficiency conscious and hopefully result in a better deal for consumers. As I have said already, continuity of air services must be the overriding objective when one considers our national interest. The availability of year round reliable air <Col N="1032" /> services to the possible range of destinations, offering consumers the widest practicable range of services at the lowest possible prices, must be our objective; and I believe that the Bill now before the House will contribute towards that end. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill because we must remember that we have an obligation to protect our national airline and maintain it as a viable entity.  At the same time we must work in the best interests of the consumer and we must ensure that our national airline operate in a manner which ensures that if we become more competitive it will give added boost to our tourism trade.  My main concern regarding this Bill lies in section 3, to which the Minister referred.  Section 3 sets out the interests the Minister shall have regard to other than those of the airline carrier when considering whether to approve an airline tariff.  Among the interests to be considered is that of tourism. Section 3 (3) (b) obliges him to have regard to</P>
      <P>the contribution capable of being made to the economy by the tourist industry by reason of the provision (subject to the need to maintain an air transport industry) of airline tariffs which are competitive in the fares, rates, or other charges and in the terms and conditions applicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As vice-chairman of the Oireacthas Joint Committee on Small Businesses I, along with other members of that committee and the chairman, spent many hours during the early months of last year working on that committee's Report on Tourism, Catering and Leisure, which was debated in this House just before Christmas.  In my contribution to that debate I emphasised the importance of access transport for the development of our tourist industry.  In stressing access transport I was very much reflecting the thrust of the report.  The report stated an obvious fact, one which we do not consider as often as we should.  I will quote briefly from pages 7 and 8 of that <Col N="1033" /> report, which I am sure the Minister must be <i>au fait</i> with:</P>
    <P>Ireland is an island and therefore tourist access is, by definition, restricted to transport by air and sea.  We are consequently at a comparative disadvantage with most European countries where overland transport by road and rail plays a major role in tourism access.  Thus, in the tourism context, Ireland is principally perceived as a secondary destination.  Given this natural disadvantage, it is critical that all tourist interests in Ireland co-operate fully in making access as easy, as economical and as comfortable as possible.</P>
    <P>In fairness to this Bill, section 3 (3) acknowledges the legitimate tourism interest in air access transport to Ireland. This section also keeps faith with the Government's own White Paper on Tourism Policy which was published on 27 September 1985 and debated in this House in conjunction with the Report of the Committee on Small Businesses. Chapter 16 (1) of the White Paper states:</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the vital importance of access transport to tourism. This country's location makes it imperative that reasonably priced access transport services, of sufficient capacity and acceptable standards, be provided from all our main markets.</P>
    <P>I accept that this Bill, while dealing with various aspects of commercial air transport, recognises the tourism interests in the letter and spirit of the White Paper. However, I would be slightly concerned that recent Government changes, which have resulted in responsibility being detached from the Department of Industry and Commerce and joined with Forestry and Fisheries affect one of the long held views of tourism interests, that traditionally tourism does not have a central place in the determination of Government policy.  I am not saying that such a reflection is valid in this instance, but we should bear in mind the firmly held views of small firms who depend on tourism, firms that are convinced that the needs of tourism <Col N="1034" /> take second place to those of State-owned carriers.  Many of these firms will look anxiously to see that their fears are groundless when it comes to the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5, to which the Minister referred, provides for a register which would be available for public inspection. This register will contain information with regard to decisions made by the Minister on airline tariffs notified to him under the other provisions of the Bill.  I welcome this section of the Bill.  It is a reasonable response to some of the tourism fears I have outlined.  I recommend that all trade associations with tourism connections maintain a watchful eye on this register.  In this way they can ensure that their interests are taken into account when questions of air tariffs are under consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the Aer Lingus interest.  While the medium to longer term trend at EC level will lead to deregulation of tariffs and will limit the privileges of national airlines within their own countries we must accept that there will be considerable resistance to these steps in several EC countries.  In those circumstances it is not unreasonable that we should take steps, but consistent with tourism requirements, to ensure a fair crack of the whip for our national airline and for the small but growing number of private airlines based at our regional airports.</P>
    <P>It is easy to forget that Aer Lingus developed most of the European business at Manchester Airport only to lose it to British Airways.  This loss was not in the face of commercial competition but resulted from the removal by the British Government of Aer Lingus pick-up rights.  While all this happened some years ago, it illustrates what other Governments can do in the name of looking after their own.  When we have an EC policy on air transport that allows Aer Lingus full commercial freedom to operate in other EC member states many of the provisions of this Bill will become redundant.  In the meantime, as the second smallest EC member state, we are not in a position to unilaterally declare <Col N="1035" /> the open skies policy to which the Minister referred.  All EC states, and particularly our larger neighbours, must move together in this area.  This can be done through extensive consultations when that day arrives.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would re-assure consumers, in view of the rumours and media reports about cracks in a number of jumbos in other airlines, that all the necessary additional checks have been carried out on the Aer Lingus fleet.  We have a national airline with a tremendous record for safety and courtesy and we want that record maintained.</P>
    <P>I would also be thankful if the Minister would make some comment in regard to the apparent discrepancy in fares.  I had some figures of comparisons between a journey to England by boat and by plane. The cost is minimal by boat compared to flying.  With regard to the air fares from Dublin to London, when these are compared with the cost of a flight from London to New York or Boston, there appear to be discrepancies, particularly when the biggest part of the cost of a flight is getting off the ground and coming down.</P>
    <P>I accept this Bill as reasonable.  I also accept that it takes full account of tourism interests.  In common with others concerned to maximise our tourism potential, I look forward to being reassured by the manner in which the provisions of the Bill are implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is to a large extent very much in the national interest.  During the period of its enactment through the other House, that House seemed to be confused about the objectives of the Minister and of the Department of Communications in producing this Bill.  I have been greatly reassured by the last paragraph of the Minister of State's contribution to the House when he said that the availability of a year round reliable air service was the overriding objective in this country with a possible range of destinations offering consumers the widest practical range of services at the lowest possible <Col N="1036" /> price and that he believes the Bill will contribute to that end.  The Bill is intended to give power to the Minister, which he or she may not use but is there in the public interest, to control, in the interest of keeping prices of a range of air services as low as possible, the cost of tariffs and fares.</P>
      <P>I would like to say how much the general public are confused by the variety of the air fares today in taking a trip almost anywhere.  The average price of going on a journey by air can be as low as 10 or 20 per cent of that charged to others travelling on the aircraft on a particular flight.  The extent to which there is a variety of fares for almost everybody on any flight is something that requires streamlining.  I hope that the power given in this Bill for the regulation of tariffs and fares will be useful.  I do not accept that having that power is in any way to be confused with the liberalisation of tariffs and fares and of our airline's working arrangements.  In the most liberalised countries &mdash; I speak of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, countries which are very close to us &mdash; where low fares are subject to much international discussion they have the same form of controls and regulations as are contained in the proposals before this House today. I believe the proposals contained in this Bill to introduce what has been traditionally there by way of practice by the airlines but which needs to be put into some order following the Supreme Court action which was taken in 1984 relating to the earlier Bill in this area.  The Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965, is really only a question of getting involved in tariffs and fares and, in particular, dealing with the anomaly that can often exist between an approved fare to the airline and that then being sold by the travel agent, whether acting as agent for the airline or in a separate and independent capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite happy that during the period the Minister for Communications has been responsible for air transport a number of important improvements in liberalising our air transport laws have been made.  The Minister, for example, <Col N="1037" /> has consistently approved proposals from US carriers for fare levels that were lower than those offered by Aer Lingus.  He has on several occasions rejected fares to the United Kingdom and continental Europe because they were considered to be too high.  He has also been the first to break the Aer Lingus monopoly on cross-Channel routes by granting authorisations for air services to Avair and Aer Arann, notwithstanding objections by the board and managment of Aer Lingus supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. There have of course, been unfortunate happenings in relation to Avair since that particular decision.  He has, with only one exception, approved all approaches from foreign Governments to inaugurate scheduled air services to and from the State and tried unsuccessfully in 1983 to persuade his EC colleagues to include more liberal provision in the EC directive on inter-regional scheduled air services which came into effect on 1 October 1984.</P>
    <P>I was interested to note the contribution of the Minister for Communications to the Bill in the other House on 1 May 1985, when he said in response to one of very many exchanges with Deputy Desmond O'Malley:</P>
    <P>Aviation is regulated by means of various multinational and bilateral treaties. A regime along the lines proposed by Deputy O'Malley would breach Ireland's treaty obligations with other countries and could not be intoduced unilaterally.  Deputy O'Malley obviously ignored this point in tabling this and other amendments.  He quoted me as saying at a press conference which I gave some months ago that I was in favour of an Anglo-Irish free trade area.  What I proposed and put to the British Secretary of State for Transport is the concept of a free air zone incorporating the two islands.  I mentioned that to Mr. Ridley on a couple of occasions and we intend pursuing that concept with the British.</P>
    <P>We are speaking here of an attempt, obviously, to get over the problems that Senator Lynch referred to a moment ago relating to the difficulties in Manchester <Col N="1038" /> some years ago relating to Aer Lingus picking up passengers in Manchester. Perhaps there could be an agreement with the British, although they would be as careful to protect their national interests as we will be ours.  I know the Minister is very keen that this be pursued.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Bill's passage through the other House, important provisions were included to protect &mdash; this is an important area &mdash; the interests of the consumer, particularly under section 5. The consumer can under section 5 inspect a register as frequently as necessary to be assured of the levels of approval in tariffs and fares that the Minister has been able to deal with.</P>
    <P>Under section 8 I welcome the reduction in the penalties that the Minister of State has drawn our attention to today. The maximum fine hs been halved from £100,000 to £50,000 and the jailing provision has ben removed.  The ludicrous situation that has existed up to now for those selling the tickets at travel agent level who were able to operate quite differently in relation to the price of tickets from those submitting the price to the Minister for approval has been brought into line in a manner that will be generally understood and accepted.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking in welcoming this Bill, I feel it is very much in the interests of the consumer.  It is no less liberal a move than the present situation and controls that exist in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.  I hope that, in the passage of time and in the interests of the travelling public and of as much movement as possible in the direction of liberalisation and competition in our airline system, the provisions of this Bill will be required to be used very infrequently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This must have been the most extraordinarily controversial minor Bill that ever came through the Dáil in recent years.  It started off as something that was intended to pass through quite quickly as a technical Bill to give the Minister certain powers.  Then it became extraordinarily controversial.  I am inclined to accept by and large the contention of the Minister of State, and <Col N="1039" /> indeed of the Minister, that there is nothing particularly extraordinary about this Bill.  I am also somewhat mystified at the depth, and indeed the ferocity of the opposition that was manifested to it both inside the Oireachtas and outside it.  It says as much about the ideological state of a large section of Irish opinion as it does about the capacity to debate the issues involved with any degree of rationality.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister mentioned the fact that this glorious deregulation that has been manifested in the United States has resulted in the loss of air services to those areas where there was not a highly profitable route available and a concentration on the routes.  It is also a fact that there has been in recent times a considerable number of reports of increasing levels of stress among airline crews because of the fact that deregulation has imposed increasing burdens of competitiveness and of price on companies and these have been paid for by extremely heavy working loads on the employees involved.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it tends to be, although it should not be, the function of people like myself on the left in Irish politics to somehow become the apologists for high price policies in the interests of what some people would regard as the artificial sustaining of inherently unprofitable enterprises.  There is a role of State involvement in all areas of the economy. My view is that there is a role for an increasing involvement, but that is not as some sort of regulatory protection of artificial markets but as a dynamism for growth and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on record my experience of air fares as an occasional traveller by air from Cork to Dublin.  When I began travelling the air fare from Cork to Dublin was approximately 75 per cent higher than the corresponding rail fare. That relationship was maintained until a private company became involved which has since become bankrupt.  All of a sudden we had a most extraordinary upsurge in air fares from Cork to Dublin <Col N="1040" /> to the extent that it is now almost three and a half times more expensive to travel by air.  The price of the air fare from Cork to Dublin has increased quite dramatically over four years, far more rapidly than the corresponding rail fare.  It was the involvement of the private sector company which produced this explosion in fares &mdash; and then, incidentally, produced the collapse of the company involved, leaving only Aer Lingus.  In the process the fares have taken an extraordinary leap upwards.  I do not understand why.</P>
    <P>There is a need to examine the cartel which operates between British Airways and Aer Lingus on the Dublin-London route.  It is extraordinary that shuttle services are available between London and Glasgow and between London and Belfast which are considerably cheaper than the standard air fare between those cities.  Aer Lingus and British Airways are equally culpable.  There will not be any remarkable change if British Airways are privatised.  They have established a fairly cosy relationship between London and Dublin in which one company are not prepared to under-cut the other.  The elaborate procedures involved in flying from London to Dublin or <i>vice versa</i> are hardly any less than those involved in flying from Dublin to New York or anywhere else.  It is a routine matter to travel from Dublin to London.  It is extraordinary that you have to go through all the procedures &mdash; the paper work and documentation that one would associate with an around the world trip.  There is a good case for simplifying the procedures and in the process producing a cheaper fare structure.</P>
    <P>It needs to be said that, were it not for the State's involvement, we would not have a commerical airline service.  There never was and never will be an inclination for the private sector to take the risks and to advance the large sums of money involved in setting up, developing and expanding a commercial airline.  There are those who suggest that there is now a need for the flotation of part of the shares of Aer Lingus on the stockmarket. Now that the State, through Aer Lingus have taken the risks, they say we can now <Col N="1041" /> offer part of the shares in the areas where Aer Lingus have demonstrated that there is a potential for profit.</P>
    <P>That is the lowest form of cheapskate private enterprise I have ever heard.  The State took all the risks and produced all the capital.  The fact that Aer Lingus are a substantially and consistently profitable enterprise which has shown considerable initiative in developing business outside the airline operation deserves to be commended. If we need legislation to protect Aer Lingus from cheapskate competition, from opportunistic operators who will maximise returns in the areas where there is a high demand, then we should have it.  But, to ensure that, do we need penalties on the scale being proposed? There are many other areas of public life &mdash; for instance, in the area of planning regulations &mdash; where penalties on the scale suggested here do not exist and where considerable and profound damage to the fabric of our society is done by people who operate, if not outside the law, then very close to the fringes of the law and where the enforcement of the law is a detailed and tedious process. The tragedy is that the law takes so long to operate that much of the damage is done before the law can be brought to bear.  The Minister may produce some evidence to suggest that these penalties are consistent with other areas of activity.</P>
    <P>Most of us have received comprehensive and quite impressive briefing documents from Aer Lingus about the air fare structure in Europe and the fact that, over a period of years when free competition was supposed to be increasing, most European countries were taking further steps to reduce the degree of competition between their own and other airlines and that Aer Lingus have been the victim of increasing regulation all over Europe. They are one of the strongest supporters of an open skies policy and are on record as this over a number of years.</P>
    <P>One would hope, therefore, that the Minister's powers are reserved for the protection of Aer Lingus from unfair competition.  Indeed, one would hope that Aer Lingus, who have demonstrated themselves as more than capable of competing <Col N="1042" /> where free and fair competition exist, will not need such powers and that the Minister involved will ensure that the European Community will achieve a common policy on air travel which will reduce and demolish the various overt protections for individual interests which now exist within the European Community. One would hope that within such a development the suspicious looking cartel which exists between Aer Lingus and British Airways on the Dublin-London route will be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>We need to protect our national airline. It has had to carry, in the national interest, heavy losses on the Atlantic. Those who have ignored Ireland when bad conditions existed cannot be allowed to step in and undermine our national airline at a time when potential profitable opportunities exist.  Therefore, it is necessary to protect our national airline by the means suggested in the Bill.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect I will be sharing as warmly the welcome given to the Bill by other Senators.  I welcome the Minister's speech more than the Bill, because of two points.  He gave a commitment to an open skies policy where European air traffic is concerned and also a commitment to ensure that the lowest possible air fares will be available.  However, the contradiction is in the last paragraph of the Minister's speech, which states:</P>
      <P>As I have said already, continuity of air services must be the overriding objective when one considers our national interest.  The availability of year-round reliable air services to the greatest possible range of destinations, offering consumers the widest practicable range of services at the lowest possible price must be our objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Bill now before the House will contribute to that end.  That, to me, is the contradiction in the argument because the availability of the lowest possible fares is subject to and conditional on the other two conditions, that is, the continuity of air services being <Col N="1043" /> the overriding objective and the availability of all round services.  Therefore, the Minister and Government are saying to us that you must get these two factors right first and that the availability of the lowest possible prices is subject to the availability of these two factors.</P>
    <P>Even though it has not been said in the Minister's speech, it is very clear to me &mdash; and, indeed, to the Senators who have already spoken &mdash; that one of the major objectives of the measure, if not the main objective of it, is to support and preserve the special monopoly position of Aer Lingus.  There is little doubt in the mind of the Senators who have spoken so far. Indeed, the Senator who spoke just before me, Senator Brendan Ryan, put it quite clearly.  He said the purpose of the Bill is to protect Aer Lingus from unfair competition.</P>
    <P>Last night I was reading the debate on this measure in the other House and I became aware &mdash; I had been aware before, but it came back to my mind again &mdash; that this Bill was first introduced in June 1984.  The Second Stage was taken in the other House by the Minister who is here with us and urgency of a very high degree was expressed on that occasion. Twenty months have passed since.  I do not think that we have had any disaster, even though the powers now being sought were not exercisable, as far as I know, in that period of 20 months.  We did, however, have rather pleasant briefing sessions in an establishment not too far from this building.  No doubt they were useful.  Equally, I have no doubt in my mind that these powers have to be balanced in relation to other aspects of the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to state quite clearly that I will not be objecting to the Bill but I have certain views in relation to it, in relation to our national airline and in relation to air traffic, because air traffic affects particularly my own part of the country.  I should like to say quite clearly that I recognise the need and the right of the Minister to exercise control in relation to air fares.  The Bill gives authority to the Minister to do so.  It is an authority, <Col N="1044" /> as he told us, that he thought he had under the 1965 Act, but the courts found otherwise.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was introduced in June 1984, considerable changes have been made by the Minister to the Bill, and I welcome these changes.  I would say that without the changes the Minister introduced the legislation would, indeed, to me and to many others be quite unsatisfactory. The reason we have this Bill, which originated, as I say, from a court case which held that the Minister did not have the power that he and his predecessors thought they had under the 1965 Act, was because of an offer of low cost air fares by a travel agent in this city on the Shannon-New York run.  The Minister or the Department sought to prevent the availability of that low cost air fare from Shannon to New York.  They found in court that they did not have the power, and hence we have this Bill.  Therefore, in the public mind, and while I do not fully share the concept that certain members of the public do, I am concerned that the air should be clarified in relation to it.  Because of the sequence of events that I have referred to, the circumstances in which this legislation was conceived and saw the light of day are to the public mind twofold.  First &mdash; and this is quite serious &mdash; to prevent the availability of low cost travel and, secondly, to preserve the monopoly position of Aer Lingus and its high cost travel both to and from Ireland.  That belief in relation to these two points is pretty widespread when considering what has given rise to this legislation.  It may be valid in part.  The Minister, Deputy Mitchell, and, indeed, the Minister of State we have here with us this afternoon, are doing their best to get the record straight. I believe it is absolutely important, where the public are concerned, to have adequate clarification in relation to the purposes and objectives of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have been mentioned here and, indeed, have been praised, and they deserve the praise they have received. Indeed, I too, have been on record as praising the contribution that Aer Lingus <Col N="1045" /> have made to this country.  They have served Ireland well and deserve credit for doing so.  Having extended that praise and that credit to our national airline, I do not feel I should be inhibited from drawing attention to certain aspects of the airline's work that I find unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I believe that the airline has served Ireland well.  The question is: has it served Ireland as well as it could or should?  To me the job that it does best of all, the job it does 100 per cent, is the job of its public relations.  It goes hard on the message that it is the flag carrier. Indeed, we are all proud &mdash; those of us who from time to time are at foreign airports and see the tail with the shamrock and the Tricolour on it.  In going so hard for that image of being absolutely vital as a national flag carrier, it is appealing very blatantly to the patriotic emotion that is in all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pretty blatant and brutal use of this emotion.  That is my concept and that is what I am expressing. The second great point &mdash; indeed, it has been made here by every contributor to the debate so far &mdash; is that it provides an all year round service.  Of course, it does. But has the possibility ever been examined that any other airline, given the same advantages and given the same monopoly position as Aer Lingus enjoy, would not do precisely the same?  Has the position ever been examined that people can say with such certainty that only Aer Lingus in the circumstances could do this particular job?  They represent their interests as being completely on a par with the national interest in every respect &mdash; absolutely 100 per cent.  They claim their national interest is Ireland's national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make the point that in my part of the country we have Ireland's only international transatlantic airport and that two-thirds of the people who come to this country and who leave this country &mdash; I talk about North America <Col N="1046" /> and Ireland &mdash; either embark or disembark at Shannon.  Is it not in the national interest that Shannon Airport should be successful and that it should grow in success? Yet the history of Aer Lingus in regard to Shannon over the years has been a withdrawal to Dublin of personnel, staff and services, and a willingness to overfly Shannon and land at Dublin on days on which other airlines &mdash; Trans-America and Northwest Orient &mdash; are prepared to land at Shannon.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to labour the point because I might be straying too far.  The successful expansion and promotion of Shannon is crucial to the national interest. One measure which will considerably help its progress is the matter of pre-emigration and pre-customs clearance to the States.  It is a matter which has been debated and delayed for quite some years.  It is known that Aer Lingus opposition has been part of that delay.  Aer Lingus, perhaps rightly, will fiercely defend its monopoly position and it will fiercely oppose competition from any quarter &mdash; legitimate, perhaps, nonetheless this is the position.  Under the legislation proposed here the Minister will have power to accept, to reject, to suspend or to modify any fare or any proposed fare.  I am satisfied that commonsense and objectivity will be applied by the Minister to any application received by him.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the stage at which an application reaches the Minister &mdash; the airline interested in a particular route &mdash; before the time comes for its application and its level of fares to arrive on the Minister's desk it has to go through a certain process of preparation.  We know that some airlines have done this and we know that they have been stymied by a refusal to share computer services and other airport services with them.  I question whether that is the national interest.  This is on the record and for as long as that type of stymie &mdash; I am not sure if that is the correct word &mdash; goes on, if the sharing of computer services and the sharing of airport services is refused then, of course, an application will never arrive on the Minister's desk. <Col N="1047" /> There is need to examine what happens at that preliminary stage.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that he and his Department are conscious of what happened in the past in relation to this aspect and that steps will be taken to ensure that there is a fair and balanced sharing of the facilities at our airports.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is conscious &mdash; indeed, he mentioned it in a few passages of his speech &mdash; of the high cost of travel to and from Ireland.  There can be no question that access by air to Ireland is expensive compared to other routes of similar distance and mileage.  That is damaging to industrial development.  It is damaging to commercial activity and it is damaging to the development of our tourism industry.  Costly air access to this country is preventing commerical development, industrial development, tourism development from reaching their full potential.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch referred to the Third Report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses.  It is relevant to look at the opinion of another State body, Bord Fáilte Éireann, in relation to their efforts to encourage and develop tourism in this country and the difficulties they encountered in achieving that objective.  It went on record before that committee as saying that access transport to this country, air transport from Britain and the Continent of Europe were non-competitive. To back that up, tourism interests, which also made submissions to that Joint Committee, as recorded on page 18 of the report, claimed, among other things the following in specific reference to Aer Lingus, that they were inhibiting the granting of licences for private air charter to Ireland; that they were uncompetitive on certain air routes; they frequently failed to announce their fares until quite late in the tourist business year; that they were more interested in transporting Irish holiday makers abroad through summer charters to 19 Mediterranean destinations, than in developing tours to Ireland; that they were hostile to scheduled competition from Europe into Ireland; that they gave no special incentive packages <Col N="1048" /> to encourage travel agents to offer special group holidays into Ireland and that, finally, Aer Lingus appeared to have a &ldquo;special relationship&rdquo; with the Department of Communications.</P>
    <P>I do not want that to be regarded as a total and outright condemnation of Aer Lingus or their failure to discharge their responsibility, so vital to tourism industry.  In fact, I praised the achievements of Aer Lingus but that should not prevent these criticisms being expressed for the purpose of ensuring that both the national airline and the Minister and his Department take note of the existence of these criticisms, valid in many cases, and that steps are taken by the interests to which I have referred to rectify this situation.</P>
    <P>The final observation I want to make in relation to the cost of air travel and which is constantly echoed is that to many people the policy of Aer Lingus would appear to be their preference to fly a plane half empty at a given figure than to fly it full at half that cost.  That opinion is widely shared.  I have said that it is important for the commercial and industrial life of this country, that it is important for the tourist industry, that we have the lowest possible level of air fares into this country and that the high cost of air travel is one of the reasons why tourism is not reaching its potential and why more people are not coming here.  The high cost of air travel is a reason why industrialists will often locate elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is important, therefore, that the Minister would, as he has done today, clearly spell out the objectives of this Bill; to restore the power he believed he had under the 1965 Act, and which the courts declared he did not have and to enable him to exercise control which was apparently being exercised from 1985 onwards. Many will continue to believe &mdash; indeed, with some measure of right &mdash; that the Bill is there to protect Aer Lingus.  I would hope that the feeling that it is to deny low cost air travel to people traveling to and from this country, such as tourism and business people, will be dispelled.  The responsibility to ensure that low cost travel is available is shared <Col N="1049" /> by the national airline and the Department.</P>
    <P>Tourism, industrial and business activity cannot and will not reach their full potential for as long as air travel costs into and out of Ireland are, in the words of Bord Fáilte Éireann, uncompetitive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a protectionist measure, this Bill endeavours to give commercial protection to Aer Lingus.  I am not suggesting that there is anything wrong with that.  I would support that fully.  It is right that every possible protection should be extended to this industry or any industry under pressure and attacked by unfair trading practices.  We have examples of those in many areas.  Senator Howard asked if Aer Lingus has served Ireland well.  I believe it has.  It has brought pride and we are delighted that we have such a worthwhile national airline. Every help we can give to it should be given.  In some areas the idea of giving protection to our industries is regarded as being an ugly word.  I do not see it like that.</P>
      <P>Worldwide Governments have no hesitation in protecting their own industries. In this instance, just as airline tickets have been dumped in the context of this Bill, we have to examine the position and protect the industry as best we can.  It is essential for our national airline and for the preservation of jobs that ticket sales be controlled in an orderly and understandable manner and that regulation is seen to be done fairly and properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also make the point that if the Minister takes upon himself, rightly, the question of pricing, other factors come into play.  He has to ensure that the level of service the airline provides is of a very high standard.  The pattern, perhaps over the past decade or so does not indicate that this is so.  While we have seen airline fares escalate dramatically in places the question of service has not been matched accordingly.  Customers deserve the highest possible service.  They are paying dear for their tickets and they deserve to be looked after.  When the Minister examines this area he should look closely at the airlines and agree on <Col N="1050" /> proper pricing structures.  The level of servicing provided should be looked at also to ensure that it is of a very high order to satisfy the requirements of people using the airlines.</P>
    <P>Another area which is appropriate to this Bill is the practice of over-booking. This should be examined.  There seems to be a standard practice in the airlines of selling an extra 5, 8 or 10 per cent of tickets above that which will fill the plane in the hope and expectation that the number will not show up.  Sometimes that does not happen and, unfortunately, people who feel they have a guaranteed seat are left stranded.  The practice of over-booking is standard procedure with airlines.  In this kind of situation people are entitled to a seat and also a reasonable level of service.</P>
    <P>We should look at this Bill as legislation which is protecting Aer Lingus.  I am not suggesting that Aer Lingus are inefficient in any way.  They have made great strides over the past number of years to render themselves more efficient.  It is generally accepted that that is so.  Aer Lingus's continuation and strength are essential for the sake of the organisation and in regard to communications with the outside world.  It is important that there is co-operation between organisations such as Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus in the national interest in getting people to come to Ireland for holidays. Aer Lingus should endeavour to fill their own planes but, at the same time, they should encourage people to come to this country at all cost if not by their planes. The role of the consumer is important in this.  Every attempt should be made to keep fares as low as possible.  The obligation is to have an efficient service.</P>
    <P>If this Bill was not passed, we would have a free for-all-situation in which the various airlines such as Trans America, North West Orient and others would service this country and cream off for a period of the year the tourist business which is available without providing any additional business.  We should continue on the North Atlantic route.  It is a source of pride to every Irishman that we are flying this particular route.  My regret is <Col N="1051" /> that we still do not fly into O'Hare Airport in Chicago.  A decision was made by Aer Lingus some years ago to cease flying into O'Hare Airport.  I know that many Irish people living in Chicago regret this and many people in this country feel Aer Lingus should re-examine the position of flying into and out of O'Hare Airport for the benefit of many Irish people living in Chicago and around Chicago and for the many people from Ireland who want to go to Chicago.  Maybe a change of heart would prevail here now or in the future. I would welcome this development and wait to hear the Minister's comment on that.</P>
    <P>The question of the viability of travel agents is relevant to the Bill.  We have, unfortunately witnessed some closures of travel agents which will have problems for our consumers.  If we go for an uncontrolled cut price situation, more of these travel agents will find themselves in financial trouble with consequent problems for the fare paying consumer.  It is in the national interest that Aer Lingus should continue to be a successful airline.  Aer Lingus and tourist interests are important national partners, and every effort must be made to make air travel fares as cheap as possible.  The Minister and Aer Lingus must be very serious about reducing air travel costs.  If careful consideration is given to doing whatever is required to be done, eliminating every possible wastage and working for greater efficiency, this could be achieved.  It is important that this be done to enable us to compete with airlines in Europe and airlines of the rest of the world.  Certainly, it would be my hope that Aer Lingus would continue to be an efficient national organisation, of which all of us can be rightly proud.  I wish continued success to Aer Lingus, to all who fly the airline and to all the people who work in that great organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be a short one.  I, too, like the other Members, regard this as a very important Bill.  I also note that the Members of my party in the other House also regarded the Bill as very important and one that <Col N="1052" /> should not be rushed through the House. I am glad that it has taken considerable time for consideration, but nobody then visualised it would take such a long time.</P>
      <P>Like the other Members, I want to pay tribute to Aer Lingus.  I have not had the pleasure of travelling by air to many foreign countries but on the few occasions I did I felt proud to see an Aer Lingus plane on the runway at the airport.  Aer Lingus give us all cause to feel proud of their record of achievements, built up over a long time, something we should regard highly and not lightly allow to evaporate or be damaged.</P>
      <P>Over a considerable time this Bill has engendered a certain amount of emotion. To some extent that is understandable. Nevertheless, I believe we must be logical, we must be very sincere and we must be very careful.  When we are dealing with this Bill we have to think of two aspects &mdash; customers and the State company, Aer Lingus.  It is not easy to find a middle way.  No matter what is done, it will be subject to criticism.  We must be very careful that the fares are not more expensive than they might be.  Everybody is concerned with this.  We must also be concerned about Aer Lingus, a State company, and to ensure that the charges are high enough to maintain the high standard that the company has established.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks we have had publicity in the media with regard to a firm who want to transport passengers from Dublin to London at around £50.  I suppose if it were possible to do so we would be glad of such a low charge.  But, having regard to all the aspects &mdash; the safety that is essential, the great record of safety, an all-the-year-round service, which again is most important and not just taking the cream periods and the times in the year when the traffic is heavy &mdash; having regard to reliability and many more things that we should take into consideration, we should be concerned that nothing would be done which would undermine Aer Lingus and the wonderful service they have established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated, as far as I understand it, that the prime purpose of <Col N="1053" /> the Bill is to close off a potentially serious loophole.  I will not go into details of how serious that may have been.  I note that travel agents have a commission of up to 15 per cent and it did seem not unreasonable that these travel agents might accept less commission and pass on the balance to the customers.  But, obviously, there is a problem in this connection.  It is an area with which I am not familiar and I am not going into it in depth.  In passing, I just want to say, as somebody looking in from the outside, that there does not seem to be anything radically wrong with reducing the commission.  It is something that is done quite generally.  I also believe that we are dealing with scheduled services. We are not concerned with charter fare levels.  It has been conceded that the charter services play a very important role in providing low-price holiday packages for the public.  As I understand it, with regard to the Bill, there is no change here and I welcome that.  I also note that the system has operated satisfactorily for over 20 years.  A court action was initiated but not concluded, and apparently the Minister felt that there would be no acceptable conclusion within a reasonable time and that is the reason for the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not restrict or confine to any one fare level the tariff to be sanctioned by the Minister.  I understand that all these submissions will be examined on their merits by the Minister and a decision made.  I have heard the criticisms about fares into and out of Ireland and indeed I have read them in the media. There seems to be some confusion in this area.  I understand, on the one hand, that in general, fares to and out of Ireland compare favourably with those of other countries in Europe.  On the other hand, I have read some very severe criticism of the difference in fares.  Perhaps the Minister, in his reply, would refer to this aspect.</P>
    <P>It is important to have our own airline and not to be dependent on other countries and other airlines.  It is important that considerable profit would be made for replacement.  What this would amount to I do not know, and I am not <Col N="1054" /> sure even the experts would be able to fix a specific figure on this.  I wonder at the present time is any finance being put aside for replacements.  Is any finance being put aside for the future?  Is the level of fares high enough to put some finance aside or to make some investment in the future?  This is a very important aspect.</P>
    <P>Safety is something with which we are all concerned.  Quite possibly it is the most important consideration when we are dealing with this Bill when we consider that last year was the worst year in the history of civil aviation.  In the year 1,533 passengers died, which was a 24 per cent increase on the worst previous year, which was 1972.  The popular Boeing 747 came under suspicion with fears about cracks.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the penalties in section 8 of the Bill and other Members have referred to them.  I realise that they have been reduced.  A figure of £50,000 has been reduced from £100,000 in the Bill initially presented.  But, nevertheless, I think the penalties are very high, and I concede the points which the Minister has made that there are different areas in which the Bill may be transgressed. Our airline is very important for our tourism.  We must consider carefully anything that would help in this regard.</P>
    <P>There was an article in <i>The Observer</i>, on Sunday 23 February 1986, headed &ldquo;Crisis in the Sky&rdquo;.  This referred to the increased competition among American airlines, which it said &ldquo;brought cheaper fares but also plunged the industry into unprecedented turbulence.  Faced with huge losses and growing labour problems, some airlines are now facing bankruptcy&rdquo;. The article further stated:</P>
    <P>America's airlines are in financial chaos.  The age of deregulation and competition which brought cheaper fares for passengers has begun to rebound on the airlines themselves. Many are reporting huge losses, including People Express, which started the fares war.  What was once called price cutting now looks more like throat-cutting.</P>
    <P>In the first ten months of last year, <Col N="1055" /> 86 per cent of all air tickets sold in the U.S. went at a discount &mdash; and the average price of a ticket was 56 per cent of the full fare.</P>
    <P>With discounts like that, the airlines are trying to cut costs in order to salvage their profit margins.  Cost cutting in turn leads to problems with the workforce.</P>
    <P>Two airlines, beleaguered Eastern and TWA face imminent strikes &mdash; the former by its pilots and the latter by its cabin staff.  Their managements may choose bankruptcy as a means of breaking the unions.  This was the route which the now reconstituted Continental, a subsidiary of Texas Air, took successfully.  Eastern has already retained a Boston bankruptcy specialist.</P>
    <P>The article lists quite a number of firms who face bankruptcy.  We do not want anything like that to happen to Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan spoke about Aer Lingus fares to Dublin some years ago and said that a private company entered into competition and he was smiling wryly at the explosion in fares this produced consequent on the private firm going out of business.  I think very highly of what Senator Ryan contributes to debates, but it must have been unprofitable for that private firm to continue in business.  It seems to me the moral of the situation was that higher fares were necessary to maintain that service.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard in his very interesting contribution to the debate spoke about the monopoly position of Aer Lingus. This is inevitable.  The important thing is to ensure that there is no abuse.  The Bill has inbuilt in it in this regard a means of ensuring that no abuses will take place. The Senator also spoke about half-empty aeroplanes, and of reducing the price by half and doubling the number of passengers. In working out a price structure, I think a full complement would never be considered.  Reducing the fare by one quarter would not in itself ensure that there would be a full complement of passengers. This is a problem which cannot <Col N="1056" /> be solved to everybody's satisfaction.  I would not like to be regarded as a knocker.  It is wrong to knock for the sake of knocking.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to Knock Airport. It is not improper of me in passing to say it seems that against the tide we have an international airport.  Great credit is due to Monsignor Horan and his committee. A deal has been clinched to provide a twice-daily service between Knock Airport and London.  A successful airport would be of great benefit.  But the indecision has meant that there is no infrastructure, no hotel accommodation suitable for an international airport; the roads need attention and so on.  I would ask the Minister to look again at the situation with regard to Knock Airport and treat it with sympathy.</P>
    <P>I, too, congratulate Aer Lingus on a job well done.  I was unable to attend the briefings referred to by Senator Howard. Nevertheless I realise that great work has been done by Aer Lingus.  Having regard to all the factors I mentioned and many others spoken of by other Senators, I realise the importance of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I would like to say a few words of tribute to our national airline.  It is vitally important that we would have a fleet like Aer Lingus to carry our flag throughout the world. Part of their brief, in addition to providing the transport required by us as a nation is also to use their offices throughout the world as sales outlets for Ireland. Aer Lingus have a dynamic role in the promotion of tourism.  It would be remiss of us if we did not acknowledge their major role.  Unfortunately, this legislation was misrepresented throughout the country as being in some way a means to give Aer Lingus a privileged position and to ensure that they could manipulate fares in their own interest.  Any of us who have read the Bill realise that this is not the case.  The Bill ensures that there is no legal doubt about the Minister's power to approve or disapprove various submissions made to him for fares in and out of the country.  It is appropriate that our Minister should have the same powers as <Col N="1057" /> his counterparts in Europe.  A free skies policy has not been adopted by any other country.  I do not see why Ireland should allow itself to be different particularly in the area of transportation at this level.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus are a tremendously important employer in this country, employing as they do about 5,800 people directly. Indirectly, they employ many people in the tourist industry, something like 34,000 additional people.  The value of their enterprise to the country can easily be measured in monetary terms.  From the prestige point of view alone, it is vital that we as a nation should have a national carrier of the status of Aer Lingus.  Those of us who have been fortunate to have been served by them know of the courtesy, kindness and efficiency with which they treat their customers, whether they are coming into Ireland or Irish people going out of the country.  For my part, I have only the highest of praise for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total Government investment in Aer Lingus over the past 50 years is about £73.6 million which in today's value is something like £300 million.  If we look at that investment I think it behoves all of us to ensure that that investment is protected.  The fact that the people involved in the industry, whether they are tour operators, other airlines servicing this country, Aer Lingus themselves or any members of the industry directly involved in the promotion of tourism or transportation, have accepted the principles of this Bill and have welcomed it as something that is a pleasant surprise for us.  Usually, in the area of legislation you get people with axes to grind and they always feel that legislation benefits one section or the other.  Everybody involved in this area welcomed the whole thrust of the Bill and its terms.  Unfortunately, it has been misrepresented as doing something else, but I think the Minister in his opening remarks refuted this because he does not intend to get involved in the control of charter fares and all the other fares that would concern us since they are part and parcel of packages that are available to people requiring a holiday.  There should be no unnecessary legislative interference <Col N="1058" /> in the normal cut and thrust of the airline business and the sale of package holidays throughout the world.  Aer Lingus play an important role within that segment of the market as well.</P>
    <P>We have to depend on Aer Lingus as a national carrier not just for the peak times when people want to travel to the sun or otherwise but as an airline that will always be available to us as a nation not alone on economic routes which everybody knows about and in which a lot of other competitors are also involved also but on strategic routes, North American routes and routes which are of vital importance to us as a nation.  We must depend on carriers like Aer Lingus to run services on those routes even at times in the knowledge that they are uneconomic but when from the country's point of view it is important, that that service would be continued.  These are the same criteria that we lay down for CIE, our other national transport authority. We are looking for services where you could say they are uneconomic but where it is important that there will be services if the proper infrastructure of the country is to be developed.  Their record last year of carrying 500,000 into the country is a record to be proud of.  They generated an expenditure rate in the country of about £250 million.  These are the kind of figures which can have a spinoff effect for our national economy and for the prestige of the country.  I know that Americans who want to come here complain about the high price of flying from America to Ireland and back, that there are other people undercutting us in this process.  The reverse of this situation must also be looked at.  It is good to know that people like Aer Lingus, when they are selling their product in the States and in other countries, are acting as agents for us from a tourist point of view and by their efforts bring many people into the State.  They have had some good years and they have had some bad years.  They have had operating losses.  In 1981 these were turned into operating profits running to about £26 million and in 1984-85 the operating profit was about £30 million.  These are welcome operating <Col N="1059" /> profit figures.</P>
    <P>We must now look to the future about the replacement cost of the fleet.  It is a major responsibility for the Government and indeed for Aer Lingus to put together a package that will allow them to replace the fleet when that becomes necessary.  It behoves all of us as legislators to ensure that the structures that will be there to assist that replacement of the fleet will be there at no risk to Aer Lingus or their operating future.  For that reason I welcome the Bill.  I welcome the fact that there is widespread support within the industry for it.  It is important for us that our Minister would have proper legislative control over air fares which all of us would accept.  I would also say that the national airlines should be conscious of how the public as users of the service perceive them.  Everybody says &mdash; and I suppose if you look at the figures there is some truth in it &mdash; that the piece of sea separating Ireland from England is one of the most expensive pieces of water in the world to fly over.  There are probably historic reasons for that.  The piece of water that separates the North of Ireland from Britain is probably a little shorter in distance but it is cheaper to cross. Admittedly, it is a different type of airport and service: it is provided for a different purpose.  For that reason, I suppose we have to contend with it.  We would like the national carrier to be aware of the fact that people find it hard to accept the cost of flying from here to Britain and back and, by comparison it is very expensive.  We would ask them, and indeed the Minister who has control over the fares, to keep that in mind.  If you take their flights to any place else they are comparable to the great airlines of the world.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Aer Lingus have fitted into that bracket of being an efficient and great airline.  It has a tremendous safety record, second to none possibly, throughout the world.  They are a flag bearer for us and for that reason alone we have a responsibility to ensure that they get every bit of support that we can give them <Col N="1060" /> by way of legislation to ensure that their future is secure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few comments on the Bill.  In doing so I would like to stress that air transport is very necessary in this country.  As Senator Ferris said, we are surrounded by water. I understand that the purpose of this Bill is to clarify the Minister's powers in regard to regulating air fares so as to close off a potentially serious loophole in the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965. Aer Lingus are doing a very good job and, as already mentioned, they are providing a great service which is very necessary for air transport in this country.  They are also doing work in promoting tourism and attracting people here.</P>
      <P>Some people might say that this Bill is protecting Aer Lingus, but I would also like to see provisions in the Bill that would protect the patrons of Aer Lingus or any other company involved in transporting passengers by air.  I see an extract from the Minister's speech in which he said that, while low air fares are highly desirable, calls in that direction can be merely academic, if there are no services on which to offer the fares.  We need the fares, and if we need something we have to pay for it.  A balance has to be struck between what the airlines require to sustain services and what constitutes reasonable value for money for the several segments of the travel market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have private companies operating air services and I am sure they must obtain licences from the Department of Transport so that they can operate. Before these licences are approved or granted they have to satisfy the Department that they will provide satisfactory services.  It has been brought to my notice that some of these services may not be satisfactory: a complaint was made to me recently about a passenger who came home during Christmas.  He booked a flight through a travel agent in Luton, but the return flight was to take him to Manchester.  He arranged to travel from Shannon and he got a print-out of his ticket at an Aer Lingus office in <Col N="1061" /> Limerick.  He duly arrived at Shannon in time for the 8.15 flight to Dublin which would connect him with an Aer Lingus flight to Manchester.  On arrival at Shannon he did not see anyone checking in at the private company's desk.  On inquiry, he was told the flight had been cancelled because of insufficient passengers.  He was left in the lurch and had to drive himself from Shannon to Dublin.  During the drive he was involved in a car accident. He was put to great extra expense because of the way the private company operated, showing complete lack of care for their patrons.</P>
    <P>I am not against private enterprise &mdash; I would do everything to promote it &mdash; but there must be a serivce.  Aer Lingus would put on that flight whether the number of passengers was two of 20.  Aer Lingus were commended for their safety, for which they have a great record, probably the best in the world.  I commend all those involved, pilots, captains, air hostesses and all ground staffs who play a vital part in ensuring a very safe air transport service.</P>
    <P>Because of recent air tragedies, and because of the recent discovery of faults in jumbo jets we must always be on the alert to ensure that the planes are safe for passengers.  It should be the duty of companies, private or State, to ensure that their fleets are adequately maintained and that planes will be replaced when necessary.  There should always be a proper check from the point of view of safety.</P>
    <P>Our airports are well equipped, at Cork, Shannon and Dublin.  We have the airport at Knock in Connacht, provided through voluntary local effort, something that should be commended.  I hope the Government will eventually recognise that effort by giving some aid so that the Connacht Regional Airport at Knock will become an international airport to give a service west of the Shannon and a means of access for tourists and others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their valuable contributions which will be of great help to the <Col N="1062" /> Department.  I am sure that the contributions will be read with interest by organisations outside.  The purpose of the Bill is to close off a potentially serious loophole in the 1965 Air Navigation and Transport Act.  It is the internationally accepted norm that there should be government approval for international air fares. Applications have to be made by carriers. This is applied worldwide and therefore there is nothing exceptional about the provisions of this Bill.  Senator Ryan referred to it as a reserve power to protect our national interests.</P>
      <P>As a tourist nation and an island we have a great interest in access transport. It must be consistent and reliable.  A very important part of that mix is low fares, but of course if there is nobody coming in it is no use having low fares on paper. A balance must be struck between what the companies require to maintain services and what constitutes reasonable value for the consumer.</P>
      <P>Most Senators referred to the level of air fares on the Dublin/London route. Fare comparison on a route-to-route basis can be used to support arguments that fares are too low or too high.  To be valid, such comparisons must include many factors, like the length of the journey, the volume of traffic on it, the infrastructural costs such as landing fees and the traffic mix, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as Dublin-London fares are concerned, the lowest return fare will be £99 on offer from Aer Lingus, British Airways and Dan Air.  In the past &mdash; I heard it last week when I had discussions with the British Minister for aviation &mdash; we heard about a £49 return fare, London to Amsterdam, but people find it difficult to avail of that fare because it is, surrounded by all kinds of conditions.  I understand one cannot book in at the airport of origin &mdash; it must be done from a city centre office of the airline concerned. The return flight cannot be booked in advance &mdash; you have to repeat the performance in Amsterdam.  What percentage of these tickets are reserved?  What looks like a very attractive fare may not be so valuable in practice.  I am not denigrating <Col N="1063" /> it; I am merely repeating the comments of people who tried to seek out this fare.</P>
    <P>As far as the Luton-Dublin route is concerned, Ryan Air intend to operate services at an unrestricted fare level of £99.  This proposal has been approved by the Minister because of a consumer perception which has been reflected here today that Dublin-London levels are too high and the insufficient seats are being made available by the major carriers at the lowest fares.  The Ryan Air service will address the extent to which a market gap exists on the Dublin-London route, not only for Irish originating traffic but for the United Kingdom traffic as well.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are community groups in Britain that have been seeking lower air fares.  The recent fare developments on this route will encourage a large increase in traffic.  This will be the acid test as to whether the lower fare will increse the level of traffic.  The Ryan Air service of £99 is an innovative decision and is designed to increase competition on the Dublin-London route.  I will watch with great interest developments in this regard.</P>
    <P>In regard to the New York route, points were raised by Senator Lynch and others.  The promotional fares to and from the US this year have been reduced significantly &mdash; decreases of up to 20 per cent are involved.  This, in so far as Irish tourism is concerend, should offset the recent depreciation of the US dollar <i>vis-a-vis</i> the IR£</P>
    <P>Senator Howard pointed out the dilemma between low fares and continuity of services.  The Bill enables the Minister to balance the competing national economic objectives.  Section 3 sets out the criteria against which each application must be judged.  The circumstances will differ by market area.  Where services operate on a marginal economic basis, the Minister will be likely to have a greater regard for air service viability than he would have on a more profitable route.  It will be up to the Minister to determine his priorities in national air transport policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> Senator Lynch raised the question of cracks manifested in recent examinations of jumbos.  I am happy to assure the Senator that Aer Lingus have undertaken stringent checks on their B747 fleet and have not found anything wrong with them.  They will continue to maintain the closest possible checks on their fleet to ensure operational safety.  I am pleased to see in the statement issued by Aer Lingus after these checks that the new type of examinations that were required following the difficulties that emerged in the jumbos were being done by Aer Lingus on a routine and continuing basis. This is pleasing for all of us here who have expressed great pride in our national airline.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard spoke of the possibility of customs pre-inspections being carried out at Shannon.  Recent talks with the US authorities have enhanced the possibility of such a facility being established there.  Further contacts in this regard are planned.  It is, however, inaccurate to state that Aer Lingus have a veto over the establishment of this facility. While I acknowledge that they have their own interests to consider and have some reservations about the proposal, that in no way is hindering the efforts being made to see this facility established. The Government recognise the value which this would have in attracting extra transit traffic and other airline business through the airport.  My officials are endeavouring to get agreement on its establishment on mutually acceptable terms with the United States authorities. Senator Howard has this matter well researched. We are hopeful in this situation and the talks are ongoing.</P>
    <P>Many Senators expressed some concerns &mdash; and Senator Howard expressed them more stridently &mdash; about the monopoly position of Aer Lingus.  Avair was an international carrier which regrettably is no longer with us.  At the time of its demise it was providing a very satisfactory and highly regarded service between Dublin and my local airport in Sligo which I availed of on a number of occasions. I regret that there is not a service there now.  I understand that negotiations <Col N="1065" /> are proceeding which may replace it with another service in the near future.  Currently, we have two other international carriers in Aer Arann and Ryan Air.</P>
    <P>Foreign carriers are competing heavily against Aer Lingus on much of their route network.  I believe I am correct in quoting the Minister in recent times as saying that he has not refused any of the applications that have been made to him.</P>
    <P>The Bill should not be presented as protecting Aer Lingus.  That is not the case.  The Bill is designed to promote the Government's national air transport objectives as well as more general economic ones.  The Minister has to balance the various interests involved and the decision rests with him.  The Bill can be used to protect Aer Lingus and any of the other Irish airlines.</P>
    <P>A point that has come up in my negotiations with the UK Minister for Aviation is that one of our inhibiting factors is the lack of a large number of airlines with which to compete, and other countries who may be seeking rights here.  While other countries may have ten or 12 or 14 carriers, we have a limited number and this inhibits our overall competitiveness as a nation.  This is something which has to be taken into account in the ordinary course of events to protect our national interests in any liberalisation of air transport.</P>
    <P>National economic objectives are broader than the interests of any one airline.  Tourism needs attractive access costs to facilitate the growth of traffic and we are all aware of the importance of this.  We knew it in a negative fashion when it decreased for a period and we know it in a positive fashion when it is coming back again.  The Minister on a number of occasions since coming into office has intervened to reduce the levels put to him by Aer Lingus and other airlines. In October 1984 he intervened when price increases of between 8 per cent and 10 per cent from Ireland to the United Kingdom were sought, and they were reduced to between 6.5 per cent and 8 per cent.  Again, in October 1985 there was an increase of 8 per cent to 9 per cent sought and it was reduced to <Col N="1066" /> between 4 per cent to 7 per cent, in both directions.  As far as the Continent is concerned, in April 1985 the Minister also intervened, and tourist fare increases from Paris were reduced to 6 per cent for that period.  The Minister has been implementing a strict policy of ensuring, as far a possible, that air fare levels are kept below the prevailing level of inflation. This policy has been pursued notwithstanding airline objections.  The Minister has stated that the powers in the Bill will continue to be used in a fair and objective way, taking account not only of the airline interests but of consumer interest and the national interest generally.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon spoke about the service to Chicago.  The termination of the scheduled service to there in the Seventies was of matter of regret for many people.  Aer Lingus are keeping under constant review the prospect of inaugurating new service points in North America.  To date the economics involved have not been sufficiently attractive for them to open up again.  In so far as Chicago is concerned, the Minister has authorised each summer direct charter services to Shannon for foreign airlines to meet the needs of tourism, and indeed the need of the Irish ethnic community in the area.  This he will continue to do in respect of routes on which no services are currently operating.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons brought up the point about Aer Lingus fares and whether they are competitive.  I believe they are, particularly on the North Atlantic route. There are other market areas where fares are not as consistently competitive as they are on the North Atlantic.  As already mentioned, the Minister has taken a number of steps towards increasing airline competition &mdash; for instance, Ryan Air.  In other areas where he believes insufficiently competitive fares abound, he has intervened to make available lower tourist fares.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Acting Chairman and some other Senators will be particularly interested in the Connacht Regional Airport. The Minister has publicly pledged to make every effort, other than the provision <Col N="1067" /> of additional finance, of course, to see the airport operational as early as possible.  So far every penny put in was put in by our Government.  The facilities at the airport are not yet of a standard to permit the safe operation of air services, but it is hoped that whatever outstanding works remains to be done can be undertaken and completed at an early date.  In so far as air services are concerned, some interest has been expressed by a number of air companies in operating services to and from Knock airport this summer. They are under consideration in my Department at present and I would hope that the examination of these applications can be sufficiently advanced to permit decisions to be taken within the next month or so.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely spoke of the Connacht Regional Airport and of a specific case of a cancelled flight at Shannon.  This seems very disturbing and if the Senator cares to give me details of the case I would be glad to take it up with the airline involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister on many occasions has indicated his interest in liberalisation of air transport and in an &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; regime in Europe.  Last week I met the UK Minister for Aviation, Michael Spicer, in Dublin and the meeting marked the beginning of bilateral discussion on the possibility of further liberalising the arrangement governing the operation of scheduled air services between Ireland and the United Kingdom. I reiterated my support for a genuine liberalisation of the European market which Aer Lingus would gain greater access to routes in Europe.  I also reiterated the commitment of the Minister for Communications for an &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; concept along these lines.  We earlier heard Senator Lynch talk about what happened to the scheduled service developed by Aer Lingus between Manchester and the Continent &mdash; their rights were removed in those cases.  We are genuinely interested in a regime where Aer Lingus could openly compete between all points in Europe.  That is what the real concept of &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; means.  The UK Minister <Col N="1068" /> and I expressed a desire to see more rapid headway made in the European Communities in this area and on a broader European front towards liberalistion of existing air transport arrangements in Europe.  In our bilateral contacts we agreed that discussion at official level would commence within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Senators very much for the manner in which this Stage of the Bill has been received.  I believe that discussions on a Bill of this nature, especially a Bill that is not controversial in a party political sense, can enhance the legislation that is going through and result in better legislation overall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, mindful of the constant exhortations of successive Governments for pay restraint from all sections of the population, calls on the Government to introduce legislation to ensure that neither the President nor any member of the Judiciary nor any member of the Oireachtas, nor any member of the European Parliament, receives a pension by virtue of having held office, either as Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the Dáil, or as Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad or as a member of the Government or Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have you in the Chair provided I am not interrupted any further.  This motion deals with the credibility of politicians and the public distrust which is felt for politicians of all our parties and Independents by the general public.  Many of us are aware of the deep distrust and deep cynicism which is felt about politics and politicians in Ireland.  It is very difficult to put one's finger on any tangible evidence why politicians should be held by the public in such low esteem.  But the position regarding pensions in this House and in the other House is one of the most tangible pieces of evidence where the public feel the politicians are being given preferential treatment over other people and it breeds distrust.  It is something which they point to.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of this motion is to object to the practice of paying sitting Members of the Oireachtas salaries as well as paying them pensions for being ex-Ministers.  By doing this these people are establishing a principle whereby they can be paid not only incomes from the State but simultaneously they are being paid pensions from the State.  It is the principle which I object to, not just in terms of politicians but in all cases.  It is important that this motion is down, because we should put our own House and the Dáil in order before we attack other institutions.  I can anticipate people asking what do you do about certain other categories?  The principle objective should be to show the public the way we are acting and to put our own House in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount paid out by the Exchequer in this case is very small.  But the actual amount paid does not matter; I am objecting to the principle.  If £10,000 per annum were paid, I believe the principle would be wrong.  The public see in this payment of pensions to sitting TDs and sitting Senators not only preferential treatment being given to public representatives by public representatives showing self-interest above public interest, public representatives awarding themselves salaries which cannot be justified in the public interest and for which they were <Col N="1070" /> not elected.  Outside the House this is regarded as one of the great scandals at the moment.  It is time this House examined it and made proposals to revise it because politicians are seen not just in this way but in many other aspects, to be feathering their own nests.</P>
    <P>I have no quarrel with the idea of paying politicians pensions <i>per se</i>, I believe there is no doubt that sacrifices are made by politicians to come into both Houses and undoubtedly, politicians could have much more lucrative careers outside.  I believe that what they do should be acknowledged and should be rewarded in some form when they have given service to the State, but I do not believe that the present way of rewarding it is right.  I do not believe the State should pay them pensions in an unprecedented manner while at the same time paying them for doing a job for the State.</P>
    <P>A further principle which I believe ought to have been established a long time ago in other areas is that legislators should not be awarding themselves their own pay, their own expenses and their own pensions.  At regular intervals we see politicians' pay becoming a source of national controversy because these awards are made by politicians themselves in the Government.  We see politicians' expenses also being awarded by the Government and now we see politicians' pensions also being awarded by the Government.  I believe this should be taken completely out of the political arena and that an independent body should be set up to award the pay of politicians, the pensions of politicians, the expenses of politicians and the privileges of politicians.</P>
    <P>The legislation which governs the payment of pensions to ex-Ministers was drafted in 1938.  I am surprised that, apart from a few amendments, there has been no updating of this legislation since 1938 and no drastic procedures have been introduced to revise the conditions under which politicians were awarded these pensions.  Public opinion sees a conspiracy among the political parties to run away from an issue which hurts their pockets.  It is natural for them to do this, <Col N="1071" /> but it is regarded as a public scandal that party politicians lie low on issues like this, try to brazen it out and are perceived to be giving themselves money while other people are being asked to tighten their belts.</P>
    <P>This is the situation in the country at the moment.  We have constant exhortations for belt tightening to all sections of the population.  We have the teachers being asked to accept a lower pay deal than they were awarded.  We have the public service being asked for restraint, we have trade unions being constantly asked for restraint, we have the PAYE workers being asked for restraint and we have the self-employed being asked for restraint.  We have the situation where the unemployed figures run at about 240,000 and where unemployment is consistently being used as a political football by the Opposition and by the Government, but normally by those in Opposition. Poverty is rife in the country.</P>
    <P>Concern is constantly expressed about all these things by Government and by Opposition; yet this malpractice continues. It is very difficult to ask the people to respect politicians who are paying themselves large sums of money which other people are not entitled to although they are being asked to take very small pay increases.  This hypocrisy stands out in the public's mind very obviously.  This House should consider and review this matter.  It is in all our interest that the public do not perceive us as feathering our own nests but on this particular issue they do so.</P>
    <P>This motion includes members of the European Parliament specifically, because there is a public perception that members of the European Parliament are very highly paid and possibly, overpaid. There are certain members of the European Parliament who are still accepting the dual mandate and getting salaries which are vast and not consistent with the sort of salaries which members of the public in other jobs are getting.  It is time that we finally solved the problem of the dual mandate.  I do not see that problem being solved by the political parties, once again for specific reasons, by the time of <Col N="1072" /> the next election.  We have people being paid European Parliament salaries, Dáil salaries and salaries as ex-Ministers. There are several people within that category.</P>
    <P>The public have a right to ask why people should be drawing three separate incomes from the State.  People have a right to ask why people, by virtue of being ex-Ministers should be entitled to draw a pension when they are also drawing a salary from the Oireachtas and a very large salary from the European Parliament. It damages the European ideal, it damages this House and it damages the image of the other House in the eyes of the public.  It should be pointed out at this stage that many of those people who are ex-Ministers receiving pensions are pursuing extremely lucrative careers outside this House.  Some Members of both Houses are full-time politicians and receive incomes which are not excessive, but others are not only full-time politicians but are receiving larger incomes from outside these Houses and are also receiving pensions as ex-Ministers.  When the public see that people who are successful &mdash; nobody begrudges them that &mdash; in their profession or business are also drawing salaries from the Oireachtas and are also drawing pensions as ex-Ministers they will be suspicious of us for that, and rightly so.  The public will rightly resent it because we are giving ourselves a privileged position which we do not deserve and which nobody else receives.</P>
    <P>These pensions have also got some very peculiar characteristics.  They are non-contributory, which is not true of the Dáil and Seanad pensions.  The ministerial pensions are non-contributory, which is a great privilege.  They have the odd characteristic, which is peculiar to Ireland, that there is no age limit on them.  We have a situation, which is not exceptional, where people can come into the Dáil, become ex-Ministers in their thirties or even younger &mdash; in theory they can become an ex-Minister at 24 and get a pension for life, but in practice they become ex-Ministers at the age of 30 &mdash; with the best working years of their lives ahead of them in other careers, and for <Col N="1073" /> life they are drawing pensions from the State.  That is not equitable and that, by anybody's standards, should not continue.</P>
    <P>A system could be introduced whereby people, as in the UK, are entitled to pensions at the age of 60, but not to enable them to draw pensions in their early thirties for life.  These pensions are also index-linked, which means that they are inflation proof, and they are also given to people after three years's service. Three year's service is a very short time for someone to be entitled to a pension. There is a case for them being rewarded in some way but not forever, which is what happens at the moment.</P>
    <P>The pension difficulties which this Government and other Governments have found themselves in have been pinpointed by some commentators with such cynicism that it is regularly pointed out by these commentators that elections will not be held until a certain date so that people can get their pensions.  It was regularly pointed out by many commentators under this Government that there was unlikely to be an election until 18 December because nobody would qualify for their pensions before then.  It is not a decisive factor, but it is a factor in Government's thinking when they are thinking about calling an election.  It should not be a factor in their thinking. It underlines the cynicism about politics that any commentator can say that this is an electoral consideration.  In other words, self-interest above public interest is being perceived in this case.</P>
    <P>I want to anticipate some of the responses from those who will take the opposite point of view.  There has already been one in that the Fine Gael Party have set up a committee to look into this.  I have written to all Members of the Dáil and Seanad and some members of the Fine Gael Party have replied that a committee has been set up to look into this issue.  I find that unsatisfactory.  An internal committee of Fine Gael being set up looks very like a fudge and it looks like they are running for cover.  It looks to me as though nothing will be done about this issue, but the Government have to be seen to be doing something by setting up <Col N="1074" /> a committee.  The committee will report, but no action will be taken on it.  However, in order to pacify public opinion, you use the device, which is regularly used by the Government to show that they are doing something, but nothing will be done until this committee report.</P>
    <P>It is noticeable that the responses I got to the letters I sent out were 99 per cent from those who were not beneficiaries of this scheme.  There was only one response from a Member of the Dáil and Seanad who was a beneficiary of the scheme. That tells me something.  I received many replies from those who were not, many honest and many kicking for touch, but the beneficiaries of this scheme, for some reason, were very unwilling to express a view about the system.  I suppose it is natural but I would have thought that they would be prepared to take a more lofty and a more long term view of it than the self-interest in which they are involved.  Indeed I did not notice any very likely beneficiaries of the scheme who replied to these letters.  What I am looking for are proposals from the Government about a new scheme for pensions. I am looking for an acknowledgement that this system is causing a great deal of public distrust and a willingness to reform it in some way which will not allow people to automatically draw pensions after three years &mdash; that is an indefensible situation &mdash; in which there will be an age limitation, in other words whereby people cannot, regardless of age, draw pensions after three years, a system in which no sitting Senators and no TDs can draw pensions by virtue of being ex-Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I have learned a number of things since I came into this House.  The first of those was to develop and indeed to improve my perception of the people who practice politics in both Houses of the Oireachtas. I came in here, to say the least of it, as a sceptic about people involved in politics. I had a particular virulent, left wing, public opinion view of what I would have seen, and still see, as the establishment in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> I want to repeat at the beginning what I have said publicly on many occasions, that while I think the vast majority of Irish politicians, my colleagues in both Houses, are wrong about most things in Irish life, I nevertheless have a greatly improved view of the quality of the individuals who serve in both Houses of the Oireachtas and I do not mean to be offensive. I believe both things to be true.  It is quite conceivable and quite true to be able to accept and believe as I do, that most people are wrong and still say, as I do, for the third time since I stood up here, that I have now a much higher view of the people who are involved in Irish politics than I had before I joined the Seanad.  That is a remark which will not do me any good in the eyes of many people who write about politics, but it still remains my sincerely held view.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about this issue of payment of ministerial pensions to people who are still Members of either House of the Oireachtas, because of the damage it does to the quality and image of Irish politics and because I am a person who is, whether it be inside or outside the Oireachtas, committed for life to working for political change.  Anything which devalues politics and devalues the worth of politics to my mind, is both an offence to everybody involved and also from my point of view, and obstacle to working for change in Irish society, which is something to which I and indeed many people in Irish politics are committed to from differing prospectives.  You cannot persuade a cynical public opinion about the importance and the centrality of politics if you do not have a public impression of politics as an idealistic profession based on conceptions of service and idealism, which is what it is supposed to be about.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the realities of life in this country.  In this country the average male industrial earnings amount to about £8,000 per annum.  The average female industrial earnings amount to a little more than 60 per cent of that, which is around £5,000 per annum.  Then we have a quarter of a million people, <Col N="1076" /> roughly, who are unemployed and, on average, the payment to each individual on the dole works out at about £55 per week or about £2,700 per year.  All of those people who are unemployed sooner or later will become subjected to means test.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the 800,000 people in this country who are totally dependent on social welfare for their income are subjected to means tests because it is felt that there can be no entitlement to payments from the State to people who can afford to support themselves.  I do not accept the principle of means testing for benefit, but it is a principle which is accepted by the vast majority of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Workers on relatively low earnings &mdash; the second lowest in Europe &mdash; and people on social welfare, who are subject to the humiliation of social welfare means test, have had to make sacrifices on an unprecedented scale over the last three or four years. There have been high taxes, extra income levies, reduced benefits in some cases, particularly pay-related benefits, factory closures, cessation or reduction of services, enforced redundancies and reduced services in some case.  We were told that the country could not afford it, that we would all have to tighten our belts because of the state of the public finances brought about by policies to which both politicians and public had contributed.  It is one of the simplicities of Irish life to blame politicians for all our faults.  Nevertheless, we have a situation where people have been asked to accept sacrifices on a grand scale as instanced by the present position of the teachers and the general level of wage and salary earners within the public service.</P>
    <P>Consider, then, the position of Ministers and Ministers of State.  They have one of the most extraordinary opportunities that can be given to a citizen of this State.  I have said before that I would give my right arm to be a member of a Government for a period of three of four years because of the opportunities it presents. I do not know anybody yet who has been a member of a Government who <Col N="1077" /> has not found that experience invigorating, stimulating and enormously worthwhile. They have an opportunity for service which is part of the tradition of this country.  Let us remember that those who were responsible for setting up this State never thought about financial reward and never worried about the financial insecurity into which they put themselves as they endeavoured to liberate and then to build up the State.  Politicians have an opportunity for practical idealism and to show the sort of example that can inspire people to accept collective sacrificies in the interest not just of the future generation but of the existing younger generation.  The Government have an opportunity to give an example of commitment on the scale necessary in a country faced with such problems.</P>
    <P>What do we do?  The first thing we do is we pay our Ministers and Ministers of State very well.  By any standards we pay them very well.  That is not something I would say &mdash; again, I will get myself hanged for saying it &mdash; about Members of the Oireachtas.  I am quite well off, because I am fortunate to have a job which is compatible with my political activities.  Nobody could suggest that full time politicians in either House of the Oireachtas are particularly well paid, given the burdens, the pressures and the demands.  Nobody could say either that the pressures on the family lives of politicians &mdash; this is something I have come to learn over the last four years &mdash; are anything but extremely demanding.  One could argue that, if the Roman Catholic Church believes that celibacy is a necessary qualification for service in the priesthood, perhaps a similar qualification should be imposed on politicians, because the strains that are imposed on families as a result of peoples political activities are unknown to those who are not involved in politics &mdash; and I speak as one who has very little involvement in the drudgery of constituency work on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>As I said, we pay our Ministers and Ministers of State extremely well.  We provide them with extra benefits such as State cars.  I find it difficult to reconcile <Col N="1078" /> the scale of the benefits, particularly the lavish and apparently unlimited travel that is available, with ideas of commitment, sacrifice and idealism.  If they lose office and continue to be Members of the Oireachtas, they descend from the lofty heights of ministerial salaries to the level of payment of Dáil and Seanad Members. If they are particularly unfortunate, they end up in the Seanad.  If they are reasonably fortunate, they only end up being demoted to the Opposition benches in the Dáil.  As such, they are not particularly well paid; but neither would I say that they are particularly badly paid. Anybody who is earning a salary which is on first glance about twice the average industrial wage &mdash; and when you add to that extra benefits in tax-free allowances it is probably closer in net terms to three times the average industrial wage &mdash; should not claim to be badly paid.  That is OK as far as it goes, considering the demand on people's time, the effort and expenditure involved.  That is not unreasonable.  But if, on top of all that, after three years ministerial service, they become entitled to an indexed pension, one's credibility, one's credulity and goodwill are strained beyond any possible reasonable limit.</P>
    <P>What can the country think of us when by the standards of most people we are better paid, not particularly well paid, but better paid than most people in the community?  There is the enormous enjoyment and sacrifice of working in Government for a period of three or four years.  Then we decide that we need pensions. At that stage we begin to show the signs of what is often talked about as the Leinster House club mentality and very little signs of the sort of commitment and idealism which should be the backbone of politics.</P>
    <P>We are presented with some arguments which are somewhat ludicrous. One is that it is compensation for loss of earnings and the second is that it is meant to encourage people of ability.  There are people from various professions in Government.  There are teachers, people from lower management levels, academics, <Col N="1079" /> people from the professions and trade union officials.  Not one of those would be earning a salary anything like a ministerial salary outside of the Oireachtas. To suggest that somehow there is an enormous pool of earnings from which these people could be drawing if they were not involved in Government is ludicrous in the extreme.</P>
    <P>I stand over what I have said.  The Dáil salary and judicial salaries are more than enough to give people a reasonable lifestyle &mdash; not excessive, not particularly generous but more then enough.  The suggestion that extra money will attract people of talent and ability into the Oireachtas is even more ludicrous.  It was not money which attracted the people who built this State.  It will not be money which will attract people with idealism and commitment into politics.  It is the possibility of doing something, the possibility of service and the idealism that draws people into politics that is the basis of real political activity.  If people are entering politics because of the level of earnings, then they are not the sort of people the country needs in its present state of crisis.  We need people who are heroes in the sense that the country has always perceived heroes &mdash; people who make sacrifices because they believe they are worthwhile and not because of some idea of incentive or reward.  We need people with qualities like Éamon de Valera, Cosgrave and Lemass, none of whom became enriched by their lives in politics.  The image we are creating for ourselves by jealously holding on to the pensions that come from ministerial office is an image that destroys any possible public credibility in what we are about.  The public perceive ministerial pensions paid to people still involved in politics or in the Judiciary as perks.  They do not see them in any way rationally justifiable, in terms of loss of income or in terms of incentive.  They see them as a glorious perk.</P>
    <P>The perk is something that is now beginning to to seen to corrupt the entire public perception of the practice of politics. It is the one area of financial support <Col N="1080" /> for politicians which it is impossible nationally to justify.  It goes beyond what is available for anybody else.  It goes beyond any necessary protection of people's basic living standards.  It goes beyond any necessary idea of preserving people from hardship.  It goes into the realm of a reward for temporary office which guarantees a reasonable level of income for people for the rest of their lives.  They should be dropped if we are to get a sense of common sacrifice.  If people are to accept that sacrifices when called for are shared equally, then sacrifice must start at the top in politics. One simple remedy and expedient would be to deny so-called pensions to people who are in the whole of their health, in the best of their youth and who happen to cease to be members of a Government. That is the way to give some impression that what we are here for is sacrifice, idealism and commitment and not some sort of cosy arrangement by which we all end up substantially better off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Senator Ross and to Senator Brendan Ryan, I find that they have not proved any case for immediate action along the lines in this motion.  Senator Ross says he is moving this motion as a matter of principle, that he objects to the principle of pensions plus pay.  He says also that he objects in principle to legislators fixing their own emoluments.  The third principle to which he objects is that of the dual mandate.  The only argument which holds any substance is the first objection he made to the fact that the system that has been set up has been set up in the form that it appears, legally and formally, as being a matter of pension plus pay. There is a case to be met on that point. With regard to the other objections, I do not think there is anything like the same case to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross said that he is against the principle of legislators fixing their own emoluments and not applying to themselves the constraints they ask for from others.  Surely the position today, in regard to the emoluments earned by the Members of the Oireachtas under a Bill <Col N="1081" /> which this House passed, is that they are linked to public pay.  Every time a member of the Government calls for restraint on public pay and incurs displeasure and odium in standing up against the demands of the public service unions, he is acting against his own self-interest. If politicians did act according to self-interest, then it would not be in the interest of the members of the Government to resist the demands for better and better emoluments in regard to the public service.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the dual mandate, I should like to point out that the matter of the dual mandate has been referred by Dáil Éireann and by Seanad Éireann to the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC.  On the establishment of that committee in this session, the Seanad asked for the matter to be dealt with and a report to be made. Senator Ross is a member of that committee. I do not know how regular his attendances at that committee are.  He certainly has had ample opportunity to raise the question of the dual mandate in the area in which it should be raised, in the committee to which it has been referred for consideration and recommendation by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I want in the short time available to me to meet what I think is the only substantial part of the argument.  It is the very real public disquiet in regard to the situation whereby we have persons in receipt of Oireachtas salaries also in receipt of allowances which are termed pensions.  It is the use of the word &ldquo;pension&rdquo;, and the fact that they can accrue to an individual at an early age, that is the crux of this particular problem of perception.  Senator Ross admitted that it was desirable that we should have persons of ability and competence adequately rewarded.  If so it is desirable that we should avoid any financial disincentive which would deter persons of ability from seeking a full time career in politics.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan made the statement that the people of middle management, teachers and academics who go into Government do not suffer a loss of <Col N="1082" /> salary.  This is not so.  I can give the House my own instance.  When I accepted a post in Government, I earned in salary considerably less than I was earning in the university as a professor.  I think it is wrong, when we are dealing with an area of public perception where there is disquiet, that the position in this regard should be presented in a distorted way.</P>
    <P>It does appear to me that Senator Ross in particular is trying to bring us back to a situation that did govern 20 or 30 years ago.  I remember over 20 years ago an occasion on which it looked as if there was an impending change in the leadership of the Fine Gael Party.  A senior member of the Fine Gael Party said to me that of course, the choice was between two persons only.  As a young Senator, I was interested to know what were the criteria. Did one judge suitability as leader on ability or commitment or appeal to the public?  No. That shortlist was made up on the basis that there were only two people with adequate private means which would enable them to take on the leadership of the leading Opposition party.  Senator Ross may want to go back to a situation where it is your private means decide whether you can aspire to party leadership or not.  I certainly do not want to go back to that position.</P>
    <P>I remember &mdash; and Senator Eoin Ryan will remember &mdash; the discussions of the Constitution Reform Committee of 1967 and 1968.  It was very interesting at times. The committee was set up by Seán Lemass.  During the period of its deliberations he resigned as Taoiseach and he joined the committee himself.  I remember we were talking about the question of how do you form a Government.  Should there be any changes in Ireland's constitutional structure in order to ensure that we get as many highly competent people as possible?  I remember Seán Lemass saying that people think a Taoiseach has great freedom in choosing a Government from his Members in the Dáil.  If he is lucky, he has 80 members of his party from whom he has to choose 15 Ministers and 15 parliamentary secretaries.  The position is, he said, that he looks around and he finds one-third of them are unsuitable, <Col N="1083" /> one-third of them are unwilling and thus he has a remaining 27 from whom he has to pick 30.</P>
    <P>I think that the situation that faces any Taoiseach in the formation of a Government, the situation that confronts him in trying to find a group of people who can run the country, is one of difficulty. It must be clearly laid down that the job conditions must be such that we can reduce year by year to the greatest extent possible the number of those who are unsuitable for office in the Government and the number of those who are unwilling to serve in the Government.</P>
    <P>I think the basic question is: how are we to go about this.  At the moment the allowance is described as a pension.  As I have said before, I think this is the problem.  In view of the very wide public disquiet about this, I think it proper that we should ask for a review of this situation. I hope that the Minister for State, who is sitting in on this debate, would report to the Government that there is a widely held opinion in this House that there are some grounds for this public disquiet.  They are not entirely adequate grounds; they are not well founded; but the disquiet is there.</P>
    <P>The governing of the country and the business of politics are concerned with two things &mdash; with perception and with reality and with the relationship between them.  It must be perfectly clear that this money which Ministers get during their period of office is money well earned.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago there used to be a principle throughout the public service of the abatement of public service pensions. In other words, if you had a public service pension of any kind and you were employed later in another part of the public service, then you could not draw your pension.  Senator Ross asks us to go back to that particular position.  I think the situation that has been won by the trade union movement in regard to abatement is that a pension is not an act of grace and favour by the employer.  In the Civil Service &mdash; and I struggled against this on the 1963 Act in this House &mdash; a pension may appear in law as being a <Col N="1084" /> matter of grace and favour from the Government; but in any terms of proper job conditions, any terms of decent industrial relations, a pension is deferred pay. That is the position which has been established over the past 20 years and I do not think we should revert to the old position.</P>
    <P>We do have, in our system of Government, allowances to the Opposition party to carry out their normal functions.  I think there is a good case for considering whether this particular problem of those who serve in Government, of those who want to be full time politicians, can be met through the mechanism of allowances to Opposition parties.  Instead of such persons being entitled to a pension for life, even in the extreme case from the age of 24, as Senator Ross has said, I think that money might, perhaps, better be devoted towards an allowance whereby the Leader of the Opposition or the Leaders of the Opposition parties could designate certain members as full time members of the Opposition Front Bench and they could be paid allowances accordingly.  This idea of establishing full time shadow Ministers is the sort of thing that could be reviewed.  There is a very real need for a review but I think this motion that has been moved and seconded here tonight prejudges the results of such a review.  I do not think this should be done.</P>
    <P>These are just a few points I should like to make.  I imagine a large number of Senators would like to speak on this and, accordingly, I do not intend to go into the points in any more detail.  I think that the problem of these being in the form of pensions is the major problem.  I think Senator Ross went on then to say that Ministers and Deputies are paid salaries that are not justified.  I do not know whether he intended to say that or whether he intended to say total emoluments that are not justified.  In fact, his words were salaries.  I mention this so that he can, if he wishes to, correct himself on that particular point.  Legislators no longer fix their own emoluments.  The dual mandate is something that should be done away with.  I think on these points there is no case to be answered.  I think, <Col N="1085" /> on the principle whereby we get people of competence and ability to take part full time in politics and aspire to Government, that that principle could be met other than by the formula of pensions. That does not mean that there will not have to be some alternative system of achieving this very desirable objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak on this motion rather in amazement.  I see the point made by Senator Dooge, but the methodology of the payment to former Ministers&mdash;I am speaking of former Ministers no matter what side they are on&mdash;is what public opinion queries. Obviously, it was on that point that Senators Ross and Ryan came with this motion this evening, which has drawn great public and media attention.  I was disappointed that the motion before the House this evening was not rather different. What I suggest they should have asked for in the motion is a proper salary structure for people in public life.  While saying that, I feel that in the last five or six years we in political life seem to have set ourselves on a self-destructive course. We have had a recent barrage of the famous phrase &ldquo;honesty and integrity&rdquo;&mdash; two words I have grown to hate.  I do not think there is any person in public life who has not made a decision in regard to their own honesty and their own integrity. But when a certain type of honesty and integrity is preached to us, then it changes our idea of what we believe to be honesty and integrity.  I say that with fervour, because I have grown to hate those two words.  Nobody can decide what the other person's honesty and integrity is.  That is a matter for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened this evening to Senator Shane Ross.  He made a few statements on which Senator Dooge, the Leader of the House, took him up.  I wrote them down at the time.  He made the statement about salaries.  He said that our salaries were always set by us for self-interest over public interest.  He said we are paying them to ourselves.  He said we are feathering <Col N="1086" /> our own nests and that sacrifices have to be made.</P>
    <P>I am coming into my seventeenth year in this House.  I was in the other House for a while.  There was an incident in my political life in 1979 where a man was promoted from a TD to a Minister.  I saw him appoint a man, because he had to give up his post at home in his own private business.  I saw him offering a salary of £6,000 more to the man whom he got to replace than he was earning as a Minister. That opened my eyes to the sacrifices people make in public life in order to make the contribution to the State they think they should make.  I have witnessed that and I have always thought about it. What is wrong with the whole system is this.  We were reaching the public service pay, but we were only linked to it in order to avoid this barrage that happens only once every four years, because that is when we paid ourselves in those times. But when we got in under the public service pay level we forgot the word &ldquo;increments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Senators Ross and Ryan that there are people in this House and in the other House who have served 25 years of their lives in public life, some of them at Ministerial level.  Yet, after an election, if there is a change of Government, they go back to their basic TD salary or some of them go back to a Seanad salary.  Would it be right in the public service pay structure, that a man or woman could have such a change in status without some compensation.  Yet that happens in the Houses of the Oireachtas. There is no increment scale for any Member of either House for their time of service.  I ask Senators Ross and Ryan whether they know of any other business in the world today where a similar scheme operates.  I do not know of one.  It is certainly not in the public service and it is not in private enterprise.  A man is paid by his length of service.</P>
    <P>I want to make another point.  For elected Members in either House of the Oireachtas is there any promotion? There is selectivity, but there is not promotion. A junior Senator or a junior TD can be elected and cross the threshold of <Col N="1087" /> that gate in Merrion Street or Kildare Street and they are earning the same salary as people who have served in those Houses for 25 and up to 30 years.  I do not think that is correct.  I listened to Senator Ryan talking about Éamon de Valera and the role he played in the foundation of this State.</P>
    <P>I see in front of me Senator Eoin Ryan, whose father was a man I admired, a man who could have made anything he liked in the profession outside of the Oireachtas &mdash; I hope he does not take exception to it.  He was a very brilliant parliamentarian.  He could have ended up in private or in public business a very wealthy man because of his ability.  Yet there was a time in this House when that man was paid £365 per annum.  It was Éamon de Valera, as far as my memory serves me, who introduced the idea of the pension scheme in order to help and to give an increment to people who had made such a magnificent contribution. That is still the system because there is no alternative system to it.  If the Senators were really serious about their motion this evening, that is the point they should have made.  That is the point we should be discussing here this evening, how could we set about drawing up proper structures for people who have served their nation loyally over many years.  I say that because I think it is quite unfair. There are many junior people in this House and in the other House who would agree with me, who have not had the experience, who have not had the sufferings of it, who have not had the joys of it.</P>
    <P>I thought Senator Ross might have said something about the salaries of the Senators. I earn £9,900 per annum.  If I was on the dole at home in Tuam, I would be earning £141.95 per week, multiply that by 52 weeks in the year and see how far you are away from £9,900.  I am not going to talk about the profession.  Basically, I think the Senatorial pay in this House is a public disgrace for a working Senator. It may not be to some Senators.  It may be a damn nice sideline, but to a working Senator it is a downright disgrace.  I think <Col N="1088" /> we should have a grading system in this House to cover those who are serving the public within the meaning of the word service rather than those who are serving in another capacity.  My car will be three years old next week and I have 195,643 miles clocked up on it.  I lost the last general election by 21 votes &mdash; I had 5,794 first preference votes in West Galway.  I have served those people in that area as Senator to the best of my ability.  It is as easy for me to travel to Dublin as it is for me to travel to Cleggan, the furthest point west in my constituency.  I have not been paid for half of those miles.  I have supplemented this.  I have done by constituency work to the best of my ability, serving the people of my constituency under hard circumstances.  I make no apologies for doing this.  I do not want to be part of any grouping of Members of the House who want to adopt the ideology of self-destruction by politicians.  I stand apart from that.</P>
    <P>I am not here under the whip of any party; I am merely speaking for myself. For anybody who wants to work on behalf of the people and make a contribution here, their remuneration is a downright disgrace.  Furthermore, it is a downright disgrace to the TDs who are called upon day and night, day in day out, week after week, year after year, to render a fine public service.  It is easy to serve a constituency in Dublin city or in any of the major cities.  A 45p bus ride would take Senator Ross into work every morning and out again.  Senators who work in their constituencies &mdash; and many do not &mdash; are not receiving remuneration for the work done by them.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about this and take away this double-edged knife that is being pointed at us as though we were a wealthy people.  We are not, and I am not, as I have given the facts.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to ministerial pensions. I listened to Senator Ross this morning on the radio on &ldquo;Morning, Ireland&rdquo;, I was told by a very annoyed Member of the other House that the Senator stated that pensions and salaries were 50 per cent tax free.  I should like to quote, for the record, some facts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have watched many Senators, Senator Lynch in particular, work from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. in the College of Art building.  There are many TDs who do not work half as hard.  I ask Senator Ross to withdraw that statement that such a man is feathering his own nest.  He is not feathering his own nest; he is not feathering anybody's nest.  Neither am I. I defend myself because I work with him. I take as an insult what was said in relation to our salaries &mdash; Senator Dooge, the Leader of the House, also said it.  I have never put self-interest over public interest.  I have never suggested or asked that I should pay myself a salary.  Had I done this I would have paid myself a salary and I would not be ashamed of it.  When those Senators who are talking have made half the sacrifices that many of us have made, then they will know what a sacrifice is.  I have always been present in the House, when called by the Whip to sit in so that the Order of Business of the day would be passed. Except during my time in the Council of Europe, on which I have the honour to be serving, I have always been present for every vote in the House, despite what <i>The Irish Independent</i> said recently.  They did not have the courtesy to ask why I was missing for some votes.  The reason was that I was in Strasbourg doing the business of this House and for which I was selected through this House to do.  I am not going to apologise to anybody for my contribution to public life; I do not have to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must correct the anomaly <Col N="1090" /> that exists whereby people who have served long and loyally should have their due reward for services rendered taken from them.  They should not be placed in a situation of embarrassment because of the type of motion before us, put down by two Senators who should be ashamed of themselves, ashamed even to take it upon themselves on television or radio this morning to disparage people who have served the country so long.  I regret that I have to take issue with Senator Ross on this motion.  I am offended by his nonsense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably none of us could disagree with that spirited defence of public representatives.  The problem with politicians is that we sell ourselves short for the service we give.  If by so doing one makes oneself more popular, either in the media or in the country, in some people's minds that is serving democracy. When the call came for the abolition of State cars for Ministers of State and it was put into effect what extra votes did anybody get for it?  What justice was done to anybody?  Still we expected people to drive from the four corners of the country in their own time, in their own cars and often at their own expense, to give public service.  We should not sell ourselves short.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the concept of what is included in the motion before us.  I agree with most of what the Senators have stated.  I agree with the principle that they are talking about.  In the public mind it is perceived that there is an anomaly, for example, that a person who spends a short period of time in office is compensated for it when he leaves it, despite the fact that he is still drawing a salary from the same employer.  Something will have to be done about this principle; otherwise it cannot be explained thoroughly and properly why this is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge has laid emphasis on the legitimate reasons for this.  We have a job to do.  Instead of knocking ourselves in front of the public, we should either be in a position to justify this or put it into terms which would be understood <Col N="1091" /> and accepted as being legitimate, whether you call it a pension, a recompense or a reward for services rendered which will accrue to you when you are given the responsibility of a Front Bench spokesperson.  This should be done in such a way that privilege would not be the reason why people would be elected to this House and be in a position to take office.</P>
    <P>If that were the case very few members of the Labour Party could afford to take office.  I speak as a person who is totally dependent on my Senate salary.  I drive about 2,000 miles per month in my constituency to give a service to my constituents. That is what they expect of me. That is what I give them and I get no recompense for it.  The Revenue Commissioners have decided, in their wisdom, that they will give me some privilege by way of a tax-free allowance which would allow for that to take place.  I would prefer to be on the full tax rate if I could write off all my legitimate expenses in my work as a public representative against my salary before I pay tax.  That is the same principle that would apply in the private sector, whether self-employed or otherwise.  I would also say that that is an anomaly here.</P>
    <P>I accept the principle of the motion and I consider whether in fact one should support it in its present form or seek to amend or change it.  It annoys me that it just fingers politicians.  There are other people in this country who were public servants &mdash; non-elected &mdash; who gave good service to the community.  They are retired from previous employment in the public service and are now holding other office in the public service, whether they are teachers or Army personnel.  Because we are elected into a situation in which there is no future and no guarantee of a future, we have to finger ourselves in this issue because it is popular.  The Labour Party are very clear and precise on what they want done in this area and did not have to wait for the motion of Senator Ross and Senator Ryan to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Our conference, some two years ago, <Col N="1092" /> passed a resolution along the lines of what is contained in the motion and our Parliamentary Party and Administrative Council, by request of that conference, also addressed themselves to the problem.  The next move we could make in that area was to refer it to our Member on the Procedure and Privileges Committee. He did so.  How far did it get?  It got very short shrift there.  This is possibly because people in the Procedure and Privileges Committee might have been representing people whom they knew were beneficiaries.  That particular formula for dealing with it was unsuccessful; and I am suggesting that the proper formula to deal with this is the formula that originally decided what the payment of Members of this House, Members of the other House and ministerial office-holders should be.</P>
    <P>That formula was laid down by the Devlin Review Committee.  That committee specifically sat to look at what was the correct remuneration for people of our category, at whatever level, taking into account what is required of us daily, seven days a week, in or out of ministerial office.  Devlin gave an impartial view of that.  It was his decision that our remuneration be indexed to keep in line with either the public service or inflation.  To do justice to this problem it must be dealt with by somebody impartial who does not have an axe to grind.  This system has been there since 1937 or 1938.  Some of our members in the Labour Party talk to us as if we brought it in.  They complain to me as if I brought in the special tax allowances for myself.  They are brought in by the Revenue Commissioners.  I have absolutely no control over them as I have no control over this legislation.  The system was introduced in 1937 or 1938 and many Labour Party members never benefited until they had gone out of this House or the other House.  We are speaking with a clear conscience on it; and it is not just because there might be a change of Government in 12 or 18 months, when some of our members might be beneficiaries, that we would be inactive on it. That would be the very reason why we would want to do something to make <Col N="1093" /> sure that there are no anomalies in the scheme.</P>
    <P>May I suggest to the movers of the motion that they should consider whether there are legal implications involving existing beneficiaries under the scheme, because if somebody allowed himself to go forward and become a Minister and later a pensioner after a period of service as a Minister, that in my opinion is possibly a contract of service with the State. Whereas politicians might decide, for all sorts of reasons, not to go down that road, the Judiciary are the very people who would say that it applies to them legally and there is nothing we can do about it.  They did that with their pay rise. When we would not give it to ourselves retrospectively, the Judiciary had to get it because they had a contract of service and they put down their foot and said &ldquo;That is what we want.  That is our legal entitlement and that is what we are having&rdquo;.  If that norm applies to present and previous Members and if you want to change the regulations for new Members, I will not support the change unless it applies to everybody.  I will not support anything that fingers politicians only, but I will support the concept of doing something specific to broaden this system into the whole area of the public service, because at least they have some security while we have none.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea talked about the kind of work he does.  There is no guarantee that he will ever be allowed to come back and do it again.  We get very short shrift at times from either the electorate or from whatever nomination process we go through.  There are risks involved in being a member of a political party.  You have to not alone defend the party itself but you must have loyalty to members of it and there are difficulties in becoming elected to either of these two Houses. Because of that obviously there will have to be a proper level of compensation.  I accept that there are anomalies in the present system, because it is inconceivable that people, particularly at a young age, should qualify for a pension for life just because they happen to give a service <Col N="1094" /> as an office-holder.  There is something to be said about that.  This should not be confined strictly to parliamentarians.  If you are talking about pensioners who have previously served in any section of the public service and who now hold other offices, whether in this House or otherwise, you should include everybody. I honestly believe that if the public are told what we are doing and that it applies to everybody in the public service, then we will have to contend with trade union negotiations, the legality of existing contracts and all the other things that follow.  It certainly is not a simple issue of passing a resolution in this house which may or not be binding on the Government. Whatever way the Government look at it, there are set norms lay which you can deal with a problem like this.</P>
    <P>The problem needs to be addressed, because, certainly in the public mind, we appear to have the power to pay ourselves. Of course, we do not have that power.  We do not have the power to decide our own tax allowances.  We do not have the power to pay ourselves pensions. There are mechanisms available to do something constructive about the matter.  Let us have a bit of solidarity among ourselves.  Let us agree that we do a good job, that we are elected to do that job and that we should be paid properly to do it, whichever way an independent arbitrator decides.  Let us admit that, if you just pander to public opinion without being constructive about what you want to do, then you are doing a disservice to democracy.  Democracy is the ability of other people to change us, to re-elect us, to put us out, as distinct from a dictatorship in which you could have somebody staying in office by his own decree forever if he so wished, as some dictators throughout the world have tried to do but failed.</P>
    <P>Senator B. Ryan mentioned that he is against the principle of means-testing.  I am against the principle of means-testing myself, particularly as it applies to underprivileged people.  If we are to make errors we should make them on the right side.  I have no objection to anybody means-testing what I have as a public <Col N="1095" /> representative, because that is all I have &mdash; I have no other source of income and because of that I would welcome a means test.  If a means test could determine what I should be paid, then I would welcome it.  There are anomalies in the level of payment for the amount of time one is expected to give in the House or to give to legislation or to give as a parliamentary representative in one's constituency. Each of us has different demands on him or her.  If one is to be means-tested, so that one is paid appropriately, I would welcome it.  I feel I would be a beneficiary under the system, although in principal I agree with Senator B. Ryan that means-testing has its own anomalies.  Senator B. Ryan admitted that he is well paid outside the House, and nobody begrudges that.  That is not the issue that is at stake; it is whether the principle is correct by which pensions are paid in the way they are paid.  In defence of public representatives throughout the country, independent or in political parties, they should not finger themselves without looking at the anomalies that apply to other people in the public service doing the same thing and getting paid from the same coffers &mdash; the funds of taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the question of pensions has been the subject of a good deal of comment and criticism among the public in recent years.  It is useful to have a debate on this matter.  The motion is rather comprehensive; it goes further than I would be prepared to go, but nevertheless it gives us all an opportunity to discuss this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion gives a number of combinations and permutations of pensions and of people who hold various posts at the moment.  I am not going to deal with these in detail because I think it only tends to confuse the issue.  The simplest example, and the one I think is most often in question when people are discussing this matter and most often in question when people are criticising it, is the position of ministerial pensions being paid to people who are now Members of <Col N="1096" /> the Oireachtas.  This is something which we can look at and consider whether they are justified.</P>
    <P>There should not be any necessary connection between being a Member of the Oireachtas and the question of whether a former Minister who is a Member of the Oireachtas should have a pension. There have been many people who were Members of the Oireachtas who had State pensions, not ministerial pensions but pensions as perhaps teachers or members of various other professions.  If they became Members of the Oireachtas later nobody suggested that there was anything wrong in their being paid a pension for some other job they did and did well and for which they were entitled to a pension.  On the other hand, if you look at the position of Members of the Oireachtas, there are many TDs and Senators who never became Ministers, perhaps never managed to become Ministers, perhaps never wanted to become Ministers.  They draw their salary.  If they qualify, they get a pension when they retire to which they are entitled and to which they have contributed, but they are in a different category.  I think it is a mistake and it tends to confuse the issue to think that merely because a person was a Minister and remains a Member of the Oireachtas for some reason he or she should not get a pension because of an allowance as a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In regard to Members of the Oireachtas, it should be remembered that many of them have other occupations; and when they cease to be a Member of the Oireachtas they have their occupations to fall back on.  A Minister is, in most cases, in an entirely different position. He has to give up his outside job. He may never be able to return to that job, depending on how long he is a Minister. I think this is the basis for the pension. It is because he has given up his former job, because he is no longer able to go back to it, that he is entitled to some kind of compensation for that.  On that basis a pension is justified, certainly in some circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> Apart from the justice to the individual, I think the State would be the loser if people of ability decline to accept office because the risk is too great and because they would not be compensated for the fact that they were unable to go back to the occupations they had beforehand.  It is all very well for Senator Brendan Ryan to say that we should rely on people of idealism and so on.  I hope we will always be able to rely on people of idealism.  It is one thing to rely on people like that, perhaps, in certain circumstances, in period of great stress and so on, but I think we must realise on the other hand that we must make provision for the ordinary situation in politics where a job has to be done, perhaps a rather mundane job, that people should be attracted in to do that kind of job and that we cannot always rely on people who are going to come in and do it merely for idealistic reasons.</P>
    <P>The main criticism of the pensions system, of the Ministerial pensions and other pensions of that kind, is because of the short period.  They qualify after three years and after that they get 25 per cent of their salary.  This goes up approximately &mdash; it varies between Ministers and Ministers of State &mdash; something in the region of 50 per cent after eight years.  That is the main criticism &mdash; that these pensions are paid after such a short period.  I would go a bit of the way with Senator B. Ryan.  I think any Member of the Oireachtas should be willing to take a chance for one period as a Minister, which on average would work out at four years, even though he is not going to remain a Minister.  If he serves a second period or term, then he is distancing himself from whatever occupation he has beforehand or the possibility of taking up other occupations.  After a second period, which would be approximately eight years, the question of considering a pension would be justified.</P>
    <P>Members of the Oireachtas have to serve eight years before they qualify and I see no reason why Ministers should not have to serve something like the same period.  If they serve further terms then <Col N="1098" /> the pension should go up to allow for that.  I have no doubt whatsoever, and I would not like to be interpreted as saying, that Ministers are not entitled to pensions: I think they are.  A Minister's job is very arduous; and, just as civil servants, or teachers, or people in industry, or airline pilots, or any other category are entitled to pensions and get pensions, in the same way the Ministers are also entitled to pensions.  The fact that they come back to being Members of the Oireachtas afterwards has little or nothing to do with whether or not they are entitled to pensions.  Being a Member of the Oireachtas is a different job.  It is a job with its own responsibilities, its own allowances, its own pension.  We should not confuse the two situations, which may appear to have a great deal in common but which are different, each with its own responsibilities and rewards.  For these reasons I think that this motion goes too far.  I think it will lead to confusion.  It is not justified. However, the debate is well worth while, but in the end, having debated the matter, the position should be reviewed. Modifications should be made and, if modifications are made along the lines I have suggested and if it leads to less criticism by the public, then a great deal would be achieved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the young Minister of State, Deputy Kenny, to the Seanad and wish him the best of luck in his future role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following numerous representations and a deputation from County Kerry VEC, the Minister will have been informed of the urgency of this matter.  With the Minister's teaching and sporting background he will appreciate the immense educational and biological value of outdoor education for young people and for the adult population.  Outdoor <Col N="1099" /> activities provide a first hand manipulated environment with capacity for cognative development, effective development and physical development of the learners.  In the school curriculum outdoor education brings a note of realism to subjects such as art and geography and science while it adds greatly to the scope and attraction of physical education and sport.  The field of outdoor education, recreation and leisure is one of the fastest growth industries in the world and by the turn of the century it should be our major growth industry.</P>
    <P>Cappanalea Outdoor Education Centre, which is the subject of the discussion here tonight, is owned and managed by Kerry Vocational Education Committee and it is situated approximately seven miles from Killorglin with Caragh Lake to the north and overlooking Cappanalea Lake.  It is surrounded by a small piece of land of up to 940 feet and is within easy distance of MacGillycuddy Reeks.  The area is extensively forested and offers a great variety of terrain for mountaineering, canoeing, orienteering, field studies and camping.  It has potential for other adventure sports.</P>
    <P>The project for the Cappanalea Outdoor Education Centre originated in 1973 with the purchase of a 55-acre site.  It progressed due to the co-operation between Kerry Vocational Education Committee, Killorglin Community Council and the Association for Adventure Sports.  The structure, developed for management, financial accountability and administration, could stand as a model for development elsewhere.  More than 4,126 students availed of the facility in 1985; and when you compare this to the 1,900 who used it in 1982 it shows a substantial increase.  This should be noted, and the increase in usage will serve as a further argument for the immediate provision of funds to keep the centre open.</P>
    <P>This growth in usage is ample evidence of the need for the centre.  Usage is spread across the community, principally school groups, youth organisations, adult groups on basic or leadership courses, <Col N="1100" /> specialist groups &mdash; for example, teachers on in-service training courses.  The range of groups is very wide.  Vocational schools, post primary schools, primary schools, regional colleges, universities, Thomond College, both physical education and rural science departments, youth clubs, scout and guide organisations, the armed forces, sporting bodies, St. John's Ambulance, The Sports Council of Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland Education and Library Boards, Civil Defence, AnCO, National Manpower Development, Department of Education, Forestry and Wildlife Service and various adult groups and tourists use this centre.</P>
    <P>In addition, the centre is pioneering many curriculum innovations, including school based programmes, an awards scheme, AnCO programmes and an outdoor education module for vocational preparation and training courses.  Cross-Border co-operation and projects including student youth exchanges are at a highly developed stage, and I feel this is another significant point in view of the recent Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Cappanalea has also hosted an exchange with two national centres in France organised by the Department of Education.  The return visits have resulted in the centre's first alpine course.</P>
    <P>Employment in 1985 stood at 11, eight of whom were under a Teamwork scheme.  The fees generated paid the salaries of the other three.  The teamwork scheme was the reason why this was brought up in the first instance &mdash; the discontinuation of the existing scheme that was made available to the centre by the former Minister of State, Deputy George Birmingham.  I was of the opinion that the Teamwork scheme was not really suitable for the staffing of such a centre, because of its nature and because of the annual basis of employment, because the people involved in instruction and so forth need to be trained in various leadership courses and need to have a lot of skill. Besides, it presented an insurance problem for the centre, because no doubt insurance companies were not prepared to insure people who were being changed <Col N="1101" /> every year.  In a way the discontinuation of the Teamwork scheme may be a blessing in disguise.</P>
    <P>In all, 21 young people of both sexes have been employed, some of whom have gone on to make careers in outdoor education. Further employment is visualised through a community council project using skills developed by staff coming off the Teamwork scheme.  So, some of these people will now be kept on, we hope.</P>
    <P>The commercial spin-off is very significant in the area.  However, the present difficulties leading to the closure, it would seem by the end of March, arise from the piecemeal approach by State agencies to recognition and funding.  For example, as I said earlier, the rules of the Teamwork scheme made it unsuitable for the unique staffing requirements of the centre.</P>
    <P>What is essential now is full sanction for the centre and its programme from the Department of Education, even if on the basis of a pilot project.  This would allow County Kerry VEC to bring the centre into their existing financial scheme and thus develop outdoor education within the schools' curriculum and promote adult and community education.  It is the view of the management board after 13 years' experience that this is the only way to preserve what must be seen as a valuable local and national resource.</P>
    <P>I referred to staffing.  Indeed, the staffing demands of a residential outdoor education centre are unique, involving specific staff-pupil ratios which vary from activity to activity and involving a three-segmented day &mdash; morning, afternoon and evening.  The ratios between staff and pupils vary from 1:4 to 1:13, giving the centre a usual working average of 1:8. The average group size attending the centre is 24 students, thus giving an average ratio of three instructors on duty with each group.</P>
    <P>During 1985, Cappanalea centre was occupied for 301 days of the year.  Each day accounts for nine hours of instruction. Therefore, with an average of three instructors working nine hours a day for 301 days, it gives a total of 8,370 instruction <Col N="1102" /> hours per year.  Assuming an instructor was to work 30 hours of instructional contact time a week for a 45-week year, the teacher requirement to cover the 8,370 instruction hours would therefore be estimated at six instructors.</P>
    <P>In addition to the instruction staff, the staff requirements come under two headings. Number one is management and administration.  A manager is required to organise, administer and develop the centre.  The assistance of a full time secretary is also essential considering the constant through-put of students and courses and the clerical duties determined by them.  Maintenance is also important. The need for a caretaker to maintain the domestic aspects of a residental centre, with an average turnover of four separate groups per week, is obvious.  There is need for full time maintenance of the sports and specialist equipment in the interest of safety and good performance, and a need for the development of the grounds and property of Cappanalea.</P>
    <P>During frequent visits to the centre I experienced an obvious lack of equipment replacement.  The equipment being used at present I would consider to be dangerous and requiring to be replaced immediately.  A grant of £7,000 was sanctioned some time ago by the former Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey. However, this went nowhere near replacing the defective equipment.  I would like the Minister of State to note this.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the various programmes that are going on in the centre, and to how the centre has developed.  Within the educational sphere, concentrated efforts have resulted in the establishment of many post-primary and third level curriculum innovations.  It is no harm to mention some of these: the development and implementation of an outdoor education award scheme, a school-based out-door education programme concentrating on a broad participation record as opposed to the attainment of predetermined standards &mdash; this was a very successful scheme and one that should be noted &mdash; the development of an outdoor education module for school-based <Col N="1103" /> vocational preparation and training courses in the primary schools; a further scheme for the development of an outdoor education module for community youth training programmes under the auspices of AnCO in co-operation with the Department of Education; a fully sanctioned in-service teacher training course in integrated studies, including physical education, biology, and geography; the initiation of an AnCO training course concentrating on the training of sports and leisure officers; the implementation for third level physical education students from Thomond College of an outdoor education module in practical work experience; the writing and compiling of a practical field studies manual which will be published this year and distributed to teachers and students on a national level.  These are but some of the programmes that have been developed at the centre.  It is a reflection of the very fine work that is going on there.</P>
    <P>From a commercial point of view, Cappanalea centre has been fully active in the development and promotion of an adventure sports tourist industry in Kerry.  I can give as examples the stocking of one of its lakes with mature trout to encourage fishing in the Cappanalea Lake, as well as, during the summer season, the running of non-residential day courses in adventure sports to service the local hotels and guesthouses, and the promotion of a commercially viable community business under the community enterprise programme, where a community group will take over the non-residential day course and develop the concept into a business proposal.  Those courses, on the commercial aspect, bear further testimony to the type of work that is going on there.</P>
    <P>To avoid the annual crisis which has been a feature of the operation of this centre since its opening, short term solutions must be replaced by planned funding. I hope that the Minister will have some concrete proposals here tonight for us.  Cappanalea centre should be sanctioned as a fully operational outdoor <Col N="1104" /> education institution under the responsibility of Kerry Vocational Education Committee.  Within its annual financial scheme, County Kerry VEC should have sanction to cover the capital, administrative, instructional and maintenance costs of Cappanalea.</P>
    <P>This is a quotation from the National Youth Policy Document, 1985: &ldquo;...to ensure that the outdoor pursuit centres will be adequately staffed and financed to enable their full and effective use as part of the national youth service.&rdquo;  The Minister will, no doubt, note that aspect of the National Youth Policy report.  The centre has been operating a management, instruction and maintenance scheme which is in line with existing VEC procedures.  Strict budgetary procedures are adhered to.  All incoming expenditure is subject to an annual plan with monthly reports and reviews.  No new financial procedures would need to be introduced to bring the Cappanalea outdoor education centre into the existing Kerry VEC financial scheme.</P>
    <P>The centre should now be established on a permanent basis.  The VEC should be authorised to provide the basic staffing arrangements, including a manager, a caretaker and secretary.  Additional funding could be used to finance the remaining staffing.  This funding could be got from fees and other forms of promotions which, if the centre was recognised, the VEC would undertake.  I ask the Minister, with his sporting and educational background, to give this matter his consideration to ensure that the centre will not be closed at the end of March.</P>

    <P>Cappanalea Outdoor Education Centre was built in 1981 by County Kerry Vocational Educational Committee with the assistance of a grant-in-aid provided under the programme for the provision of recreational facilities.  It is one of a series of outdoor education centres with which the Department are now experiencing some problems.  Grants in respect of furnishing and equipment are made available on an annual basis by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it has not been possible for the Department of Education to authorise full-time staffing for the centre due to the embargo on the creation of new posts in the public service.  Having regard to the many demands for staffing in various areas within the education sector, there is no possibility of effecting a re-deployment of any posts to cater for the staffing needs at the Cappanalea centre.  In the context, as a result of a request from Senator Deenihan and others, I met a formal deputation on 26 February in relation to the Cappanalea centre.  Presentations were made which were very valid.  Further funding of £7,500 was made available under the Teamwork scheme to enable the centre to continue to the end of March.  I share the Senator's concern in relation to the short term schemes, their implementation and their consequences for the overall efficient running of such centres.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the 1986 Estimates for the running costs, including staffing of outdoor education centres. Furthermore, it is not possible to consider applications for staffing having regard to the current policy of staff numbers in the public service.  The question of the staffing of outdoor education centres, including that at Cappanalea, was considered by the National Youth Policy Committee.  In the Government's <Col N="1106" /> recently published White Paper entitled <i>In Partnership With Youth</i>, paragraph 5.5.3 states:</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the valuable contribution which outdoor pursuit centres, managed by Vocational Education Committees, and youth hostels and residential centres, run by voluntary youth organisations, can make towards meeting important personal development needs of young people.  The Department of Education will ensure that the outdoor pursuit centres will be adequately staffed and financed to enable their full and effective use as part of the national youth service.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Senator Deenihan that in that context, while I regret that I cannot offer any short term help, the Government are setting about the implementation of the National Youth Policy. Though in that context the provision of staffing, etc., would not be anything like what has been provided under existing schemes to date.  I will communicate with the Senator further as soon as progress has been made.</P>

      <P>In the event of the centre closing at the end of March what action does the Minister propose or suggest that the Department might take to ensure that it remains open?</P>

      <P>I cannot give the Senator a categoric assurance but I have asked for meetings with the appropriate personnel in the Department.  I will communicate with the Senator as soon as those meetings have taken place.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 March 1986.</P>
