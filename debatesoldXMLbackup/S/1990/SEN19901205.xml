      <P>I have notice from Senator Hugh Byrne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The recent tragedies in the north Irish Sea where four lives were lost.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Pól Ó Foighil of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make funds available to bodies of approved status for the annual maintenance of accommodation built under section 5 of the Housing Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Tom Raftery of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to make the necessary resources available for the urgent repairs of Ballycotton pier and breakwater, which were very seriously damaged in the storms of January and February last and are now in a dangerous state of repair.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to review the case of a prisoner in <Col N="1930" /> Arbour Hill (name supplied) with a view to exercising his ministerial prerogative of commuting the sentence in the light of its comparative severity taking into account the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Carmencita Hederman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Taoiseach to ensure that the Bronze Age gold collar at present in London be returned to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to outline the criteria used in the distribution of national lottery funds.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make provision for the retention of the Health Research Board Laboratories in Trinity College, Dublin, which have made a huge contribution through fundamental research in combating leprosy and other diseases.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Byrne, Ó Foighil, Raftery, Norris, Hederman, Ross and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Byrne's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Ó Foighil, Raftery, Norris, Hederman, Ross and Costello may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take all Stages of item No. 3 &mdash; Public Hospitals (Amendment) Bill, 1990.  There will be a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. followed by the Fine Gael motion on education and the amendments to that motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House about two matters.  The first <Col N="1931" /> question relates to the Companies Bill which, I understand, is finishing in the Dáil today.  In the newspapers last Friday, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was reported as assuring a group of accountants that the Bill would be on the Statute Book by Christmas.  If that is to be the case, with the large number of new amendments to the Bill, it would mean that we would have a very short time to debate it here.  In effect, it would be rail-roaded through this House. That, I think, is not the intention of the Leader of the House.  Can he inform us if he has given any thought to the points raised last week about the way in which that Bill, which is in many ways a new Bill, will be treated when it comes to this House?</P>
      <P>Secondly, on motion 80 on the Order Paper &mdash; a matter which has been raised practically every day since the resumption of the House &mdash; my understanding is that the European Court of Human Rights reported over two years ago.  The State was found to be in breach but we have not heard from the Government since then.  I believe the case which has been made from the independent benches and elsewhere is a reasonable one.  If there are difficulties, this House is where the Government should outline these difficulties and, at least, bring us up-to-date on what is happening in that case.  I earnestly ask the Leader of the House if he would make time available for a debate before the recess &mdash; preferably next week &mdash; so that this matter can be fully debated and if there are difficulties they can be aired publicly.  I strongly urge him to accede to that request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a number of issues.  First, will the Leader of the House outline to us the schedule for the next number of weeks?  I asked him, through the Leas-Chathaoirleach, about the Appropriation Bill.  Senator Manning has just referred to the Companies Bill.  We raised the question last week as to the form in which that will be taken.  The normal procedure would be <Col N="1932" /> for the Companies Bill to come back to this House on Report Stage.  It would appear to be singularly inappropriate to try to deal with a Bill that has been amended almost 300 times since it left here, and which was amended almost as many times in this House.  To try to deal with that without going back to Committee Stage would be an error.  I would like the Leader of the House to offer a view on that and perhaps indicate whether it will be possible to debate that Bill in full.</P>
      <P>Similarly, there is the matter of the Appropriation Bill which has to be, as I understand it, passed by the House before 31 December.  On a number of occasions in recent years we have found ourselves trying to deal with the Appropriation Bill in a very rushed manner, and then coming back to a sort of non-debate in January on a matter which had already been disposed of by the House. I would prefer that we would have a full debate on the Appropriation Bill before Christmas.  One of the values of an Appropriation Bill debate &mdash; and one of the reasons it is welcomed by Members of the House and would be welcomed greatly by our benches before Christmas &mdash; is that it is of its nature an Adjournment-type debate, where people can raise issues of substance or concern in any area.  It is always a good debate. It allows people to raise almost every issue apart from income tax.  It saves the need for an Adjournment-type debate. It would be well worth while to attempt to have that dealt with before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of motions, I would also ask the Leader of the House to consider the many varying statements and points of view that have been offered on the question of neutrality on all sides of the House by various parties and by leaders in many aspects of Irish life.  If the Seanad has a role, it is approaching consensus in national policy and in attempting to create a certain understanding of concepts. There is no understanding of neutrality. I do not intend to make a speech on neutrality, a Chathaoirligh; I see you are getting a little concerned.  There is a need for a definition of neutrality.  There <Col N="1933" /> is a need for us all to establish our position.  There is a need to find where the common ground is and at least establish where the differences exist.  It is not threatening to the Government at this time.  I ask that a debate on neutrality be allowed some time between now and Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to thank the Leader of the House for ordering the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Bill for this afternoon.  Secondly, I would like to ask what progress has been made in relation to his efforts to get the Environmental Protection Agency Bill introduced in this House?  Is it possible to have a debate on the prisons and in particular on the question of the suicide rate of young prisoners in Mountjoy?  Finally, may I concur with the questions raised by Senator O'Toole in relation to asking the Leader to give us an outline of what he expects to be taken by way of legislation between now and the end of this session?  Also, I would like to support Senator Manning in his request for a debate on motion 80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to motion 80 also.  I would like the Leader of the House to convey the concern of the Progressive Democrats on the delay on this matter, and to ask him to expedite the matter as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House when we may expect the Altamont Bill back in the House?  We are also awaiting an explanatory memorandum which was to be circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Leader of Fine Gael, Senator Manning, for raising motion 80.  It is very important.  I would like to say that what I am looking for with motion 80 is a debate on the issue.  I am not expecting that the Government would rush proposals into this House but one of the most important functions of Seanad Éireann is to discuss important issues and outline the range of expertise we have in order to prepare the public.  I <Col N="1934" /> emphasise the point that I am looking for a debate.  I do not wish to be obstructive. Nevertheless, I am moving an amendment that motion 80 be taken first.  I am formally proposing an amendment to the Order of Business, which I will consider not pressing in the light of what the Leader of the House is able to tell the House today.  I emphasise it is merely a debate I am looking for and I am quite realistic as to what that debate may contain.</P>
      <P>If I may make one further point, Sir; I note today on the Order Paper the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988 which I have been following very closely in the other House.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, has demonstrated a capacity for vision and reform in this area, which is most impressive. We have an opportunity to do something better than the normal procedure of many years which is, when we are confronted with a controversial problem, we look for the nearest available British precedent. In some areas of criminal law we are ahead of the British.  This is another opportunity.</P>
      <P>One further item which I may raise is the question of Oireachtas envelopes.  I realise this has been referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but I brought it up several times here.  We have also written and nothing has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to accept your ruling, so I assume also the fact that most of the envelopes we receive are totally devoid of gum also does not arise, but it might perhaps be heard somewhere in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can arrange for Santa Claus to give Senator Norris some gum at Christmas.  May I once again request the Leader of the House to convey to the Government the wishes of the vast majority of all decent-minded people for the immediate release of the Birmingham Six, and that this wish be conveyed by <Col N="1935" /> our Government to the new British Prime Minister &mdash; if you would allow me to finish &mdash; in order to regularise relationships between our two countries which have been severely ruptured by this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I feel it is important that in this Chamber it is constantly and frequently brought before the Government, specially in the context of there being a new British Prime Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise the question of the payment by the Minister for Social Welfare of the Christmas bonus to those who are employed on the social employment schemes.  Very briefly, we all appreciate, as public representatives, the excellent work being done throughout the country both in urban and rural areas.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would make time available on an all-Party basis to discuss this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I second Senator Norris' proposal of an amendment to the Order of Business.  The fact that Senator Mooney has returned to believing in Santa Claus is an interesting reflection on the state of debate in Fianna Fáil at present.</P>
      <P>I concur with what Senator Manning said about the Companies Bill.  This House dealt with it with considerable diligence. We could do with further substantial legislation, which this House would then deal with with considerable diligence.  Last week I asked the Leader if he could give me the name of one substantial piece of legislation which he expected to be introduced in this House in the immediate future.  I would be very glad to have that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the request by Senator Kennedy for a debate on the inadequacies of <Col N="1936" /> the social employment scheme.  I would like to inform the House that the Independent group will be introducing a motion next week in our Private Members' time to deal with that and many other aspects of the treatment of the unemployed.  I would be delighted with the support of Senator Kennedy and of Fine Gael on the issue.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that we debate the issue of neutrality.  There is an increasing list of important issues which are debated everywhere except in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Prisons, neutrality &mdash; the list gets longer and longer.  On the issue of motion 80, I would ask the Leader not to tell us to take it in Private Members' time.  We are talking about the failure of the Government to do something they are legally obliged to do.  It is not a matter to be dealt with in our time.  It is a matter for the Government to come in here in their own time and explain their own delays.  Perhaps there is a good reason, but the solution is not to take up Private Members' time to talk about matters that are properly the concern of the Government. We would end up in a ludicrous situation if we are told that Government legislation has to be taken in Private Members' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This House has always paid attention to the cultural affairs of our nation.  Therefore, I am delighted to see motion 89 on the Order Paper, a motion which states &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann welcomes the designation of Dublin by the EC as European City for Culture for 1991&rdquo;.  It is a great honour for Dublin that we have been designated by our colleagues in the EC as European City of Culture.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we could take this motion early in the New Year, if not in this session, before the festivities get under way.  Many Senators would be interested in the motion and in contributing to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support <Col N="1937" /> Senator Upton in his request for a debate on the situation in the prison service.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he will make time available for motion 87 because of the dramatic increase in rural crime in 1989 and we hear now from the Minister for Justice that we are going to have an increase in the crime figures for 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to an item which I raised in the past few weeks and in which the Leader of the House is not giving us much information. It is on the question of when the legislation on the reform of local government will come before this House.  We now know that the special expert committee which is sitting is to deliver its report on 15 December and I would like to ask the Leader of the House two questions.  Will that report be made available to Members of the Seanad and, secondly, what is the timescale envisaged?  Now that you know that is coming on 15 December, what is the timescale from that to June 1991 when the elections are expected to be held?  If we wait and do not press this issue now, those of us who want the elections held and who believe in local democracy will find ourselves in the position that we are pressing to have the elections held but the reform package will not be in place.  It is important that we have information on the timescale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the proposal that Motion 80 be discussed, and I would like the Leader of the House to take note that this can no longer be regarded as the expression of some eccentric opinion.  It now has the explicit support of Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats.  What is being asked for is not the introduction of legislation but the airing of the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what Senator O'Toole said about neutrality.  There is intense public interest in the country at the moment as we approach the Intergovernmental Conference.  People are totally confused <Col N="1938" /> about what terms like &ldquo;security&rdquo;, &ldquo;defence&rdquo; and &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; mean, and in what direction our foreign policy is heading.  In view of the fact that the Assises have just been held in Rome &mdash; and Senator Hussey was a member of the delegation &mdash; it seems to me that the impression given in the press reports is of total confusion.  We need clarification very urgently indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is the festive season, and I see there are a number of young children in the Gallery, may I take this opportunity of thanking Gay Byrne for his very successful campaign in having the gnomes restored to the windows in Switzers.  May I ask the Leader of the House if he has any suggestions as to whether any Members of this House might care to join the gnomes in Switzers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Companies Bill was mentioned by Senator Manning and, indeed, by other Senators also.  The Senators know that the other House debated this matter and it took them roughly three days or thereabouts.  It is concluding in that House today.  As the Dáil has amended the Bill, although it was originally a Seanad Bill it is now deemed to be a Dáil-initiated Bill.  In the normal course, this means that the Bill is set down on Report Stage in the Seanad, and the amendments made by the Dáil to the Bill are treated collectively in one debate.  This type of arrangement works very well.  However, in this case, because of the large number of amendments, which I understand is close to 300, I feel the Whips should work out a convenient way for dealing with that Bill, which could lean towards the wishes of Members to see the Bill adequately <Col N="1939" /> debated while, at the same time, not delaying the passage of the Bill unduly.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of the Members, as I am sure many of them know, the amendments break down, conveniently, into the 13 Parts of the Bill.  When the Whips meet, it may well be that these Parts can be taken <i>seriatim</i> with appropriate time limits that should be agreed.  For the benefit of Senators, I would point out that a list of the amendments made by the Dáil will be published and they will be available early next week.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage the debate is confined to the content of the amendments made by the Dáil, but technically these amendments are not required to be agreed by the Seanad, as they have already been made to the text of the Bill by the Dáil. This would allow the Bill to be taken in the 13 Parts of the Bill <i>seriatim</i> as set out in the amendments.  Whether this should be considered on Report Stage or Committee Stage is something that the Whips will decide.  I stress that they do so in conjunction with the appropriate time limits.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning also asked about Motion 80.  I am aware that up to now there have been votes on the Order of Business on that matter.  The proper manner in which to have debates is to have discussions across the board with all Senators.  I am not impressed by votes on the Order of Business, particularly when there is no chance of them being successful. However, I understand and appreciate the across-the-board support for this matter today in particular and certainly on the basis that we are not going to have another element of, if you like, bully-boy tactics.  It should not happen.  I am certainly prepared, where I see consensus, to press for a debate.  I can assure the House that if that consensus is there, I will arrange for a debate on Motion 80 next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the Companies Bill.  I have given a reply on that.  He also asked what other <Col N="1940" /> legislation we will have before us in the House before Christmas.  I can say for certain we will have the Appropriations Bill.  Personally, I always loved the Appropriation Bill.  I saw it as an Adjournment debate and I can understand totally the point the Senator made. As he rightly said, it must be passed, before December.  We always came back and debated it for a day or two in January. If we can, I certainly would not mind doing what the Senator is saying, if that is possible.  However, we have a fairly long programme before us.</P>
      <P>The Companies Bill will certainly take up a long time.  I have no doubt on that. We also have the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, which was amended in the Dáil, and which was referred to by Senator Norris.  Incidentally, that is being taken here next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>I have noted Senator O'Toole's point about the Appropriation Bill and I have also noted what he said regarding neutrality. Again, I agree it is an issue that is causing quite a lot of debate.  It is something we should discuss.  I cannot say for certain, in view of the large volume of business we have before Christmas, whether we will have a debate on that matter before Christmas.  Certainly it is something I will examine.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton referred to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, as did Senator Brendan Ryan.  I can tell Senator Ryan, who was asking for major legislation, and I can tell the House, that that Bill will be initiated in the Seanad.  My understanding is that it will be published fairly soon, probably early next week.  Because it is a major piece of legislation, when the Senators receive it they might like to think about it, go through it and analyse it.  Perhaps when we come back after Christmas we will have it as one of the first items on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Upton also referred to motion 80, as did Senator Helen Keogh.  Senator Doyle referred to the Altamont Bill.  I can tell her that the law agent is at present dealing with that.  I would like to refer to comments that were made by Senator <Col N="1941" /> David Norris in relation to this Bill in an interview on &ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; on radio on 23 November.  In the course of that interview Senator Norris made the following comments:</P>
    <P>It seemed almost as if there was an attempt to vote this matter through without any sustained discussion at all, that it was to go through on the nod.</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>It was introduced by leave of the Government and the Government intended to let it go through on the nod.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that the Leader of the House is replying. He is free to give whatever information he considers appropriate to the business of this House.  In the context of his reply to Senator Avril Doyle he is giving additional views and information, which I think the House should listen to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris further said on that programme.</P>
      <P>It was felt by a few of us in the Seanad that we would be lax in our responsibility if we just connived at this Bill going through on the nod.</P>

      <P>It is to clear misunderstandings that I want to put the following facts on the record.  There is a separate set of Standing Orders of the Dáil and Seanad relative to Private Business which provide for the promotion and the conduct of a Private Bill through the Houses.  These Standing <Col N="1942" /> Orders are completely separate from the Standing Orders under which public business of the Seanad is conducted on a daily basis.  A Private Bill is promoted for the particular interest or benefit of any person or locality and is introduced, not at the behest of the Government, but by virtue of an application made by a parliamentary agent on behalf of an individual or a group.  In this case the parliamentary agent is Mr. Michael Egan, a solicitor in Castlebar.</P>
      <P>The first Stage of a Private Bill takes the form of an examination of the Bill by the Examiner of Private Bills, who is a civil servant and who reports to the House.  The motion to take Second Stage was moved by Senator Liam Naughten, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, and not by Senator Avril Doyle, as you suggested, who by virtue of his office as Leas-Chathaoirleach has a formal supervisory role in moving the Stages of each Private Bill as it comes before the Seanad.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach is not in charge of the Bill in the same accepted sense that a Minister is in respect of a public Bill. Accordingly, if any Stage of the Bill is opposed, the proceedings are adjourned to another sitting day to allow the agent to brief the Leas-Chathaoirleach, or other Members as the case may be.</P>
      <P>These few facts will, I trust, clarify the situation for all concerned.  They will also bear out the propriety of the decision taken by the Cathaoirleach in postponing the Second Stage debate to a later date to allow further information to be made available to Senators, particularly in view of the reservations expressed by many as to the effect of the passing of Second Stage of this Bill.  I understand that this information will be circulated either through the Leas-Chathaoirleach or through the office fairly soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want again to stress to Senators that they should appreciate that the Government had no hand, act or part in promoting the Bill or no vested interest in restricting the debate of any Stage of the Bill, and allegations to the contrary leave a lot to be desired.  I indicated to the Senators before they came in that if any one Senator on any side of the House <Col N="1943" /> queried or wanted information I made it quite clear that I would &mdash; that it was my duty &mdash; to stall and to ask for an explanatory memorandum, precisely what the Cathaoirleach did as the debate moved on when Senator Joe O'Toole expressed concern.  I remember that debate.  Senator Doyle and Senator Lydon basically supported the thrust of it.  Senator Norris, as I can remember, was a bit like Allanah Machree's old dog &mdash; he went a bit off the road with everybody. Senator O'Toole expressed his concern and at that stage the Cathaoirleach moved in wisely and well.</P>
    <P>I have to say to Senator Norris that I am appalled at the mischievous, opportunistic and almost hypocritical approach the Senator has to some matters in this House.  I want to make it clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Integrity abounds throughout the House and everybody knows that. Senator Norris should apologise to the House, but I do not believe he will.  I could refer this matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but, quite honestly, I could not be bothered.  I ask Senator Norris at this point &mdash; he is a long time here &mdash; to seriously consider amending his attitude to the House and the very decent Members we have in the <Col N="1944" /> House on this matter and indeed on other matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris went on in his query to me about motion 80 on the Order Paper. I have given my reply on that.  I think it is unfair that I should be pressured.  I think the way it is being handled today is beautiful.  I have no objection to it and certainly, as I have said, that debate is on stream.  Senator Norris also asked about the Criminal Law (Rape) Bill and I have replied to that.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney briefly raised a matter on the Order of Business.  Senator Kennedy referred to the payment of social welfare and a debate on that.  I have no plans at this time for that.  I accept Senator Kennedy's point; it is an important matter.  Senator Brendan Ryan referred to the Companies Bill, one piece of substantial legislation which I am very happy we are getting.  He also asked for a debate on the Social Employment Scheme and neutrality.  Senator Seán Haughey asked for a debate on motion 89 on the Order Paper.  I think that is important and we will look at it after Christmas.  Senator Neville asked about the prison service, as indeed did Senator Upton.  I have no plans for this matter at this time and I could not guarantee a debate on it before Christmas.</P>
      <P>On Senator Hederman's question regarding reform of local government, I do not know when the legislation will come through and I am sure at this time I am quite right in saying neither does the Minister for the Environment know when the legislation will be forthcoming. I know reports are still coming on.</P>
      <P>Senator John A. Murphy supported a debate on motion 80, as he did on the question of neutrality.  Senator McKenna asked about the problem in Grafton Street.  All I will say is that I am happy about it.  Senator Cassidy referred to the televising of the Seanad.  I understand they will be on stream as quickly as possible.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Public Charitable Hospitals Acts, 1930 to 1932, and the Public Hospitals Acts, 1933 to 1976, so that unclaimed prize money and accrued interest arising from the operation of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes may be vested in the Minister for Health and disposed of by him in respect of service by certain former employees of Hospital Trust (1940) Limited, the private company which promoted and operated the Hospitals Sweepstakes.</P>
      <P>All of you are familiar with the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  When they were operating, the governing legislation required that, in relation to each individual sweepstake, sufficient funds were deposited to secure the total value of prizes in that sweepstake.  Trustees were appointed to be responsible for these deposits.  Inevitably some prizes, mostly small ones, were not claimed and the parties entitled to these prizes were never identified or did not submit valid claims.  Over the years these funds remained on deposit and, now amount to approximately £480,000, consisting of prize fund deposits and accrued interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, Hospitals <Col N="1946" /> Trust (1940) Limited was placed in voluntary liquidation in March 1987.  In effect, this signalled the demise of the sweepstakes.  The last sweepstake was run in January 1986 and all the company's employees were made redundant in March 1987.  Following that, the trustees of the prize fund deposits indicated that they wished to be relieved of their trusteeship, largely because they felt that few, if any, of the unclaimed prizes would become legitimately payable in the future.  In the circumstances the Government decided that the unclaimed prize money, together with accrued interest, should be taken over by the State and used for the benefit of former employees. Basically, that is why I am sponsoring this Bill.</P>
    <P>The amount of money available for distribution, £488,000 approximately, is relatively small.  Consequently, we have to be somewhat selective in our approach to deciding who will benefit.  For this purpose the former employees can be divided into three broad groups.  First, we have those former employees who completed their service and retired on pension in the ordinary way.  Included in this broad category you will also have short service employees who worked in the sweepstakes for a period and then retired to go elsewhere.  All of these employees received their full entitlement over the years.  They could not be said to be disadvantaged in any way by the closure of the sweepstakes.  Those who are in receipt of pensions are at least as well off now as they would have been had the sweepstakes continued in operation.</P>
    <P>The next group are what I shall call the voluntary redundancies.  These are employees who accepted voluntary redundancy on the basis of schemes drawn up in 1987 and in 1980.  Many of those received the standard non-contributory company pension of about 14 per cent of their salary; plus a top up <i>ex gratia</i> pension element which would bring the pension up to 50 per cent of salary in some cases; plus enhanced redundancy payments paid by the company &mdash; Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited; plus in many <Col N="1947" /> cases the promise of 13 weeks employment every year while the sweepstakes were operating.  When the company went into liquidation the <i>ex gratia</i> element of the pension was withdrawn and of course the promise of 13 weeks employment was no longer relevant.  This group of workers could certainly be said to be disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The final group comprise of what I shall call the compulsory redundancies.  These are the employees who lost their jobs when the company went into liquidation in March 1987.  A total of 147 workers was made redundant on that date and a small number on the days immediately preceding it.</P>
    <P>The compulsory redundancies received only statutory redundancy plus, where the service was sufficient, the standard pension of 14 per cent.  The Labour Court recommmended that something on the lines of two weeks' salary per year of service should be paid in addition. However, these workers never received this payment and it appears extremely unlikely that they ever will.  This compulsory redundancies group has certainly been seriously disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>We have had discussions with SIPTU and various staff representatives and, of course, we have had a considerable volume of representations on the issue. All the views put forward have been fully considered and they have been very helpful in our efforts to divide up this money. It is clear that there are two disadvantaged groups &mdash; the voluntary redundancies and the compulsory redundancies. What we propose to do is to give a flat rate payment of, say, up to £1,000 to the voluntary redundancies.  These are the people who lost the <i>ex gratia</i> element of their pensions.  Where any of them have died the payment will be made to the spouse if alive.  I am afraid that legal difficulties would rule out making payments to any other relatives of deceased persons.  The balance will be shared out between the compulsory redundancies who are still alive.</P>
    <P>Spouses of deceased persons will, of course, be catered for in the same way as <Col N="1948" /> those in the previous group.  However, payments in the case of the compulsory redundancies will be calculated on the same basis as was used to calculate statutory redundancy, that is, weighted according to age and service.  This would be fairer for this group because many had relatively short service.  We will have to be allowed a little latitude in deciding who are in this group, as a number left some days earlier, that is, prior to the liquidation.  In all equity I think that these must be regarded as belonging to this group.  All of these workers will qualify for, I hope, at least 60 per cent of statutory redundancy.  We may be able to put a floor or lower threshold on such payments of possibly up to £500.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that we will have to ask for the submission of claims in all cases. However, we should be able to process them very quickly as most of the beneficiaries are probably located in Dublin. Our aim will be to have as many as possible paid out before Christmas.</P>
    <P>There is one other issue which was a cause of concern, that is the question of taxing these benefits.  My officials have consulted with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners on the taxation treatment of the proposed payments.  The position is that the payments will fall to be treated as payments received in connection with determination of employment which are chargeable to income tax by virtue of section 114 of the Income Tax Act, 1957. However, section 115 of that Act exempts from the charge to tax the first £6,000 of the aggregate of all such payments received by an employee in respect of employment.  In addition, Schedule 3 to the Act provides for the exemption level to be increased up to £10,000 or more in certain circumstances.  Statutory redundancy payments which are specifically exempt from income tax by virtue of section 37 of the Finance Act, 1968, are not taken into account for the purposes of the exemption under the 1967 Act.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, while the proposed payments will be technically chargeable to income tax, it is highly unlikely that any of the former employees of the Hospitals Trust will actually be <Col N="1949" /> liable to tax in respect of the amounts received by them since it is likely that none of the proposed payments will exceed the threshold.</P>
    <P>May I briefly run through the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides that the deposit funds will be vested in the Minister for Health.  Section 3 authorises the Minister for Health to disburse these funds, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Section 4 indemnifies the trustees against future claims.  Section 5 provides for the audit of accounts and their presentation to the Dáil and Seanad.  Section 6 covers any future liabilities which may arise &mdash; these will be met from the Exchequer.  Section 7 provides that future claims against the funds must be made within four years unless some legal disability is established.</P>
    <P>Further sections provide that the expenses involved in disbursing these funds will fall on the Exchequer, that the Sweepstakes Acts may be repealed if there is no longer any need for the legislation, and in that event any moneys payable into the Hospitals Trust Fund shall instead be disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As you will see, the Bill has emerged as a short one which provides a simple and easily managed system to take over and disburse these funds and one which will not give rise to any drain on these funds to meet distribution costs.  I am very anxious, as I am sure is every Member of the House, that these funds be paid out before Christmas.  For that reason I would ask for your co-operation in progressing the Bill to finality as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>In that context I would like to make two points.  First, many people have suggested that the additional funds be made available to assist the former employees specifically from receipts from the sale of the Hospitals Trust Board's premises in Ballsbridge or indeed grants from the Exchequer.  It is not open to the Hospitals Trust Board or to the Minister for Health to direct that the proceeds of the sale of the premises in Ballsbridge be diverted for the benefit of employees of the private company which rented these premises. <Col N="1950" /> Indeed, virtually all the proceeds of that sale have now been used up, the bulk of it in supporting the Health capital programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to Exchequer assistance, many people have suggested that funds should be provided to help the liquidator meet additional redundancy payments which have been recommended by the Labour Court.  Here again, I have to point out that Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited is a private company.  Therefore, neither I nor the Minister for Finance have any function in this matter and there is no action we can take to secure implementation of the Labour Court recommendations.</P>
    <P>While I have every sympathy with the position of these workers, I am sure you will appreciate from what I have said that there is no other way open to the Minister for Health to assist them.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the position in some detail and have no hesitation in commending this Bill to the House.  I would again earnestly urge your full co-operation in progressing the Bill to finality so that the money can be distributed as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>My party will not obstruct this Bill in its passage through the House because we share the concern about the position of the people who have been adversely affected by the liquidation of the Hospital Sweepstakes Trust.  We are naturally concerned for the very adverse position these people are placed in and we, too, are anxious that the payments be made before Christmas.</P>
      <P>The Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes fund was a major contributory factor to the relative success of the health system in the forties and fifties.  The workers in the sweepstakes fund made their contribution to that.  The sweepstakes fund was important in the capital programme and was important at that time in the fight against TB.  That is something that should be remembered and is another reason why the legislation should be passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a couple of points. First, the sweepstakes are no longer in <Col N="1951" /> existence; they have been replaced by the national lottery.  In the current year £10.6 million has gone from the national lottery to health.  Roughly £2 million was spent on hospital beds, £3 million on the elderly, £1 million on the National Social Service Board, £800,000 on the mentally handicapped, £500,000 on child care, £100,000 on AIDS research, and £2.7 million was allocated to health boards.</P>
    <P>Since the enactment of the national lottery legislation many of the voluntary agencies &mdash; the Wheelchair Association and the Multiple Sclerosis Association are, for instance, two organisations with whom I have a personal association &mdash; have had a major problem collecting money.  I am absolutely certain I am not being alarmist in saying to this House that the collections by organisations such as those I have mentioned have been reduced by about 50 per cent to 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that the injection of funds into the health services as a result of the national lottery in no way makes up for what has been lost to the voluntary organisations.  Much of the funds from the national lottery goes to areas other than those which the voluntary groups are looking after.  I would be very personally concerned about an organisation like the Wheelchair Association which does an incredible number of things in terms of back-up of disabled persons in wheelchairs, in organising annual holidays, driving schools, social centres and a range of activities.  I do not propose to list them all to the House because that would be tortuous for the listeners as well as for myself.  I make the point that organisations such as the Wheelchair Association do tremendous work.  Many would argue they are doing work that should be done in the first place by the mainstream health services and by the Department of Health.  Whatever about that debate, I make the point that they are grossly disadvantaged now by the national lottery and it is something I urge the Minister to consider.  It must be a relevant consideration in future that we look at the degree to which we can compensate the <Col N="1952" /> voluntary organisations for their loss of funding through their own internal fund-raising operations.  There is no way that a scratch card or ticket for any of the other voluntary organisations can favourably compare with the national lottery tickets either in terms of promotion, attractiveness, prize funds or whatever. That is something we have to worry about.</P>
    <P>It is slightly extraneous to the discussion today, but only slightly, that we are basically remedying a matter arising from the demise of the sweepstakes and its fall-out for workers and we have to look at the new reality there.  I am basically in agreement that this £480,000 should be distributed among the workers. I broadly agree with the delineation of the degree of need by the Minister.  I would like clarification that there will be favourable or positive discrimination in favour of people who have a long spell of service with the sweepstakes and who at the age of 54 or 55 years are now out of work and are very disadvantaged in terms of the labour market.  It would want to be clear to this House in accepting the legislation that there would be positive discrimination towards a person whose position is now very critical in terms of future employment.  For example, there is a critical difference between a person in their early fifties who is now involuntarily retired and a person in their early and late twenties who would, we hope, be in a position to regain other employment.  I would like a little more clarification on that question.</P>
    <P>We are addressing the question today of channelling the prize fund to the workers who are the innocent victims of the liquidation.  I would like in that context to mention here that £7 million is being lost at the moment to the health services.  It is unfortunate that the £7 million of extra money collected this year will not be available to these services.  I know that in a very strict sense it is not part of the Health Vote for this year, but more vigilance should have ensured that that money would go to a needy health service at the moment.</P>
    <P>On that basis I make the point that we <Col N="1953" /> will be supporting Second Stage of the Bill.  We may come back with other points at later Stages of the Bill.  We support Second Stage in the hope that the money can be paid out for Christmas and that the workers who have suffered so much will in some way have their situations rectified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I commend the Minister and his Department for bringing forward the Bill and their very laudable wish that it would become law and have passed all Stages before Christmas.</P>
      <P>The Minister has laid out the reasons for this Bill; specifically, to amend the Public Charities Acts of 1930 and 1932 and the Public Hospital Acts of 1932 and 1976.  The prize moneys from the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes that have gone unclaimed over the years &mdash; the mind boggles to think that any prize money could have gone unclaimed, but somebody will benefit from it &mdash; may now be transferred to the control of the Minister and may be disposed of by him to certain former employees of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes in Ballsbridge.</P>
      <P>All of us are well aware of the debt of gratitude we owe to these people who for many years gave sterling and dedicated service and then at the advent of the national lottery were made redundant when the company was placed in voluntary liquidation in March 1987.  This Bill is now an attempt in some small way to rectify the injustice suffered by these people.  The proposal from the Government is that this unclaimed prize money, with accumulated interest totalling nearly £500,000, should go to the former employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say at this juncture it is unfortunate that, relatively speaking, it is a rather small sum.  I was not aware of the Minister's address earlier on but I wonder if there is any possibility of augmenting it in any way?  Thinking back to a year or 18 months ago, there was a lot of talk in the newspapers about the actual location of the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes offices and I know they were deemed to be situated on a very valuable site.  There was <Col N="1954" /> a sizeable amount of money generated on the sale of these offices.  I understand what the Minister says now that unfortunately neither he, his Department nor the Government are in a position to take hold of any of the remaining proceeds of that sale.  I was hoping funds such as that could be available so as to make a more meaningful payment to these people.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the national lottery which undoubtedly led to the demise of organisations such as the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  I am the national chairman of GORTA, the freedom from hunger organisation and our organisation has no doubt that the national lottery has had a significant impact on our fund-raising activities.  There are only so many pounds to go around.  The national lottery's gain is a loss to various charitable organisations such as GORTA, Concern, Trócaire and all the other very worthwhile organisations.  I would earnestly request the relevant Minister to make compensatory payments to charitable organisations such as my own, Trócaire and Concern and all the others.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I would also like to say, as did Senator Joe O'Reilly, that the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes did an enormous amount of good work for our hospitals during the years, particularly in the forties and fifties, in the bad old days of TB.  While I appreciate what the Minister and his Department are doing, I wonder if the national lottery has replaced the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes specifically.  I know that the national lottery contributed an enormous amount &mdash; £10.6 million &mdash; to the Department of Health in some form this year but the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes were a rather more specific payment to hospitals <i>per se.</i>  I wonder if there is some way that we could get back to a similar situation?</P>
    <P>To get back to the Bill before us, the Minister is to be commended for his decision that any future liabilities which may arise will be met by the Exchequer and that all expenses involved in the management of these funds will be also paid by the Exchequer.  In other words, as the Minister rightly said, every single penny of this £488,000 will go directly to the <Col N="1955" /> former employees of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  It proves his willingness to ensure that every penny available to him will go directly to the former employees. I take the Minister's point that the employees most seriously affected are those who were in employment when the company went into liquidation and that they should get the bulk of the funds.  We agree with this and Senator Joe O'Reilly agreed with this proposal also.  It would be silly to dilute the funds or benefits so that it would be of no value to any recipient.  Restriction of the payment to those who suffered most from the closure will mean that they, at least, will get a meaningful sum.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I am pleased the Minister is anxious to have these payments made by Christmas.  We in this House should assist him in every way to ensure that this very laudable objective is achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  We will support it and will co-operate with the Minister in his endeavours to get the Bill through the House as rapidly as is possible. It is, of course, a short Bill.  It arises from the appalling treatment which was meted out to the people who worked in the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes, some of them with very long years of service.  The Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes, as a number of Senators on both sides of the House have said, provided a very valuable funding service which allowed the hospital in this country to be built up when funding was very scarce and very difficult to obtain.  The contribution of those funds played a vital role in the fight against TB, and indeed continued to play an important role for a number of years after the TB epidemic has been conquered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All through those periods the workforce in the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes were an absolutely essential ingredient in ensuring the success of the sweepstakes and that is something which has not been given the recognition or attention it deserves.  We find that these people who, in some cases, had given a lifetime of service to the development of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes were thrown on <Col N="1956" /> the wasteheap and were very badly treated financially arising from what happened. I have no doubt at all that they were given a very raw deal.  Some, unfortunately, have passed on to their eternal reward.</P>
    <P>The initiative which is being taken now is welcome but unfortunately as everybody concedes, it does not go the full way.  When I say it does not go the full way, we have to recognise also that these people who worked in the sweepstakes for many years were rather poorly paid and even in the best of times did not benefit particularly well, given the type of work they were doing.  Those who have fared worst of all in the shake-out when it did happen were the 147 or so people who were in full-time employment at the stage at which the sweepstakes collapsed. The Minister has very fairly acknowledged that there was a Labour Court recommendation along the lines that the workers would be given two weeks pay for each year of service and that unfortunately, is not going to happen.  He also indicated there were very serious restrictions and reductions on the pensions which people can expect arising from the collapse.</P>
    <P>The Minister also has made clear that it does not appear to be legally possible to direct the funding from the sale of the site in Ballsbridge to supplement what these workers would certainly be morally entitled to, in my opinion.  While I accept the Minister's view on that, it certainly is very galling and painful for people who had given a life service to the development of the sweepstakes to find that the sale of the site nets £6.6 million and that they cannot get a penny out of it.</P>
    <P>The other point which has been alluded to by a number of Senators is the fact that the decline of the sweepstakes was influenced to a significant extent by the development of the national lottery.  I do not want to join willy-nilly in the quick political fix which some people go for when they say lottery funds for anything; I do not want to go down that road. However, there is a case to be made for the people who worked in the sweepstakes having as it were, their moral <Col N="1957" /> entitlements satisfied out of lottery funds. If that is not possible, it might be possible to introduce legislation which would allow funds in unclaimed bank accounts and similar type accounts for many years which, effectively are dead funds, to be liberated and released to supplement the entitlements of people who suffer very badly because of unfortunate events such as befell the people who worked in the sweepstakes.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Minister's outline of what these people can expect, £1,000 is not a lot of money for those people who have had their pensions diminished and who got only 60 per cent of the statutory redundancy &mdash; a little more than half.  I accept the restrictions under which the Minister is working but we must remember the type of people we are talking about.  Very many of them are elderly people who do not have very many resources and who very badly need the money.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to hear the Minister mention the fact that in effect practically none of this money will be taxed.  That is very welcome.  However, I would sound a note of alarm.  He says it will not be taxed because of the fact that, in effect, it will amount to less than £10,000, the reality is that quite a number of the people who worked in the sweepstakes could legitimately expect to get redundancy money which would be greater than £10,000. While it is welcome that it will not be taxed, it is very unfortunate that the amount of money these people will receive is too small to be taxed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I am sorry and disappointed it does not fully compensate the people who worked in the sweepstakes over the years.  However, to the extent that it makes a gesture towards satisfying their moral and legitimate rights, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Leader of the House, Senator Fallon, who very obligingly gave a commitment that this Bill would be taken before Christmas to allow the people who will benefit to get the money before the Christmas season.</P>
    <P>There is one final point which I find disturbing, that is, the announcement by <Col N="1958" /> the Minister that the people who have claims would have to go through the process of making the claims.  I hope that will not create any great difficulty for them.  I hope the Minister will make every effort to ensure that the making of a claim will be a formality and that every assistance will be provided by his Department to allow them to make the claims rapidly and to formulate the claims.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister, Deputy Treacy, for coming to the House this afternoon with this legislation which is important to a certain number of people.  This ends an era in Ireland, and particularly in Dublin.  I am anxious that the money would be distributed on a basis of need.  I am concerned about the number of references made in the Bill to the Department of Finance or the Exchequer.  I would hope that out of this small amount of money no money will be wasted in administration. As elected representatives, we are aware of the money that can be wasted in administration and I ask the Minister to see that this does not happen.</P>
      <P>I would like to put on record my concern about the large amounts of money that are lying unclaimed in banks, insurance companies, and building societies and all financial agencies.  There should be some way of getting these agencies to tell us as legislators the amounts of such unclaimed funds.  We could find many ways in which they could be employed profitably.</P>
      <P>There has been sadness about the delay in dealing with the employees of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  That is now a thing of the past and I want to thank the Minister.  I am sure the House will do its duty in its usual professional manner and pass this important legislation.  I also hope the former workers will all be identified. Senator O'Reilly made reference to the older employees.  I ask the Minister to see that they are all identified and catered for in an appropriate manner. Senator O'Reilly made reference to that point also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are companies that go out of business and leave employees with <Col N="1959" /> nothing.  I hope that there will be some safeguards in the Companies Bill, to which there has been so much reference in recent times.  It is employees who suffered because the Hospitals Sweepstakes was wound up.  There was a lot of sadness and distress over what happened.  We are aware of the upset caused to families.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to lottery funding. I do not refer to present company but there are people who like to talk about lottery money and what should and should not be done with it and the voluntary bodies that should and should not get funds.  I have chaired the Clare Federation for the Mentally Handicapped for 26 years.  That is a long time and I am not a new recruit to voluntary work.  The lottery has affected our funding.  I say this because I strongly believe that voluntary work in conjunction with the statutory bodies and the Departments of Health and Education has worked well.  I pay tribute to the Minister for Health and to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for the extra money granted to the mentally handicapped, although we could well do with more.  I thank them because I am aware of what was done for the mentally handicapped down the years.  The national lottery has affected the money given to voluntary organisations because, as some of my colleagues have said in addressing this legislation this afternoon, there is only the same amount of money to go around.  We have felt the upset of that.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 3, may I say I have a horror of the clause, &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo; in legislation.  Section 3 provides that the Minister for Health may do something with the consent of the Minister for Finance. I have no trouble at all with the present Minister for Finance; he is great, but there are some boys in the Department and when I see &ldquo;with the consent ....&rdquo;  I start worrying.  I ask the Minister to make sure that those boys down there do not get their hands on any of the money that should go to the former employees of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1960" /> I also want to pay compliment and to thank the Minister for putting in section 9, which provides that expenses incurred in the administration of the Act shall, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas rather than out of the undistributed prize money.  He is here again.  It is not really Albert Reynolds; it is the boys in the Department.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for introducing this legislation.  When we deal with health legislation here, regardless of the flak and all hell flying outside about what service is available and what service is not available, it is nearly always the same Senators who take part in the debate.  There is an across-the-floor unanimity and a common sense approach to the legislation.  Out there there are workers waiting for the few pounds that will come out of this Bill and nobody in this House will delay its passage.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Treacy, for introducing this legislation which is important to many families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this important Bill &mdash; the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Bill, 1990.  As other Senators have pointed out, the basic purpose of the Bill is to amend the various Public Hospital Acts which were passed in the period 1930-1976, so as to enable the unclaimed prize money spanning over a period of 60 years and the accrued interest arising from the operation of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes, to be taken over by the State and to be vested in the Minister for Health and used for the benefit of the former employees, particularly, as the Minister of State has indicated here today, those former employees in the compulsory redundancy groups.  Over the years these funds remained on deposit.  Now, with interest, the Minister of State has indicated they amount to about £488,000.  Indeed much of the £488,000 that is available for distribution is interest on the prize money. I hope, like Senator O'Reilly, that this legislation will have an expeditious passage through the House so that these funds can be paid out to the former employees, <Col N="1961" /> who, as all the speakers have indicated, are so worthy and deserving of these small payments; and that these payments will be made before Christmas.</P>
      <P>Ever since the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes was set up in 1930 and the Irish Hospitals Trust was set up in 1940 they have carved out a very special place for themselves in the history of this country and indeed in the history of Irish hospitals and Irish medicine.  They have made a very significant and important contribution to the promotion and development of our health services.  I would like to pay public tribute to all the former employees who down through the years have made an outstanding contribution to the development of our health services. Indeed, without the dedicated and committed staff the Irish Hospitals Trust and the sweepstakes which they ran would have been nothing.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to section 9 of the Act.  I would like to welcome the assurance given by the Minister in the Dáil that the cost of the administration and distribution of these funds will be met by the Department of Health and not out of the moneys that are now available.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would also like to welcome the clarification that has been given by the Minister here today in relation to the taxation treatment of the proposed payments, particularly in relation to sections 114 and 115 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  If the occasion arises, I hope the Revenue Commissioners will be generous with these recipients and that they will not be liable for income tax in relation to these payments.</P>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in paying tribute to all concerned in the running of the sweepstakes over the years, particularly the dedicated staff.  I hope the Minister will make every effort to ensure that these payments are made before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister and the Government on its introduction.  The Bill, as has been stated already, will allocate outstanding prize <Col N="1962" /> moneys not collected to the staff who were made redundant and to pensioners.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay my tribute to those associated with the Hospitals Trust and the sweepstakes.  They brought the health service out of the 19th century and into the 20th century and have played a great part in developing a proper and adequate health service.  It is unfortunate that we have seen some dismantling of that health service over the past few years.  We look forward to a change in that and a change in attitude towards the health service and in ensuring that proper funding is made available to ensure that there will be the health service our people deserve and should have available to them.</P>
      <P>I also wish to pay tribute in particular to the employees of the Hospitals Trust and to empathise with them in their trauma of being made redundant.  I am sure most of them joined the Hospitals Trust with the expectation that they had a job for life.  It is unfortunate that when an organisation like the Hospitals Trust, a private organisation, goes into liquidation adequate funds are not there on occasions to give the employee's just compensation for having been made redundant.  It is unfortunate that the Labour Court recommendation &mdash; an independent body arbitrating or recommending payment on the basis of what they see as just &mdash; was not implemented. Pensions are something that people look forward to; it is part of their remuneration and part of their right and when they are cut off it is very traumatic for the people concerned who feel rightly aggrieved that they will not receive a benefit which they assumed would be theirs in the event of the discontinuance of their employment or, as in the case of most of them, on their retirement.</P>
      <P>That having been said, the approach that has been taken by the Minister is to be welcomed.  No provision will be adequate to meet the full justice of the employees' situation; it will not meet the Labour Court recommendation but, that having been accepted, we must welcome the fact that some semblance of justice is being given to the employees and to the pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> I welcome the fact that the Minister has clarified that the cost of administration will not be paid out of the fund. We welcome the fact that the £488,000 will go in total to the employees.  My party and our spokesman has indicated our support for the Bill and I am glad to add my voice to that.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House.  It is an indication of the concern of Government and the Minister for the former employees who left their positions, some at some disadvantage and some at a very little disadvantage.  It is an indication of where the Government stand and the caring nature of the Government in this matter.  This little windfall could quite easily have been tucked away in the finances of the Government in some little slot, drawer or corner but the Government took on board the issue of distribution.  Indeed, while the payment is not a major amount of money &mdash; indeed the whole sum is relatively small &mdash; it indicates that there is public awareness and a caring approach by Government to the people involved.</P>
      <P>I want to be associated with the expressions of thanks to the Minister regarding the introduction of this Bill to the Seanad and I want to compliment him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill before the House and our spokesman, Senator O'Reilly, has pledged our party support for the measure and that we will facilitate its rapid progress through the House.  I hope that as quickly as it goes through the House moneys will be paid to the various individuals involved.  In principle we support the Bill but I would like to raise a few matters in relation to it and relevant matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Hospitals Trust, how it closed down and the fact that quite a number of people were left in difficult financial circumstances.  Some of them, unfortunately, are currently drawing unemployment assistance and were not <Col N="1964" /> fortunate to get alternative work.  Others, thankfully, were more fortunate and did get work.  The decision to award the national lottery to An Post was the death knell for the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    <P>I want to commend the Hospitals Trust Fund and the individuals who were involved in its throughout its years, those who directed it and all those who worked and participated in it both at home and abroad.  In former days most of the moneys came from America and in ways it was a lottery which nearly preceded its time in relation to the moneys raised and the many hospitals who were assisted. At times there has been a begrudging attitude towards some of the people who were directly involved in it and much criticism was directed their way. However, without their foresight, work and vision many of the hospitals and health services which we take for granted today would not have assisted.  It is important, even at this late stage, that that should be put on the record.</P>
    <P>The reality is that when the franchise for the national lottery was awarded to An Post it sounded the death knell for the Hospitals Trust Fund and the people involved took a realistic attitude.  Certain criticism can be directed at that decision but given its success and with the right approach, anybody could have made it a success.  I believe that the Hospitals Trust Fund would have been the right body or group to run it.  Nowadays when there is much talk about social justice; it certainly was not a socially just decision to award the franchise for the national lottery to An Post.  While An Post have made great progress, in relation to horses for courses or sticking to what they should be doing, the Hospitals Trust Fund would have been the correct group to run a national lottery.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the national lottery has been a great success but at whose expense?  Obviously, moneys has been raised and given out but there is no doubt that many of our hitherto renowned charities have been affected in various ways and some of the those charities perform vital works.  Today there were St. <Col N="1965" /> Vincent De Paul carol singers at the Bank of Ireland in College Green.  They have obviously been affected in relation to the contributions they collect and they do a lot of work, particularly at Christmas time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Lotto; will the Minister ensure that it is being run on an orderly basis because there seems to be an inordinate number of jackpot carryovers which, of course, means that more money is spent.  Obviously, some people will spend more when it is carried over or when they think the prize is going to be bigger.  All of us would secretly harbour an ambition to be a millionaire, on paper or otherwise.  Will the Minister assure the House that there is no question of the Lotto being tampered with in any way.  That is important for its successful running.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister also give a categorical assurance as to how lottery funds have been spent?  We certainly do not want it to be any sort of a slush fund or election fund for his or any other party particularly coming up to local elections or a general election.  It is important that community groups and community interests be reflected in how the money is spent and that there are clear decisions and guidelines so that the people who spend the money will get some return, either in their area with some facility, or in the general region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, I am glad you brought me back within the range of the Bill.  In relation to the number of people benefiting &mdash; I understand under compulsory redundancy that about 147 people are benefiting and then there are so many spouses under the other group &mdash; will the Minister indicate the total number of people who will benefit and how much he expects them all to get?  I welcome what he has said, that most of them will not be taxed.  It would be a hypocritical attitude if people who have been left badly off indirectly through the <Col N="1966" /> establishment of the national lottery should see their sum further reduced. Will the Minister indicate how many people are involved?  I was talking to a former worker and a number of 600 was mentioned.  Will the Minister give a breakdown of that number?  Will the various groups be treated any differently in relation to the amount they receive?  As the Minister correctly and aptly said, those covered under the compulsory redundancy were by far the worse off and it is important that that should be considered.  Some of the proceeds from the sale of the property could have been put towards helping them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that there are certain difficulties and he mentioned the difficulties in relation to the Labour Court. I accept what he said but some way could have been found of giving an <i>ex gratia</i> sum or some sort of a payment which would have assisted these people.  The Minister mentioned something about legal difficulties and I would like him to expand on that when he is replying.  Will the Minister make a special effort to ensure that as far as possible the people who have been identified are paid forthwith? Will they have to apply, or provided they and their spouses have been identified, will the payments be made forthwith?  What process will be used? Will the Minister &mdash; and I am sure he is concerned &mdash; ensure that the payments are made as soon as possible?</P>
      <P>Basically I support the Bill.  However, I regret that more was not done in the past for those workers, a small group, who were badly affected by the establishment of the national lottery.  The fact is that one great success and benefit to the country resulted in a group, albeit a minority group, suffering severely.  I support what Senator O'Reilly said and the various other points he made in his thought-provoking contribution and I look forward to the Minister making the payments speedily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister for introducing this Bill.  I have had many representations from former employees of the Irish Hospitals <Col N="1967" /> Sweepstakes and I know they will be very happy about the introduction of the Bill and also hopefully they will get the money before Christmas.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Irish Hospitals Trust Fund for the work they did over the decades in providing valuable funds for the Irish health service.  At the time, the money they provided was badly needed for the building of hospitals and the development of the health service. My grandfather, who was Minister for Health for many years, was a great supporter of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes and as Minister they helped him out on many occasions.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill provides a mechanism to transfer unclaimed prize moneys to the former employees of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes. Unfortunately, the sum involved is small and the ex-employees will not receive much money.  The conditions in which the former employees worked would not be acceptable today.  This must surely go down as a case in Irish labour history that should never be repeated.  I appreciate that the Minister for Health and other Ministers, such as the Minister for Labour, were unable to provide moneys from the Exchequer.  I am delighted they found some way of compensating the employees, small though it is, for their many years of work.  I welcome the Minister's wish to have the money paid out before Christmas.  This is a very humane approach and I know everyone will co-operate in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I want to make a point which was made by Dr. Hillery in the Dáil when he said that the case of the Hospitals Trust underlined the need for secure well-funded pension schemes where contributions were made to fund such schemes.  He also said that there were still too many companies where pensions were paid out of current payroll, leaving employees particularly vulnerable when these companies went out of business.  I support those remarks as they are very important and I hope they will be taken on board by the Minister for Labour.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the <Col N="1968" /> Minister on finding some avenue to help the former employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  I note the Minister said that he wishes a speedy passage for this Bill through the House today and I am quite certain that will happen.  Everybody welcomes this measure.  It is timely and I am particularly glad that the Minister has indicated that although there will be a fair amount of administration involved, there is an intention on the part of the Government to pay out as many people as possible before Christmas.  That is a worthy objective.</P>
      <P>I wish that something similar could be done for the people protesting today outside the gates of Leinster House about the SES schemes.  I understand they have been deprived of a Christmas bonus.  I do not want to be too niggling but this is another example where it would be possible to look at this matter.  It is a very useful exercise in our democracy that people continually engage in peaceful registration of their point of view and brief Members of the Oireachtas as they come in.  I am glad to see the Minister making a note.  I could be incorrect and if I am I am sure that he will, in a very courteous way, put me in my box.</P>
      <P>I would like to be slightly contentious and introduce another analogous matter, the question of Irish Shipping.  Here, again, are people who have given the State a good deal of service and have not yet been rewarded in the way they should be.  They have been deprived of their pensions and basically have been flung on the scrapheap.  It would be inappropriate to go into the merits of the case because I understand that to a certain extent it is <i>sub judice.</i>  I hope the Government will look at this matter and do the decent thing with regard to the people in Irish Shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly happy to speak on the question of the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Bill.  Of course, it was not a grandfather of mine who introduced the original Bill and I cannot make the substantial claim that Senator Ryan was able to make.  However, I was brought up in <Col N="1969" /> Ballsbridge, I remember the sweepstakes office very clearly and I remember the women who worked there.  I often spoke to them at bus stops.  They were extremely decent, conscientious, hard working people.  I have to say, however, that because of the times that were in it when I first knew them in the fifties, the conditions of employment &mdash; and of course they were very grateful for the work &mdash; were not great.  Their salaries were very low but were a valuable supplement to a household income or for someone who was widowed, as were many of those women.</P>
    <P>Claims of the statutory redundancy of 14 per cent put the matter in perspective. Fourteen per cent of a tiny income is very little.  The Minister has indicated that the sum of money that can be disbursed in this matter is also small.  Senator Ryan also referred to this.  I understand that it is less than £500,000.  That, shared between some hundreds of people, will be very small beer indeed.  The Minister indicated a scale of priorities and I do not envy him in having to make this sort of judgment. It is a judgment of Solomon to a certain extent but he is convincing in his arguments that a proper system of priorities has been established in this instance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sum of money, £480,000 of small unclaimed prizes going back to 1930.  I would like to echo what Senator Cosgrave said with regard to the possibility of some additional financing.  This is very small money.  It is notable that the sweepstakes to a certain extent have been replaced by the national lottery and the national lottery has been successful way beyond the wildest dreams of anybody, including the people whose brainchild it was.  Is it possible that some small allocation could be made from lottery funding to make a worth-while contribution to the lives, in retirement, of those people who worked so hard over many years?  I say that particularly because the building in which they worked and the site on which the main office existed was always a very valuable site.  It became considerably more valuable as a result of suburban developments in the Dublin 4 area and <Col N="1970" /> particularly because of the closeness of access routes into Dublin, especially the DART.  This site was sold recently for an enormous sum of money.  For technical reasons this money accrued to the Department of Health.  I wonder if the Minister will be able to tell us if some of this money from the sale of the workplace could be given back to the workers who maintained that building.  That would seem an appropriate device to use, that moneys generated by the sale of the workplace ought to go back to fund pensions for the workers.</P>
    <P>I will not talk at any great length about this Bill except to welcome it, to congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill but, typically, to end with just a little cavil which I hope will save the Minister's reputation as a grammarian.  In his speech the Minister says: &ldquo;the final group comprises of what I should call the compulsory redundancies&rdquo;.  It would be more grammatically accurate to say: &ldquo;the final group comprises&rdquo;.  There is a confusion of number and the introduction of an unnecessary preposition.  I am sure the Minister would not wish his reputation to be blemished.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly made a very wide-ranging contribution as spokesman on behalf of his party.  Many people blame the national lottery for the demise of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  That charge is frequently made.  It is reasonably clear that, in fact, the growth of state lotteries in the United States of America, Canada, <Col N="1971" /> Australia and elsewhere was the cause of its demise and Senator Cosgrave referred to this.  The final blow was dealt when the state lottery in California was established in the latter half of the eighties.  At that stage union sources were claiming that over 40 per cent of sweepstakes ticket sales were made in California but when the lottery was established in California that 40 per cent was eroded.</P>
    <P>The national lottery did not and could not have caused the demise of the sweepstakes. They went into decline because of international competition abroad. Eventually and, ultimately, the managing company of the sweepstakes, Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited, went into liquidation on 16 March 1987.  Our own national lottery did not start their sales of tickets and other products until May 1987, two months after the liquidation. Therefore, it could not have affected the sweepstakes in any way.</P>
    <P>The national lottery has hugely benefited organisations helping the mentally and physically handicapped and other voluntary and statutory organisations like the Irish Wheelchair Association who received £300,000 to date and the home care attendance scheme.  The Multiple Sclerosis Society received £86,000 for respite care.  The national lottery has assisted all of those and other organisations in developing community-based services and this could not be done without the lottery.  A number of Senators referred to the various funds that have been distributed through the lottery to the various organisations.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly, and other Senators, raised the question of service.  I want to assure the House that the moneys will be allocated on the basis of age and length of service.  There are two distinct groups. The group who had retired before the liquidation and whose pensions were not up to standard, got only 14 per cent of their pension instead of 100 per cent and we propose to give them a flat rate across the board of £1,000.  The other group, about whom Senator Norris spoke in such grammatical terms, comprise those who were forced into redundancy based on <Col N="1972" /> age and length of service.  Some of those people were a very short time with the company but others had long service.  We hope to give them a flat rate of a minimum of £500 and, based on age and length of service, some of them will qualify for up to £4,000.  They are the group who lost everything.  They lost their jobs, they lost their redundancy entitlements and had no recourse.  They are the people who are really disadvantaged and we hope to be generous to them.</P>
    <P>On the question of numbers which Senator Cosgrave mentioned, 147 people were made redundant through the liquidation on 16 March 1987.  A few days prior to that, three or four people had left and they were also affected because they had expected to be compensated.  They did not get the compensation so we must include them in a round figure of about 150.  There were about 200 others who took voluntary redundancy and did not get a proper pension.  In all, we are talking about 350 people.  The figure of 600 has been mentioned.  That would have been the total number of staff employed by the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes throughout their duration. Obviously, those who had retired in the normal way could not be disadvantaged or affected so we are not proposing to give any money to them.  The group who were disadvantaged as a result of leaving and their pensions not being paid as a result of the liquidation of the company &mdash; there were no resources to meet that pension fund &mdash; and the group who lost their jobs as a result of the liquidation are the two disadvantaged groups with whom we intend to deal.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly also referred to the surrender of £7 million.  This has been talked about a lot in the past week and has alarmed the public, as if the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, and myself took £7 million and went back to the Minister for Finance and said: &ldquo;We are good boys, Minister, we have come back with £7 million&rdquo;.  That is not the position and it is totally unfair to misrepresent the legal <Col N="1973" /> position, the accountancy and appropriations position and what the Constitution imposes on the Government of the day and on the public service at large.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to be in the Department of Finance with my colleague, the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Ray MacSharry, when we brought in a special tax amnesty for people who were in tax difficulties. We also brought in what was called a preliminary tax.  The money that has been mentioned was arrears of taxes that were paid as a result of preliminary taxes. Consequently, there was a PRSI health charge and, as a result of that, in the normal accountancy appropriations position, the Revenue Commissioners transferred the health contributions to the Department of Health.  A Government Department can only spend the amount of money voted to them in a budget or Supplementary Estimate.  As a result of that, we had no option but to accept the money as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The Constitution makes it obligatory on any Government Department receiving money in appropriations-in-aid to return it to the Exchequer in the normal accountancy way.  The money came in as appropriations-in-aid and there was a percentage of PRSI contained in the preliminary tax and arrears of tax payments. We could not touch that money. It was not voted for our Department.  We had to account for it because it went through our books.  Consequently, it went into the Exchequer.  It must be shown and appropriated in the Exchequer because the Constitution is very strong on accountability and appropriations.</P>
    <P>In no circumstances did we return money that we got to the Exchequer.  It came from the Revenue Commissioners, through our Department, and went back into the Exchequer in the normal way. We did not return moneys voted by the Oireachtas in the budget or a Supplementary Estimate to the Exchequer. We spent every &ldquo;bob&rdquo; of it.  We went to the House last year and introduced a Supplementary Estimate for £35 million to keep the services running and in order <Col N="1974" /> to improve services.  Anybody who says otherwise is misrepresenting the position, alarming the public and creating an unnecessary fear among the people that we are not discharging our honourable, financial, medical and health responsibilities.</P>

      <P>It was referred to and I have to respond to all the points.  With regard to what Senator Upton said, we have to put an advertisement in the paper and invite people to complete the claim forms.  We do not envisage that this will cause any considerable delay.  The reason we feel we should advertise is, first, there <Col N="1975" /> are many people who do not realise they are eligible for benefit.  Secondly, the lists we have from pensions trusts and the liquidator may not be fully up-to-date.  A problem we see emerging is that some of the people may have moved residence and others have emigrated as a result of the 1987 liquidation.  Consequently, while we have their names we do not have their locations.  I gave a commitment in the Dáil that where we have names and addresses we will communicate with them and inform them of the position. However, in order to be fair we want to ensure that everybody is made fully aware of the position and in case they have transferred residence the advertisement will be placed.  They may then make their submission, which will be considered. Also, if we divide the money among the 150 or 151 people who may qualify for payments, we may find that some are deceased and have no spouse, or some have moved from their residence. The money may get into the hands of somebody for whom it was not intended, to the detriment of others who would be deserving of it.  We want to be absolutely certain that there is a <i>de facto</i> bona fide person to give that money to and when we confirm that situation, we will divide the money.</P>
      <P>I have covered the situation pertaining to the numbers, and the employment numbers.  Senator Cosgrave asked for an assurance that there was no tampering of any type with the national lottery.  I have no personal responsibility of any type with the national lottery, but I am absolutely satisfied that the lottery is properly and professionally run.  Questions of this nature were catered for in the Act and are handled by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very obvious safeguards built into the operation of the lottery: accountants are always present and there are several other safeguards.  This, indeed, was the whole purpose of the national lottery legislation, so I am absolutely satisfied that the lottery is being run to a very high standard in a professional way. I do not think there is any tampering or &ldquo;upping of the ante&rdquo; to ensure that there <Col N="1976" /> is a high, accumulated prize at any time. You will notice, at times, when the jackpot is not won and the figure reaches a certain target, the lottery company adds on money to bring it up to an even greater figure to ensure that the prize money is there and is attractive to the people.  If there was any tampering with it, they would not be adding on the money, so I am very satisfied that this is the position. If the Senator wished to take this matter up with either the lottery company or the Minister for Finance, either the company or the Minister would be delighted to respond, but I am absolutely satisfied that everything is in order.</P>
    <P>If there is any point I have omitted, I would be pleased to respond to it. Senator Norris talked about the social employment schemes, which have no relevance to this situation.  The only thing I can say on that is that you cannot say that people who are confined to an unemployment situation and who cannot get work or do work because they are on the unemployed live register should be deprived of a Christmas bonus, while those who have the opportunity to work should be in the same situation as those confined to the dole queues or the unemployment situation.  They get major bonuses for working, much greater than those who are unemployed.  They have a week in lieu every second week to work and earn whatever they wish without impinging on their rights to collect the same money that week.  It is ironic that somebody who might have been responsible for creating the social employment schemes and creating the system was out today protesting with them.  I hope this confirms the situation.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank everybody who contributed to this debate.  I am very grateful for their co-operation.  I am confident that with their continued co-operation we can ensure that these funds are disbursed between now and Christmas.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the Bill, especially as I was not here for Second Stage, which went through more quickly than I expected.  Section 2, which provides that the funds should be vested in the Minister for Health, is seemingly a very innocent, logical and sensible section. I am suspicious, as a matter of principle, that any funds should actually be vested in the Minister for Health or in any party politician at all.  There is a case to be made in regard to all funds of this sort, and the national lottery, which Senator Cosgrave so rightly raised, that these funds should not be vested in the Minister for Health or in anybody who is subject to the normal sort of pressures which politicians are subject to.  They should be vested in an independent body, a public trustee or an independent trustee.  It seems we are too loose and cavalier about always placing these funds in the hands of the Minister.  There is a very good case that funds of this sort &mdash; and there is a parallel between this and lottery funds &mdash; should be vested in someone who is not subject to the pressures that politicians are subject to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for his comments and ask him why it was not felt possible for the Government to put this in the hands of someone who would not <Col N="1978" /> be subject to the sort of suspicion and the pressures which a politician can be subject to and is subject to in cases of this sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I could respond by saying that it is politicians themselves who create the suspicions about their colleagues. I have no difficulty whatever in discharging my duties as Minister of State in the Department of Health in an impartial manner.  Neither has the Minister for Health.  Some of the colleagues here in the front benches of the Opposition clarified the contribution made by the hospital sweepstakes to the health area.  When funding was short at the start of this State over the years in the thirties, forties and into the fifties, the sweepstake was of major benefit in providing capital funding for buildings and other facilities for the health area.  As the sweepstake was designed to help in the health area, it was felt that the funds of the trustees should be transferred to the Minister for Health to be administered by him on behalf of the people who were employed there and whose joint and collective efforts made a key contribution to providing and administering resources for health capital expenditure over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not quite answered the question which I put to him.  I understand what is happening.  I understand the reasons why it is happening, but what I have not got from the Minister is any reason why funds of this sort should not be taken outside the political arena.  The moment funds of this sort are distributed by a politician, they are subject to suspicion, not just from politicians but from the public.  I know the Minister said that there would be very strict criteria about distributing this money.  I do not doubt for a minute that the present Minister for Health and past Ministers for Health and Ministers for Finance are absolutely unblemished on the issue of integrity, but as a principle the Government should consider &mdash; and not dismiss, as the Minister has just done, <Col N="1979" />&mdash; that funds of this sort which are discretionary, despite the criteria which the Minister spelled out but which are discretionary within those criteria, should be taken away from politicians and given to people who are not subject to that suspicion.  I am asking the Minister what is his objection, not just in the national lottery which is a public scandal, as a general principal, to giving these to people who are not subject to political pressures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I could respond to Senator Ross by saying that this is a political forum.  We are not vesting money in any political forum.  We are vesting money in the Minister for Health.  If money was to be invested in a politician, be that politician the Minister for Health or another politician, then the Minister for Health would be named; it would be a named person.  However, we are vesting money in the Minister for Health as the head, on behalf of the Government, of the public health service department. He is the head of that collective department and his agents in the Department of Health will distribute the money. The undistributed funds are held in the name of trustees appointed by various hospital sweepstakes' committees.  The trustees have agreed, in fact, that the money will be taken over by the Minister for Health.  The purpose of this section is simply to enable the Minister to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) was inserted to ensure that the money would not have to be taken into the Exchequer extra receipts, which I have already referred to &mdash; the Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash; and then voted to the Minister for Health by way of Supplementary Estimate.  This would be a very tortuous, arduous and protracted procedure and would deprive the people who need and deserve this money from getting it quickly.  When vested, the Minister for Health will be able to distribute the funds.  There will be no charges attaching to the funds for issuing and administering the cheques.  The payments will be fully audited by the Auditor and Comptroller General on behalf of <Col N="1980" /> the State.  The accounts will be presented to the Oireachtas.  If we were to transfer the moneys to some other authority or body, we would have to provide for their administration, vouching, accounting and for whatever reports would have to be put together in order to do this.  Consequent on that there would be a reduction in the small amount of money available to these people.  To save administration, the State will carry that in the normal Health Vote.  The Minister is there as a representative of Government in a public service Department to distribute these moneys to people who worked for an organisation who contributed to the capital expenditure needed many years ago for the Department of Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister is saying.  Maybe he should consider something else.  What the Minister is saying is that they have to be vested in the Minister for Health for reasons of practical expediency.  It is something which should be understood.  The Minister also said that it would be very expensive to employ somebody to distribute these funds.  I am not suggesting for one moment that there is a full-time job for one person involved in distributing these funds.  The Minister is giving me an opening here that maybe a public trustee should be set up to look after funds of this sort and then we could include funds from the national lottery as well.  We could include funds from other areas where somebody, ultimately would have to be subject to the Minister for Finance.  It should be someone who could stand in the public arena, be subject to public scrutiny, and make firm recommendations in public to the Minister about the distribution of funds of this sort.  The criteria could be spelled out in public and be subject to public scrutiny. It would be much harder for any Minister to come back and say, &ldquo;no, we are not doing it&rdquo;, without giving a very good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about the public perception of those who distribute public moneys, and why they distribute them. There is definitely public concern about <Col N="1981" /> this and I do not think it just comes from politicians.  This may be a very minor Bill in the macro-economic picture, but there is a principle involved there.  There is a public concern about any discretionary funds, especially of a charitable nature like this, which are distributed by politicians. The Minister should consider the suggestion that funds of this sort should no longer be directly administered by politicians.  They should be managed by people who are independent of political parties and who can make a public issue and public recommendations about how they distribute the moneys.  The Minister could consider this idea and not dismiss it completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only concern is that the money will get to the people concerned before Christmas and many of them are very anxious about this.  I would like to ask the Minister whether setting up the distribution of the funds will take time.  Will the people get the money before Christmas?  That is what people are concerned about, not the points Senator Ross is making.  Senator Ross is the person who is making the people concerned.  I was not aware that people were concerned about the way any politician is distributing money.  I think the Senator has a vested interest in his stand on many issues by making people concerned about these issues and by pretending that they should be concerned about the way money is distributed.  I do not see any problem.  I do not hear anybody talking about it.</P>

I am glad that it is earmarked for the health sector.  I find the remarks of Senator Ross surprising.  They seem to me to be the absolute negation of democracy. That is what we are about here.

As the Minister, Deputy Treacy, has clearly stated, this money is vested in the Minister for Health.  Like Senator Eoin Ryan, the only concern we have is that this legislation will be cleared here this evening, properly and absolutely correctly by us as legislators, and that the funds are given to the families who are to get the money.  If Senator Ross was living in the real world like us as politicians elected by the real people and not by those who elect him, he would know that the couple of quid is needed in the homes of the families who were former workers of the Hospitals Sweepstakes.</P>

The two or three main political parties have served this country well and will continue to do so.  We are not here to rush through legislation.  The request was made by Senator Upton that this Bill be brought to this House and a request was made to the Leader of this House that that be done.  We co-operated, as a responsible Government.  We brought the Bill in here.  We are not debarring anybody from contributing.  We are not rushing anything through.  We will vouch for all moneys and appropriate them in the normal, proper manner.  What Senator Ross is suggesting is something for financial and fiscal policy &mdash; more financial than fiscal.  It is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  While I can consider anything, it is not for me to be able to respond and say: &ldquo;Yes, we could do this, that or the other.&rdquo;  The trustees requested, after the liquidation, that they be relieved of their duties and that they had no further function.  We considered that in the normal legal, financial manner.  We felt <Col N="1985" /> that the advice from the Attorney General and the Department of Finance was most appropriate and that the proper thing to do was to have this vested in the Minister for Health.

      <P>Section 3 leaves it open to the Minister for Health, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to decide how exactly he will dispose of the available money on foot of service with Hospitals' Trust (1940) Ltd.  I clearly outlined that in detail in my Second Stage speech here.  The Minister for Health did likewise in the Dáil.  Basically, what it means is that the Minister for Health will make certain proposals to distribute the moneys taking into account the age and the level of service of former staff of Hospitals Trust (1940) Ltd.  I believe he will consult with the Minister for Finance on this matter and have the moneys distributed accordingly.</P>

    <Title>Equality of Education: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Jackman on Wednesday, 28 November 1990:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the failure of the Minister for Education to ensure equality of educational provision for all students irrespective of the sex, and Socio-Economic background of the students, and calls on the Minister:</P>
    <P>(a)  to make available the required number of teachers to reduce the size of classes to reasonable levels;</P>
    <P>(b)  to provide specialist teachers for remedial work, guidance counselling and other specialist areas at both Primary and Post-Primary levels;</P>
    <P>(c)  to provide modern educational facilities in all schools including Science and Language Laboratories, Physical Education Facilities and Technology rooms;</P>
    <P>(d)  to eliminate all sub-standard school buildings;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1987" /> (e)  to extend the second level school cycle to six years so that all students can avail of a six year cycle;</P>
    <P>(f)  to provide educational specialist support for educationally disadvantaged students;</P>
    <P>(g)  to provide support for teachers through a comprehensive system of In-Service Education; and</P>
    <P>(h)  to provide adequate funding for all schools enabling them to provide an education of equity for all students.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that almost 20 per cent of the overall provision for net Government Expenditure on Supply Services for 1990 is allocated to Education</P>
    <P>and commends the Minister for Education:</P>
    <P>for keeping education policy under ongoing review;</P>
    <P>for ensuring high quality broadly based education for all ability levels during the compulsory cycle of education;</P>
    <P>for increasing resources in order to cater for the needs of pupils with educational difficulties;</P>
    <P>for reform measures which encourage and facilitate pupils to continue in full-time education after compulsory schooling in programmes suited to their aptitudes and abilities; and</P>
    <P>for ensuring the participation of concerned interests in the development of the Irish education system.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just had enough time last week to welcome the Minister <Col N="1988" /> for Education to the House.  Since I knew that she would not be in this week I wanted to say nice things to her and, in fact, I was, perhaps, too effusive in my praise.  The Minister certainly looked as startled as if I had made an elopment proposal.  It is instinctive in the Minister to think that the Independents will be critical.  I meant it when I said that I think the Minister is a vigorous, hardworking and sympathetic Minister for Education. I liked her speech.  The Minister did not insult us by reading out the speech in detail, which is a terrible waste of time, but very intelligently summarised its main points and added some others as well.  The Minister referred to the forthcoming Education Bill and had some interesting things to say about that.  I am sorry the Minister is not here today but I am glad to see our old friend, Minister Calleary, here.</P>
      <P>It is particularly appropriate that education should be highlighted in this vocational assembly &mdash; vocational in theory &mdash; where teachers are so remarkably represented.  The proposer and seconder of the motion are both teachers and the two leading speakers on the Government side are also teachers and there will be others to follow.  My own interest is very much part of my whole brief, and I recall my close association with the ASTI for some years before I went on to third level.  We are very fortunate to have in the House two distinguished officers &mdash; the president of the ASTI, Senator Costello, and the secretary general-designate of the INTO, Senator O'Toole.  That is a very welcome conjunction of talent at the highest level. In that context the Minister's suggestion that we should have regular educational debates was particularly welcome.  We should take the Minister up on that and get her confirmation that this should be the primary House for debating education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all in favour of the proposal forms which are mentioned in the motion.  It is like being against sin.  I cannot imagine anybody not wanting a better teacher-pupil ratio and so on.  I pay tribute to the sincerity and commitment of my friend, <Col N="1989" /> Senator Mary Jackman.  It is difficult not to conclude that a party political game is being played here to a certain extent. There is a sense of <i>deja vu</i> in looking at that motion and thinking that it could have been put down in identical terms by Fianna Fáil some time between 1983 and 1987 and that you would have an identical amendment welcoming progress on the part of the then Government Senators. After all, there is no profound difference in educational philosophy between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or, indeed, between any of the Members in this House.  We all agree on the desirability of reform. We would all love to spend money on such reform and it would be, moreover, a very popular thing to do.  The argument beyond that is simply point-scoring.  I deplore the fact that this subject should have to be approached in a fractional way and that there will have to be a vote at the end of the debate.  Our memories are short.  We recall that in 1983-87, it was Mrs. Gemma Hussey who was then the ministerial arch-scrooge in educational spending.  As I say, there is a sense of <i>dejá vu</i> here in seeing the same thing happen again.</P>
    <P>I am in sympathy with the details of the motion.  I am also in reasonable sympathy with the specifics of the amendment, except that I am totally puzzled as to what &ldquo;concerned interests&rdquo; mean in the final section of the amendment.  That is certainly vague &ldquo;... ensuring the participation of concerned interests in the development of the Irish education system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I agree with nearly all of the points of the motion except, again, if I may be critical of item (h) in the motion which says that adequate funding should be provided for all schools to enable them to provide an education of equity for all students.  That, if I may so without offence, is so general as to be totally meaningless &mdash; in other words, we want an educational utopia.  That is what that means, and I am all for that too.  But that would not get us very far.</P>
    <P>There is such a wealth of expertise here on education &mdash;I mean up-to-date expertise, people who are <i>au fait</i> with the <Col N="1990" /> details of the position in primary and post-primary schools &mdash;that I have no intention of covering the well-trodden grounds here.  As I say, we have great talent, we have virtually an <i>embarres de richesses</i> here between all the people I have mentioned.  There is little need for speakers to cover ground already well known.  For example, the ASTI have produced this excellent brochure called <i>Facing the Facts</i> in which much of the statistical information presented by speakers up to now is already covered, on inadequate buildings, prefabs, pupil-teacher ratio, etc.  I take it that all Members of the House are acquainted with this brochure and with the campaign which has currently been mounted by the ASTI, another stage of which developed on 28 November last when the ASTI launched a survey on the staffing, funding and facilities in second level schools, as reported in the press the following day.</P>
    <P>There again the details are well known &mdash; the dropping of subjects, the level of voluntary contributions necessary to keep things going, the appalling situation about prefabs and so on.  I have only one fault to find with the ASTI booklet and that is a pedantic but, I would hope, a justifiably pedantic point, that on page 5 there is something about which they should know better.  They use a phrase &ldquo;less teachers&rdquo;.  It is all very well for the popular press to talk about &ldquo;less teachers&rdquo; but I would expect the ASTI to remember that the proper adjective there is &ldquo;fewer&rdquo;&mdash; a word which is so strange now as to not merit any recognition.</P>
    <P>The argument I would pick out myself would be improving the pupil/teacher ratio, which, as we are reminded, is not only good for children but good for teachers as well.  In the INTO <i>Tuarascáil</i> of November 1990 reference is made to the anger which exists among young teachers in the country who cannot get jobs because of the disastrous pupil-teacher ratio.  I would remind the House that that anger is by no means confined to this side of the Atlantic.  I was in Boston recently talking to a number of young graduates, some of whom were working <Col N="1991" /> for peanuts at a very low level of teaching in the parochial school system, which simply does not pay, more of whom are doing all kinds of menial jobs, and who feel betrayed by this country and by the deficiencies of its educational policy. That is something I feel strongly about.  If I may offer an entirely improper personal note, my daughter is one of those emigrants and I am not immune from the anger she directs at the Establishment in this country.</P>
    <P>I regret the dropping of subjects.  I think more could have been made about that.  There is an impoverishment in the curriculum, representative of the fact that subjects have to be dropped, notably, perhaps, political studies.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the in-service item and point out that our universities are moving in that direction now and that adult education in our university in Cork has been transformed into taking care of continuing a second chance education with a large programme for in-service there.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to welcome the Minister's mention of the forthcoming Education Bill.  I hope that the preliminary papers &mdash; green or white or whatever colour &mdash; will be well debated in this House, where they should be properly debated.  I congratulate the Minister for this enterprise.  Many of us had been pressing for the introduction of an Education Bill for a long time.  It is more than a matter of tidying up.  It is more than a matter of rationalising approaches.  It is even more than a matter of putting legal sanction on what have been up to now very dubious methods of running education through Government circulars.</P>
    <P>Above and beyond all those necessary reforms, what the Education Bill, I hope, will do is take education out from closed doors into the area of public scrutability and public control.  There may be many people who are like that, and I do not mean the obvious ones.  From an item in the media the other day it seemed that not all the powerful teachers unions are in favour of the Education Bill, which <Col N="1992" /> leads me to suspect that when we list off the vested interests who have been colluding behind those closed doors &mdash; the Civil Service mandarins, the bishops, the religious leaders and so on &mdash; we should also take into account powerful union leaders because they are not terribly enamoured of the idea of being subjected to public accountability as well.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will face up to all these problems on the long road down to the actual legislation of the measure.  I hope she remembers that this is now a changed country.  Our society is a totally changed society, for good or ill.  The Minister will be applying this legislation in a very different society from the early days of the State and I hope she recognises that all the children of the nation, irrespective of religious belief or practice, are entitled to equal opportunity in the areas of teacher training and teacher employment.</P>

      <P>Since I became a Member of this House I have been asked at various times how I reconcile the previous comments of the Progressive Democrats about the redundancy of the Seanad with my presence in it.  Of course, the answer is very simple: I am committed to exploring whatever potential the Seanad offers. I am equally committed to stating unequivocally when I see the Seanad being used for pointless table thumping.</P>
      <P>I have been a teacher, so I read through the eight sections of the original motion and I am in agreement with every single one of them.  Yes, of course we should have more teachers to reduce class sizes; of course we should eliminate all substandard school buildings; of course, we should provide adequate funding for all students.  If the Senators sponsoring this motion want to come along with any more lists of unassailably valid aspirations I would be for them too.  I would be for a peaceful solution to the problems of Northern Ireland.  I would be for the ending of the Gulf crisis and I would be for the abolition of poverty, homelessness, depression and prejudice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will all of that agreement on those obviously desirable things bring? <Col N="1993" /> Nothing much, because we live in a world of financial constraints, we live in an Ireland which is beginning to come to terms with the limitations of the money available for public spending purposes. Against that background this motion, using a topical illusion, reads like a letter to Santa.  It is a &ldquo;give me&rdquo; letter &mdash; give me this, give me that, give me the other. It assumes the Minister for Education has been doing nothing to achieve the objectives reasonable people would be seeking.  That is not true.  The Minister has not been inactive or passive.  Her plans, which were announced last week, to create a central Education Act indicate she is thinking deeply about education and its place in the national thought process. That is something that I welcome, and I am not alone in saying this.  I would like to add that the Progressive Democrats sought that type of approach and have asked for such an Act to be formulated and then implemented.</P>
    <P>What worries me at the moment is that we tend to say &mdash; and the IDA indicate it in posters all over the world &mdash; that we have a highly educated young workforce. That is true.  We know all the statistics about how many electronics graduates Ireland produces each year and we are very focused on the achievers, so that we have developed a points driven mentality about education.  My fear is that we have developed a points driven mentality about youth in general.</P>
    <P>If one was to monitor the national newspapers for a year one could come away with the impression that young Irish people did very little else except cram for points and for where those points would take them.  We have spent the last decade congratulating ourselves on how young people are no longer condemned to the permanent and pensionable box.  It is arguable that we are putting them now in a worse box &mdash; in the points box.  At least the bright academic ones who make it into the points box are in a box which is highly regarded but what about those who do not make it into the points box? What about the ones who go to schools baffled by the notion that free education is a marvellous benefit to them and who <Col N="1994" /> learn one lesson loud and clear while they are there, which is how to be a failure?</P>
    <P>In a points driven educational system that is inevitable.  From early on, the nonacademic student is loosing self-esteem. They do not feel they belong.  They do not feel they matter.  They do not feel they can affect or change things.  For too many of our students school is like a foreign country.  They come from homes where there may be no books, no family cycle of academic success.  They move into a place where it is all books, more than a stone of them to carry to school every day.  Not only that, but it becomes clear to them quickly that they have either got to perform academically or they have got to perform in sporting terms.  If they cannot make it in either field, then they begin to slip through the mesh.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there are too few remedial teachers.  Ideally, the situation should be that every school has access to the services of a remedial teacher according to its needs.  At second level there are far too few career guidance counsellors. It is vitally important that students under pressure have someone who is not completely interested in their marks, in their points, but has some interest in them as people and who sees some potential in them other than exam success.  We could argue about the minimum number of guidance counsellors that are required per student.  It is too easy to suggest that there is a formula of numbers that will solve our problems &mdash; take X number of students, add Y number of guidance counsellors and all will be well, because all will not be well.</P>
    <P>We talk of Ireland's educational system as if it were some bland common unity right throughout the country and that is not so.  Teaching in some areas of Dublin is radically different to teaching in other areas of Dublin.  Teaching in any of our cities is different to teaching in rural areas.  Teachers will tell you that. The pupils cannot tell one that because they do not have the experience of different places, different approaches.  To suggest that what will work in Tallaght will work in Askeaton is naïve.  We have <Col N="1995" /> to develop an educational system that is responsible and flexible.</P>
    <P>A school in an area of high unemployment, where several generations of many families have never had third level education or a satisfying career, is dealing with a completely different set of expectations from a school in a wealthy suburb here in Dublin.  The staffing levels and approach of that school should respond to the real needs of students, not just to the global requirments of a points-driven system.  We should be flexible enough to have a higher number of remedial teachers in areas of greater need, not to get everybody up to the level where he or she can enter the points race but to get everybody comfortable with the idea of learning and to allow students to learn how to learn.  We have to stop addressing the educational system from the top down.  It is unacceptable that we should be patting ourselves on the back for the numbers of graduates we produce while at the same time the exact same system is turning out functional illiterates who, if they are lucky, may end up in a FAS training scheme, being taught the basic skills of writing a letter of application or making a telephone call.</P>
    <P>We must also stop addressing the educational system in too long a time frame. It has been acknowledged that Ireland in the past has had an abominable track record in teaching languages to young people.  That nettle has been grasped.  We are teaching some languages in a better way than we did in the past, so students are getting at least the basics of a spoken language.  Of course, we should have more language laboratories, especially when we consider the likelihood of increased mobility in the workforce after 1992.  The situation is that at the moment we are teaching French and a scatter of other languages.  We are not saying things such as the unification of the two Germanys, are going to have a profound effect on Europe.  This is going to change the economy of the entire Continent.  It is going to change the industrial base of the Continent.  The language is going to become much more important than it has <Col N="1996" /> been in the past.  Therefore we need to have many more students becoming competent in the language of the fairly immediate future.  That is what I mean by flexibility.</P>
    <P>Education is certainly the leading out of potential and an exploration of knowledge, but it must also be an inculcation of the skills and capacities needed in the real world.  We have not on any side of this House being creative enough in finding ways to make it more responsive. It is very sad that the director of the Industrial Development Authority has to say publicly that there are not enough graduates of particular disciplines to meet the needs of companies intending to set up in this country in the next few years.  It is even sadder that there was such a &ldquo;shrug, shrug&rdquo; response to his comments from people who, like the proposers of this motion, claim to care about education.</P>
    <P>Every single demand in that motion is about money.  It is a call to throw money at our educational system.  It is a suggestion that money is all that is required.  I reject that.  Money is not all that is required, and this is the type of thing that we should be looking at under the aegis of this new Education Bill.  We require flexibility, innovativeness and openness. We need to find out from students what they want and what they hope for.  We need to find out from parents what they want and hope for.  Education is not just about buildings, teachers and points. Education is about giving a sense of possibility, a feeling of self-worth, a message that Ireland values or cherishes all the children equally, whether they are academics or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a couple of speakers since I came in.  They have more or less denigrated the motion as though what is in it is self-evident and that we are all in agreement with it and, therefore, that we should not bother raising it.  I, on the other hand, regard the motion as being very important.  We should ensure that we hammer home the message that, if the issues in this motion are not being met by our educational <Col N="1997" /> system and are not being addressed by our Department of Education or by a Minister for Education, it is important for us to emphasise that.  Even if it takes repetition, we should certainly do so because all of the issues that feature in this motion are exceedingly important. They are essential to the education of the children of this country.  If we do not address them then we are failing in our duty.  I would not under any circumstances cast any doubt, suspicion or aspersion on the motion but I would say: let us face up to it; let us prioritise what is missing in education and let us deal with it.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy spoke about the Education Bill and its importance.  I would agree entirely.  It is important that we do have an Education Act.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have a commitment to an Education Act and it was part of the last Programme for National Recovery.  No doubt it will be continued in the forthcoming one.  My own union have a committee working on it at present.  We are concerned also that education as it has operated in the past by administerial diktat and by ministerial circular going around to schools and not coming before the Houses of the Oireachtas, should not continue.  You need a firm, legal statutory framework for the operation of the education system.</P>
      <P>It is many a long year since we saw legislation on education coming before this House or before the other House.  I do not think that is good enough.  We certainly do welcome consolidation of various developments that have taken place in the education arena.  Of course, we must also ensure that certain matters that are negotiated by the trade union movement in terms of pay and conditions remain sacrosanct because they are part of the working conditions.  They were negotiated and that is the normal role of the trade union movement and of the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday we had an historic date in terms of teacher unity.  The inaugural meeting of the three teacher unions heralded the beginning of an era when all of <Col N="1998" /> the education bodies will be together. The trade union movment &mdash; the INTO, the ASTI and the TUI, consisting of in excess of 40,000 teachers &mdash; will speak with one voice for their members, obviously in terms of pay and conditions but also in terms of the professional role of their members and in terms of the question of a better deal for education in all its forms for the pupils, for the school and for the system in general.  That it will be a major boost to addressing these issues that are here before us in stark fashion.</P>
    <P>My union have been conducting a campaign over the last eight months to draw attention to some of the areas that are identified here.  We seek to prioritise education among our services in this country.  Our concern has been that there is a crisis in education.  That crisis is not necessarily of this Government's making, it is of successive Governments' making throughout the eighties.  There has been a decline in educational provision in relation to staffing and resources over a period of almost a decade.  As a result we are in a serious situation at present, leading to demoralisation within the education system and threatening the high calibre of product for which our education system is internationally known and through which our business sector sells this country to the world. We attract business and muiltinational companies because of the labour market, because of the high quality and flexibility of our workforce.  The danger is that that may no longer be the case, and that is our concern.</P>
    <P>The reason for that I attribute largely to what I have called in other fora the three Rs &mdash; the three wrongs in our system.  The first one of those is class size. We have allowed our classes to grow enormously large with the result that we have the largest class sizes of any other country in Europe at present.  The survey that the ASTI conducted indicated that at post-primary level there are in excess of 30 pupils in two-thirds of the classes in the country.  That is an enormous number.</P>
    <P>Classrooms such as these were <Col N="1999" /> designed, very many of them in the late sixties and seventies, for much smaller classes when the pupil-teacher ratio was considerably less than what it is at present.  There are young men and women from 13 to 18 years of age in classes numbering more than 30.  It is impossible to give individual attention to students in those circumstances.  How can we talk about giving fair and equitable attention to an individual pupil who is in need of specialist attention in those circumstances?  It is not possible.  We have, in all, one teacher for every one of 170 pupils who is in need of specialist care and attention in educational terms, as a result of disadvantage of one type or another.  That is an atrocious statistic, but that is the statistic that exists in our education system at present.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to have a free education system yet virtually every school in the country is involved in fund-raising or collecting funds from parents.  The voluntary contribution, as it is called, is one of the most compulsory things in this country.  Every parent is expected to make a voluntary contribution. That contribution is not for luxuries; it is for essential services in the school.  To my mind that is a disgrace and a scandal.  We already pay through a very heavy and burdensome tax system for the services but money is demanded from parents again, a second demand for education provisions, for essential services in the educational arena.  That is not tolerable.</P>
    <P>Facilities have suffered in many schools as a result of the inadequacy of funding.  Let me say also that <i>per capita</i> we spend less money per pupil than any other country in the EC.  Our expenditure per pupil is roughly one-half that in the United Kingdom.  That is not good enough and it means, of course, that parents have to make contributions.  It also means that facilities are inadequate, that schools have no laboratories or libraries.  The survey we did showed that 20 per cent of post-primary schools had no library.  Can you imagine teaching the <Col N="2000" /> new junior curriculum in English without a library when the whole focus of that very worth while initiative in curricular development is to ensure that pupils have access to a broad range of books, projects, assignments and practical work? A school library would provide a more flexible system of education rather than the simple rigid textbook we all had throughout the school system.  New methodology and a new curriculum and syllabi are being provided and they are being undermined because the Minister has not provided the resources for dealing with it.</P>
    <P>In this day and age 28 per cent of schools have no gymnasium or physical education facilities.  That is unacceptable. Fifty three per cent of the schools we surveyed at post-primary level over the last eight years have lost subjects from the curriculum.  We are talking about a comprehensive system of education, about expanding it; about developing a curriculum and we find that there has been a loss of subjects, not just of Latin or Greek but in critical areas: in the sciences, in modern languages.  Twelve per cent of schools have lost modern languages as subjects.  Yet, here we have the Minister for Education talking about the enormous provision she is going to make in modern languages.  Twelve per cent of schools have lost business education subjects and 11 per cent have lost science subjects.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to be competitive in the modern world.  In January 1993, we will be operating in full competition with all the other countries in the EC. Remember, it is competition.  We will be expecting our youngsters to compete in the same way.  They are supposed to be proficient in modern languages.  People in the industrial and business sector speak about the need for proficiency in languages.  Yet, how many schools have a language laboratory?  Just a handful of schools have language laboratories.  In the context of Europe, we are at the bottom of the league in relation to the cycle of post-primary education.  We have a five year cycle.  Every other country in Europe has a minimum of six years and <Col N="2001" /> the average in the rest of the EC combined is 6.9 years.  In the context of our competitiveness that will be a major problem.</P>
    <P>There are many inadequate school buildings.  Forty per cent of schools have prefabs.  Obviously that is a major area that requires to be redressed with modern buildings in the context of the new health and safety legislation.  That could be a very serious matter facing the Department unless capital funding is provided in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>In terms of recruitment we find that in the post-primary sector this year only 10 per cent of teachers who qualified with the higher diploma got jobs; 90 per cent of those who qualified got no permanent jobs; 10 per cent got permanent jobs; 50 per cent got part-time jobs; 20 per cent got jobs in England or elsewhere and another 20 per cent simply went to other areas or are unemployed.</P>
    <P>There are two other points I would like to address briefly.  One is the question of in-service.  In-service is something that is virtually non-existent.  We have no national framework for in-service. Tremendous work is being done by teacher centres around the country but they are operating on a shoestring.  If they prove themselves over a period of time, they might get a small grant from the Department of Education.  There is no staffing, no secretarial or research facilities, no provision for seconding teachers for work and research.  All of these facilities exist across the board in Northern Ireland.  There is no facility either for short term in-service for teachers or for longer-term retraining.  That is a serious disadvantage in our educational system.</P>
    <P>In relation to the introduction of the junior certificate, we were promised three days by the Minister for Education. We have not got a single one this year. Again, the Minister reneged on a commitment she made on 19 November to introduce a day of in-service before Christmas.  She has now reneged on that and it is not going forward.  I would like an answer to that.  Teachers are preparing for the junior certificate; they have been promised some in-service; we have not <Col N="2002" /> got it.  Why have we not got it?  I would like to know the reason.</P>
    <P>My final point is in relation to the junior certificate.  I applaud the initiative that has taken place over a period of time in introducing changes in the curriculum at junior certificate level and in future we will be working for the senior certificate. These will be radical changes, the first major changes in the history of the country.  However, there are major problems of resources and staffing and now because of the <i>ad hoc</i> approach, we find ourselves with a major problem regarding assessment where the Minister embarked on one course of assessment initially and now in mid-stream, half-way through the introduction of the junior certificate, she has changed her mind.  Everything has been thrown into chaos and confusion. Teachers do not know what is happening, pupils do not know what is happening. There are 40,000 pupils who will be doing their examinations in June 1992 and here we are mid-way through the course without any sample papers, without any direction, without any focus as to where the courses are going.  We want an answer from the Minister to that.  It is not good enough to initiate curriculum reform without underpinning it with the resources and without ensuring that it is developed on a proper, logical, structured framework, not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to address that point and particularly the latter two points: why have we not got some in-service &mdash; the short term in-service we were promised, the national in-service that we need &mdash; and how it is that the Minister is suddenly changing her mind and creating chaos in relation to the assessment of the provision for the junior certificate which is due to be examined in 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa mo bhuíochas a ghabháil as ucht seans d'fháil chun labhairt ar an rún seo.  Aontaím leis an leasú atá curtha síos agus lena dúirt an tAire an tseachtain seo caite i dtaobh díospóireacht ar chúrsaí oideachais a thionscnú le linn gach seisiún.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to the contributions that <Col N="2003" /> have been made here this evening and I must say I agree in the most part with what Senator Keogh and Senator Murphy have been saying in relation to the motion.  It would smack of political opportunism, that you list a set of demands and the impression conveyed is that absolutely nothing whatsoever is being done.  It is understandable that the Government would reply by putting down amendments because in actual fact nothing could be further from the truth. While the individual speakers that I mentioned have not suggested by any stretch of the imagination that everything is absolutely perfect, one has to recognise that there is a great deal of work being done.  It is important that we would write that into the record and reiterate some of the statements that have been made in relation to the whole area of education.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, the financial allocation for education in 1990 was almost £1,400 million and that represents more than 6 per cent of gross national product and almost 20 per cent of net Exchequer expenditure on non-capital services.  It is no harm to point out that the corresponding figure in 1986 was just 16 per cent.  By any measurement that is a huge amount of money and shows the commitment to education by the Government.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government is to provide a broad education for all ability levels, with special emphasis on those children who are disadvantaged.  In the post-primary area a numerous schools which have had bad accommodation have been replaced or upgraded.  I am not suggesting that any sector or any school should have to accept bad accommodation. There is a very major effort being made by the Minister for Education to upgrade all schools and it is not fair to say that nothing is being done in that area.  It is a priority of Government and will remain a priority of Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to the junior certificate.  Pupils are now in their second year of the new junior certificate programme. The Senator said that there were radical proposals and that it was <Col N="2004" /> a completely new direction.  The person who is responsible for that is entitled to receive congraluations and recognition. One has to recognise that major developments like that take time.  You just do not decide tonight that there will be a new programme, a junior certificate of education, and tomorrow have everything in place.  It must be recognised that difficulties will arise that cannot be foreseen and that must be overcome.</P>
    <P>The programme for the junior certificate is broadly based and incorporates the existing group certificate and intercert curricula and the emphasis is on practical development in as many subjects as possible.  That is to be welcomed.  A great deal of work has been done in the development of a new senior cycle curriculum which will provide for a wide range of aptitudes and abilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also announced that a working group will report shortly on the general question of assessment and certification of second level vocational training programmes with a view to the establishment of a national system which will set a frame of reference for employers for evaluation of certification and about the uniform approach to the certification.  That is an extremely important development.  That announcement received a very good response and widespread approval at a recent conference in Malahide, which was attended by people from the RSA in England, from the City and Guilds of London and from a number of certification bodies.  It is only appropriate that in that area we should have our own body for national certification.  I look forward to the time when that is in place and there will be a uniform approach to certification.</P>
    <P>The Minister also introduced a vocational leaving certificate programme in September 1989.  This two-year course gives a student a grounding in specific technological areas plus a modern continental language and, very importantly, work experience.  There is also the second chance education under the VTOS for adults over 21 who are unemployed for 15 months or more.  Also, resulting from talks under the auspices of the Central <Col N="2005" /> Review Committee, 175 concerning posts for disadvantaged areas were provided, plus a number of others to VECs where the schools were the &ldquo;only provider&rdquo; in their area and the pupil-teacher ratio was reduced to 19:1.</P>
    <P>Everyone would love to see the pupil-teacher ratio reduced to a very low level but we have to cut our cloth according to our measure.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to the local contribution to schools and said that, on the one hand we pay substantial amounts in income tax and then we have to pay a local contribution to education.  Inherent in that is the suggestion that taxation should be increased.  I do not think anyone on this side or the other side of the House would suggest that income tax should be increased for the PAYE or any other sector.  It is generally agreed that income tax is far too high.  The question is where will all this money come from in order to increase allocation?  It has to come from somewhere and that is a fact that must be recognised.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned on numerous occasions that she is very anxious to improve the pupil-teacher ratio and to provide the option of a six-year cycle for all post-primary schools.  In that connection, I was delighted to hear the Minister refer to the fact that some schools are using the transition year solely for the purpose of a three-year leaving certificate cycle, which is totally against the purpose for which the transition year was designed.  As the Minister has indicated, the transition year was for the students to find themselves and to develop and that there would not be any emphasis on examinations or anything of that nature. I was delighted to hear that the Minister was taking that matter in hand and that unless the transition year is used for the proper purpose, the school concerned would not be funded in respect of that year's programme.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator Murphy saying that he would look forward to the day when all schools would have public accountability.  In that connection I want to refer to a Bill that was introduced in the other House in the name of Fine <Col N="2006" /> Gael, who put down this motion on education.  It was introduced by the then spokesman on education, Deputy John Bruton, who is now leader of the Fine Gael Party.  I refer to the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Bill, 1990 which sought to remove the appointment of teachers to vocational education committee second level schools from the committees and to replace those members by a local appointments commission. I was a member of the Standing Council of the IVEA and also a member of the Teachers' Union of Ireland.  I want to compliment the Minister for Education on the stand she took in the other House in relation to that Bill and to say that, thankfully, in their wisdom the other House rejected the Bill.  If Deputy Bruton wants to improve the lot of Fine Gael, I would suggest that he should re-appraise his attitude in relation to the whole question of local democracy. A slur was being cast on the members of vocational education committees and there were unfounded allegations of political interference in the appointment of teachers.  They have cast a slur on the whole vocational education committee system of education that has served this country so well down through the years.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that Fine Gael did not consult with their local representatives because, from speaking to the members of the vocational education committees, I know it is those members who are the most vociferous in condemning any attempt to take control away from the vocational education committees.  The implication in that proposal was, that all teachers in the vocational education committee sector are in some way inadequate and not capable of doing their job.  The reality, of course, is totally different.  The professionalism and dedication of vocational teachers has made an outstanding contribution to the development of our second level education system and has ensured that thousands of students who otherwise would not have received the opportunity could avail of the chance to further their education and with outstanding results.</P>
    <P>There is never a vetting system of <Col N="2007" /> students who attend our vocational education committee system.  We have an open door for everyone and it does not matter, creed or colour, they are all welcome.  There are no entrance examinations, no testing of ability.  The vocational education committees have always taken special pride in caring for the disadvantaged.  That is recognised everywhere in the educational sector. The system caters for the less advantaged. Down through the years persons who did not get the opportunity to get second level education anywhere else turned to the vocational education committees and they came up trumps for them.  For that they have to be complimented.</P>
    <P>I take exception to the implied suggestion that I, as a vocational teacher, was appointed through some political influence or pressure.  I was employed by a vocational education committee when the Fine Gael and Labour had control of that committee.  I could never say that any political bias was used against me or against any of my colleagues.  That Bill has done a great disservice to local democracy and particularly to the members of Fine Gael, many of whom have made outstanding contributions to vocational education by serving on vocational education committees. Because there is public accountability, the vocational education committee system is fair game to any would-be knockers whose accusations are groundless. When was the appointment of a secondary teacher questioned?  There is no public scrutiny of any kind in secondary schools.  Everything is done behind closed doors, as Senator Murphy has said.  Who decides what teacher is appointed?  I do not know but I would like if the people across the floor of the House would tell me.  Who decides what teachers are appointed in the secondary schools?  Why pick out a particular sector where there is public accountability, where everything is up front, out in the open and where local democracy operates? I take grave exception to that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the announcement of the <Col N="2008" /> Minister last week in the debate about education, I take great pride in the fact that at a special conference in Jury's Hotel last Saturday the Irish Vocational Education Association discussed a document, <i>A Blueprint for the Future</i> in relation to the development of education. We are first in the field in relation to this development and the structures of local education authorities.  I hope that education will be developed into the nineties and the next millennium.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to say those few words.  I welcome the announcement of the Minister of the proposed discussions on the Green Paper on education resulting in a White Paper in 1992.  I hope that as a result of that, all interests will come up trumps and show exactly where accountability is, the one sector that has public accountability, that has done a tremendous job for the country and for the less advantaged should be due recognition.  Individuals should not knock it at every opportunity.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis seo a fháil cur leis an méid atá ráite ag mo chomhleacaithe ar an taobh seo faoi chúrsaí oideachais.  Ag éisteacht leis na Seanadóirí a labhair anseo anocht agus an oíche cheana, cuirim ceist orm féin an mbainim leis an chuid seo den saol beag nó mór, nó an gcónaím in áit ar a dtugtar Gaeltacht nach bhfuil aon bhaint aici le cúrsaí oideachais atá á bplé anseo anois agus le tamall anuas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhíodh caint uair amhain i leith cúrsaí oideachais go rabhthas ag iarraidh go dtiocfadh Santa Claus isteach chun cabhair a thabhairt.  Is féidir liom a dhearbhú don Teach nach bhfuil aon Santa ag tabhairt chúnaimh do chúrsaí oideachais sa Ghaeltacht agus nach raibh sé riamh ann. Le blianta fada anuas bhí an Ghaeltacht ag plé leis an Roinn Oideachais agus mar gheall ar an stádas atá ag an nGaeltacht ó thaobh na teanga de, bhí siad ag iarraidh ar an Rialtas go mbainfeadh eisceachtúlacht le ceist oideachais sa Ghaeltacht, mar gurb í an Ghaeilge an chéad teanga a bhí acu uilig ansin, agus gurb í an chéad teanga a bhí acu sa chuid eile den tír ná an Béarla, agus go raibh <Col N="2009" /> an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil ag cuid mhaith acu siúd freisin.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Seanadóir Costello faoin churaclam nua.  Múinteoir bunscoile a bhí ionamsa chomh maith, agus sa bhliain 1969 nuair a tugadh isteach an curaclam nua bunscoile ní raibh réiteach dá laghad déanta ag an Roinn Oideachais ag an am le go bhféadfaí a leithéid a sholáthar don Ghaeltacht.  Ní raibh socrú ar bith ann oiread agus téacsleabhar amháin a chur ar fáil.  Tháinig cuid againn in iarthar na tíre le chéile agus cheannaíomar sean Gestetner.  Thosnaíomar ag athrú leabhair i nGaeilge agus iad a chóipeáil agus a chur ar fáil do scoláirí na Gaeltachta. Tharla sé sin breis agus scór bliain ó shin. Nach aisteach an rud é, tar éis an méid ama atá imithe agus tar éis an curaclam nua a bheith ann &mdash; ní churaclam nua níos mó é &mdash; níl aon athrú bhunúsach tagtha ar cheist téascleabhair na Gaeilge.  Mar sin tá an gasúr Gaeltachta agus na scoileanna Gaeltachta fágtha gan téacsleabhair Ghaeilge agus Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Le taispeáint cé chomh dáiríre is atá an Rialtas faoin cheist seo, caithfear a rá nach bhfuil aon tsuim ag an Roinn Oideachais i dtéacsanna.  Níl pingin rua acu le caitheamh.  Bhí go leor Seanadóirí romham ag caint faoi chearta oideachasúla. An bhfuil a fhios ag an Teach cé as a dtagann an cúpla pingin suarach a chaitear chuile bhliain ar théacsanna i nGaeilge do scoláirí na Gaeltachta agus do scoileanna atá ag múineadh trí Ghaeilge sa chuid eile den tír?  Tagann sé ón chrannchur náisiúnta.  Pé scéal é, bhí an Roinn Oideachais ag taispeáint go raibh freagracht éigin orthu, ach anois níl aon phingin fanta sa Roinn le haghaidh téacsanna Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>An bhliain seo caite tugadh £450,000 don obair sin, agus táimid ag braith go huile agus go hiomlán ar an gcrannchur náisiúnta.  Bhí tráth ann nuair a bhí meas ag an Roinn ar an nGaeilge agus ar an nGaeltacht agus suim acu i scoláirí a chur siar chun na Gaeltachtaí leis an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Feicim arís nach bhfuil aon phingin fanta ag an Roinn le caitheamh ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge.  Táimid ag maireachtáil ó bhliain go chéile ag braith ar dhea-mhéin mhuintir na hÉireann, a <Col N="2010" /> bpinginí a chaitheamh sa chrannchur náisiúnta chun airgead a sholáthar do mhúineadh na Gaeilge, sna Gaeltachta</P>
    <P>Is léir do chuile dhuine go bhfuil droim láimhe tugtha ag an Roinn Oideacha agus ag an Rialtas don cheist seo agus nach mbeidh airgead ag teacht níos mó di ach i bhfoirm íocaíochtaí ón gcrannchur náisiúnta.  Is cuma leis an Rialtas faoi mhúineadh na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltact agus sa Ghalltacht.  Déanadh tagairt anseo d'easpa leabharlanna agus rudaí eile.  Tá rudaí i bhfad níos measa san iarthar, maidir le cúrsaí taisteal scoile. Fágtar iad taobh amuigh de na scoileanna agus iad feannta, fuar fliuch.  I gCloch na Rón, cur i gcás, ní foláir do mhinibus amháin ceithre aistear a dhéanamh chu gasúir a thabhairt abhaile.  D'impigh m ar an Aire Stáit sa Teach seo anuraidh minibus eile a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na n-oileán a bhí ag freastal ar an gCeathr Rua.  Dúirt sé nach bhféadfaí é seo dhéanamh agus go raibh an córas a bl acu a chomh maith le haon chóras eile s tír.  Tá áthas orm gur athraigh sé a intin i mbliana agus gur ghéill sé dom.  Is mait liom an duine atá in ann a intinn a athr anois agus arís.  Tháinig sé ar an athr intinne de thoradh brú mór a chuir cui againn air, cé gur dhearbhaigh sé anuraidh go raibh an córas sách maith.</P>
    <P>Is é mo phríomh phointe ná go bhfu an Ghaeltacht fágtha ar an ngannchuid Tá gá le breis airgid a chur ar fáil do réamhscoileanna nó naíonraí atá fíorthábhachtach do mhúineadh na teang sa Ghaeltacht; ní mór cúrsaí oiliúna a sholáthar do lucht eagraithe na naíonra seo.  Murach an méid beag airgid a chuir eann Údarás na Gaeltachta ar fáil, n bheadh aon airgead ag teacht chuig naíonraí na Gaeltachta.  Níl an Roinn Oideachais ag comhlíonadh a ndualgai sa mhéid sin.</P>
    <P>Foirgnimh bheaga atá in úsáid d'fhor mhór na mbunscoileanna sa Ghaeltach agus cuireann sé sin lancais ar a leithéid de scoileanna, maidir le soláthar ón Roinn Oideachais.  Roinntear an t-airg ead Stáit ar líon iomlán na ndaltaí a fhág ann nach mbíonn ach méid beag airgid ag dul do scoileanna beaga.  Cruthaítear deacrachtaí, dá réir, maidir le solátha <Col N="2011" /> múinteoirí, agus go háirithe i gcás soláthar múinteoirí tacaíochta.</P>
    <P>Ní mór teangmháil tuisceanach a chothú idir an teaghlach agus an scoil chun forbairt iomlán an pháiste a chur chun cinn agus le go mbeadh toradh fónta leis an pholasaí teanga.</P>
    <P>Tá athruithe á ndéanamh sa churaclam nua.  Tá sé ag éirí níos baintí le timpeallacht an dalta agus measaim gur rud maith é sin.  Dá ndéanfadh an Roinn Oideachais athbhreithniú macánta ar a bhfuil á dhéanamh acu ar son oideachais sa Ghaeltacht, d'fheicfeadh siad go bhfuil an-chuid rudaí ag tarlú nach bhfuil inchosanta de réir nósanna maithe oideachais.</P>
    <P>Téann daltaí meánscoile na Gaeltachta ar aghaidh go dtí Ollscoil na Gaillimhe. Fuair an ollscoil £1 mhilliún, arís ón gcrannchur náisiúnta, chun árasáin a thógáil d'fhoghlaimeoirí na Gaeilge agus dóibh siúd a bhfuil baint acu leis an nGaeilge.  Bheadh sé seo an-inmholta dá mbeadh na príomhfhíricí i gceart.  Tá dualgas bunreachtúil ar an ollscoil seo faoi Acht 1928, ábhair a chur ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge, ach is eol domsa gur chlis an ollscoil ar an nGaeltacht, agus ar an lear mór Gaeilgeoirí atá lonnaithe sa chathair.  Is é an toradh ar an bhfaillí seo ná go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht tar éis éirí cúng, tanaí agus lag.  Leathchéad bliain níos déanaí, bronntar £1 mhilliún ar an ollscoil chéanna le foirgnimh a thógáil chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Muna bhfuil téacsanna oiriúnacha acu sna bunscoileanna, nó áiseanna foghlamtha acu sna meánscoileanna, cén chaoi a bhféadfadh an ollscoil fóir a dhéanamh ar an nGaeilge?</P>
    <P>Nílim ag cur an mhilleáin iomlán ar an Rialtas atá faoi láthair ann; níor thug Rialtais a chuaigh rompu an tacaíocht chuí don phobal Gaeilge, ach oiread. Táim ag cur béime air seo anocht mar is beag duine eile a luaigh a thábhacht.</P>
    <P>Labhair an tAire an oíche cheana faoi theangacha breise Eorpacha; bhí áthas uirthi go raibh deis ag daoine an Ghearmáinis agus an Fhraincís a fhoghlaim. Tacaím leis sin go hiomlán; a mhéid teangacha a bhíonn ag an duine, is amhlaidh <Col N="2012" /> is fearr é.  Ach céard faoi teanga ár sinsir? Cén freastal atá á dhéanamh ar labhairt na Gaeilge sa churaclam nua atá á thabhairt isteach sna meánscoileanna?  Is tábhachtaí go mór é labhairt na Gaeilge ná scríobh na Gaeilge, dar liomsa agus dar le mórán daoine eile.  Bhí deis ag an Aire labhairt na teanga a chur chun tosaigh sa churaclam nua seo, ach measaim nár thapaidh sí an deis.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir gur tuar dóchais í an reachtaíocht oideachais seo atá faoi chaibidil anois.  Tá súil agam go dtabharfaimid áird cheart ar an nGaeilge, ar a múineadh, ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ar gach atá ag teastáil chun oideachas forleathan Ghaeltachta a chur ar fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to support the motion.  I am also glad Senator Ó Foighil spoke about the universities towards the end of his speech.  I would like to briefly address this area.  It seems to me that there is some inconsistency at Cabinet level because I believe, and I would like the Minister to comment on this, that the Departments of Education and Finance are at odds with some of the other Departments or, at least, the interests of some of the other Departments.  I would like to explain what I mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Department of Education, driven by the Department of Finance, are imposing on the universities a unit cost exercise which is a new method of examining the funding of universities and it is one which universities themselves are particularly concerned about. It takes into account only part of the contribution of the universities national life.  It only takes into account, for example, the central teaching function of the university.  There is a token recognition of some research value, but not in the widest, general broad sense for which <Col N="2013" /> universities in this country are, mercifully, very well known.  It does not take into account the full range, or reflect, the interests of Cabinet as a whole because, for example, the Department of Industry and Commerce get considerable assistance from universities in the creation of new jobs, in the development of new technology and so on, sometimes a little outside the normal university status. There are, for example, companies developing on campus in both Trinity College and UCD and this is not really recognised.  I believe it should be.</P>
    <P>What is the status of the unit cost exercise which is currently being implemented?  It does not take into account the output of graduates and the full impact of this in terms of the perception of the country abroad.  The reputation of this country internationally is that our educated graduate population is one of our principal assets.  I know that the staff in Trinity College, for example, make a special point of meeting visiting industrialists and discussing with them the qualifications of graduates, discussing new ideas, new technology and so on.  I know that a recent visit was made by a number of very prominent businessmen from the United States who commented to senior officials at the university on the quality and status of our graduates.</P>
    <P>We then look at things like the environmental area where commitments are given over and above those required by the teaching contract.  If there were time I could list off the number of people who have been to the forefront of the battle for the environment outside their teaching time.  The same is true with regard to health boards, to the Health Research Board which has been under attack financially by the Government, to the Medical Research Board from which the provost of Trinity recently resigned and to the development of new drugs, for example, to fight diseases like leprosy.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention also the way in which secondary education feeds into the university system.  There is discrimination here, although it is not intentional. Perhaps something could be done about it.  For example, in the west the teaching of mathematics and physics in many schools is not taken to honours <Col N="2014" /> level in girls schools and this means there is no flow of women into the university faculties of science, mathematics and physics, at least not in the same way that there should be.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recognition of degrees in America, I have a constituent who is seriously concerned because the educational evaluators in the United States of America do not understand the Irish academic situation, the marking system or the status of degrees and they refuse to give proper recognition to it. Would the Minister please look into this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that such an important topic was given so little time.  It is absurd that on the subject of education we have only one and a half hours debate. There are people queuing to speak and they are restricted to about three or four minutes.  It is something we should think about.  It is partly our fault for not agreeing to devote a full day to it.  I believe a motion on education merits a full day's debate.  I want to say a word or two about the teaching profession, where they are abused, neglected and taken for granted and where they were misled by successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the constant excuse, when a motion of this sort is put down with specific areas in which education and teachers can be helped, that there is not enough money to fund the projects politicians want.  I understand, as one who believes in holding back public expenditure, those restrictions on education but I believe &mdash; I have said this before but have not had a satisfactory answer &mdash; that the privatisation of Irish Life which is to take place early next year will raise hundreds of millions of pounds for the Exchequer.  This money could be specifically pigeon-holed into the educational field.  It could be put into capital investment which would improve the main problems in education which we hear about so often.  We would no longer have this excuse.  It could be put into capital investment which would improve the pupil-teacher ratio.  It would improve the lot of teachers, many of whom have been misled into going into a profession in which there are no jobs.  Many teachers stay at home and are over-educated for <Col N="2015" /> a system which can no longer cater for them.  The capital is not there to give them the necessary facilities.  Some are unemployed and even if they get employment, they find that they have no mobility to move from job to job.  Others are forced to take the road of emigration and they go abroad.  When they go abroad, what happens?  They find that their particular qualifications are not recognised. I know the situation has improved very recently in Britain, but in the EC and in America there are inconsistencies.  Many teachers, as a result of the system which we impose on them, are going into jobs for which they are not suited, having been promised jobs in the educational world.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what Senator Norris said in relation to the third level university sector.  He pointed out that the universities have established commercial companies on their campuses.  Indeed, the first commercial company established in this country on a campus was in University College, Cork.  Additionally, we have the national micro-electronics research centre in Cork which attracts millions of pounds of overseas grants each year for research.  We have the centre for co-operative studies.  We have the national centre for food bio-technology.  All of these contribute in their own way to the national economy.  I am afraid the method of unit cost will not take account of that adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My perspective in education is from the third level where I have worked most of my life &mdash; from every level in the third level, being an assistant in UCD to vice-president in UCC.  As I look at what has happened over that period of nearly 30 years, I ask myself what does the meaning of the phrase in the Constitution treating <Col N="2016" /> all our citizens equally mean when you see that students at university are coming from the same socio-economic sectors in society now as they were 30 years ago? Are we treating all our children equally, I have to ask myself when I see the children of the better-off sectors in our society able to afford grinds to get the necessary points to get into university? Are we treating all our children equally? Obviously, we are not.  When I see the pressure on young children today starting at national school level in order to get the necessary points to get into university, I wonder are we putting far too much emphasis on university entrance requirements when the vast majority of those at second level will never enter university? There is excessive emphasis on academic subjects, on getting the necessary points to get into university.  Are they getting into the right faculties when they get there?  There is certainly a lack of career guidance.</P>
    <P>Students are now studying subjects that require high points only because they got the high points.  If one looks back at the report on university investment in education which came out in the early sixties and looks at where students were in the 1960s, those with the least number of honours in the leaving certificate went into medicine and into veterinary medicine. Today, they are going into medicine and veterinary medicine which require high points only because they get high points.  Good mathematicians do not necessarily make good doctors or good vets.  They are doing so because there is inadequate career guidance in schools. I can tell you that, as a result of my experience in the administrative side of UCC, many of them end up as tragedies. They find themselves in faculties in which they have no interest.  Brilliant students opt out.  It is a tragedy.  It is a waste of resources and a waste of their lives.</P>
    <P>With regard to the pressure on students trying to get into university, the problem is that you cannot fit a gallon into a half gallon size.  We have to accept that there are only a certain number of places. Unfortunately this puts the kind of pressure on students that is breaking them physically and mentally.  There is something wrong with a system that puts that <Col N="2017" /> kind of pressure on young people and robs them of their youth.  We must look at the system again.  I agree with Senator Ross that there should be more time devoted to a subject as important as this.</P>
    <P>Finally, to those people who made such play about all the money, the cost and so on, I accept it is expensive but if you think education is expensive, try ignorance.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear it. We can record it this evening.  There were many speakers on the Fine Gael side and a number of them could not contribute this evening.</P>
      <P>Senator Keogh referred to the fact that this was a long list requiring money.  It is not just a question of money.  There are glaring problems in education at the moment.  Take the six year cycle, which I know Senator Keogh would agree with, and the excellent programmes that can be followed in a six year cycle, whether it is a transition year, senior certificate or the vocational preparation programme; £3 million is as much as it would take to extend the six year cycle to the 50 per cent of students who do not have that facility now.  That is a small figure when we are talking in terms of a £1 billion plus budget.</P>
      <P>Senator Keogh referred to other aspects which are cost-effective.  As regards remedial teaching, when you are talking about disadvantaged pupils who end up illiterate in many cases because they do not get the contact they need on a one-to-one basis with a remedial teacher, I do not think you can ever quantify that cost in relation to money. Senator Keogh referred to flexibility.  We should harness the potential and skills of young teachers and offer early retirement to ageing teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McKenna said that parents would reject further taxation.  I stated, and will refer to it later, that there is <Col N="2018" /> indirect taxation of parents.  I gave the figure of £4.7 million in relation to voluntary funding of £25 annually and the figure of £2.45 million collected in exam fees.  That surely is indirect taxation. Without those moneys the education system would be lacking in funding.  I was interested in the Senator's reference to local education authorities.  There was a vocational education committee meeting in Jury's last Saturday.  Unfortunately I was not a delegate.  It is not so very long ago since Gemma Hussey, as Minister for Education, dared mention local education councils and she was nearly burned at the stake.  I brought it up for debate at the vocational education committee and I was told: &ldquo;shut up, we do not want to hear that&rdquo;.  There was no discussion.  That was exactly how local education councils which are not very far off local education authorities the IVA have in mind now were dealt with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are there. I know the Minister has a Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels but I am disappointed she is not here to listen to the passionate pleas from people on this side of this House.  I hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, tells her of our concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In opening the debate I congratulated the Minister on her announcement to introduce the comprehensive education Bill and I stated it would open up a much needed debate on education, not just by teachers but others &mdash; trade unionists, church authorities, parents, students and employers.  In calling for the issuing of both Green and White Papers quickly because the crisis is ongoing, I asked particularly that the proposed education Bill would not become a smokescreen for inactivity.  The Minister's speech confirmed my worst fears.  We were subjected to a long list of carefully selected data and dates.  It was really a smokescreen for her inability to address satisfactorily the glaring problems in education.  Why was it necessary to list so many demands?  Precisely because of the glaring inequalities that exist within <Col N="2019" /> the system.  The Minister tried to hoodwink us.  When I mentioned that only the report of the primary school curriculum review body was published and urged her to ensure no further delay regarding the publication of the OECD report on the Irish education system and the report of the primary school review, the Minister avoided the question by saying I was accusing her of having the reports published already and that they were gathering dust on shelves.  There was no question of that.  I said, and I say now, she was not listening.</P>
    <P>Again, she sidestepped the issue of the recommendations of the reports and, more importantly, what she intends doing in response to them.  The Minister said she was looking forward to receiving the reports.  She said that the specific demands set out in the motion before the House as the way to primary education are each in their own way desirable and progressive.  I wish Senator Keogh would share that view.  The Minister agreed with the demands but she said that they would be amply dealt with in the reports to which she referred.  That is procrastination and it can only be further exacerbated by saying that not just the ongoing crisis but other problems and difficulties will be considered in an education Bill.</P>
    <P>Another smokescreen was the new programme for economic and social development.  That is shelving the issue. The Government recognise the need for further improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio.  That will be dealt with by way of discussion in the new programme for economic and social development.  We were subjected to page after page of what the Minister had accomplished.  In the area of the disadvantaged, she referred to the home/school community liaising initiatives, which I agree with, specialist teachers for remedial work and so on. The least any Minister can do is identify schools with the highest priority of need and allocate remedial teachers.  We must work on a sliding scale, dealing with areas of greatest need first.  What about the thousands of students who do not get remedial help and end up educationally <Col N="2020" /> disadvantaged, many in a state of acute illiteracy?</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to in-service. We are still waiting for the sample paper but we are not going to get it.  We are waiting for the in-service course this term but I doubt it will materialise between now and 20 December when the holiday period begins.</P>
    <P>In regard to new schools and extensions, the Minister, failed utterly to respond to the statistics about pupils and teachers in prefabs.  The Minister mentioned that teachers do not spend their full day in prefabs.  She ignored and fudged the issue that students spend their days in them.  If they are lucky enough to have specialist rooms they will move once or twice for two periods a day.  She ignored the question I asked her about the £300,000 collected from parents for a boys' school in Limerick where when the principal asked the Department for furniture and equipment he was told he could not have it because the building was unauthorised.  The Minister did not respond to my call to increase the number of guidance counsellors.  Students who come from disadvantaged homes, areas of high unemployment and poor social economic areas are just left high and dry.</P>
    <P>I referred to the six year cycle and the Minister fell back on her old excuse: it is a matter for discussion at the negotiations on the new programme for economic and social development.  She was selective in the years she took when she spoke about the increase in the capitation grants because nothing was done until 1990 when there was a £10 increase.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by Senator Mullooly is a brief summary of the educational aims and objectives any Minister for Education would surely have as basic priorities.  Take the first one: commending the Minister for keeping educational policy under ongoing review, if the Minister for Education does not keep education policy under ongoing review, I do not know who would.  I cannot go through the other items in the amendment because of lack of time but I see no reference to specific future planninng. I hear about reports, Green and White Papers and the proposed <Col N="2021" /> education Bill.  We will all have an input but the Minister should lead the education debate.  She should not hide behind promised reports and the promise of an Education Bill.  She should come out and direct education; she should lead the education debate.  She should not hide behind promised reports and the promise of an education Bill.  I look forward to 1992 as being a year of eventful things which will take place.  Hopefully, <Col N="2022" /> the legislation promised by the Minister will be one of those events.  In the meantime, the problems and difficulties experienced by pupils and teachers alike and, in fact, the ongoing crisis in education as far as I am concerned, have all been left unresolved.  I certainly could not support the amendment as put forward by Senator Fallon.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Hugh Byrne that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House he proposes to raise the following matter: the recent tragedies in the North Irish Sea where four lives were lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to get the opportunity at last to raise this matter. As all of you and the Minister well know, the incident to which I will refer occurred on 22 November 1990.  This is one in a succession of incidents that has caused the loss of life of at least 100 people over a ten-year period.  It has also caused the loss of a lot of property, the property of Irish fishermen and of Scottish, Welsh and English fishermen.  While I am pleased to see Deputy Noonan here, as Minister for the Marine, nevertheless when I raised this matter last, which was about one and a half years ago, I had the Minister for Foreign Affairs to answer me.  I would pose the question, why is it that we do not have any one Department watching this particular issue?  As I said, while I am pleased to see Deputy Noonan here, I would have to question the Government's commitment to the elimination of what I would regard as a very serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest tragedy happened on 22 November 1990 and caused the death of four Scottish fishermen.  Immediately one might ask, what is my interest in Scottish fishermen?  My interest is that this happened in the North Irish Sea.  It is well known that it is a common fishing ground for our own fishermen.  Many of our own fishermen, as I will outline later on, have been affected by submarine activity in the Irish Sea to date.  I am depending on information from <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  I will be quoting occasionally from them.  I would like to relate what happened.  The accident happened when the <i>Antares</i>, based at Carradale, Kintyre, was fishing off the Isle of Arran.  The Plymouth-based hunter killer submarine, <i>HMS Trenchant</i>, reported to its base that it had hit the gear of a fishing boat.  The navy said it surfaced and tried, unsuccessfully, to contact by radio two trawlers in the area. It could see &ldquo;nothing amiss&rdquo; and left the scene after contacting lifeguards.  Here <Col N="2025" /> we have a situation where, when the accident occurred, it seems that the submarine came to the surface and saw nothing amiss.  It would be very difficult for it to see anything amiss on the surface at that stage since the four fishermen had been drowned and the trawler had been pulled under the sea.</P>
    <P>The point I would like to make at this stage is the inconsiderate fashion in which the Ministry of Defence and, particularly, the submarine acted.  They were prepared to move away even though they knew full well that they had hit something. They were prepared to move away and leave the rest to God.  We all know what happened, that four people were lost.  It is known that onshore on the night of 22 November the wives and girlfriends waited for the four fishermen to return. They were only fishing about ten miles off the coast of Scotland.  Of course, they never arrived onshore.  The Labour MP, a particularly good friend of mine, Mr. George Foulkes, a long time campaigner for better safety measures in fishing grounds, claimed that the tragedy need not have happened.  That is a view I share. He had been warning for 18 months that this kind of thing could happen.  He had presented many documents to the Department of Transport and to the Department of Defence over ten years predicting what would happen and what eventually did happen.</P>
    <P>A large search, involving a naval frigate and a mine sweeper as well as naval helicopters, found pieces of red wreckage, the same colour as the <i>Antares</i> and it was conclusively discovered that it had been snagged by the submarine <i>Trenchant.</i> The many incidents &mdash; and there have been some 90 very serious incidents &mdash; in which varying numbers of fishermen lost their lives have been logged.  That has happened over a period of ten years. During those ten years &mdash; I have not time to list all of the different incidents &mdash; the Ministry of Defence in Britain refused at all stages to give any information.  Only in this case, the case of the <i>Antares</i> and in the case of the <i>Sheralga</i> about which all of us here would know much more, a trawler fishing out of Clogher Head, did the Ministry of Defence admit that they were responsible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2026" /> The Ministry of Defence have recently complied with a High Court order to hand over papers which are believed to include logs of submarines which may have caused the trawler <i>Inspire</i> to capsize in the Irish Sea in 1988, with the loss of two lives.  Irish Sea fishermen had only just learned of the rules of action drawn up by the British navy for submarine commanders, which apply to vessels fouling fishing gear.  The rules begin with the warning that when such contact occurs &ldquo;the safety of the lives of the fishing vessels crew is of paramount importance and must subsume all other considerations&rdquo;. That is a very interesting new regulation applied to the Ministry of Defence because heretofore they just snagged the trawler, brought it under, lives were lost and they went away about their business ignoring any damage that might have been caused or any lives that might have been lost.  The actions recommended include reducing speed to a minimum possible, returning to periscope depth and establishing radio contact.  Communication with fishing vessels is also recommended and the submarine is advised to surface when possible.  The rules also urge commanders to resist the temptations to be unnecesarily secretive.</P>
    <P>I would like to continue with the help of <i>The Irish Times.</i>  They did an in-depth survey of the whole issue.  It is absolutely vitally important to put this on record at this stage.  The British navy still operate some five fleet submarine vessels with nuclear weapons on board and driven by nuclear reactors and 11 conventional vessels out of the Neptune submarine base at Faslane on the Clyde, a few miles from the scene of last Thursday's accident. The point I would like to make is that here you have nuclear submarines with nuclear weapons on board moving around in the Irish Sea and damaging harmless trawlers and causing loss of life. I would like to say to the Minister that he is well aware, as we all are, that vast amounts of nuclear waste are being transshipped in the Irish Sea to Sellafield.  God forbid that it will ever happen that one of these nuclear powered, nuclear carrying submarines will collide with one of those ships involved in the trans-shipment of nuclear waste.  People may say that that <Col N="2027" /> is over-reacting.  I say it is not.  I say it is being absolutely sensible.  The Irish Government &mdash; and I will be criticising them later on &mdash; and the British Government seem to suggest that because the submarines are below water they cannot collide.  I would like to refer to the 90 accidents that are already logged and well documented both in our own Department and in that of Britain.  So it is ridiculous to suggest that it would not happen.  Of course, it could happen.  The day that that will happen none of us will live to tell the tale.  I am saying that that is not an over-reaction.  That is a fact of life.</P>
    <P>Many of my colleagues, when they heard I was raising this matter today, and particularly those people who live in the maritime counties, said to me that the Irish fisherman is afraid of his life to go to sea because of the dangers lurking in the waters.  The fishermen on the west coast are not as afraid as those on the Irish Sea, because that is where most of the traffic is.  I said on another occasion that there is as much submarine traffic in the Irish sea as there is vehicular traffic in O'Connell Street at Christmas time. That is not an exaggeration because there you have the French, the Dutch, the Russians, the English and the Americans all playing war games with their submarines. It is interesting that they should still be playing these war games when we are told that the Cold War is over.</P>
    <P>To me, at any rate, it seems that the activity in the Irish Sea, from the information I have, particularly from Mr. Bernard Moffatt of the Celtic League in the Isle of Man, shows that the Cold War is far from over.  If what is happening in the Irish Sea is any indication, then any suggestion of progress being made towards world peace is an absolute fallacy. If we are on the way towards peace, why is it that, instead of being on the decrease, submarine activity and nuclear activity is on the increase in the Irish Sea?</P>
    <P>I think this is the fifth occasion on which I have raised this issue of submarine activity in the Irish Sea.  I have always asked the question on those occasions: What have the Irish Government done?  I am asking the same question now.  What have the Irish <Col N="2028" /> Government done since April 1989 when I last raised this issue?  Are we so unconcerned about our own fishermen that we will do nothing about the position?  It is not enough for the Minister to say, or for the Irish Government to say, that this is happening outside our territorial waters and that we have no say.</P>
    <P>Our people are out there earning a livelihood for themselves.  Goodness knows, they have enough problems as things stand at present without the added danger of lurking submarines.  They are innocent people out there trying to earn a living.  They are saying to me that it seems as though we do not give a damn about what happens to them.  It has been suggested to me in Kilmore Quay that instead of using steel cable to trawl their nets they are now using nylon so that, if the nets are snagged, the ropes will break and that at least even if they lose that property their lives will be saved.</P>
    <P>This kind of situation cannot be allowed to continue.  The fact that the Minister of State and not the Minister is in here this evening is also a source of worry to me.  I know that the Minister of State is excellent at his job, but nevertheless he does not sit around the Cabinet table, which is where all decisions are made.  I would ask the Minister of State, as a friend and as a person interested in all of our fishermen, to carry this message back to the Government in the hope that I will never have to stand up in this House again to say that more lives have been lost and, worse still, to have to say that Irish lives will be lost.</P>
    <P>In the catalogue of disaster and incidents that have occurred I would have to say that Irish fishermen have been involved in about 50.  It is sad to say that we continue to do absolutely nothing and behave as if our people matter little to us.  The British authorities and the Ministry of Defence show scant regard for their own people, because recently they have been the cause of four deaths.  I do not know whether that is manslaughter or not, but because they have been warned so often I would have to suggest that it is nothing less than that.  I do not want our Government to be involved in that, but I would have to say at this stage <Col N="2029" /> that they are siding with the British in keeping this whole business quiet.</P>
    <P>I do not want to have to say these things but I live in Wexford at Hook Point, among fishermen who are contacting me every other week about this, even when there is not an incident.  I do not raise this only when there is an incident, because I probably would not be allowed.  Either the Irish Government are not taking the fishermen seriously or they are not taking me seriously, but there is some breakdown in communications along the line.  It is just not good enough.  I am asking the Minister of State tonight to carry this message back and to ask the Minister for the Marine, the Minister for Transport and the Taoiseach, who is now Minister for Defence to seek meetings with their counterparts in Britain with a view to ending this terrible activity.  I will settle for nothing less than the removal of the submarines from the Irish Sea, which is well known to be a popular fishing ground.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Chathaoirligh, I want to raise a related matter.  It relates to submarine activity.  In March 1968, which is quite a while ago now, Aer Lingus flight EI 712, the &ldquo;St. Phelim&rdquo;, went down off Tuscar Rock and to date nobody has given a reason.  Because of what has happened in the Irish Sea and because of the fact that the Ministry of Defence in Britain kept quiet for so long, I have every reason to believe that there was a collision in mid-air, whether it was with a missile from a submarine or a missile from some of their onshore ports, I do not know.  I do know that the general feeling of all people on the east coast of Ireland and the west coast of Britain is that something happened that we have not heard about.  I am asking the Minister of State tonight, not to answer a few questions I want to put, but if he would ask the Government, on my behalf and on behalf of all fishermen and all interested people, if they will reopen an inquiry into that particular incident.  I want answers to the following questions. Were tests with surface to air missiles being carried out at Aberporth in the last six months of 1967 and the first six months of 1968?  I have every reason to believe <Col N="2030" /> that that was the case.  How many test firings were made in that period?  Was control of any launched missile subsequently lost?  Was control of any air launched target lost?  I think this is possibly the answer to the question, that it may not have been hit by a missile.  My own impression is that it was hit by an air-launched target.  What was the range of any surface-to-air missiles under test? When will range records for the period be made public?  The reason I am asking these questions is that to date no information has been given.  I ask these questions in my own interest and in the interests of people who have shown interest and concern over the years.  Even for the sake of the air crew who had responsibility for that aircraft, is it not time that their names were cleared?</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick West)</i>: I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to this debate and that Senator Byrne has raised this important matter. He posed a number of questions at the end of his contribution.  I would need to have had notice of those questions if I were to have answered them at this stage. The question under discussion reads: the recent tragedy in the North Irish sea where four lives were lost.  That has no relation at all to the questions that were raised.  However, I am prepared to let Senator Byrne have the replies in due course.  I would not attempt to answer them this evening because I would need information and in my response I do have to give accurate information.  For that reason, I will not attempt to answer them because I could not guarantee the accuracy of my replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say on behalf of the Minister that, arising from my due responsibilities for the safety of life at sea and, on the other hand, for the development of the fishing industry, I have expressed in a press statement, released on Friday, 23 November, my concern at the incident involving a fishing boat in the Firth of Clyde on 22 November.  I explained that I would be taking a keen interest in the outcome of any inquiry established to investigate the incident.  I should like to say that those with competence in the <Col N="2031" /> matter should be conscious of the safety of all seafarers and the absolute necessity of taking all measures to avoid loss of life and damage to fishing vessels or gear.  I would add that fishermen in Donegal and the Irish Sea have in the past expressed concern about the danger from submarines in their respective fishery areas and they are entitled to the highest safety standard being applied by all.</P>
    <P>The loss of the <i>Antares</i> took place outside Irish territorial waters.  I understand from a statement made by Mr. Archibald Hamilton, Minister of State at the UK Ministry of Defence, that a Royal Navy submarine HMS <i>Trenchant</i>, operating in the Clyde area in the early hours of Thursday, 22 November, surfaced to investigate unexplained sounds on her starboard side.  Mr. Hamilton reported to the House of Commons that the crew recovered a length of trawl cable from its casing and, assuming that it might have snagged the gear of a fishing vessel, tried unsuccessfully to contact neighbouring fishing vessels on the VHF radio.</P>
    <P>The MoD statement indicated that the submarine remained on the surface and conducted a search for some two and a half hours and, seeing nothing untoward, continued her operations.  The UK coast-guard, having been contacted by the Royal Navy, initiated inquiries in an attempt to account for all vessels which may have been in the area.  It was later established that the FB <i>Antares</i> was missing in the search area.  Following a search and rescue operation the vessel was discovered on the sea bed in the early hours of the morning of Friday, 23 November, and the four crew are still missing, presumed dead.  The UK Ministry of Defence announced today that work is taking place to raise the <i>Antares</i> from the bed of the Firth of Clyde.</P>
    <P>Inquiries are to be conducted by both the UK Department of Transport and the Royal Navy and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to speculate in advance on the outcome of such inquiries. However, I wish to reassure this House that all appropriate action that I can take will be taken.  Ireland's national control over foreign vessels ends at the <Col N="2032" /> limit of our territorial waters.  Inside that limit, vessels must travel on the surface and show identification.  Beyond that limit, vessels operate in international waters, which do not have jurisdiction. Vessels travel freely through international waters.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that every possible step should be taken to ensure that submarines operate in a responsible fashion <i>vis-á-vis</i> fishing vessels.  To that end, and to minimise the danger posed to fishing vessels at sea by submerged submarines, my Department brought the matter to the attention of the International Maritime Organisation, which is the London based United Nations specialised agency responsible for safety at sea.  A resolution was, as a result, passed by the IMO Assembly in November 1987, recommending that a submerged submarine, if information on the presence of a fishing vessel and its gear is available, should as far as possible keep out of the way of that fishing vessel and any gear connected to it unless the submarine is disabled.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the most recent tragedy I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs to continue to avail of every opportunity to raise in the appropriate international fora the dangers which submarines pose to fishing vessels.  I have also asked him to voice in the relevant bilateral contacts the concerns of our fishermen about submarine activity in the fishing grounds and other waters around our coasts.  As Senator Byrne knows, An Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have raised this issue in the past at the United Nations.  Furthermore, my Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has on a number of occasions raised incidents involving submarines bilaterally with the authorities in the countries involved and will continue to do so.  In short, a Chathaoirligh, my Department will continue to do everything possible to enhance the safety of vessels at sea whether in territorial or international waters.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 December 1990.</P>
