      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
      <P>Ba chóir d'Aire na Gaeltachta a mhíniú cén fáth nach raibh am aige plé a dhéanamh faoi Theilifís Ghaeltachta lena Aire Stáit Gaeltachta ó Mhí an Mheithimh go dtí Mí Dheireadh Fómhair na bliana seo.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Patrick Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The relocation and development of St. Gabriel's school and clinic in Limerick for the physically handicapped on a site which has been acquired for this development joining St. Paul's school, Dooradoyle, and that the proposed development be part of the implementation of the overall plan for the provision of services for the physically handicapped in the area of the MidWestern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to review the case of a prisoner in Arbour Hill (name supplied) with a view to exercising his ministerial prerogative of commuting the sentence in the light of its <Col N="1522" /> comparative severity taking into account the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The disparity between the social welfare code and the income tax code in the treatment of share fishermen.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to address the serious escalation of crime in rural areas, and to make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>I regard the matter raised by Senators Ó Foighil, Kennedy and Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ó Foighil's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Kennedy and Norris may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matters raised by Senators Neville and Doyle are not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment: Senator Neville's matter is too wide and is more suitable for discussion on a substantive motion and Senator Doyle's matter involves legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take today Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in that order.  There will be a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. or perhaps a few minutes later, perhaps 8.8 p.m. or thereabouts, we will take Item No. 79, which is the Fianna Fáil motion, the second part of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in conjunction with the handing in of the signatures today on Campaign Aid for overseas development aid, the Leader of the House might make time available before Christmas for a full debate on overseas development aid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two items which I have raised with the Leader of the House over the past two weeks.  First, <Col N="1523" /> the outline of the list of legislation which he proposes to initiate in this House during the course of this term.  We are aware of certain names being given to us and certainly the Government Whip has been forthcoming in letting us know some of the developments behind the scenes. For the record, and to know exactly what the position is, we wish to know at this stage so that people can prepare themselves for it what legislation you intend introducing in this House.</P>
      <P>The other issue which I want to raise &mdash; and I have raised it with you in the past number of weeks also &mdash; is the need for a debate on the crisis in the education service.  Whether that be through the noting of developments in education or an agreed motion or simply statements, it is certainly agreed on all sides of the House that the whole education service needs discussion just as other aspects of Irish life have received discussion here over the past month or two.  I would like a reply on those two issues &mdash; the list of legislation and the prospect of a debate or statement or agreed motion on the education service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to support Senator Manning in his request to the Leader of the House that he would allow time for a debate on this country's overseas aid contribution.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to ask the Leader of the House when it is proposed to take the Bill which will allow the Minister for Health to distribute unclaimed prize money from the Hospital Sweepstakes to those people who worked in the Hospital Sweepstakes and who were very badly treated in their redundancy terms. I make a special appeal to the Leader to try to facilitate this Bill being taken before Christmas so that these people can get their money.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to ask the Leader of the House when it is proposed to take the Environmental Protection Agency Bill or if there has been any further information on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of <Col N="1524" /> points I would like to raise with the Leader of the House.  Yesterday in Kilkenny we had an invasion of public property by a group of travelling traders. They caused a considerable amount of damage in a public area.  This group of traders have been travelling around the country for the past two years and nobody seems to be able to control them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on the Order of Business, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader of the House if he can initiate either a debate on this matter here or ask the Minister if there is any way we can deal with this group who are creating havoc in every town and village in Ireland.  It is the same group.  They are very wealthy; they are not the normal type of trader. They are going around&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, that kind of generalised statement is going very close to racism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about traders; I am not talking about anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you a question for the Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am asking him to ask the Minister either to change the Casual Trading Act to deal with these people or else that we would have a debate in the House on the matter.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Leader if he could initiate a debate here on the statement that was made by the Taoiseach yesterday in which he suggested that the sanctions in the Gulf against Iraq should be given time for them to start worrying Iraq rather than as at present where you have certain countries who are seen to want to go for an all-out-war&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I have to remind you that the question must be put to the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1525" />
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader of the House a question.  I am just telling him why I would like a debate in this House on this particular matter.  The Taoiseach came out very strongly in favour of negotiations and the use of sanctions.  I think that is the way to go because if there is a war in the Gulf it will impinge on everyone of us here.  I do not think we should allow this matter to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Leader of the House is going to agree on a debate there will be an opportunity for you to speak, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just suggest again to the Leader that this matter be treated urgently as we do not want a war in that area or in any area of the world and there are people who would like to start a war at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House, as I have done on numerous occasions, if he would give special and urgent consideration to holding a comprehensive debate on what I perceive to be, and many other Members perceive to be, the continuing crisis in the health service.  I ask the Leader of the House if he would accept that there are still major difficulties in terms of waiting lists, hospital care and if, in the light of that, he would be willing to give it priority for debate.  I think it is a very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to express concern at the extreme ugliness and obtrusiveness of the machinery involved in televising the Chamber and to express the wish through you, Sir, that perhaps some amelioration of this can be obtained, because it is a very beautiful Chamber of which we are all proud.  I would not like to think it would be spoiled by these instruments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>What is happening here at the moment, I understand, is experimental and I cannot say that what you are witnessing here at the moment it will be the final result.  I understand that <Col N="1526" /> what has been installed and the exercise that will be undertaken shortly is part of the process of the experimental arrangements that have to be undertaken initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very relieved to hear that, a Chathaoirligh, because perhaps then the concern of the House could be taken into account, even the question of colour.  They really jump out at you.</P>
      <P>I would like formally to move that item No. 80 be taken first today.  Senator Lanigan referred to statements of the Taoiseach in Paris.  I would like to put it into exact context in one brief sentence.  The Taoiseach indicated on RTE television news last night that he looked forward to the construction of a new Europe based on the concept of human rights.  In that light it would be appropriate that we take this matter dealing with the judgment against Ireland on the subject of human rights.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he will be able to inquire from Government and make a statement to the House concerning newspaper reports that have been occurring recently which indicate that the Taoiseach has offered or is offering to Deputy Brian Lenihan the chairmanship of an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs, that post to be a paid post.  The reason I raise it is simply because there are two motions, one in the name of the Labour Party and one in the name of myself and others, seeking the establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs.  I think we would welcome indications that this was about to happen; and I also feel it would be appropriate before the chairmanship is offered to anybody, including very distinguished people like Deputy Lenihan, that the House should be consulted about this establishment because it will be an Oireachtas joint committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to follow up on the remarks by Senator O'Toole about the need for an urgent debate on education.  As we indicated on the last couple of occasions, there is a crisis in <Col N="1527" /> education and certainly I would request the Leader of the House to indicate, if he could possibly do so, a time when he would be prepared to allow a debate in this Chamber on that important issue.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would be prepared to allow a debate on the issue of imprisonment of children of the age of 15 in Mountjoy.  We have read in the newspapers today where a young girl of 15 has been described as depraved and unruly and imprisoned in an adult prison, which certainly was not intended for any such purpose, and the neglect of the relevant Government Departments in providing alternative facilities.</P>
      <P>I would like also to second the proposal by Senator Norris in regard to motion No. 80 and urge that this important issue of humans rights be debated by this House.  It is high time we did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask you and the Leader of the House if we will have an opportunity to discuss a matter which is among the papers laid before the Seanad: Foyle Area (Rivers Finn and Foyle Angling Permits) Regulations, 1989.  The River Foyle is jointly managed by the Irish Government and the British Government.  Because of serious pollution, which was raised last year, and the consequences for the future of the River Foyle, I would ask the Leader of the House to allow a debate, because we will not have another opportunity to make observations about the administration of a very important jointly managed river.  I hope I will have an opportunity to have a discussion on the management of the River Foyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In agreement with the other speakers who have asked the Leader of the House for a debate on overseas development aid, I find it very sad that twice yearly, before Christmas and before Lent, we have emphasis on such aid.  It is sad that we saw so many people today bringing with them 21,000 signatures to demand this.  It is obvious <Col N="1528" /> that the people of Ireland want development aid and an improvement in the Government funding towards developing countries.  I feel it is about time now that the Leader would put pressure on the Government to establish the Oireachtas Joint Committee on overseas development aid and allow us a quick debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Leader of the House could give us some indication of when the legislation required for the reform of local government will be forthcoming.  We were told that the local elections were postponed from June 1990 to June 1991.  If they are to take place in 1991 under the new arrangement, the legislation would need to be forthcoming fairly soon.  I understand that the report which was promised was supposed to be to hand last September. I wonder has that come and when does the Leader feel that the legislation will be before this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Seanad's attention to motion No. 82.  We have been singing the praises of the great leadership of the Soviet President, but here is an opportunity not only to pay a tribute to him but also to consider what assistance the West can give.  At the moment the West is totally ignoring the lead that is being given there.  I think that is a shame.  This House could be the initiator of a demand that more assistance than they are getting at the moment should come forward.  I ask the Leader of the House if he could make arrangements for an early discussion of that motion.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Costello on the question of the imprisonment of juveniles. That is a long standing matter and something needs to be done about it.  If it remains much longer with us it could become ingrained in our society so something has to be done about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support the question of having a debate on education.  I hope the people who are advocating it will not lose sight of the issue of the number of working class people who manage to get into third level education.  I would also ask the Leader of the House to get agreement <Col N="1529" /> with the Whips to have removed from the Order Paper motions that are outdated or have been on the Order Paper for too long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House when it is proposed that the legislation to deal with the setting up of the Environmental Protection Agency is to be introduced and, indeed, if it is proposed to be introduced into this House first.  The setting up of this agency is a matter of great urgency.  We are very fortunate that Ireland has such a green image abroad but I am afraid there is major divergence now between the image and the reality.  The setting up of this agency, not alone to put a stop to unnecessary pollution in this country but indeed to eliminate it totally for the future, is urgently required particularly from an Irish agricultural point of view. We want to see this legislation introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil le Ceannaire nua Fine Gael.  I would like to congratulate your new leader and wish him well in his new task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I commence by thanking the gracious Senator for his good wishes, which we will convey to our new leader, Deputy John Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the call for debate on ODA. I will not develop my views on that any further until we have the opportunity to debate it.  Also I think item No. 80 on the Order Paper should be treated as a matter of urgency, given the length of time it has been tabled at this stage.  Perhaps the Leader would indicate when the television broadcasting of proceedings in this Chamber will actually commence now that we seem to have the hardware in place.  I am inclined to agree with Senators who find the cameras obtrusive. I would think that with modern technology we could resort to something a little bit more refined and a little smaller, particularly a fixed camera which I think is to fix on yourself.  I am told that in the European Parliament a three inch <Col N="1530" /> diameter camera flush with the wall serves that purpose very adequately.  Perhaps we could ensure that we are not getting leftovers and that this is the best that modern technology can do.  I do not know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no suggestion, Senator, that the size of the camera need necessarily reflect my ego.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be remote control. In view of the income crisis being experienced by share fishermen all around our coastline since September and because they are debarred from any social welfare entitlements and in view of your ruling on my Adjournment motion &mdash; which, with respect, I disagree with, but I will talk about that again &mdash; I would like to be advised by the Leader of the House as to what mechanism we can use to have a debate into this Chamber on the crisis for share fishermen, particularly deck hands, at the moment.  It is particularly urgent.  It may be a small constituency but it is important and very valuable to our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, first of all, that I agree with Senator Doyle and Senator Norris.  It is one of the characteristics of television that those who operate it never seem to appreciate how the technology intrudes and impinges on everybody else. In my view, if those things are necessary for the televising of this House, I would be quite happy to do without it.  I find them ugly, offensive and unnecessary. Senator O'Toole is laughing at me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say also that I agree completely with Senator Costello's views of a 15 year old female child being locked up in the worst female prison in western Europe on legislation that is 70 years out of date.  It is a disgrace and it is something this House should debate, not in a cursory, half an hour debate but in a serious debate.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to allow the question of the non-availability of proper custodial places for young people who break the law to be debated.  It is a serious issue that should be discussed and debated in this House and the Minister should be invited to explain why no such facility is available.</P>
      <P>I heard the demand for a debate on the crisis in education, and I agree with it.  I heard the demand for a debate on the crisis in the health services, and I agree with it.  I have also heard a demand frequently &mdash; and we have had one recently &mdash; for a debate on the crisis in agriculture. I would like to suggest to the Leader of the House, through you, Sir, that we have been told by all the economists that this country is booming; yet, we have crises in education, health, agriculture, etc.  Could we have a debate on the crisis in economics, because it appears that the science of economics is entirely out of touch with reality?  One of the problems in this country is that we are listening to people who cannot actually talk about the real situation on the ground and that we should look at the quality of advice that is given.  That is a serious debate.  We should look at the sort of advice our Government give because obviously those who advise the Government have no contact with reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, Senator Lanigan &mdash; with whom <Col N="1532" /> I agree on the issues in question &mdash; raised the question of the Gulf.  In tune with Senator Farrell's congratulations to Fine Gael on their new Leader, could the Fine Gael Party explain to me where they stand now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In conclusion, may I ask, simply as a matter of procedure, when will item No. 6 be taken, the International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, because I want to put the House on notice that I will be opposing the Bill on the grounds that it is spurious, wasteful and entirely contrary to the interests of the developing countries of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for your protection, a Chathaoirligh.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House, in view of the fact that we have an absence of legislation &mdash; maybe he is going to enlighten us today and produce a list of legislation which is coming before the House and which would be very welcome &mdash; whether he would possibly accept, which has not been accepted in the past, legislation from Independent Members and Members of the Opposition and allow it to be debated in this House and given a full run in the House.  Unfortunately, this has been refused in this House for a certain length of time.  I believe there has been Private Members' legislation which the Government side have simply refused to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I would like to ask the Leader if he would allow or, indeed, initiate a debate on Northern Ireland.  I was in Northern Ireland over the past few days and I must say there are different noises coming out of Northern Ireland about the talks that are going on from what I hear down here.  It would be very enlightening if we were to have a full and frank debate with a declaration by the Government about what is going on in those talks and who is holding them up. <Col N="1535" /> The people I talked to in Northern Ireland quite blatantly and openly feel that the Dublin Government is the nigger in the woodpile here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the Dublin Government maintain that it is the people in Northern Ireland who are holding up matters.  It would be very useful if the Leader of the House would allow us to have a debate on this very important matter while we have obviously time on our hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank my colleague from the west, Senator Farrell, for his very flattering and <Col N="1536" /> generous remarks concerning my new leader.  I am thrilled that he did not go as far as his colleague in the Dáil yesterday, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, who in wishing him good luck, wished him many years of happiness and satisfaction in Opposition.</P>
      <P>I would like to join with my fellow Senators in describing these cameras as absolutely obnoxious and totally out of keeping with the character of this magnificant room on which the State has spent so much money.  They are a gross intrusion.  About two months ago in Berlin I saw a film showing of a so-called people's court which took place in 1944 without any such intrusion.  If they could get their act together correctly 46 years ago, the wit of modern technology in 1990, should be able to conceive of something infinitely better than these gross intrusions we are looking at here today.</P>
      <P>I would like to put two points to the Leader of the House.  First, I want to endorse entirely the repeated calls by Senator O'Reilly for a debate in general terms on the health services.  Secondly, I would like to ask him what progress has been made in regard to the repeated calls which have been made in this House, both on the Leader's side and on this side, for the establishment of a foreign affairs committee.  I raise that issue now because in recent days we have been reading cryptic comments which suggest that the Government are on the point of establishing such a committee.  If that is so, I welcome it.  I welcome it for the following reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>You have been very generous with me, a Chathaoirligh, but I just wanted to make the simple point that even on the Order of Business today five Members of this House have called for debates on issues which are effectively foreign affairs issues.  A fact of life is that this is the only Parliament in western <Col N="1537" /> Europe that does not have a foreign affairs committee.  The excuse earlier this year was that we were terribly absorbed in the Presidency of the European Community &mdash; I compliment the Government on that; it was a very effective exercise but if we are not to become irrelevant to what is happening in the rest of Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Leader of the House to make time available for statements on the latest developments within GATT?  I know we have discussed this matter previously but we have advanced from that.  I would ask him to do that particularly in view of the fact that the US seems to have moved now from a position where it was previously conducting a propaganda war to one where it is now trying to intimidate its opponents by threat of a trade war.  We would welcome the opportunity to reject that.</P>
      <P>I welcome Senator Ryan's interest in the Progressive Democrats but I think it would take more of a metamorphosis rather than a change on his part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Manning, asked for a debate on overseas aid.  Some Senators asked when item No. 6, which deals with the International Development Association, will be taken.  I hope that Bill will be taken very soon, probably next week. Therefore, the points made by many <Col N="1538" /> Senators dealing with overseas aid can be made in that debate.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked for the list of Bills for initiation in this House.  As I indicated, we already have had the Statute of Limitations Bill, the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, another Justice Bill.  We have had a number of Bills and we are hopeful of getting more.  Active discussion is taking place at all times on the question of having Bills initiated in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Senator also mentioned the need for a debate on education.  I can assure Senators that this is well in place.  We are having discussions and hopefully we will have such a debate as soon as possible. As the Senator indicated, it will be a broad debate on the whole education area.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton asked about the people in the Hospitals Sweepstakes.  The Public Hospitals (Amendment) Bill will be with us before Christmas and we can have a full discussion on that.  The Senator also asked about the Environment Agency Bill as did Senator Cullen and others. My understanding is that this Bill will be published fairly soon.  It is a very important Bill.  I am having discussions with the appropriate people to ensure that that Bill is initiated in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the problems in Kilkenny, but this problem is not confined to Kilkenny.  There is the Casual Trading Act and the Senator is probably talking about an extension of the Act.  If that is the way to do it, obviously we should talk to the Minister for Justice. Senator Lanigan also raised the question of a debate on sanctions on the Gulf.  It is something I will think about and will discuss with him at a later date.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly asked for a debate on health.  At this time I have no plans for a debate on health, but I would make the point to Senator O'Reilly and, to others that they have the opportunity in Private Members' time to arrange a debate on health problems or whatever other issues that they consider appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the television cameras and the Cathaoirleach replied.  I have no proposal at this time <Col N="1539" /> to take item No. 80 to which the Senator referred.  Senator Norris also referred to a foreign affairs debate.  I am not aware of any move towards setting up a committee to deal with foreign affairs.  I think the House would agree that there have been more debates on foreign affairs in the Seanad than in the other House.  It has been a feature of this House that we have had many debates on foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to education.  He also referred to the child in Mountjoy under the age of 15 years. This is a matter for concern for all of us. I have no plan for a debate on that matter at this time.  I note that Senator Costello has seconded the motion for a debate on item No. 80.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan talked about the future of the River Foyle.  I have no plans for a debate on that matter.  Senator Jackman referred to item No. 6 &mdash; International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, 1990.  I have referred to that already.  Certainly we will have plenty of opportunity to discuss that Bill when it comes before the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Hederman asked for a debate on local government legislation.  My understanding is that reports are still being compiled and I do not know when legislation will be completed; certainly it will not be before Christmas.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte raised a number of points on motion No. 82 on the Order Paper.  Although that motion is in the names of Fine Gael Senators it is suitable and appropriate to Private Members' time, and perhaps it should be considered in that context.  Senator Harte also referred to the juvenile in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullen referred to the Environmental Protection Agency and I have replied to that.  I am very anxious that we would have this Bill with us for initiation and I am keeping my fingers crossed that that will happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell referred to the election of Deputy John Bruton and I, too, would like to wish him well in his new role.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to overseas aid and to item No. 80 on the Order Paper. She also asked about the televising of <Col N="1540" /> proceedings of the House.  I have given this information on a previous occasion. My understanding is that we will have in-House televising towards the end of November and broadcasting proper should begin when we resume after Christmas.  The first official telecast from the Dáil will be on Budget day and I understand that the Seanad will start sometime after that, probably in February or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle also asked for a debate on the plight of fishermen.  I have no plans for that but I repeat the Senator will have an opportunity to raise it during Private Members' time.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the placing of the TVs in the Chamber and the Cathaoirleach has replied to that.  He also referred to casual trading, to the child in Mountjoy, and to education.  I have noted what he said but I cannot do anything about the advice that is given to the Government.  I have noted what he said on item No. 6 and, as I have indicated to other Senators, I hope that item will be taken next week and we can have a debate on it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe's point is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to Senator Ó Foighil attending a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but, in fairness, I would have to say there are excellent persons on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges such as Senators Manning, Doyle and Naughten.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> Senator McKenna's point is not appropriate to the Order of Business. Senator Staunton referred to Deputy John Bruton and to such matters as the TV cameras and health.  Again, I am not aware of the formation of a foreign affairs committee.  Senator Haughey's point was not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise a point of order.  I did not wish to interrupt the Leader of the House while he was speaking. Could you guide us as to whether it was correct for the Leader to refer to the absence of Senator Hederman?  It may have been a little bit unwise, indeed slightly discourteous, to ask a question about somebody who is not here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice that the absence of Senators be referred to.  I think it was done in a way that was intended to be very conscious of the importance of the question put and he was acknowledging in a very courteous way the desirability of emphasising what she wanted to hear by way of his reply. A misunderstanding of that is being mischievous where the Senator is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed Senator Norris should refer to that matter.  The fact is that Senator Hederman came to me and indicated she had to leave the Chamber as she has to catch a plane. She apologised for having to leave the Chamber and she asked me to give the reply.</P>

Facilities are being provided in this Chamber to allow all Members to be able to debate and discuss matters in the two official languages provided for by the Constitution. In future, I will not allow any remarks to be made that are intended to cause embarrassment.  I thank the Leader of the House for the courtesy of his reply and I thank the House for their support in that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Second reading of this Bill, which is a very specific piece of legislation, entitled the Altamont (Amendment of Deed of Trust) Bill, 1990.  Many Senators are probably aware of the personal situation of the Honourble Jeremy Altamont and his family.  The Bill before us will deal specifically with this trust and this trust only.</P>
      <P>In this country we have no Act enabling us to vary trusts once they have been formed.  In the UK in 1957, they introduced the Variations of Trust Act which allows changes in trusts if there are changes in circumstances since those trusts were initially formed.  In 1963 Jeremy Altamont, as a relatively young man, entered into and was the signatory to a trust which provided that his son, and only his eldest son, would be the benefactor of the Sligo estate and all the assets therein contained.  As is now history, Jeremy Altamont is a happily married man with five daughters and no plans for any further family.  He has now tied himself inadvertently into a trust where his assets can only go to a notional eldest son at this stage.  This Bill is specifically to deal with such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently, in law, a man is considered capable of begetting a son as long as he is alive &mdash; even at 100 years of age. The legal opinion in the country, and indeed the Bank of Ireland trustees who are the trustees of this particular trust, will still argue that it is in theory possible for Lord Altamont to produce a son even at this stage.  In practice, that is not likely to be so as is agreed by both of the Altamonts and as a result he is very anxious that he is allowed to provide for his five daughters while he is still living.  He is precluded from doing so by the trust he signed in 1963.  As he says himself, it has been his personal agony that inadvertently, as a young man without knowing what the future would bring, he tied himself and his wife and five daughters into this position.  It is a question of equal rights.  Very few in this day and age, in 1990, in a similar position with assets such as this family, would tie everything down <Col N="1545" /> to a sole heir, a sole son.  Times have changed in the 30 odd years that have gone by and this family's circumstances are quite different to what they might have been considered to be in 1963 when the trust was signed.</P>
    <P>If a provision had been included in the original trust document to allow change if circumstances changed, this Private Members Bill before the House would not have been necessary.  No provision was entered into at the time.  I suppose one could question the legal advice available, but one must remember the legal climate in the early sixties pertaining to people who had property in Ireland.  As a young man, the signatory treated the trust document much as any of us would treat the signing of a will.  He assumed it would be possible to change it given changing circumstances over the years. He was unaware that the legislation pertaining to trusts in this country would preclude him from changing any aspect of the trust if his circumstances changed. Hence, with senior counsel's opinion, and having spoken at length to the trustees of the Bank of Ireland in relation to this trust, this is the course of action he is now taking and which, on face value, we support.  I can see absolutely no reason why any parent should be precluded from looking after their daughters in their lifetime because of archaic legislation that has not been updated.  I have no difficulty in supporting the principle.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us, as I said, pertains only to this family's circumstances and the assets referred to in this trust, but there are many trusts that have run into similar difficulties or difficulties of one kind or another.  The question that is being begged by the procedure we have had to enter into here today is that we look at our trust legislation and have on our Statute Book a Variations of Trust Act so that without going through this rather cumbersome process of a Private Members' Bill other families who find themselves in changed circumstances, but tied into a system that no longer suits the family needs, may, given certain conditions laid down under a Variations <Col N="1546" /> of Trust Act, change without resorting to a Private Members' Bill.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, legal opinion in this area needs looking at again.  There is no doubt that legal people in this country are operating to what are on our Statute Books. Changes must start in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Even if, in a situation such as we have now, a vasectomy was contemplated to prove conclusively to the legal people that no further children were possible and/or wanted, as a result, they would not accept that.  The legal opinion says, no, that is not sufficient because there is a 50 per cent to 60 per cent chance of it being reversible even before the latest information on a totally reversible procedure.  Nothing has been spared in researching possible ways of changing this trust before the family, through their legal advisers, have had to resort to a Private Members' Bill.  As such we support the Bill.  I feel very strongly that Jeremy Altamont should be in a position to look after his five daughters and their familes and to look after his wife during his lifetime if he should so wish.</P>
    <P>There is another anomaly.  This trust was signed in 1963.  We produced a Succession Act in 1967 which, to my knowledge, was retrospective only for three years.  There is a year between when the trust was signed and the operation of the Succession Act would effectively come into operation.  If, indeed, Jeremy Altamont had had a son, the trust would have had the effect of overriding any of the principles in the Succession Act about which we all feel very strongly.  His wife and five daughters would have been cut out of any will, notwithstanding the issues in the Succession Act to look after his wife/spouse and all the family.  If they had a male child in this family, because of the date of the signature of the trust, the Succession Act would not apply to it and the five daughters and the wife would have been excluded from all inheritance.</P>
    <P>Basically the family want to get the family assets to treat them under the normal succession procedures for his wife and five daughters.  The Bank of Ireland trustees, I understand, will be opposing this legislation.  They have no choice but <Col N="1547" /> to oppose it.  They are there to act and to protect the interests of a notional son not yet born, and never likely to be born. One can understand the role they have to play given the situation they find themselves in.  They will oppose the Bill on principle.  That is understandable.  I support the Bill very strongly on principle also, so that the family can put their assets into a position of treating them normally for the benefit of the wife and family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this.  As Senator Doyle said, Lord Altamont entered into a family settlement in 1963, which was customary at the time, and made provision that his eldest son would succeed to the Sligo estate of which Westport House forms a part.  The effect of the settlement is that now, because he does not have a son, but has a wife and five daughters, he is precluded from making any provision for them during his lifetime.  That is what this Bill hopes to do.  He can, of course, make a will and make necessary provisions for his family, but this will only apply after his death whereas he considers that he should be allowed to make provisions during his lifetime and that his wife and daughters should not be denied benefit because of some archaic custom.  I tend to agree with this.  In the event of his death he can deal with the assets by will but he wants to do it now while he is alive.  That seems a reasonable enough thing to want to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude in 1963 was completely different from what the attitude is now and having got advice he discovered the only way he could change the terms of the family settlement of 1963 was through the introduction of this Private Bill which is being put forward in the Seanad today. This is to give him access to the estate and the assets so that he can make provision for his family.  It does not seem reasonable that they should be disentitled simply because they are ladies.  I agree with this.  As Senator Doyle said, the Bank of Ireland trustees will object. They have no option but to object being the trustees of the particular settlement. <Col N="1548" /> Their objection will not be a very strong one.  They may, in fact, withdraw it in the end.  The trustees, in their original objections, did state that Lord Altamont could still father a son and they even mentioned that he could donate sperm for future use in the sperm bank.  This is something he could do, but I do not think he intends to do it.  He actually agreed to have a vasectomy and become sterilised if this would allow him to settle these assets on his wife and children.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary because we do not have any legislation which allows for the breaking of trusts.  In the British Parliament in 1958 they introduced a Bill which allowed them to do this but we do not have such legislation here so we have to go through this procedure.  That is not something that should cause us any great agony.  If we agree that the man owns the estate, then he should be allowed to settle it on his wife and children during his lifetime, and perhaps break this settlement. There have been some objections put to me that it would be better if the land was given over to the community and settled because there may be some dispute as to how he got the land in the first place, but that is going back into the far reaches of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few brief remarks about this.  I do so with a certain delicacy because this is a family matter.  I do not think it is appropriate to refer in any detail to the possible hypothetical sex life of the noble marquis. However, I am concerned about a couple of things of a technical nature. Unusually, we did not get copies of this Bill.  I do not want to criticise the staff of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of that. This is quite a technical Bill.  Without wishing to oppose it directly, I would like to express a little bit of concern about it because it seems to me that what we are dealing with is a situation where there should be reform of the trustee laws rather than an attempt to introduce a special Bill for one private person.  I do not think that legislation ought to be contemplated simply for the individual; it should be for the entire people of the country.  I recognise that this is a particular case and I assume it is a particular case not because the noble marquis is a member of what is now an extinct peerage of Ireland, but because he holds assets, including some of the very important cultural inheritance of this country, notably Westport House and the parklands surrounding it and its contents which we are all grateful to the Browne family for maintaining and for opening to the public.  Here there is another thing that ought to be attacked, that is the way in which these houses are taxed to their destruction.  If we want to recognise the contribution that these places make to the life of the country, instead of introducing Bills to deal with individual cases, we ought to be making proper provision. I do not think that this is an attempt to evade the tax provisions; it is an attempt to break a trust.  As I understand from reading the newspapers, the intention is to break a trust so that Lord Altamont can use funds which are not currently at his disposal because of the nature of the trust in order to invest in the estate and <Col N="1550" /> to protect the estate as part of the inheritance of his daughters.  This, in my opinion, would not be necessary if there was a proper understanding of the role of these houses in the cultural life of our country and of the potential as a major tourist draw.  I hope that the Government will address this particular problem.</P>
      <P>The next point I would like to make is that the trustees are opposing this.  There has, I understand, already been a court case in which the Bank of Ireland, acting as trustees of the estate, opposed it.  I am not in possession of any information about the character of the person who wishes to break the trust, and I would not in any sense wish to cast aspersions on his character, but we have had no explanation in any detail as to what precisely it is intended to do with moneys which could be obtained by the breaking of the trust other than to say it is to make provision for his daughters and that they should be treated equally and not discriminated against on the basis of gender, with all of which we agree.  Do we not have a further responsibility before we introduce and pass legislstion which could be instrumental in breaking the trust to ensure that there will be a wise employment of these funds subsquently?  I make this point without wishing to suggest in the slightest way that there is any doubt about the character, the business acumen, the parental responsibility of Lord Altamont, I have no doubt that he is exemplary in these matters, but we simply have not been given any information on it.  I think it would be rather unwise to pass a Bill of this nature unless we have some information and are satisfied that it is in the best interests of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this because &mdash; and this will be my final point &mdash; reading the newspaper reports suggested to me, not from any defective character or anything else, that there was a division of opinion among the trustees as to whether the kinds of investment of capital in the Westport estate that were apparently contemplated by the Marquis of Sligo, or the Earl of Altamont &mdash; I forget what his correct title is &mdash; were in fact the most productive <Col N="1551" /> employment of the money.  It may well be, as Senator Doyle said, that the bank has a technical obligation to oppose.  It seemed to me, however, that there might be a little bit more than that.  It may be a question of business judgment, although in this week of all weeks for the Bank of Ireland to express concern about the business judgment of an individual does take a kind of Westport biscuit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody, in principle, could do other than have sympathy with the family.  I do not even want to mention the name of the family although Senator Doyle, of necessity, mentioned them. There are issues that, in a proper and humane ways and with proper respect for the privacy of the family, deserve to be discussed.  If this problem exists, should we not deal with it by proper legislation? Will there be a succession of unfortunate families who find themselves in this rather peculiar position having to go through the extraordinary procedure of introducing a private Bill?  Do we not need proper legislation to deal with it?</P>
      <P>I would also have to inquire &mdash; and I want to do it with some care &mdash; why precisely a trust was set up.  Was it to do with understandable concern for the welfare of children or was it to do with the minimisation, perhaps, of obligation to the Revenue Commissioners at some future date?  Those sort of things arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say too, that in the light of what I know to be the legislation in this country to deal with the equality of the sexes and also the status of children I would like an explanation from somebody at some stage.  I appreciate the trust predates the legislation but at least I would like to be assured that from now on trusts which would appear to discriminate between children on the basis of their sex are no longer legal or possible.  Can somebody, presumably from the Government side, give me a categorical assurance that it is no longer legally possible to set up a trust which effectively discriminates between the children of the person setting up the trust on the basis of their sex?  Is that still a legal possibility?  Is it still something <Col N="1552" /> that can be done in spite of equality legislation, in spite of the Succession Act and in spite of the Status of Children Act which is in force for some two or three years?  These are the sort of issues that arise out of the difficulties that arose for one specific family.</P>
    <P>I would like also to put on record my own view.  I have absolutely no problems at all about a trust which involves the transfer of the ownership of property. I have considerable reservations about page three of the Bill regarding a trust which confers ownership of something as intangible as fishing rights; I do not accept there is a right to private ownership of such a fundamental natural resource in this country.  Therefore, there is a fundamental distinction between the ownership of property and land and other things which, in spite of the image that I sometimes have, I regard as the property of individuals to be disposed of by themselves within the taxation code of the country.  Fisheries are a different thing and it seems to me there is a slight anomaly in this House introducing legislation to secure for family the future ownership of what is essentially a national resource which in many cases will exist irrespective of what contribution that particular family make to the well being of that resource and which will probably exist because of the work of many other people, including the State, to sustain that and protect that resource.  That perhaps is by way of a smaller point.</P>
    <P>I would like to know essentially about this legislation why is it that this issue and this family have at their disposal and are given to their disposal the right to have legislation introduced to remedy a quite wrong, unfair, improper although admittedly legal, anomaly when there are perhaps thousands of people around the country who are the victims of anomalies of the law in all sorts of other areas?  They have to wait in a long queue perhaps for five, ten, 15 or 20 years to have their positions sorted out.  A classic example would be children born to parents who were not married who, until the Status of Children Act, had virtually no legal rights <Col N="1553" /> and had to wait until that legislative reform took its place in the queue.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to be assured that there are specific reasons of considerable and fundamental national importance which justify this legislation being introduced ahead of a queue of reforming legislation in all sorts of areas to do with taxation, welfare and all sorts of areas where people lose out on what they thought to be their own rights because of anomalies, contradictions, internal conflicts within legislation and which have to wait for their position in the queue.</P>
    <P>I have no problems about the principle of this but I know the delays in introducing reforming legislation in this country, I know how slow it is, I know how many people have to wait and see their lives go by while waiting for reforming legislation that would have changed their own circumstances.  There are all sorts of areas, family breakdown, welfare anomalies.  There are long lists of areas where families and people have to wait because of the logistics and the physical impossibility of moving up in the queue to get the legislation dealt with.</P>
    <P>What is so fundamental about this family's circumstances that actually enables them, has facilitated them or has provided them with the right to move through that queue to introduce a private Bill?  Is there something out there that people are entitled to know about which could enable other people to do the same thing, to have a private Bill introduced? Is it to do with access to good legal advice, to resources to finance this or what?  The discomfort and inconvenience of the family is something that all of us would sympathise with and be at one with in any attempt to remedy it.  The choices that were made somewhere along the way that enabled this anomaly to jump the queue of perhaps a thousand anomalous situations in law, many of them affecting large numbers of people, is a question to which we should get an answer.  At the end of it all, why this legislation, why this anomaly, why this family before all the others?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, have certain questions which are causing me some difficulty. When I read this legislation and saw it on the Order Paper all that came to mind was the arrangement for a divorce in Victorian England when people with money were able to operate through private legislation through the Houses of Parliament in order to get a dissolution of a marriage.</P>
      <P>There is something about this arrangement here which makes me very uneasy. It makes me uneasy that it seems certain people, a certain person or a certain family apparently have been able to initiate a Private Members' Bill in the House, I want to know why this case above all others is the one that we should be dealing with?  I understand &mdash; I seek your guidance on this &mdash; that an objection from any Members of the House would halt the Bill at this stage.  I would like a ruling on that because I certainly do not want to cause hardship for any family of any class or in any place.  At the same time, you will understand that there are problems here for us.  Legislation itself is a most interesting vignette of a discriminatory insight into a discriminatory family arrangement which I would have thought was something of another age.</P>
      <P>I find it impossible to believe that such an arrangement, discriminatory by its nature because it does not even refer to names, discriminatory purely on the basis of sex, does not fall retrospectively on the basis of legislation particularly in the mid-seventies that has come into being in the meantime.  I understand indeed that this is not the case.  I find that to be a flaw in the legislation that was passed at that time.  It also brings to mind my profound belief that case law is bad law and that individual cases in the end of the day make bad law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be just as easy for us and just as quick for us to put through legislation introducing general principles which would allow such changes to take place without difficulty.  I would like to have an answer to that question.  Why is it that we cannot introduce legislation which would take up precisely the same amount of time of both Houses, but would at least <Col N="1555" /> have the effect of releasing other trusts which have found themselves bound into unacceptable and unworkable arrangements? I would like to know the position on that.</P>
    <P>On the question of the first undivided moiety, which is referred to, I had occasion about five years ago to take a group of 60 school children from Dublin to west Mayo, that beautiful part just north of the fiord, Killary Harbour, where they spent a very happy weekend in the Delphi Adventure Centre run by a very well known Gaelic footballer from that county.  That was a very successful operation except for one aspect &mdash; he did not have access to certain waters which are owned by the Delphi Fishery.  Those 60 children who were with me could not understand why they could not fish the water &mdash; this was before the rod licence issue &mdash; and neither could I.  I felt it was a relic of an age, of a part of our history that was long past.  Today, I am participating in the further exclusion of those young people who accompanied me on that weekend and others from this also.  I know that is by the way but, nevertheless, we have hand and part in it.</P>
    <P>What will happen if the Bill is not enacted or passed through this House? My understanding is that, on the death of a person making the trust, the trust would revert to the estate of that person and would then be divided properly among the members of the family.  That seems much more equitable than many of the arrangements that the person who thought up this selection of division of property might come up with in the future.  I do not know the person or the family involved, but I know that the legislation protects all the people whom this legislation seeks to protect, the only difference being that the person who wishes to have the trust changed now wants to have access to the money.  The decision we take today might allow the dismantling of this trust, might allow the money to be badly invested in some project which would fritter it away and leave nothing for the proposed beneficiaries. <Col N="1556" /> In that case we would be doing a bad day's work.  I do not have the knowledge Senator Norris has regarding Mr. Altamont who has added the title to the family surname by deed poll.  If Mr. Altamont decides to reinvest the money, it might be to the detriment of his family at the end of the day.  We should also be aware of that.  I would also like to know why the trustees of the Bank of Ireland feel they have to oppose it.  We have been told they are opposing it but their opposition has not been outlined.  Are they afraid of where the money might go?  Are they afraid for the long term effects on the family?  What is their fear? We are entitled to know.  We are not experts in the area of trust law or in any aspect of it and, therefore, we would like to know where this might lead us.</P>
    <P>If the Government support this legislation, we are entitled to hear why a Bill has not been introduced to allow the dismantling of trusts.  If the Government support this Bill, why can we not take out the names and make it a general Bill? If, through a process of amendment on Committee Stage, I delete all the names, and references to aspects of wealth, money or property, could I then change it to a general Bill which might have a wider application to other people?  Is that possible?  Can we widen the Bill to give access to other people who do not have access at present to the operation of this House?</P>
    <P>I do not object to something that will improve the position within a family, but, at the end of a day, exceptional cases make bad law.  If there are underlying problems, let us address them and decide what the next step might be.  Are we now opening the floodgates?  Are we looking forward to ten more of these Bills in the next session?  Who will stop another ten Bills being introduced in the next session? Whose decision was it to allow the Bill to come this far?  Where does it begin?  Who made the decision to tackle it?  Were other people seeking similar arrangements from the House?  Did we decide on this one as opposed to others?  I do not know.  These are questions which will be asked by other people.  In the same <Col N="1557" /> way that one should not tip the cap to the upper class, neither should one discriminate against them.  I want to be very careful with my use of words here.  I would be sensitive to the challenge, the decision or the charge that, as a House, we are reacting to the needs of the landed gentry.  I am not saying that in any demeaning way to the person referred to in the Bill; I do not know the person and I want to make it clear that I am not personalising it except in as much as there is a name in the legislation.  Why is it that name as opposed to others in the legislation?  Members will be asked about similar problems in other areas.  I know families who are inarticulate, who do not have the legal resources to write up this legislation.  As I have been reminded, in the last three weeks for instance, we have had two different families outside the gates of the House, one a man from Cork on hunger strike seeking to get back the only property he or his family ever had, and there is another woman outside the gate today protesting about land that has been in her family for five centuries &mdash; including seven generations of farriers and blacksmiths &mdash; and now by some convolution of the law, finds she does not have access to her own property.  Can these people have access to this House? Is this access restricted to people who are titled?  Is it restricted to people who are important?  Is it restricted to people who have money?  Is it restricted to people who can put the resources together in order to get the legal brains to draft legislation which then comes to us?  How does it come to us?</P>
    <P>We discussed this morning the need for the initiation of legislation.  We have talked in both Houses and in all our committees of the need to develop progressive social legislation.  This social legislation which is looking after the needs of one family.  How can we justify giving time to this when we do not have the time to deal with other aspects of social legislation?  For the past, ten years I have been asking why we are the only country in Europe which does not have an education Act, for instance.  The Minister for Education has been saying for three <Col N="1558" /> years that she looks forward to the introduction on an education Bill.  We would be far better off here today discussing an education Bill.  I understand that is not relevant to a Second Stage speech but I merely using it as an example.  The people who elected me could say that: if I have the time to look after the hereditary arrangements for Lord Altamont while their schools have over-crowded classrooms, and are under funded, would I not be better dealing with aspects like that?  I could not argue with that.  I need to know the answers to those questions. I think we are establishing a very dangerous precedent.</P>
    <P>I want to know what to do when my telephone rings, or more likely when the telephones of Members on the Government side ring and influential people say &ldquo;I believe you passed legislation last week to allow Lord Altamont change his trust fund from his notional son to his very real daughters.  Will you now do something for me?  Will you allow me make whatever changes are required because I am tied into some deed or some trust fund?&rdquo; I am worried.  This is unprecedented.  I do not mind establishing a precedent but this establishes a precedent which is not very attractive. We seem to be responding to the needs of the wealthy and the titled.  We seem to be giving our time to the introduction of legislation on issues such as this instead of concentrating on the poor, the services they need and many other matters.  We always make judgments on a day-to-day basis on which legislation to debate.  I am not saying that in a criticism of the Government and I would not want it to be seen in that way.  Neither am I making that objection to the Leas-Chathaoirleach whom, I understand, by role and virtue of office is required to deal with this type of legislation.  However, I have serious reservations about what we are doing today.  This is a mirror image of what happened in Victorian times when wealthy families could acquire a divorce by bringing a private Bill to the Houses of Parliament, but only the wealthy could do that.  This seems to be precisely what is happening here today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> I also have difficulty with the passing on of the fishing rights of the Delphi fishery to anybody.  They should be owned by the State and there should be access for the people, a point raised by my colleague, Senator Ryan.</P>
    <P>The person who devised such a discriminatory arrangement for his or her potential family in 1963 should have made it clear that whatever future arrangement he proposed to put into place was not anywhere near as discriminatory because if we do nothing, eventually the value of this trust will go into the estate of the person who set up the trust and will be divided fairly among his surviving family.  At least that will be fair and acceptable to all.  However, leaving the Bill aside, we should not establish a precedent here by dealing with individual items in legislation.  I do not like it.  It is a fire brigade action dealing with the wrong kind of problem.  I have raised quite a number of questions and I look forward to hearing answers to them.</P>

      <P>The position at the moment is that we are dealing with the Second Stage, as moved by the Leas-Chathaoirleach. Senator O'Toole asked if I would make a ruling on the position in the event of an objection being raised to the Second Stage reading or to anything contained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that any Member can object but the manner by which Second Stage is agreed is a matter for the House in the normal way.  Nevertheless, some fundamental matters pertaining to this legislation have been raised by Members. There are serious questions of clarification and interpretation and the impact of this legislation in the context of legislation passed over the years.  Many issues have been referred to in a considerable way by the contributors.  I have the authority at this stage to defer any further discussion on Second Stage and I request the Leas-Cathaoirleach to seek full clarification and briefing by way of an explanatory memorandum which will allow, on the resumption of Second <Col N="1560" /> Stage, for a more informed understanding of the background to this Bill and all the matters that are causing concern and reservation for the Members.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the manner in which superannuation schemes made under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928 are given statutory effect.</P>
      <P>At present, all superannuation schemes for national and secondary teachers made under that Act must be confirmed by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This Bill would dispense with the requirement that schemes be confirmed by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would provide instead that they be laid before each House and have immediate statutory effect, unless within 21 days on which either House has sat a resolution annulling a scheme is passed, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>This is purely an enabling mechanism. All pensions are being paid.  This measure will put everything in order.  There is no deep-seated philosophy or any complex thought about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 2 of the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928 the Minister for Education may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, prepare superannuation schemes in relation to any particular class or classses of teachers.  The classes of teachers in respect of which superannuation schemes have been prepared and effected under the Act are national teachers and secondary techers, including teachers in comprehensive schools.  I should mention for the information of the House that the superannuation terms of vocational teachers do not come within the ambit of this Act. Such matters are being addressed in the Dáil.  For superannuation purposes vocational teachers are local authority officers and their superannuation terms are governed by schemes made under the Local Government (Superannuation) <Col N="1562" /> Act, 1980 for which my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has responsibility.</P>
    <P>At present under section 5 of the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, each and every superannuation scheme made under that Act, including a scheme which amends or revokes a previous scheme or schemes, must be laid before the Oireachtas and be confirmed by resolution of each House before it can come into force.</P>
    <P>By their nature superannuation schemes are very complex.  Since 1929, when the principal scheme for secondary teachers came into effect, 32 schemes have been made and effected under the Act.  These schemes comprise a principal scheme and 18 amending schemes covering the superannuation provisions of secondary teachers.  The national school teachers' superannuation provisions are contained in a principal scheme, made in 1934, and 12 amending schemes.  The House will appreciate that, given the large number of schemes involved, any amendment to the teachers' superannuation code is a technically complex matter.</P>
    <P>The last statutory amendments to the national and secondary teachers' superannuation schemes were made in 1972. Since then, following negotiations at the conciliation council for teachers, the superannuation benefits of teachers have been improved in line with improvements which have taken place in the public service generally.  These have been implemented by my Department on an administrative basis, in advance of the making of the necessary statutory schemes.  I can assure the House that teachers who have retired have been given the benefit of these improvements as they were implemented and that all teachers who are on pension have received their full entitlements.</P>
    <P>Work is currently proceeding in my Department on the drafting of the necessary schemes which will have the effect of updating on a statutory basis the superannuation terms of both national and secondary teachers.  Six schemes in all are involved, covering the superannuation <Col N="1563" /> entitlements of teachers, their spouses and their children.</P>
    <P>The procedures under this Bill will facilitate the making of these schemes and any future schemes which might be made.  They will assist the Minister of the day in minimising the delay in giving statutory effect to changes in the teachers' superannuation code.  In other words, when changes come and more money is given, they will receive it quicker.</P>
    <P>These simplified procedures are in line with those obtaining for public servants generally.  For example, until 1976 the superannuation arrangements for civil servants were contained in various Acts dating from 1834.  Amendments to the civil service superannuation code could only be made by amending legislation. Then in 1976, the statutory basis for the code was changed to enable the Minister for Finance to make schemes amending the superannuation terms of civil servants, and having these schemes confirmed by the Oireachtas in the simplified manner now proposed for teachers.  Identical statutory provisions were introduced for local authority staff, including vocational teachers under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1980.  In the case of the Defence Forces the requirement of a positive resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas to confirm their pensions schemes was changed in 1975.  In the wider public sector, the revised procedures are now standard.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that what is proposed is an enabling measure simplifying the procedure for promulgating superannuation schemes for teachers.  I can assure the House that there will be no change in the statutory functions of the Minister for Finance, in that all schemes made under the Act as amended will continue to require the consent of that Minister.</P>
    <P>I am also satisfied that there will be no diminution in control by the Oireachtas since the revised procedures provide that any scheme made under the Act must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> In conclusion, I should like to mention that in the course of the preparation of this Bill, the opportunity has been taken to examine the provisions of the 1928 Act.  I am satisfied that the Act is operating satisfactorily in the light of current needs and that no other amendments to it are necessary.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  Like many people involved in education on this side of the House I hope we will see more of the Minister in the future.  I welcome her initiative in putting superannuation schemes for teachers on a statutory basis. A long time has passed since 1928 and the last statutory amendments were made in 1972.  Superannuation has implications for pensions, early retirement, voluntary redundancy and many other things that I will address.  We are all very much aware of the difficulties experienced by teachers today which have made them seek improvements in their pension schemes to allow them to retire at an earlier stage. They are anxious that improved pension provisions would be introduced through amendments to the existing superannuation schemes to allow them to retire early and also to ensure that they could obtain a pension <i>pro rata</i> to their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to amendments that will be forthcoming if the moneys are available but an early retirement scheme would give opportunities to young teachers from third level institutions.  It would open up teaching to young teachers trained in modern methods, technological skills, language developments, not just in French as has been the case up to now but in German and Italian. It would give opportunities to teachers with entrepreneurial skills as the economy calls out for entrepreneurs to create employment.  We, the older teachers in the system, did not have the opportunity of training in that area.  All those skills are vital to ensure that we have a vibrant education system.  Sadly, at the moment these well trained, highly skilled young teachers have to emigrate if they wish to <Col N="1565" /> teach.  I do not need to go into the number of teachers who, according to the newspapers, are finding employment in British schools.  The British education system has come under severe attack over the years and the status of teachers there, unlike here, is abominably low.  However, our young teachers are seeking jobs in European and British schools.  It is sad that if they wish to continue teaching they have to go abroad or else enter other professions. They are a plus for other professions because teachers can use their skills not just in teaching but in other walks of life.  I know this does not come under the ambit of the pensions and superannuation schemes we are discussing, but early retirement for teachers would create opportunities for employment.</P>
    <P>Another area causing concern because of the low level of recruitment of young teachers into the system is the age profile. I am now a full-time politician and have left teaching and I am saddened at that, but looking at the age profile in our own school &mdash; I am not disclosing my age but I am certainly not a bright young thing entering the system full of idealism and what one can offer at that stage of a career &mdash; the average would tip the scales in favour of the older, more experienced teacher rather than the young teacher. When a position becomes vacant &mdash; it is rare at the moment, particularly when employing substitute teachers &mdash; it is galling to find that when the young recruit who is a highly skilled language teacher or is skilled in advanced technoloy or whatever, comes into the system he or she stays for one year and then has to leave taking their skills with them.  That happens because of the lack of job prospects.</P>
    <P>Then, as I said, they go into other areas of employment or emigrate.  That is the picture that is unfolding, not just in relation to post-primary schools, but also to primary schools.  Obviously, the post-primary sector includes voluntary secondary schools, comprehensive schools, community schools and VEC schools. With 1992 looming &mdash; it is mentioned always in terms of economics, industrial <Col N="1566" /> development, agriculture and multinationals &mdash; teaching has to be seen in the European context where easy mobility will facilitate teachers.  We need these teachers to be role models for our young people in tackling the challenges of the nineties and, indeed, the next century.</P>
    <P>The arguments for the introduction of amendments to the pensions scheme to provide for early retirement options were reinforced by the recent experience when early retirement and voluntary redundancy were offered to some teachers and a large number of teachers looked for voluntary redundancy.  That scheme was introduced by the Government to reduce the number employed in the public service. I understand that 2,300 members of the INTO, 939 ASTI members and 950 TUI members applied.  Out of those members 375 INTO members were given voluntary redundancy, leaving almost 2,000 teachers who wanted to leave; voluntary redundancy was given to 138 ASTI applicants and 58 TUI members.  Those remaining have to continue in a job they find increasingly difficult.  That leads me to the whole concept of stress, the major factor associated with today's occupational problems among teachers.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that teachers are perceived by the general public as having a soft job.  The last time we debated education on the Adjournment the Minister agreed with others who had been teaching at primary, second and third level they were under greater stess when teaching than in politics.  I still agree with that, though it is something the general public do not seem to appreciate.  They would need to spend one day in an overcrowded pre-fab, or any classroom for that matter, whether at primary level or secondary level to see that attitudes to authority and to authority figures today are far different to what they were when they were at school.  Unfortunately, parents think in terms of their educational experience and stress is brushed aside.  It is not just an occupational problem among Irish teachers, there is growing evidence of it internationally.  The studies are there to show that stress in <Col N="1567" /> teachers is increasing.  If one compares teaching to other professions, teaching comes out as having one of the highest levels of occupational stress.  That is a fact.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Going back to the sources of stress I was talking about, the sources are work-related and they have to do with many things &mdash; conditions of service, day-to-day problems in teaching, students' behaviour and discipline. Indeed, we could debate the whole area of discipline at any time here because it opens up so much.  I am sure the Minister would have plenty of say and we would have plenty to say to her on the whole area of discipline.  All of these factors influence the decisions of teachers to seek early retirement and affect the status of the teaching profession generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> I will very briefly go through the areas where one has specific information from overseas in relation to stress and teaching. For instance, in Sweden &mdash; a very liberal country with a good education system which has had an openness for quite some time &mdash; 25 per cent of over 4,000 teachers are teaching under psychological strain.  That is reported in the Council of Europe report, 1982.  An interesting quote from the International Labour Organisation, 1981, concluded that one of the steadily growing problems faced by teachers in their working environment is job-related stress and that many studies in developed countries demostrate that teachers are subject to mental and physical exhaustion caused by the psychological and physical strains of teaching.  In a poll by Gorton in the USA in 1982 it was formed that 35 per cent of public school teachers were dissatisfied with their current jobs and 40 per cent said that, with hindsight, they would not have become teachers.  These are facts that are reported correctly internationally. I have already referred to the low status of teachers in Britain, where research has shown that the source of stress is institutional in nature.  Therefore, there is a need for change, not only by the individual but in the structures of the education system, particularly the structures which govern the conditions of service of teachers.  In Northern Ireland, our closest neighbour, current research had led to demands for longer-term studies because, again, stress has been seen as a cumulative process.  It has been suggested that it is not just during the school year that levels of stress increased but also during the lifetime of the teacher.</P>
    <P>From all of that research it is clear that teaching in the 1980s is a profession under severe pressure and contradictory demands from society.  The last quote I will give relates to an International Labour Organisation report of 1990, describing the plight of the modern teacher in the following terms and obviously giving more credence to what I want to say with regard to early retirement and voluntary redundancy.  The report states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> Rapid advances in technology and the increasing complexity of working life are creating new and heavy responsibilities for education systems &mdash; and for the millions of teachers who work in them.</P>
    <P>I was making a point a few moments ago with regard to rapid advances in technology. I could go on and on about the need for training and retraining of teachers but it is not for debate today. When we do get an education debate, it is something about which we will be talking: the need for resources etc. as the advances in technology and the complexities of working life are creating problems for our teachers.  When this was debated in the Dáil quite a colourful definition of the teacher was offered by Deputy John Browne.  He summed up the needs of today's teachers when he said, in a colourful phrase: &ldquo;Today's teachers need the bravery of a lion, the skill of a psychiatrist, the stamina of a marathon runner, the appeal of Zig and Zag and the patience of Job.&rdquo;&mdash; colourful and very true.  That, better than anything else, illustrates the difficulties of teachers today.</P>
    <P>Another question I would like the Minister to answer is in regard to job-sharing if we are thinking in terms of increased employment and keeping those young teachers in the educational service.  Many teachers are anxious to share their jobs and, of course, it is a very attractive option for those who wish to combine family life and responsibilities with a career in teaching.  If teachers were working half time they surely would qualify for half the pension entitlements with their contributions adjusted <i>pro rata.</i>  Has the Minister seen that in the amendment to the legislation before us?</P>
    <P>An area that will be increasingly important, as demographic trends show a decline in population, concerns extending early retirement to schools with falling numbers that will be closing.  Surely there is a golden opportunity for the Minister to extend early retirement to teachers who are in those schools that will close or schools where there are <Col N="1571" /> amalgamations.  It would be timely for the Minister to offer again voluntary redundancy to those teachers.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister about the transferability of pension entitlements for teachers transferring to other parts of the State sector.  That will be of increasing importance.  If people do not take voluntary redundancy and if they prefer to move into a job in a less stressful area, what will happen to their pension scheme?  Will it be possible for those teachers to move to private companies with pension schemes and to transfer their pension schemes into the private sector?  I know it would involve the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners with regard to taxation and so on but I would be anxious to know if the Minister has included these areas in her amendment to this legislation.</P>
    <P>The last point I would make is one we raised before with the Minister on an Adjournment motion, where we were trying to get rid of anomalies in retirement age.  Under the provision of the present schemes teachers must work for 40 years before they can retire on full pension, which is paid at the rate of half their salary on retirement.  They may retire at 60 on a reduced pension.  Having regard to the references to stress and accumulated problems, very few actually want to stay to 60, let alone 65.  Teachers in national schools may also retire on a reduced pension after 35 years service provided they have reached 55 years of age.  This option is not available to other teachers.  It was raised before and the Minister said that funding would be necessary.  I think in relation to the amendment to this Bill it would be important for the Minister to set out guidelines as to whether she intends introducing the same regulations for post-primary teachers as exist for primary teachers. This would be a start.  When I would like to see, and what other teachers would like to see, would be the retirement age for all reduced to 55.  This would be for two reasons: (1) to allow teachers with the accumulated stress in their lives to move out; and (2) to enable young <Col N="1572" /> teachers with the skills I talked about to enter the ageing force and to revitalise the education system.  I would like the Minister to answer these questions in relation to the amendment to the Bill before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and support this Bill and I thank the Minister for bringing it forward.  This is an enabling measure which will simplify the procedure for promulgating superannuation schemes for teachers and will bring it into line with that obtaining for other public servants.  The Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, is the Principal Act dealing with superannuation schemes for national and secondary teachers, including teachers in community and comprehensive schools.  Under the provisions of that Act all superannuation schemes for these categories of teachers were required to be confirmed by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The purpose of this Bill is to amend the 1928 Act so that this requirement will no longer be necessary.  It will only be necessary in future for such schemes to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. They will then take effect immediately and without the requirement of having to be confirmed by both Houses.</P>
      <P>However, a superannuation scheme laid before the Oireachtas in this manner may be annulled by a resolution passed by either Houses within the following 21 sitting days.  I know it is unlikely that such a situation will ever arise or that the final provision of the proposed new section 6 will ever have to be invoked.  However, it is provided in the proposed new section that if a resolution is passed annulling a scheme then &ldquo;the scheme shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister may not like dealing with hypothetical situations but when we are discussing a Bill all we can do is speculate on situations which may or may not arise.  Let us suppose that at some time in the future a new or revised superannuation scheme is drafted and laid before the Oireachtas, as is required <Col N="1573" /> by this proposed legislation, just at the start of the summer recess.  Such a scheme could not be annulled for some considerable time because neither House of the Oireachtas would be sitting.  In the meantime, all teachers retiring in the months of August or September of that year would have their pension and gratuity entitlements calculated and paid on the basis of the new scheme.  I assume that the provision to which I have referred in the new section 6 is intended to cover such a situation where the superannuation scheme might subsequently be annulled.  As I said, I know it is most unlikely that such a situation will ever arise; but, if it were to arise, I could see it causing immense problems.  It would appear to me that as far as possible any new schemes or revised schemes should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas when the Houses are sitting. This would ensure that the kind of problem to which I have referred could not arise.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it ever arose in the past that a proposed superannuation scheme for teachers, or indeed for any other category of public servants, was rejected or annulled by the Oireachtas. Certainly, since I started teaching many years ago, I cannot recall any superannuation changes which caused major problems.  Most changes were introduced as a result of negotiations or came about through conciliation and arbitration. There was some opposition &mdash; perhaps it would be more correct to say that there were some reservations &mdash; when superannuation contributions were introduced for national teachers about 20 years ago. Prior to that, national teachers did not have to pay superannuation, but a change was recommended by the Ryan Tribunal, which recommended the common basic scale for teachers in the early seventies. Apart from that particular change, all other changes I can remember were generally welcomed by teachers, and some were achieved only after very long campaigns. I recall in particular the very long campaign for the synchronisation of pension increases and salary increases.  There was also a very hard fought campaign by a <Col N="1574" /> small number of teachers for pensionable credit in respect of periods of teacher unemployment in the thirties and forties. Eventually, certain concessions were granted to those teachers who were affected by unemployment in those years.  This is a matter which I feel is going to arise again in the future in respect of more recent teacher unemployment.</P>
    <P>I understand that teaching service abroad is not recognised for pension purposes here and, of course, career breaks are not eligible for pensionable credit. These are areas too which should be looked at in view of the way in which a teacher's subsequent teaching can benefit from the experience gained during a period spent teaching abroad or during a career break.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention and which I would ask her to consider sympathetically.  Some years ago in the late seventies a widows' and children's pension scheme was introduced for male teachers and this subsequently became a spouses' and children's pension scheme in 1981 when it was extended to include female teachers.  At the time these schemes were introduced, teachers who were already in the service could if they wished, by giving the prescribed notice, opt out.  I have no idea of the number of teachers who opted out or what their reasons may have been at the time for doing so, but I do know that in some cases it was a very foolish decision.  I also know that there are some teachers still in the service who opted out and who, if they now had an opportunity, would re-enter the scheme.  I would ask the Minister to examine the feasibility of allowing such teachers into the scheme by giving them one more opportunity to do so.  I am sure it would be a relatively simple matter to work out contribution arrangements which would ensure that there would be no loss to the Exchequer by doing so.</P>
    <P>There is one major anomaly in the area of teachers' pensions which I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister, although probably it is a Department of Social Welfare matter rather than a <Col N="1575" /> Department of Education matter. However, it is a matter which creates considerable discrepancies in the relative financial positions of spouses of deceased teachers.  Since 1974 all permanent lay teachers are compulsorily insured under the Social Welfare Act.  Because this is so, if a male teacher dies his widow and children are entitled in the normal way to a social welfare contributory pension; this is in addition to any teacher superannuation pension scheme for which they may qualify.  If the husband of a female teacher dies she and her children are similarly entitled, provided, of course, that the contribution conditions are satisfied in either her late husband's or her own insurance record.  However, if a female teacher dies, her children and her husband are not entitled to any social welfare pension and they will receive only whatever pension they may be entitled to under the teachers, spouses' and children's pension scheme.  Therefore, the surviving dependants of deceased female teachers are seriously discriminated against financially <i>vis-a-vis</i> their male counterparts.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would bring this matter to the attention of her colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, because to me it would appear to be in breach of European Community Directives on equal treatment for men and women in social security matters, and it can have a considerable impact on the financial situation of the surviving spouses and children of deceased teachers.</P>
    <P>I now come to the main point I want to make in this Second Stage debate.  I refer to the desirability of an acceptable early retirement scheme for teachers.  I have made this case previously to the Minister, Senator Jackman made it today again, and I know the Minister is giving the matter serious consideration.  As I said in the past, I believe that the option should be there for that small minority of long serving teachers who are no longer able to cope with the stress and the strain of working day after day in the classroom.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman went into great detail in relation to the whole problem of stress <Col N="1576" /> as far as teachers are concerned and I do not intend to cover that ground again, but I do believe that an early retirement scheme would benefit this category of teachers, their pupils, their colleagues and, as Senator Jackman rightly pointed out, it would offer an opportunity of introducing more new blood into the profession. I believe that an acceptable early retirement scheme would greatly benefit the education system.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I welcome this Bill.  I look forward to the simplified procedures for which it provides being used over the years ahead to bring forward many superannuation improvements for teachers.  I have made some suggestions to the Minister in relation to areas which I feel should be looked at with a view to making changes.</P>
    <P>There are many other suggestions I could make.  For instance, a very strong case could be made for paying the surviving spouse of a teacher the full pension to which that teacher was entitled.  I have also heard it argued that it should be made possible for a teacher to draw down in advance part of his or her retirement gratuity in order to meet the cost of third level education since teachers' children do not qualify for higher education grants.  The covenanting arrangements which can be availed of, and which the present Minister for Education played a major role in putting in place, have been very helpful to teachers.  They have certainly eased the situation considerably where there is only one child involved in third level education.  However, the burden of having two or possibly three children at third level at the same time creates an impossible situation for many teachers.  If some mechanism were available whereby a teacher in those circumstances could draw down part of his or her retirement gratuity, it would certainly be very helpful.</P>
    <P>I know that if any Minister can be relied on to give serious consideration to the points I have raised it is the present Minister, who since she assumed that office, has proved herself to be an outstanding reforming Minister for</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> Education.  I know that she will give consideration in due course to the points that I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would at the outset like to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, but in the same voice to deplore the fact that the Minister for Education is not here to hear the contributions on this legislation.  It is not often we have legislation on education and I certainly do not remember such an occasion since I became a Senator.  Indeed, I am not certain if there was one in the term of the present Minister for Education.  When we do have a particular Bill before us, I think it is important that the Minister be here in person to hear the debate and to be able to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I do not think that it is fair for Senator Costello to abuse the Minister for Education.  In fact, the Minister for Education, as he well knows, was here and she was called away.  That is why she is being replaced by a very able person in Minister Daly.  Mention has been made on previous occasions of references to people who are not in the Chamber and we had an example of it earlier today.  I do not think it is fair of Senator Costello to carry on in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite appropriate for me to make a statement in relation to the relevant Minister for Education being here.  This is an important matter.  We already discussed on the Order of Business the crisis in education and the importance of the issues that need to be dealt with in education at present and one of them is the area of superannuation and retirement.  Indeed, some very relevant points have been made by speakers on both sides today.  I do not think that my remarks are at all out of line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation is technical.  It is a very short Bill to standardise the area of superannuation both in the Civil Service, which was covered in similar terms in the 1976 legislation, and in the local authority area, which covers the vocational sector in the 1980 legislation.  It is allowing for <Col N="1578" /> a matter to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas without debate as happened previously.  If there is no motion seeking to annul it within 21 days, then it will automatically become law.  I am not so sure that there is any great need for it when we consider that it has been ten years since the last piece of legislation in relation to the other sector of the teaching profession and there has been no amending schemes of superannuation since then.  The timing of this enabling legislation is not a matter of the greatest priority.  However, it is good to see the legislation being standardised that we are all operating, as the teaching profession, at primary level and second level on a common basic scale and that we would seek to have similar types of legislative and statutory provisions for the superannuation scheme as well, at least in terms of its implementation.</P>
    <P>I am torn between the two sides of the trade union movement and the statutory powers, the legislative powers, of this House.  We have again and again bemoaned the fact that matters are dealt with by ministerial order, that matters are simply laid before the House and the opportunity to debate them has not been available in many cases.  That is something that has come up on numerous occasions.  In a sense we are limiting the role of the House in that we cannot now have a wide-ranging debate on matters of superannuation in this House; indeed, it is the function of the House to go into the background, the philosophy and the various provisions.  On the other hand, schemes of superannuation would be negotiated and probably balloted on in advance so the matter would be thoroughly aired.  Therefore there are two sides to the story, but it effectively removes the opportunity for this House to debate and vote on statutory matters that come before it.  It still remains a matter of concern.  It does facilitate but at the same time it restricts.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Senator Mullooly that there could be a scheme introduced in the middle of August and that the benefits might not become available because the House would not be sitting <Col N="1579" /> until October.  However, that is a hypothetical possibility rather than something that has occurred.  The last scheme was introduced as long ago as 18 years and there is no great likelihood of major changes in the schemes being introduced in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer too to the fact that the only function the House will have is to annual the scheme; it is not in a position under the present subsection (6) to amend.  All it can do is by resolution within 21 days annul a scheme that has passed.  That obviously limits the scope for debate or the possibility of the House amending the scheme.  In other words, the scheme either comes <i>in toto</i> or it leaves <i>in toto.</i>  That is a restriction on our activities.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that the wording in the proposed new section 6, in the third line, may not be appropriate.  It reads:</P>
    <P>Every superannuation scheme made under the Act (including a subsequent superannuation scheme revoking or amending a previous scheme)...</P>
    <P>Surely a subsequent scheme does not revoke a previous scheme; all it can do is replace a scheme.  The provision would revoke existing schemes but surely a new scheme cannot revoke an old scheme; it can only replace it.  Unless the Minister wants me to introduce a technical amendment, perhaps the Minister would respond to that and see if that is the appropriate wording in the circumstances.  My real concern is not with the legislation itself; is with what can be done once this legislation is implemented; what new schemes are likely to be introduced downstream; what are we going to facilitate; what will be the benefits of this amending legislation?</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Work is currently proceeding in my Department on the drafting of the necessary schemes which will have the effect of updating on a statutory basis the superannuation terms of both <Col N="1580" /> national and secondary teachers.  Six schemes in all are involved covering the superannuation entitlements of teachers themselves, their spouses and children.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to elucidate then elaborate what is meant by that pregnant word &ldquo;updating&rdquo;.  What type of undating is required?  Are we talking about substantial updating?  Are we talking about revising not in basic terms but simply in terms of language and of chronology rather than any substantial changes?  My concern about the entire scheme is not that it is a bad scheme &mdash; we have a good superannuation scheme for post-primary teachers and for primary teachers, there is no question of that &mdash; but about the extension of the scheme, to what it applies and the eliminations therein.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly in the scheme whereby at the age of 55 years, primary teachers are entitled to take early retirement, on a reduced pension albeit, whereas in the post-primary sector that is not available until the age of 60.  On the one hand, there is one set of teachers who are on a common basic salary scale, on a different retirement scale chronologically. They can retire at the age of 55 and another group cannot retire until they reach the age of 60.  That is an anomaly in the scheme.</P>
    <P>We as negotiators in the trade union movement are prevented from seeking to eliminate that anomaly or indeed, to improve on the scheme in any fashion because the only extent to which we can go on negotiation is to the Department of Education.  We can go only to the teachers' conciliation council.  When we have presented our case at the teachers' conciliation council the answer has been the same: no, we cannot meet any claims you make on grounds of cost &mdash; or some other grounds &mdash; and there is no independent tribunal to which we can appeal.</P>
    <P>The normal procedure in negotiating conditions of work and pay is an automatic process from conciliation council to an arbitrator.  On this issue, we are <Col N="1581" /> stopped short at the Teachers' Conciliation Council, so that the Department of Education will not deal with us adequately and consequently we do not have the independent forum to which to present our case.  That has been the area where we have fallen down again and again in seeking to improve changes in the superannuation scheme.  There has been no substantial change since 1972. Eighteen years have gone by without the possibility of negotiating any improvements in our scheme of superannuation as teachers.</P>
    <P>Could I ask the Minister if what she has said in relation to an updating of the statutory provisions includes a substantial improvement or substantial change in the scheme and will allow us that necessary right to arbitration?</P>
    <P>In terms of other sectors, of course, we are discriminated against.  We get only 50 per cent of our earnings at a particular time, when we get a full pension. Members of the Army, for example, can get a pension at the age of 40 and Garda can get a pension at the age of 50.  There are areas in the public service where, we would argue, there is tremendous room for improvement in terms of negotiation if the appropriate channel were available.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned by Senators Jackman and Mullooly, the question of early retirement is a very moot issue in the teaching profession.  In 1987, when the now Commissioner, Ray MacSharry introduced his scheme for voluntary redundancy, the expectations at the time were that this would be widely available within the teaching profession but we found it was available to a tiny degree. Roughly 10 per cent of the teachers who applied were given the benefits of the scheme.  That was a sore disappointment to many teachers.  There were many teachers who would have availed of the scheme because of pressure, stress and burn out factors that were well documented in other countries, and in various private schemes that are in operation.  I would like to see something introduced along those lines where somebody who is under extreme stress, who simply cannot cope within the school system, would <Col N="1582" /> have the facility of leaving the system. This would be advantageous to the teacher and it would be advantageous to the pupil.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an element of early retirement introduced in the case of school closures and amalgamations. There is in operation in every sector of education a system of redeployment.  If school numbers drop in one area the teachers are redeployed to schools where there is a shortage of teachers or where pupil numbers are growing.  Every year a number of schools are closed and teachers, young and old, willy nilly, are moved from a school in which they have been teaching for perhaps 20 or 30 years to a totally different environment.  A scheme should be available on a limited basis for older teachers of say, 50, 55, 60, 63 or 64 years of age so that they would not have to go into traumatic circumstances to which they would find it difficult to adjust.  The Minister should regard that as a matter for consideration in any new scheme.</P>
    <P>In the three teacher unions we operate a permanent health insurance scheme because of the very high stress levels in the teaching profession.  Because roughly 50 per cent of teachers who retire on permanent disability do so because of burn-out, anxiety, depression, trauma and stress factors as distinct from those who retire because of heart trouble, accidents or whatever, the teaching profession are compelled to provide a service that we pay for on a private basis.  We, as teachers, are providing the service and the pensions for them.  That is something the Department of Education should address.  I do not think it is proper that the responsibility should be left entirely on the profession to provide a permanent health insurance scheme for their members who become disabled through their work as teachers.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly and Senator Jackman referred to demographic trends. That is a very serious development in the primary sector.  Pupil numbers in the post primary sector are still on the increase but will shortly decrease.  The general projection is that demographic trends will <Col N="1583" /> decline rapidly in the late 1990s to the extent that there will be at least 100,000 fewer pupils in the system than there are at present.  Consequently there will be an ageing teacher profile and fewer members coming into the profession.</P>
    <P>The situation is dire at the present time.  Last year in the secondary sector fewer than 10 per cent of our members who qualified for the Higher Diploma in Education got permanent jobs; 90 per cent did not.  About 50 per cent got part-time work in the profession.  Another 20 per cent had to emigrate, largely to London, where there is a surplus of jobs and a shortage of teachers for different reasons.  Some 20 per cent had to emigrate to other countries and a further 20 per cent simply moved into other areas of occupation.  The situation is dramatically changed from what existed ten year ago when every teacher who qualified was given permanent employment almost immediately.  Because of the present situation &mdash; a whole generation of young teachers are not reaching the schools.  It means that teaching is moving fast to being a middle aged profession that still has to deal with pupil numbers which remain the same and consist of young adolescents from the age of 12 to 17 or 18 years.</P>
    <P>The teaching profession is getting older all the time &mdash; the late thirties, forties or fifties.  That requires that the Department of Education in educational as well as humane terms, would put in place a scheme for early retirement.  Certainly, the response from the Minister to date is not sufficient, namely, that she would be prepared to consider a system based on actuarial reckonability whereby the amount that had been put into the scheme by teachers would be granted back on early retirement.  Any scheme must be, as a minimum on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  We would like the Minister seriously to consider early retirement, at least at the age of 50; that a scheme be introduced whereby teachers could leave the profession on reduced pension at the age of 50 but that it would be on the basis of gratuity and a <i>pro rata</i> pension.  That <Col N="1584" /> should be a priority so as to provide a certain degree of mobility and in particular to enable teachers to leave when pressures begin to increase.  That would allow young teachers to be recruited to the service.</P>
    <P>All this question of renegotiating a scheme for early retirement and improved superannuation comes back to inadequate provision for schools.  We have experienced almost a decade of cutbacks by successive Governments, where classes have got larger.  We have the largest classes of any country in the EC. Pupils are in classrooms that were designed at an earlier date, before free education was introduced, for much smaller classes when there was a much smaller pupil-teacher ratio.  Classes have got huge with consequent problems of discipline and stress on the teacher while trying to maintain a modicum of proper behaviour.  This pressure is the result of cutbacks.</P>
    <P>The failure to address the whole area of discipline is another major problem. Corporal punishment has been abolished for a long time and has never been replaced by a code of discipline and certainly our schools require a code of discipline. It is unacceptable that teachers are expected to operate in schools without knowing where they stand legally or procedurally in relation to disciplining pupils.  There is a degree of confusion and teachers find themselves under pressure, not knowing what to do in certain circumstances, not knowing where to turn and not having any code or any reference point.</P>
    <P>Curricular developmnents that have taken place in recent years have likewise put enormous pressures on teachers and they have been introduced without the necessary back-up or in-service training, so that teachers now are teaching new subjects, technology, computers, new languages, without either the back-up or the in-service training to enable them to address the subjects properly.  This has placed enormous burdens on the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>While the legislation facilitates the introduction of new superannuation <Col N="1585" /> schemes and improvements in the schemes, the history so far is that it would not seem that we need such an enabling measure because so little has been done to improve the existing scheme and the mechanism is not in place to allow us to negotiate an improved scheme.  I would welcome this measure if it is the intention of the Minister that it is to be a facilitating measure, a proper enabling measure to allow substantial improvements in our superannuation scheme and to allow the extension of the scheme to areas that we are not allowed to negotiate at the present time.  That is the crux of the problem.</P>
    <P>A statutory mechanism is fine but unless the substantial improvements required are permitted, we are literally going nowhere.  I say to the Minister that, in the context of updating the schemes she should indicate her willingness to negotiate an extension of the superannuation scheme.  First, the question of age and secondly specific areas where there is need for early retirement, are two areas open for negotiation.  Further, would she be prepared to accept an amendment of the conciliation and arbitration scheme so that if an impasse is reached in the conciliation council the negotiations could go that one step further to an independent arbitrator whose findings would be binding?  In that context we would be talking about real progress in the area of teacher superannuation.</P>

      <P>First, I welcome the Minister, Deputy Fahey, to the Chamber. I am rather bemused by Senator Costello's remarks in relation to my point of order when he was berating the Minister for Education for not being present in the Chamber.  He stated that it was an extremely important piece of legislation and it was extremely important that the Minister should be present for it.  Then in his contribution he said he did not think there was any need for the legislation because it was not of great significance. I am bemused by his reply.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It simplifies the process of superannuation schemes for teachers.  It amends the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, under which all superannuation schemes for national and secondary teachers must be confirmed by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives us an opportunity to pay a special tribute to all the teaching professions, and to include the vocational sector which is not included in these schemes, because they have a special scheme under local government which is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.  The Bill provides that schemes will now be laid before each House and have immediate statutory effect.  I take this opportunity to congratulate and compliment the Minister for being the first Minister in over 60 years to bring forward such legislation.  It is evidence of the ability, commitment and the outstanding achievements of this Minister.  She has proved to be an excellent Minister for Education.  It is only right, when we get the opportunity, to pay tribute to the work she is doing.  She has an extremely difficult portfolio.  A number of Senators have referred to the difficulties that are evident in education. I do not know if there is anybody who appreciates those difficulties more than the present Minister for Education.  She was a former teacher and has hands-on knowledge of the whole area of education.</P>
      <P>The legislation being proposed today is very technical because of the multiplicity of amendments that have been made over the years which, again, were referred to by a number of Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the early retirement scheme for teachers and the number of teachers who applied for early retirement at that time.  Again, one must give credit to the Minister for taking that on board.  I readily appreciate the fact <Col N="1587" /> that there were a number of teachers who, if given the opportunity, would have opted out at that time, but we must cut our cloth according to our measure. There has to be some limit to the schemes that are provided.</P>
    <P>I want to join with Senator Mullooly in his comments on an existing anomaly in relation to pension schemes.  As the Senator said, that is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.  The provisions applicable where a male teacher dies are not available on the death of a female teacher.  I ask the Minister to take that matter on board.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly referred to the covenant and its importance in relation to third level education.  I would like to include with that type of financial assistance in relation to higher education and third level grants, the qualification particularly in relation to the PAYE taxpayer.  I have made the suggestion to the Minister over a number of years and I know she has looked on it very favourably I can appreciate the difficulties that exist and I know she is very anxious to do something about it.  My suggestion is that net income should be taken on board in qualifying people for third level education grants. As Senator Mullooly said, the covenant is fine where there is one student from a family in third level education but where there are two or three third level students in a family the burden on a PAYE taxpayer, a salaried person, is enormous, particularly when the students are living away from home and they have to pay board and lodgings and fees.  I would ask the Minister to consider if there is some relief that could be given to people who find themselves in that position.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the mental strain on teachers is substantial.  Society has changed completely.  There is a totally different attitude to teaching.  The involvement of parents in education has created a different viewpoint and a different attitude to the management of education at local level.  There are questions of rationalisation, amalgamation and so on and all this brings pressure <Col N="1588" /> on teachers in primary, post-primary and third level.</P>
    <P>The teaching profession is a difficult one and nobody recognises that more than the Minister.  She is making every effort to increase the facilities and improve the lot of the teaching professions and she is viewing very favourably the proposals in relation to early retirement.  That creates its own difficulties which must be recognised.  The Minister, at all times, has the interests of teachers and pupils at heart.</P>
    <P>I want to welcome this legislation, to compliment the Minister on bringing it forward and to say that we know the Department of Education is in good hands at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody in his sane senses would object to this legislation but it does raise questions about this House and the extraordinary priorities of what activites need the positive approval of the House and what are subject to the condition of negative approval, i.e. that it becomes law unless we object.  I would like at some stage to have some explanation as to what it is, why it is and where it is that the priorities are determined about which areas of subsidiary legislation, statutory instruments, ministerial orders or whatever they are called, and how it is adjudicated on because in this case we obviously have a situation where something just flips from being one to being another, from a position where up to now it needed the positive approval of the Houses to the situation where the procedure of the superannuation schemes can be amended unless the Houses object.  I have no objections.  It is important and correct that it should be so.  But, it is fascinating and deserves to be teased out further because, if you pick up the Order Paper of either House after, say, the summer break and look at the long list of statutory instruments there, virtually none of which is ever debated in either House which amounts in many areas to legislation by Ministerial fiat.  Most of it is necessary, most of it is correct and most of it is worthwhile but it a long way from <Col N="1589" /> the concept of parliamentary democracy that is supposed to exist in practice when the ordinary lives of ordinary people can be transformed in relation to the health services, social welfare and so on.  It is not so common in education because, given that there is no such thing as an education Act in this country, you cannot have subsidiary legislation.  It is only in specific financial provisions like this that there is actually a need for any sort of legislative or quasi-legislative response. It is as good a commentary on the lack of public policy in Irish education that we do not actually have any legislation or quasi-legislation to deal with education <i>per se.</i>  We have the Vocational Education Act and other matters but we do not really have an education Act.  I know the Minister has on a few occasions indicated she wants to introduce such an Act; I hope she does and I wish her luck. I look forward to seeing it although I am sure her idea of what should be an education Act and mine would differ on many things.</P>
      <P>I do not want to necessarily belabour or go over the points that have been raised by other Members but this is an appropriate occasion to raise the whole concept and question of teaching, the reward for teaching and, indeed, the situations under which people should be allowed to retire from teaching.  I am always intrigued by the number of people, overwhelmingly male, who do not teach, who think teaching is perhaps the easiest job on God's earth.  The reason I say they are overwhelmingly male is because most of them I have heard are the sort of people, in Senator O'Toole's words some years ago, who, while they think keeping some 40 six or seven year olds entertained, amused, educated, stimulated, is easy would drop dead perhaps at the prospect of having to look after their own three or four children of six, seven or eight years on their own without the assistance of their wives for more than two hours at a time. However, they are still convinced that people who look after 40 children have an easy life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teaching is an extremely difficult and <Col N="1590" /> demanding job.  It puts enormous pressures on people.  I only know the level of teaching I am involved in which, in terms of the need to preserve discipline, is perhaps the easiest.  Because of the age of our students and the motivation they all have, it is relatively effortless in terms of discipline, but the sheer fact of having to stand in front of a group of other people for, in my own case, 16 hours a week and in the case of other teachers for 23 or 24 hours a week, is in itself physically demanding.  It is often people who would drop dead at the prospect of having to talk even to a group of ten people who assume it is effortless for somebody to stand in front of 20, 30, 40 or more and pronounce on some subject. I would not say and I do not subscribe to the view that our young people are in any way lawless &mdash; in fact, quite the opposite &mdash; but where concepts of discipline on what is needed, on what is a disciplined approach and what is a proper standard of behaviour have changed quite dramatically and where discipline and respect have to be earned and cannot be imposed by some sort of rigid system, that puts enormous demands on teaching and on teachers.</P>
    <P>It is a fact now that most young people believe they have a right to have their respect earned.  They believe they have a right to be treated with a considerable degree of seriousness by those who claim to teach them.  They believe they have a right to ask questions about topics and they do not, any more in many cases, accept that they simply sit and accept what is handed down to them on a whole range of subjects.  Neither would most teachers be happy with that concept of education at second level or, indeed, even at primary school level.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing sense of education as a dialogue and a partnership between teachers and those they teach. That, of course, is also demanding, stressful and wearisome and that very stress raises questions.  It obviously raises questions about the age at which people should be entitled to retire on an adequate pension and it is a fairly valid point to raise at this stage whether 50 per <Col N="1591" /> cent of salary is any longer an acceptable level of pension.  Increasingly, in the private sector, pensions pitched at that level would be regarded as being on the lower part of the spectrum of acceptability.  I am well aware of private sector pensions that are well below that, but in terms of professional pension funds in general a pension which is pitched at 50 per cent of previous earnings is not regarded as particularly generous and would be on the lower end of what would be regarded as acceptable.  Apart from that and apart from the level of payment, the question of the age has been well and truly discussed and pursued.  The simple answer is that it would be lovely to do it but the funds are not available.  That is a matter that deserves a lot more time than we have here today.</P>
    <P>I simply believe that education is one of these areas of human endeavour and of public provision that is hopelessly and unbelievably underfunded.  One of the areas of underfunding is related to the number of years of service that people must have before they are entitled to full pension provision.  If we are to have the sort of vitality that our schools need and if, at the same time, we are to ensure that those who find the extraordinary stressful burden of dealing with large classes of young people under conditions of perhaps considerable pressure, too much to take, they should be allowed to retire, first for their their own sake, but also to ensure that there is a continuous flow into that profession of young people and that we do not have a gradually ageing body of teachers, with the best will in the world losing the initial enthusiasm that comes with the beginnings of any area of professional activity, perhaps even in politics. The early years are the years of the greatest enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>In a profession as demanding as teaching, there is a particular need to ensure that there is a continuous flow of young people into that profession with young ideas and with the most recent and best quality training available to them, with the vitality, the imagination and the willingness to challenge established ways of <Col N="1592" /> doing things that goes with being young. You cannot guarantee that inflow if you rigidly fix the number of teachers at the present level and do not allow early retirement for those who wish to retire. You can do it, of course, if the Minister is allowed to introduce the sort of pupil-teacher ratios that we probably need in this country.  As part of a package to ensure that there is a continuous stimulation of the profession by the introduction of young people, early retirement on adequate pensions is obviously a necessary part of it.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about this question of superannuation for teachers &mdash; it is not just true for teachers, it is true for a large part of public service pension schemes &mdash; the question of the pension provision for the dependants needs to be addressed with perhaps a greater degree of sharp-sightedness than is currently the case.  I do not have to tell the Minister that most women &mdash; 70 per cent of them as I recall &mdash; are predecessed by their husbands.  The pension provision for dependent spouses under the superannuation schemes is, to say the least, limited &mdash; a quarter of the salary of the earner together with whatever would be there regarding dependent children.  That is not a particularly generous provision and it is one that bears most heavily on women.  It is the one that bears particularly heavily on those women enshrined in our Constitution, the women who stay at home to look after the upbringing of children.  They are the people who suffer the consequence of the inadequate provision for what used to be called widows and orphans.  They are widows and orphans but the language sounds somewhat anomalous.  It is wrong when the man dies that his widow should be suddenly presumed to be able to live on half that salary whereas to my recollection, if the woman dies the husband does not suffer the halving of his pension.  That seems to me to be a classic case of convenient discrimination based on the certain knowledge that most men will die before their wives but which effectively penalises those women who choose to stay at home and look after their children <Col N="1593" /> and quite contradictory to the letter of the Constitution, the spirit of the Constitution and to much of the talk about equality that we have confronted.</P>
    <P>I have to say that this Minister has shown a willingness to address issues.  I particularly welcome what I think is her commitment to introduce an Education Bill which, when we have had our say and hopefully persuaded her to change it in our direction, will become an Education Act.  It would be a great memory of her period as Minister for Education to finally have legislation which attempted to define what we were doing in education, what the State's role was in the education, what the role of the voluntary sector was in education, what the role of parents was in education, and what the role of various other agencies was in education.  I want to give the Minister whatever encouragement I can to stay at it and to produce what is most needed in order to put education on a proper legislative footing, which it has needed for the last 70 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend proposing an additional number of sections and a Schedule.  I have taken the time, not just this week or not just today but regularly over the last number of years, to study the legislation which describes and regulates the pensions available to teachers working for the State.  The legislation governing the superannuation of teachers is the 1879 Superannuation Act &mdash; an Act for improving the position of the teachers of national schools in Ireland.  The legislation referred to by the Minister in the final paragraph of her speech is the 1928 Act which says in section 3:</P>
      <P>Where a superannuation scheme is expressed to apply to any class of teachers to whom the National School Teachers (Ireland) Act, 1879, applies, such scheme may be in addition to or in substitution for the provisions of the said Act as amended by the Pension (Increase) Act, 1920 relates to such class of teachers and may revoke or amend such provisions accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend taking the opportunity to put <Col N="1594" /> some proposals to the Minister.  In doing that, I have the Minister somewhat at a disadvantage because I will be proposing things which I know in her heart of hearts she agrees with, and I hope she will be able to concede, express an opinion on and lead the way towards enhancing the position of the superannuation scheme for teachers.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary fact that when the teachers' pension scheme was first introduced in 1879 &mdash; it is in the Schedule &mdash; women teachers were entitled to retire voluntarily at 50 years of age.  The Minister has expressed views on that on a number of occasions and I know she has quite freely offered those views, but more than a century later, despite unpredented levels of stress and pressure in education, the voluntary retirement age for those women has risen.  They are five years worse off than they were more than 100 years ago.  That is extraordinary in terms of social legislation, progress in legisaltion, etc.  I call on the Minister to introduce regulations which will reduce the voluntary retirement age for teachers to 50 years of age immediately.  Many of our teachers, who have given 30 or 35 of the best years of their lives in classrooms, are tired, worn out and burnt out.  The Minister knows it, and I know it.  We meet them regularly.  Some of these teachers feel they can no longer contribute as effectively as they wish or as they could when they were younger.  We should give them the option to exit from the profession with dignity and with financial security.  Let us have a comprehensive range of options to allow for voluntary early retirement for teachers. It is different to other occupations.  The Minister is a teacher and is aware of this. She knows that 40 healthy, mischievous four year olds or whatever age they are, demand 100 per cent of the teacher's energy and skill 100 per cent of the time.</P>
    <P>While the community would look askance at the idea of a 50 year old couple deciding to take onto themselves the responsibility of rearing a young family we take it for granted that every day of the week teachers in their mid to late fifties take on and face a daunting and <Col N="1595" /> exhausting task of controlling, teaching and disciplining the largest classes in Europe.  It is time that we responded to this.  Teachers are an energetic, enthusiastic, innovative group of professionals and they give all they have to what is, in effect, an under-resourced, under-financed and under-funded education system. The system is successful, but at the cost of teachers' health and welfare.  We have seen it time and time again.  The Minister knows it and I know it.  Is there a difficulty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair on the Minister that she should be called away at this point.  It is also unfair and demeaning to the House that this should happen.  I am not blaming the Minister but there is supposed to be an agreement between the whips that in situations like this the Minister would be automatically paired. I certainly understand the Minister's concern and the matter will be checked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was making the point that the system is successful only at the cost of teachers' health and welfare and that price is too high at the end of the day.  I meet experienced teachers all the time who ask me the same question they ask the Minister when will the voluntary retirement age be reduced?  An early retirement scheme <Col N="1596" /> would carry with it many benefits for the education service and those benefits would create employment for our young unemployed teachers, it would allow the introduction of new blood to the teaching service and such developments would be in everybody's interest and to the great benefit of our pupils.</P>
    <P>I will be looking at another part of the 1879 legislation which says:</P>
    <P>If the Commissioners of Education certify to the Lord Lieutenant that they are satisfied that a male teacher under the age of fifty-five or a female teacher under the age of fifty, who, in case he or she continued in the service until the age of compulsory retirment would be entitled to a retiring allowance under this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>In other words, a person who is entitled to a pension</P>
    <P>&mdash; that person has become incapable from permanent infirmity of mind or body to discharge the duties of his or her situation, the Lord Lieutenant, with the consent of the Treasury, may grant to such teacher a gratuity, or, if the teacher prefers it, a pension. .</P>
    <P>The Minister and I know that is the basis of a lot of difficulties and that is reflected in the teachers scheme of 1934 set up arising from the 1929 legislation.  Section 12 of the 1938 scheme states:</P>
    <P>The Minister and Minister for Finance are satisfied that such teacher has, while in the service, become incapable, from infirmity of mind or body, to discharge the duties of a teacher efficiently and that such infirmity is likely to be permanent.</P>
    <P>This is a major opportunity.  I will make a number of proposals here.  Some of them are major proposals and I know they would create a difficulty for the Minister in the sense that they would need substantial Government approval of funds.  I freely admit that but there are other issues which come to the Minister's clinics, which come to my desk, which come to all of us who deal with teachers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> The majority of Senators present in the Chamber at the moment are teachers and we know about this.  I can give the Minister examples.  I will not play on emotions at the moment, but if we take the disease of ME &mdash; we know that it is a real disease &mdash; it creates all sorts of difficulties and we know it is not permanent. No self-respecting doctor could sign the form which the Department are required to send out on foot of this legislation which requires that the infirmity is likely to be permanent.  It is unlikely that the condition of ME will be permanent. It could last for ten years, 15 years or more but it is not permanent.  With modern science and technology advancing at such a rate, one never knows what permanent means.</P>
    <P>In the past year I came across cases where that form had been signed.  I know of three cases where teachers who were in receipt of the Department of Education pension were told by the Department they were no longer entitled to it.  Let me say the Department are right on occasion and I will give the reasons.  One of them was a person who had no mobility whatsoever and could not move except with the greatest of difficulty.  In the meantime that person has had two highly successful hip replacement operations, is now mobile and well capable of going back to the classroom.  The person's infirmity, which was likely to be permanent at the time the doctor attended him, has gone.  I point that out because there are occasions when the Department say: &ldquo;Yes, we gave you a disability pension but now you are no longer entitled to it&rdquo;.  Under the schemes the Department are entitled to ask on an annual basis for the medical evidence if the person is still not able to carry out the job of teaching.</P>
    <P>One of the other cases I came across was of a teacher who received disability pension on the basis of terminal cancer. It was a very sad situation of a young woman who was facing death.  Colleagues, friends, family in a small rural community were depressed.  Now the person has made a full recovery and all we can say is buíochas le Dia.  The Department have now said: &ldquo;This person <Col N="1598" /> is now fully recovered when all the medical evidence a short time ago was that she would now be dead&rdquo;.  That is a great story to relate.  I am just pointing out to the Minister that it is a situation where the Department have had to take back the pension.  If that can be done with hindsight surely the Minister would also take my case that there are some diseases, for instance, ME, and there are some conditions like alcoholism from which people can recover and after a number of years can go back to teaching. The situation at the moment is that for somebody with ME it is not possible for that person to get a disability pension, even though the Minister, the doctors and I know that this person is totally disabled.  Because of the 1928 legislation and the 1979 legislation which requires that the infirmity is likely to be permanent the doctor cannot sign the form.  Therefore, the Minister cannot give the pension. All that is needed is a minor amendment to the legislation and it still leaves total discretion with the Minister and her Department.  It is not a question of opening floodgates; it is a change in the regulations and is no more than that. That is one of the changes I will be putting before the Minister and I appeal to her to help to get that change in the superannuation. It would change human problems of people, which the Minister and I know about.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned with aspects of the Bill before us.  I have always taken the view that changes in legislation, changes in schedules of legislation and changes in schemes arising from legislation should be done by an affirmative process of a proposal put to the Houses, affirmed and agreed by the Houses.  I see very good reasons for changing that.  This is a good example of where it would be useful to have a quicker way of dealing with it.  As one who deals with teachers all the time and who in another capacity represent teachers all the time, because I have no fears that the teachers' superannuation could never be worsened as it would mean a worsening of the conditions of service, I have no worries on that score. A concern that might apply about other <Col N="1599" /> legislation where we would be worried that something might worsen a situation does not apply here because the legal and constitutional rights would not allow the Minister to worsen the conditions of service.</P>
    <P>There is one very curious line in the Minister's speech where she says that the superannuation benefits for teachers have been improved in line with improvements which have taken place in the public service generally.  That has happened and there have been statutory instruments to reflect that change.  The Minister stated: &ldquo;These have been implemented by my Department on an administrative basis in advance of making the necessary statutory schemes.&rdquo;  I hope the Minister will tell me precisely what that means.  It means to me that the Department of Education have been acting <i>ultra vires</i> the legislation and the schemes in as much as all those changes should be registered somewhere and they are not registered anywhere.  The legislation governing teachers' pensions requires many changes in the regulations or in the scheme be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas through the presentation of a statutory order or instrument by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the Minister introduced a system of redundancy, including added years for primary and post-primary teachers. I can find no evidence of a statutory instrument being presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas at that time.  All the indications are that the introduction of that redundancy scheme, to which I objected vociferously at the time, may well have been <i>ultra vires</i> regulations and legislation of the State.  Today we are tidying up retrospectively because things should have been done which have not been done.  We are now looking at an extraordinary situation where major changes have taken place.  A full scheme totally different to anything outlined in the legislation was introduced by the Minister's Department in 1988 &mdash; I hesitate to say illegally because I am not sure that would be the correct word but which was <Col N="1600" /> certainly <i>ultra vires</i> legislation, certainly without a statutory instrument, without the approval of the House and against the spirit, directions and requirements of the legislation.  It reflected the panic of the time.  I will certainly be interested to hear the Minister's views as to how that operation might have been challenged at that time.  I am not saying that in a petty way.  I am raising that from the point of view of the value of legislation and the need to respond to legislation.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to review the legislation relating to the generation and disposal of waste with particular emphasis on the implementation of regulations which would enable local authorities to enact bylaws which would define whether waste would be disposed of or recycled.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Foley.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot disagree with the motion.  I wonder why it is necessary for Seanad Éireann to call on the Government as a matter of urgency to review the legislation.  I would have thought that the Government would have gone ahead and reviewed it without having to be asked to do so by Seanad Éireann.  We are not initiating anything.  I wonder why the Government could not review the legislation without having to be cajoled or pushed by the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not have an opportunity to hear Senator Foley open the debate.  I was not able to find out the date the legislation relating to the generation and disposal of <Col N="1601" /> waste was implemented.  How old is that legislation?  The Minister can help with that answer.  It is interesting that up to 6 p.m. we were debating an amendment to a superannuation Act which dates back to 1928.  We should review legislation every 20 to 25 years and if it is not necessary to update it we can leave it but some legislation has not been updated for 60 or 100 years.  Surely the review of legislation on an ongoing basis is a pragmatic exercise and is something every Government would want to do.  Then we would not have to go back through dusty Bills wondering when they were enacted. Senator O'Toole referred to the English terms used.  Rather than talking about the Minister he was talking about the &ldquo;Treasury&rdquo; in relation to the previous Bill.  That seems extraordinary in this day and age.</P>
    <P>How do we view waste disposal?  Our attitude is that waste appears but we do not have any responsibility for it.  There is a negative attitude to local authorities. I will give an example of this, and I know the Minister will agree with me.  Every institution has to be kicked.  It was interesting to note when we had a tag-a-bag of 25p per sack, bin or whatever receptacle was used in my own local authority area, that people were willing to pay 50p or £1 a week to private enterprise to collect their rubbish.  They did not see any conflict between paying 25p to a local authority and paying £1 to a private enterprise. I find that extraordinary.  It is a strange reaction and is all to do with our negative attitude to local authorities and to the Department of the Environment. The only time we react to waste is when the word &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; is mentioned; then people become quite hysterical.  They react very vehemently against dumps when they are being provided in or near their areas.  They disregard the fact that they are the producers of the refuse which has to be dumped somewhere.  It is not just a question of calling on the Government to review the legislation relating to the generation and disposal of waste and to implement regulations enabling local authorities to enact bylaws which would define whether it was disposed of or <Col N="1602" /> recycled; what we must ensure is that people understand that they are the producers of rubbish.</P>
    <P>I was quite astounded at the figure of one million tonnes of refuse referred to by Senator Foley.  That is really mind boggling.  We can divide waste into two categories, domestic and industrial.  In the lead up to Christmas and the post-Christmas period with all the packaging and various things associated with Christmas, there will be a plethora of waste dumped, whether it be outside public houses or take-away cafés.  At this time there should be a media campaign to alert people that they are the producers of waste.  It does not matter what we ask local authorities to do; at the end of the day if we are not individually concerned, seeing that we are the producers of domestic waste, by-laws or no by-laws the situation will not be rectified.</P>
    <P>For the last 20 years school children, both at primary and secondary level, have been told about protecting the environment. They are brought on nature trails and view sophisticated video programmes on how waste is recycled in Germany and France; they look at environmentally aware projects; they enter competitions for this, that and the other, and yet it is impossible to keep a litter free school.  Despite those competitions there seem to be two ways of behaving &mdash; one while the authorities are keeping an eye on you and the other when the authorities are not keeping an eye on you.  How do we address the issue of making young people aware that they are the producers of litter?  It seems that like everything else, it should start in the home.  Even when they leave their homes and walk to school, they pass litter on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, it all comes back to how we perceive our environment. During the green Presidency there was a great drive to project ourselves as having a clean environment, with clean, uncontaminated food, clear rivers and so on but tourists lured here by glossy brochures, find an extremely different picture.  They find a throwaway, <Col N="1603" /> careless society who dump tins, cars, glass, etc. and for some reason they always appear to be dumped in our most scenic areas.  I am sure the Minister is aware that when local authorities are asked to prosecute by exasperated county councillors they are told a prosecution will be taken if a name is found on private correspondence or whatever.  Litter can be traced to litter louts but it can also be traced back to people who should know better and who should have better values. In County Limerick the local authority had an estimates meeting recently and we found that we are as financially starved this year as any other year.  I could not ask for any by-laws to be implemented unless there is a guarantee that the local authorities would be given the necessary finance to ensure that what is inherent in this motion could be implemented.</P>
    <P>Senator Foley said that the by-laws would allow local authorities to charge for the provision of waste disposal facilities. Is he talking about dumping because these have already been charged for and I would consider the charges to be minimal? He said it would allow them to charge different rates for recyclable and non-recyclable waste.  What exact rates and charges has he in mind?  Would it be sufficient to allow the local authorities not just to implement but to monitor those by-laws?  It is all right to have facilities for the collection of wastes but it is an extremely expensive operation to monitor them.  In America and Japan there is somebody standing by actually telling you exactly where to put your coloured bottles or whatever, where to put the different sizes, etc., and they have sufficient gadgets to ensure that the different sizes of bottles are put in place. As a people we would tend to come to the recycling depots but we certainly would not do the groundwork by classifying items into different sizes, structures, colours, etc. as they do abroad. They tend to be far more civic minded. It would be up to local authorities to monitor the areas where they would collect those items.  I would have liked Senator Foley to comment on how they <Col N="1604" /> operate the pilot area in Kerry which appears to be working so well for them. That is one aspect as regards the finance that would be necessary to ensure it worked properly.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that under the Environmental Protection Agency Bill all of this could have been thrashed out and I am sure it will be when that Bill comes before us.  The Minister is no doubt aware of the many calls from this House for the Environmental Protection Agency Bill to be introduced.  What I am worried about in relation to this motion is that we no longer have An Foras Forbartha which was a source of valuable information not just to the Oireachtas Members but to local authorities, community groups and so on.  They gave scientific advice on all environmental issues.  It is a pity they are gone and that we are still waiting for the Environmental Protection Agency Bill to take over their role.</P>
    <P>As regards industrial waste, we are very much aware of the fact that individual firms must have licences to dispose of effluent.  It is very difficult to have all of these monitored by local authorities. It is only when things go wrong that fire brigade action is taken.  Another point regarding recycling, is that it must be economically viable, and no matter what we say it will only work if that is so. I know it is in the very early stages in Kerry but I would like to know whether it is an economically viable option.  We all hope further employment can be created as a result of recycling.  At the end of the day, we need a nationally co-ordinated scheme for recycling re-usable waste products.  Although I have faith in local authorities I worry about their finances and resources, and whether they can monitor such schemes when they come into existence.  It is a burning issue.  It is interesting that an American millionaire, whose name escapes me, has retired from his industrial job and has decided to devote the rest of his life to the area of recycling and to the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> There are many lessons we can learn. I would start with the domestic exploiter. In Ireland we tend to scream at multinationals and to look to industry but we seem to forget the buck stops with each individual.  I welcome the motion but I would be twice as happy if the provision of resources for local authorities were implicit in it and in the local government reform package we will get.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House particularly as we are dicussing a motion on recycling and, generally speaking, waste disposal.  It is only right to acknowledge that in his term as Minister for the Environment massive strides have been made in the area of recycling and general waste disposal.  It is the first time in the history of the State that we now have a comprehensive policy on how to rid ourselves of waste and how economically to recycle a lot of waste material.</P>
      <P>There will always be a difficulty in providing modern landfill sites and it is becoming an extremely acute problem for local authorities.  That will continue to be so given the fact, as Senator Jackman suggested, that people agree they are necessary provided that they are not located in their immediate vicinity.  My view is that this problem will continue to agitate people in the years ahead.  At this stage it is only proper that we should take steps to conserve the landfill sites we have available to us by recycling as much as possible of domestic refuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding is that when you remove glass, cans, plastic, metal and paper, approximately 40 per cent of what is left is organic waste and that can be digested.  The problem is: how can we separate all the various items listed.  I understand that in France and Denmark they have a mechanism to separate them. I know the Minister is aware of this and I ask him if he would have a look at the possibility of locating one such machine in the Cork area on a pilot basis.  It has been suggested that a 40 per cent EC grant is available directly to local authorities <Col N="1606" /> for a digester dealing specifically with municipal waste and I understand Cork County Council have lodged an application for a digester with the Minister. The Minister might elaborate, given his call earlier in the year to other local authorities, on how many of them have made proposals to the Department relative to this and what the likelihood of sanction is for the Cork applicaton.</P>
    <P>The programme under which Cork County Council lodged a claim is an EC programme called Thermie, that is, for a full-scale municipal digester.  The problem for Irelend under that programme is that a full feasibility study has not been completed by any local authority, and certainly not by Cork County Council. The closing date is 6 January 1991.  Under some of the environmental programmes funding can be made direct to the local authority as in the case of Thermie. Would the Minister, therefore, consider it appropriate that some mechanism be put in place in his Department whereby the managers of local authorities would be made aware of schemes where funding would come directly to the local authorities rather than having what seems like the hit-and-miss operation at present?</P>
    <P>Everyone welcomes the estblishment of private recycling units all over the country.  While profit margins are, generally speaking, low it goes to show there is now a level of consciousness of the need to recycle.  I welcome the grant aid that is made available in this area through the Department.  It has increased from £250,000 to £500,000 and that in itself is encouraging.</P>
    <P>In the environment action programme the Minister listed three points that were particularly pertinent in this regard.  They are the increase that I have spoken about bringing the amount to £500,000; the fact that the Minister asked the IDA to look at the possibility for spin-off industry from recycling and the possibility of arranging tax incentives for companies who involve themselves in recycling given the low profit margins that everybody accepts.  In Cork and Kerry companies seem to be blossoming.  There does not <Col N="1607" /> seem to be the type of regulation that perhaps should be in place.  One can argue that at the end of the day competition will decide which of them will last.  Under the present scheme of things there are a number of cowboy operations. They start off on the basis of making some profit but they seem to cause damage rather than alleviate the difficulty. In those circumstances given the influx of new companies into the recycling area, would it not be appropriate to bring in a licensing system?  It could be operated by the local authorities, where on an annual basis licences would be issued and they would perhaps be based on performance and thus ensure that at all times companies stayed within their remit.</P>
    <P>I would also like to use this occasion to mention the serious problem that has arisen with offal disposal.  The Minister is well aware that with the advent of mad cow disease slaughterhouses are experiencing difficulty in disposing of offal.  Up to 1 November, Cork County Council were accepting offal in two tipheads but with the advent of winter the danger of leachate contamination of streams meant we had to bring that process to an end. That begs the question of where exactly that offal is going at present.  In Tralee there was the danger of an explosion when domestic refuse was compacted on top of offal because of the carbondioxide present.</P>
    <P>I understand there are 660 slaughterhouses and 48 large-scale slaughtering premises in this country.  It is estimated that we kill 1.2 million cattle, 2.5 million sheep, 2 million pigs and 42 million poultry per year.  That is a substantial amount of waste at the end of the day.  With the closing off of our exports of meat and bonemeal a major problem exists for slaughterhouses.  In fact, it is compounding the high price of meat at present.  I understand costs have gone up by 33? per cent in the interim period.</P>
    <P>In Cork we have a pilot programme whereby sewage sludge, offal and industrial waste from the Pfizer factory are digested together successfully and the <Col N="1608" /> rendering at the end of the day has produced a significant flow of biogas and the by-product can be used as a fertiliser on the land.  In Denmark, France and other countries this is operating successfully and from the environmental point of view that would seem to be the way forward. I congratulate the Minister on indicating that his Department are prepared to fund a feasibility study provided that the slaughterhouses and local industry are willing to pay their fair share in any such study.</P>
    <P>It is important that we establish how expansive that digester should be because in many instances I am told that although the pilot project looks extremely positive when you put in place a major digester we may not get the same level of positive results.  I would like the Minister's comment on that.  The feasibility study, which is to take three months, will obviously take a look at the location.  It will have a look at the benefits to the environment, how waste is to be collected, how the digester itself is to be run and particularly how it is to be financed.</P>
    <P>Side-by-side with this project would be the creation of what I feel is a significant number of jobs.  The initial results suggest that the biogas generated could act as a feeder to local industry within the area and it could also assist the development of the glasshouse industry in Cork.  I am pleased to indicate that discussions are at present going on between Bord na Móna and Cork County Council with regard to new product development on the byproduct of this particular digester.</P>
    <P>The cost of a full generator is prohibitive, £6 million.  Obviously, while in the long term it would appear to be the way forward and while a 40 per cent grant might be available from the EC, this is going to have major ramifications for the Minister in regard to cost on the Exchequer, especially when you consider that the project they are proposing for £6 million will cover only Cork city and county.  That begs the question: What is going to happen to the rest of the country?  We still have a long way to <Col N="1609" /> go down that road but it looks to be something well worth pursuing.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Environment Protection Agency is being put in place.  Now that the Kramer report has been published in relation to Cork harbour, there are one or two points I would like to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Despoilation of Cork harbour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that that report would be put in place, but, more important still, it should be said that the control mechanism used by the Cork County Council environment department has by and large been proved to be correct and the statements they have made in the past have proved to be well founded on this occasion.  On the question of the Environment Protection Agency, obviously a location will have to be found for that.  Given the major concentration of chemical industry in Cork harbour we would look with a benign eye on the siting of such an agency in the Cork area and we would readily provide a premises for the Minister if that were to happen.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude, I would like to advert to the fact that the Government have now decided that a national waste incinerator is required and that we cannot be exporting our waste to other countries. I also understand from some of the Minister's statements that it is getting down to two consortia to decide which one of them is to get the contract.  I understood from a statement made by the Minister that these consortia would decide on the suitability of location.  I find it quite ironic, therefore, that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Mary Harney, should come to Cork and should indicate that with regard to this national waste incinerator that it should not be sited in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator will get his opportunity to contribute.  I am also quite concerned that the Senator should speak in such a way, given the fact that his own qualification is in the chemical field and, above anything else, he should have a good knowledge of the importance of a national waste incinerator. If we accept the principle that it should be located in Ireland then we should be willing to accept it in Cork, if that were a suitable location, other than any other part of the country.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out two other facts relating to the national waste incinerator that concern me.  Industrial development is quite likely to follow hard upon the siting of a national waste incinerator and 2,000 jobs could be generated around that incinerator.  What concerns me is that in the September issue of <i>Business and Finance</i> there were two articles relating to the national waste incinerator, one where, again, the Minister, Deputy Harney, said it would not be in Cork, that it was not appropriate that it should be in Cork and another indicating that she was quite adamant that Limerick was a more suitable location.  I would hate to think the nepotism would be part and parcel of our partners in Government; and, while I would not want the Minister to comment on that, it is rather appropriate that it should be said in this Chamber.</P>

      <P>At the outset I welcome this motion.  It is a bit like motherhood; one of these things which anybody could agree with.  I compliment Senator Foley on his speech last week.  It was very comprehensive. Unfortunately, he did not spell out precisely what the difficulties were with the present legislation in relation to the disposal of waste and so on.  The motion is fine, by 31 Members of the House, all Fianna Fáil people.  I also understand that the Environmental Protection Agency Bill is on its way; it has been on its way for a long time.  I saw Senator O'Keeffe reading through the <Col N="1611" /> Environmental Action Programme.  I am sure that if he had gone on to the end of it he would have seen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Intellectually, I hope as distinct from physically; but it would be a good source of fibre as well.  The Environmental Protection Agency Bill, if we were to take that announcement seriously, would have been up and going by now.  It has not materialised yet and the Minister might fill us in on when we can expect it.  It is a question we ask the Leader of the House each day and the disorder of asking this question seems to have spread.  Today it spread as far as Senator Cullen of the Progressive Democrats who has got interested in when this Bill will be introduced.  My own view of the Fianna Fáil motion is that it could be interpreted as a coded message to the Minister to introduce the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  That is how I would decode it.  The reason I say that is that pretty well everything covered in the motion would also have been covered in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and much more besides.  If we got that Bill then we would be aware and we would solve the problem and many others also.</P>
      <P>The amount of waste which is recycled in this country is very low by international standards.  The desirable aspects of recycling waste have already been well explained here.  They will extend the life of present landfill sites and they will also allow productive economic activity to develop.  It will allow for the creation of employment in recycling material.  It should be possible to establish a considerable number of new industries based on commercial recycling; and, while the employment which can be expected from these industries in relation to the overall levels of employment in the country can be modest, nonetheless it is fair to say that they would be significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to say that the suggestion in the Environmental Action Programme where tax initiatives or tax incentives to <Col N="1612" /> encourage recycling are being studied is welcome.  I look forward to proposals being made in relation to tax incentives to encourage recycling and to encourage the use of biodegradable containers where that is feasible.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of hazardous waste, we have to get down to the question of the safe disposal of this material. That is a long and complex question.  It is complex in relation to the chemical aspects and it is even more complex in relation to the political aspects.  Hazardous waste is not just hazardous in terms of human health.  It is also very hazardous in terms of political health and the side-effects of a political mistake made in relation to hazardous waste management could be fatal politically, if not fatal from a health point of view.</P>
    <P>I understand there is something like one million tonnes of refuse produced each year in this country and that, of course, means we have enormous potential for recycling waste.  If we are to look at the figures which have been quoted from places like Japan where they are able to recycle in excess of half the total waste which they generate, and if we look at the objectives which the French have set themselves of recycling two-thirds of their waste over the next decade, it indicates the enormous potential which exists for recycling waste in our country.  At present the levels of achievement are very modest.  Quinnsworth, the supermarket chain, who have done a good deal of work in relation to promoting recycling and so on, have estimated that something like 40 per cent of the plastic bags which they give out in their supermarkets are waste, so there is quite a considerable potential there for saving.  There are also estimates available to show that something like 100 jobs could be created in recycling the present levels of waste cans in this country.</P>
    <P>In relation to what should be done by way of developing the potential, I believe there is a need now for a national policy. I believe that policy should have clear objectives and the methods by which it would be pursued should be clearly laid out.  In particular, it is important that <Col N="1613" /> investment is made in increasing the public's awareness of waste and how it can be reduced.  I believe in relation to industry there is a need for courses in environmental management for industrialists.  I would expect that as industry develops those courses would become part and parcel of the training of managers and, indeed, that they would be introduced on a short term basis for managers who are at present working in industry.</P>
    <P>It is important that we carry out research into environmental management and environmental policy.  A modest amount of that is going on at present.  Again, it is a matter of regret that the Environmental Protection Agency is not up and going because there are plans there for research into these areas.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the labelling standards in relation to waste and disposal of waste be improved.  There is great scope for some products to contain labels which would be much clearer and much more easily understood for consumers in relation to biodegradability and various other aspects of how packaging and so on should be disposed of.</P>
    <P>There are two points I want to mention very briefly.  One relates specifically to the problem of coastal pollution and to the difficulties which plastic materials create in relation to coastal areas.  They are an absolute plague in coastal areas.  I wish an awareness programme would now be introduced as to the deleterious effects of these materials so that the public might be made fully conscious of the tremendous damage this type of litter does to our coasts, which indeed are one of the country's great national resources.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to refer to is the matter raised by Senator O'Keeffe in relation to the disposal of offal.  That is a very serious problem now.  I hope the Minister is addressing himself to it.  Clear steps should be taken to ensure that serious damage is not done to the health of the environment arising from this practice which now seems to be becoming more widespread.  I find it particularly alarming to hear the reports of people burying offal and that kind of thing.  It is <Col N="1614" /> very worrying and I sincerely hope the Minister will take appropriate action to remedy any irregular behaviour in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl do na Seanadóirí uilig a ghlac páirt san díospóireacht agus an t-ábhar fíor-thábhachtach atá i gceist againn anseo agus ba mhaith liom beagáin a rá faoin diíospóireacht sin.</P>
      <P>The production of waste is an inescapable feature of modern Irish life and life generally and the volume and complexity of waste directly reflect the kind of society in which we live and the living standards we enjoy.  Experience has shown that in Ireland, as in other countries, industrialisation and economic growth give rise to accelerated generation of waste of all types.  This trend requires action by the private and public sectors as well as increased awareness on the part of the general public if economic growth is to be sustainable in terms of protection of the environment.  To put it very simply, we cannot go on producing ever-increasing amounts of waste and close our eyes to the environmental consequences. Traditionally, waste was viewed as something with a negative economic value.  Its holders no longer wanted it at a given time and place because it has no market value, but the modern view of waste is more discerning. On the one hand, waste is a potential source of pollution and, on the other hand, waste can represent a real natural resource as a secondary raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the motion before us emphasises this potential of waste as a natural resource in its reference to recycling.  Putting down the motion at this time was opportune and timely.  To appreciate the problems associated with waste we need to understand the different forms under which it arises: municipal waste, industrial waste, agricultural waste, miscellaneous waste and hazardous waste.  They all present distinct characteristics and they require quite different management strategies.  Production of industrial waste in Ireland <Col N="1615" /> exceeds 1.5 million tonnes per year.  A significant amount of this &mdash; some 40 to 50 per cent of it &mdash; is recovered or recycled and the balance is disposed of on private sites, local authority sites or dumped at sea.  I should point out that under the Government's environmental action programme marine dumping of industrial waste will be terminated finally by the end of 1995.</P>
    <P>Agricultural wastes are a very significant part of total waste produced in Ireland as one would expect in view of the importance and size of the agricultural sector.  Over 20 million tonnes of these wastes are produced each year and virtually all agricultural wastes are disposed of by land spreading.  While it is gratifying that this is a form of recycling, the whole management of agricultural wastes is, of course, vital so as to prevent problems of water pollution.  Miscellaneous wastes include mining and peat wastes, construction rubble and metal wastes such as scrap vehicles, tyres and waste oils.  With regard to the latter, there is a significant degree of recycling.  Hazardous wastes are produced mainly from industrial sources and, on a broad definition, some 52,500 tonnes of this waste arise in Ireland each year.  Of course, this would be classified as toxic and dangerous waste for all the purposes that are relevant to the EC directives.</P>
    <P>Municipal waste includes household refuse, street sweepings and sludge from waste waters.  Statistics show that we produce over one million tonnes of this waste each year or about one-third of a tonne per person.  This figure has been increasing steadily.  Local authority refuse collections systems serve about three-quarters of the national population and collect the bulk of municipal wastes. In all, local authorities will spend over £50 million in 1990 on waste disposal activities.  Most wastes in Ireland are disposed of by landfill, although other methods such as incineration are likely to increase in the future.</P>
    <P>I should say here that the landfill disposal option is fully acceptable from an <Col N="1616" /> environmental point of view, given a suitable location and proper management. When used up, landfill sites can often be reclaimed to provide parks and other amenities.  About 1.5 million tonnes of waste is deposited annually on approximately 160 local authority tip sites while at least 175,000 tonnes is deposited on some 40 private tip sites.  While landfill is usually cheaper than other disposal options, it still entails significant collection of transport and management costs.  Worthwhile savings could be realised if waste production was minimised or if a greater proportion of waste was recycled or recovered.</P>
    <P>I have listened with considerable interest to the contributions of Senators and there seems to be a general agreemnt that the actual disposal of waste should be the last &mdash; not the first &mdash; item on the waste agenda.  Enlightened waste management strategies should focus in the first instance on waste minmimisation and this can involve a number of considerations.  First, minimisation of waste can be achieved at production stage by the use of clean technologies in the production process itself.  There is an economic incentive for industry to do just this in view of the cost of disposal of industrial waste and this incentive will increase in the future as the standards for final disposal become even higher. Secondly, minimisation at source will also depend increasingly on the manufacture of clean and environmentally friendly end products.</P>
    <P>The next method of reducing the amount of waste for final disposal is, of course, recycling.  This is central to the motion we are discussing this evening. Recycling can conserve natural resources, extend the life of existing disposal facilities and it offers significant opportunities for productive economic activity and employment.  The Environment Action Programme acknowledges that by international standards the amount of municipal waste recycled in Ireland is low and it proposes a number of initiatives to encourage greater activity in this area.  At the same time, Senators should bear in mind that the quantities <Col N="1617" /> of municiple waste produced <i>per capita</i> in Ireland are still low by international standards.  Indeed, most of the countries who can claim to be advanced in the recycling of municipal waste still produce more net waste <i>per capita</i> than we do. Nevertheless, I am determined to improve the level of recycling in Ireland and, in line with the action programme, a number of important measures have already been taken.</P>
    <P>Major local authorities were asked to prepare recycling schemes for their areas which would identify recycling possibilities and measures to facilitate them.  I am pleased to inform Senators that most local authorities have now responded to this request and their recycling plans are now being evaluated in the Department of the Environment.  Grant assistance from my Department for recycling projects have been increased to £500,000 this year &mdash; that is a 100 per cent increase on last year's allocation.  IDA feasibility studies are being carried out in relation to the potential for new recycling industries and I await the results from that source with some interest.  Finally, two important studies have been commissioned in relation to tax incentives for recycling and the use of biodegradable forms of containers and packaging.  Again, I am expecting the results from these matters shortly.</P>
    <P>A number of important advances were made in waste policy during our Presidency of the European Communities earlier this year.  As President of the Environment Council, I guided through the adoption of a comprehensive resolution on waste which established modern principles for future EC waste management purposes.  Under my Presidency, the Council also agreed an important framework directive on waste. Finally, a specific directive was agreed concerning reduction and safe disposal of waste from batteries.</P>
    <P>Before I speak about waste legislation in Ireland, which is central to the motion, I want to respond to a number of issues raised by Senators.  The first concerns eco-labelling.  The Government fully supports this concept which should serve to <Col N="1618" /> promote environmentally friendly products. Work on eco-labelling is continuing at the European Community level.  I am however, including a general power in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill for the promotion of an eco-labelling scheme.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Bill has been referred to by every single contributor I have listened to.  It is now virtually complete and will be published and introduced very shortly.  I take it that when it is being discussed here it will give Senators a further opportunity at some length to consider legislation which, I believe, will introduce new measures, new structures and new powers that have been eagerly awaited by all concerned with the environment for quiite some time.  It will be a good Bill.  More about that anon.</P>
    <P>I would also remind Senators that the Environment Action Programme promised a nationwide attitudes survey to the established baseline data, in relation to individuals and the corporate sector, to assist in planning environment awareness campaigns and other programmes in the years ahead.  Results of the survey, which I am sure will also be applicable to waste management, will be available early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>Senator Foley spoke about the achievements of the Kerry Recycling Group.  I am pleased to acknowledge the contribution of small recycling operators throughout the country.  Kerry Recycling Group and some 20 other operators have had the assistance of recycling grants from the Department in order to try to expand their operations, as they do very good work.  The Senator was quite justified in supporting them in the way he did.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the problems of pollution of the sources of group water schemes.  Waste has to be acknowledged as a potential source of pollution. This is why in rural situations we must put a premium on improved farm management and on proper waste water disposal facilities.  Action is being taken on two fronts to combat this threat to rural water supplies and to smaller group <Col N="1619" /> schemes in particular.  First, grants are available to groups to undertake the necessary works to connect to public water supply schemes and an ever-increasing number of group schemes will receive their supply direct from public schemes in the future.  In cases where a connection to a public scheme is not practicable, grants are payable for the installation of suitable water treatment facilities.</P>
    <P>I think that perhaps a statistic or two about that is worth keeping in mind. About 40 per cent of group schemes use private sources of supply and as many as 60,000 households in the country are supplied from private sources.  There are about 5,000 group schemes in the country &mdash; something in excess of 5,000 schemes &mdash; and they serve 139,000 homes.  You can get some idea of the importance of the group scheme system to the community at large.  It applies particularly to rural Ireland.  It is important that these rural communities be supported, first of all, in providing water supplies for their homes and, secondly, we must seek to try to have the best quality water possible made available through those group schemes.  The only sure safe way to have that quality maintained on a continuous basis is for as many as possible of those group water schemes to be connected to public water supply.  We would hope in the future that as many as possible of the new group schemes that are grant-aided would, if at all possible, be connected to public water supply schemes that are treated in a proper fashion because there is some concern in regard to ground water that, of course, agricultural wastes and disposal like that can affect the quality. We have to be conscious of that and monitor it very carefully indeed.</P>
    <P>I readily acknowledge that the cause as well as the symptoms must be treated. The powers available to local authorities to require measures to be taken to prevent pollution or to regulate activities, such as the storage and disposal or wastes which may pose a threat to water quality, have been significantly strengthened by the Local Government Water Pollution <Col N="1620" /> (Amendment) Act, 1990.  This Act introduces civil liability for injury, loss or damage to persons or property resulting from the pollution of waters.  These legislative measures, together with the grant scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food to improve waste storage facilities on farms are designed to reduce the incidence of water pollution generally.  This, of course, benefits group water schemes.</P>
    <P>Enormous amounts of money had been provided by the Department of Agriculture and Food to help the farming community who now fully recognise their responsibility to reduce the levels of pollution emanating from their operations. They have been given this grant assistance to enable them to provide better storage facilities, better holding facilities for their wastes and to do all in accordance with the strictest standards as laid down by that Department.  We are happy to co-operate in that regard.</P>
    <P>There has been an enormous improvement in the whole area of management of farm operations this year.  Generally, farmers, often maligned, should be at least congratulated on the efforts they have made in trying to improve their own situations.  Thousands of them have attended symposia, lectures and seminars over the last number of winters to learn how to better use the facilities they have and how to improve upon them and they have been encouraged to do quite a lot in so far as improving the environment is concerned over the past few years.  I am happy to support them in their efforts.</P>
    <P>Senators also referred to toxic and dangerous wastes.  Quite a lot of comment was made on these matters.  As I have already indicated to the House, we produce about 52,500 tonnes of waste which is regarded as toxic and dangerous in the context of the relevant EC directives. We also produce a further 55,000 tonnes of chemicals, metal and oil wastes which can be broadly regarded as hazardous as well.  While minimisation and recovery methods should be applied as fully as possible to these wastes, we must have a proper disposal facility for the smaller quantity, say, 5,000 to 10,000 <Col N="1621" /> tonnes which require specialised incineration. That is the matter referred to by Senator O'Keeffe.  This facility of a national incinerator must be carefully planned, managed, monitored to the highest environmental standards.  The thing that has to be said is that we must have it.</P>
    <P>We have had the opportunity for a number of years now of disposing of these toxic and highly dangerous wastes by relying on our friends abroad.  We utilise incinerator facilities in the UK, France and Finland.  It is becoming increasingly obvious to me, as Minister for the Environment attending Environment Council meetings in Europe, that the policy of proximity and the policy of self-sufficiency will be the order of the day in a very short time.  Proximity simply means that you should dispose of these dangerous substances and wastes as near as possible to where they are created.</P>
    <P>The self-sufficiency principle applies in that it is expected that each country will provide the necessary facilities to dispose of its own dangerous waste.  Taking that seriously and acting responsibly in that matter, we must plan to have in place a facility to deal with our own waste in a proper way, properly controlled, monitored in a safe way long in advance of the door being closed by other countries who will eventually refuse to take that waste from us.  It is infinitely more suitable to know what is happening to our wastes, to have it controlled and monitored, to know precisely where it is going rather than to have it disposed of in bogs, ditches, drains, dumped at sea or in any other location.</P>
    <P>Waste is a necessary by-product of industry.  Whether it is processing, chemical, agricultural or whatever, we produce the waste and we will continue to do so in increasingly large volumes.  We should do whatever we can by improving the production processes and reducing the amount of waste generated at source &mdash; this must be an essential as well &mdash; and whatever we can do on the other matter referred to by Senator Foley, the question of recycling of waste.  We have not a good reputation or record in this question <Col N="1622" /> of recycling.  We are the worst in Europe. We are improving a little bit but we have still got a long way to go.</P>
    <P>Whatever we do in the production processes or in the recycling area we will still have a sizeable volume of dangerous toxic and harardous waste that has to be got rid of.  If we are told in a short time: &ldquo;Keep it yourself, Minister; it is not coming into our country because the self-sufficiency principle will become established in law&rdquo; then we will end up with it and will have to store it, bury it or dump it where it could be a very serious hazard to the lives and health of all our people. That nettle has to be grasped.  That is what the national incinerator proposal is all about.  One will have to be provided and we must plan for it and we must do it carefully.  I believe if we do that we then can have a facility and we will be the authors of our own destiny in so far as the disposal of that waste is concerned.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the question of improving legislation on national waste. Our existing legislation falls under two main headings.  First, there are a number of provisions scattered throughout the various statutes dating back to the last century.  The most important of these are the Public Health and Sanitary Services Acts.  These Acts enable us, but they do not compel sanitary authorities to collect household and trade refuse.  More recently, a series of regulations have been made under the European Communities Act, 1972, which give effect to various European Community directives pertaining to waste.  These regulations implement directives on a general framework for waste disposal, toxic and dangerous waste, waste oils, PCBs, transfrontier shipment of hazardous wastes and, finally, disposal of asbestos.</P>
    <P>Senators will see that existing legislation on waste is either very old, last Century stuff, or derives totally from the EC directives I have referred to.  This is unsatisfactory.  In particular, Senators will be aware that secondary legislation, under the European Communities Act, 1972, must be restricted to the measures necessary to implement the provisions of the EC directives concerned.  We cannot, <Col N="1623" /> for example, cater for further provisions notwithstanding their desirability in terms of particular national circumstances. This factor, along with the growing importance of waste control as a central component in promoting a cleaner environment, suggests the need for a modern statutory framework to underpin all aspects of waste control.  My intention is that a comprehensive Bill should be prepared which will provide for all activities associated with waste.  The movement is in that direction.  The Community is now taking up the whole question of this legislation by way of directive following the framework which was put in place under my Presidency.  From that will flow all the legislation needed to deal with this waste business.  It is starting now and I believe it is necessary.  I include storage, collection, transportation and treatment as well as all types of waste from the simple domestic refuse along the scale to hazardous waste which are separate but still related in all the activities associated with waste.  There were a lot of comments made about particular issues.  I do not think it is necessary for me to deal with them in an individual way this evening.  There will be opportunities shortly, particularly in the discussion on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill quite a voluminous piece of legislation. It is a major matter which is about to descend upon you&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is about to descend on the Oireachtas.  It will give a great opportunity to everybody to have a very careful consideration of what is required there.  I want to make one or two little comments about things I heard this evening.  The question of animal waste was referred to by several Senators, also the question of offal and the sizeable amounts of offal generated in an agricultural country.  Perhaps all of it is not being disposed of in a manner of which we would all approve. However, so that at least we understand what is going on, there is still a very big export market for bone meal and the <Col N="1624" /> export of bone meal has become more restrictive in recent times.  Senators should at least be aware that the export of this product is still going on.  I am aware of the problem and the potential it creates for unsuitable and unlawful disposal of these animal wastes and I propose issuing guidelines in the immediate future to local authorities on the proper method of disposal of this offal.  It is still being exported in very large tonnages.  In fact, it is expected that the export of bone meal and these related matters will be running at about the same as 1990.  Rendering plants are still operating.  They have always been a suitable method of disposal of these kinds of wastes.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I am somewhat concerned about offal being disposed of in open landfill sites.  It can be done properly at landfill location but there are ways of doing it, and because of that, I have decided to ask the Department to draw up suitable guidelines for sanitary authorities so that they are fully acquainted with the best method of disposing of these wastes on their landfill sites if that is the only method available to them.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Keeffe was particularly anxious about the anaerobic digester.  I understand it is at testing stage in Cork. I hope the Senator is aware that this matter has not been disposed of by the Department or the Minister just yet.  I would not want anyone to feel it has suddenly been all cleared.  We have not as yet agreed to assist this project.  I believe it would be appropriate to include it perhaps when it comes to approval stage for assistance under the envirge operational programme.  That would be the best way I can envisage of getting decent grant assistance to enable it to proceed.  It has not been approved yet and I do not wish it to be announced that it has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator is quite right to say it has great advantages and it could have a major potential for the disposal of sludges which are likely to increase.  The volume of sludges is cetainly very likely to increase over the years because of the <Col N="1625" /> increased level of activity under the sanitary programme in so far as new sewerage treatment plants are concerned particularly one that would be operating, for instance, in Cork when that design is finished and put in place.  We are talking about huge volumes of sewage sludge. We will not allow it to be be dumped at sea after the date which I mentioned earlier on.  That will be banned.  It has to be got rid of and that digester, of course, could do the trick very adequately for us. It is also quite a useful plant type for disposing of animal wastes.  It certainly offers very big possibilities on the whole question of recovery of gas and using it to the full advantage.  While not telling the Senator that it will be approved, let me put it in this fashion, I certainly see the great possibilities for this anaerobic digester.  Hopefully, we will be able to deal with it in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the new conceptual approach to waste involving minimisation. Recycling will feature prominently in the legislative measures we have in mind.  I will also bear in mind the many quite interesting, educational, stimulating and constructive points that were raised by all the Senators who contributed to this debate so far.  Their contributions were well researched.  They have given notice to me, of course, that they will be expanding on the matters they have referred to when the Environmental Protection Agency is being discussed here in the very near future.  I look forward to that opportunity also.  When the waste legislation is finally complete, together with the controlling and monitoring arrangements that will be put in place in the new Environmental Protection Agency Bill, we will then have gone a long way in quite a short time in dealing with the whole question of waste that arises in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Suffice it to say that the national incinerator at this stage is going in the wrong direction.  My view is that the only way forward is not just to minimise it but to end waste from hazardous substances.  The world is not in a position to keep on consuming wastes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the specific issue of the motion I have every reason to support it.  I agree with the sentiments but my problem with it is that it does not go far enough.  If all the populations of China and India were to reach the standard of living and consumption currently achieved in the United States the world would only have resources to provide that standard of living for about three years in terms of natural resources that are available. Quite clearly, therefore, the assumption that underlines the continuous consumption of resources and even the assumption that underlines the renewal of resources either presumes that we will discover huge tracts of unknown resources or else presumes that the world will run out of resources a lot quicker.  At current levels of consumption the world is assumed, depending on which one you look at, have 50 to 150 years supply at <Col N="1627" /> current levels of exploration and discovery. That is on the assumption of the present level of under-development of the vast majority of citizens of the world.</P>
    <P>The fundamental question I would like &mdash; if the Minister had not given us such a long and indeed informative address &mdash; to have addressed is the consumption of the world resources.  The questions that need to be addressed are underlying ones.  Recycling is a necessary step on the road to somewhere else.  The somewhere else is stability in the consumption of the world's resources; for instance, waste disposal, the conversion of toxic substances into non-toxic substances like any incinerator.  Carbon dioxide is not a harmless product.  Carbon dioxide on the scale we are now producing it, along with water, is a serious threat to the stability of the global environment.</P>
    <P>All you can do in disposing of waste is change the timescale somewhat.  The only way to stabilise the world environment is to stabilise waste production which means many areas of activity either ceasing or using entirely new technology which involves zero waste.  Therefore, words like &ldquo;waste minimisation&rdquo; are noble aspirations but they are not adequate.  Even large sections of the chemical industry accept that the long term target will be zero waste because we have these ridiculous cycles where you have gaseous waste which, when the pressure comes on, becomes liquid waste and when that comes on it becomes solid waste.  Then the solid waste ends up on the ground and becomes gaseous waste itself.  Then somebody has to dispose of that and you get liquid waste and that goes into something else and becomes solid waste and the whole damn cycle starts all over again.</P>
    <P>The solution to the problem can only be addresed if the problem is addressed properly.  The problem is a problem of waste and waste has to end.  We have to stabilise the consumption from the <Col N="1628" /> world's resources, stabilise the consumption of energy, stabilise all of those things to a level that the world can sustain. Recycling is a breather that gives us time to deal with the underlying questions. It is an important breather, it is a necessary breather and it is a reproach to a country that talks so much about its environment.  It is a reproach to us that we have not done it.</P>
    <P>It should not be seen as the solution. It is a step on the road to the real solution. The real solution is one that I hope at some stage we will see if the Environmental Protection Agency Bill gets introduced here.  I would love to think that the interesting debate we had on the Water Pollution Bill would inspire the Minister to have the Environmental Protection Agency Bill Introduced here.  Then we could discuss these questions in detail.  I want to simply put down those markers and leave some time for my colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my gratitude to Senator Ryan for allowing me this short time to make some comments. The debate did not really reflect fully the terms of the motion because until the Minister spoke there was virtually nothing about the existing legislation and its inadequacies.  People spoke in a general way about the problems of pollution but they did not deal with the defects in the law.  There is obviously not time for me to do it.  The Minister has laid some basis for it.  It is a cause of shame for us in Seanad Éireann and the Oireachtas that we are really basically dealing with legislation from the British imperial past and the European Community. There is very little domestically-generated legislation governing this area of our lives which is very important.  All modern countries are waste generators. We all, both at national level and at domestic pump level, suffer from what environmentalists call the NIMBY syndrome, Not In My Back Yard.  The Minister, I am sure, will be aware of this in his own locality of Laois where recently there has <Col N="1629" /> been a problem of the disposal of highly toxic waste.  I am thinking of the Portlaoise area where there has been a situation with regard to asbestos, which is an extremely toxic substance.  Nobody really wants it buried or destroyed in their backyard.</P>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with what Senator Brendan Ryan said about the dangers of simply thinking that you can incinerate or dispose of waste by some kind of modern technological process. There is no time to go into quantum physics or sub-atomic particles and so on but basically it is more or less true that matter is virtually indestructible.  You can alter the form of the matter.  As Senator Ryan has dramatically illustrated you can by burning or other processes alter the form of matter but you cannot guarantee that it will ultimately emerge as completely non-toxic.  We have to be aware of this problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister raised issues of sewage polution, sludge and so on.  I would like to put it to him that perhaps behind all of this fine talk we might get some action. We have a glowing example here in Dublin with the Pigeon House electricity generating station right beside the main sewage outfall.  We have an enormous amount of human excrement which is disposed of in what is in my opinion an unsuitable and utterly unproductive way in these works where it could be reclaimed and used for the production of energy.  Why do we not think also, for example, in terms of the implementation of a district heating system employing waste?  They have done this in Sweden and in a number of the Scandinavian countries and yet we have not found ourselves capable of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of the waste that is involved is what I would call insidious waste.  It can come in various forms.  Recently a radium needle was misplaced from a hospital. Some child finding this in a dump would not realise the danger to which he or she was exposed by virtue of the radiation effects of this needle.  We see, those of <Col N="1630" /> us who love our beaches and walk along the strands, the effect of plastic bags disposal. They crop up all over the place.  I have to say that the industrial concerns, which we would like to feel are responsible, are very often not responsible at all.  For example, the Mogul Corporation of America produced plastic bags that were supposed to be photo-degradable, in other words, destroyed by sunlight. That is fine, but they did not tell anybody that they were specifically used for burying in dumps where they never came into contact with the sunlight so they simply never became properly biodegradable. We have to be aware of this.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear the Minister is correct when he talks about the international ramifications of the NIMBY syndrome, the fact that nobody really wants it in our back yard, that we have to wake up to the fact that other countries are increasingly unwilling to accept our waste and that we may well, as we move into the nineties, find it difficult to persuade anybody else to do our dirty work for us.  Not only are we finding that, but our great ally, the United States, is finding it.  Perhaps the Minister will not think me too tendentious if I suggest that perhaps if he has some of these friendly talks &mdash; as for example, when he was President of the European Council of Ministers for the Environment &mdash; he might like to drop a hint to the United States of America that it simply is not good neighbourly practice to use the harassed state of Nicaragua as a dump for their toxic waste which the Mayor of a small town in Nicaragua assured me last week was one of the principal arms of American policy at the moment.</P>
    <P>One final point, because I catch the dangerous glint in the Acting Chairman's eye, is on a purely urban note.  Living as I do in the city of Dublin and loving it, we are aware of waste at that level of domestic rubbish.  It seems to me quite extraordinary that the hamburger joints are allowed to continue to pollute the <Col N="1631" /> main streets of this city without suffering a tax.  I would like to ask the Minister to consider implementing, as part of these regulations, a specific tax on those hamburger joints and other outlets whose trademarked bags and containers can be seen floating in the Smurfit fountain and all along the gutters in O'Connell Street. I believe they should be at least taxed in order to provide the wages for litter wardens who might be able to reduce the incidence of this by approaching members of the public and fining them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>This subject is of grave importance for our long term future.  If we want people to dispose of waste products by recycling we have to make recycling economical.  I see two ways of doing this.  One is by charging people an economic rate for disposal of refuse and the second is, by taking into account the saving the recycling industry is making in raw materials.  Recycling reduces the volume of waste that is just disposed of, as a result, we use up fewer resources. We will have to make a much greater effort to ensure that glass, paper, etc. is used again and again.  This will not happen of its own accord.</P>
      <P>It is fine to talk about reducing toxic waste so that we do not need an incinerator to dispose of it.  Anybody who looks rationally at the situation will admit that while that must remain a long term goal, it is totally unrealistic to expect it to happen in the short term.  However, it is totally unsatisfactory to continue disposing toxic waste in the way we do at present.  I have no doubt that it is necessary to grasp the nettle on this issue and ensure that we dispose of toxic waste in a satisfactory manner.  At the same time we must continue to reduce the volume of toxic waste as rapidly as we can over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the disposal of animal and fish matter, in Galway we had the question of the disposal of fish from fish farms which both the fish farmers and the city authority considered to be a problem. We have to be more careful when we set <Col N="1632" /> up new industry to make arrangements for the safe and adequate disposal of any waste products that may arise.  It is as a result of lack of planning that there is often friction between communities and to problems that cause a lowering in effect of people's lifestyles.  It is a matter that needs to be addressed urgently. Large fish farms will not be able to prosper unless proper arrangements are made for the disposal of their waste products in a safe and environmentally satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>Mention was made briefly of the disposal of sludge.  One of the greatest challenges facing us is to come up with a suitable system for the disposal of sludges of various types, particularly organic type sludges and also to ensure in the future that rather than becoming a waste product they actually become a raw material for profitable processing.  I know that in the timber industry we have progressed rapidly from the stage where bark was something we had difficulty in disposing of to the present situation where the demand outstrips supply in the horticultural industry.  Timber millers are receiving more money for bark than they are for timber chips.</P>

It is essential that extra funding is made available to the many local authorities involved in recycling, in particular to groups such as the Kerry Co-op Recycling Group, who are doing tremendous work. <Col N="1633" /> There is no doubt that in the next few years people will continue to be agitated more and more about this problem.

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta ach caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil an-díomá orm nach bhfuil Aire na Gaeltachta anseo leis an cheist seo a fhreagairt.  Go deimhin féin, tá sé ansuntasach nach mbíonn Aire na Gaeltachta i láthair le ceist ar bith faoin Ghaeltacht a fhreagairt.  Is minic a dhéanaim mo mhachnamh ar an gceist, an bhfuil a leithéid de dhuine mar Aire Ghaeltachta againn in aon chor.  Cineál bean sí de Aire Gaeltachta atá againn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le ceist seo na Gaeltachta agus teilifís na Gaeltachta, cuireadh meitheal oibre ar bun i 1987 agus bhí Roinn na Gaeltachta páirteach sna díospóireachtaí a bhí ann ag an am sin, ach níor tharla tada dá bharr.  I 1988 d'ordaigh an Taoiseach &mdash; sin Aire na Gaeltachta nach bhfeiceann muid in am ar bith &mdash; go gcuirfí tuarascáil le chéile faoi chúrsaí theilifís Gaeilge nó teilifís Gaeilge bheith lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht don tír ar fad, agus go gcuirfeadh Údarás na Gaeltachta an tuarascáil seo ar fáil.  Chaith Údarás na Gaeltachta £70,000, de réir m'eolais, chun an tuarascáil sin a chur ar fáil, agus chuir RTÉ tuarascáil theicniúil, chuimsitheach ar fáil ag an am sin.  Bhí cur síos cuimsitheach ar na costais a bhain le bunú na teilifíse seo, agus SKC a chuir seo ar fáil sa tuarascáil.  Ba thuarascáil thoirtiúil é a raibh an-ábhar machnaimh ann agus <Col N="1634" /> ar a bhféadfaí cinneadh a bhunú.  I mí Mheán Fómhair, 1989, cuireadh an tuarascáil seo ar fáil don Aire, don Aire Stáit agus, ag deireadh thiar, do bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta le go mbeadh siad in ann an cheist a phlé.</P>
    <P>I mí Meithimh i mbliana dúirt Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta go mbeadh cinneadh ann i mí Mheán Fómhair.  Mí ó shin, agus é ag freagairt na ceiste, &ldquo;An raibh suim dáiríre ag an Taoiseach, Aire na Gaeltachta, i dteilifís na Gaeltachta&rdquo; in agallamh ar Raidió na Gaeltachta, dúirt Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta: &ldquo;Tá suim ag an Rialtas, cinnte, i dteilifís Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil ach, i láthair na huaire, ní bhfuair mé deis chun é seo a phlé leis an Taoiseach mar Aire na Gaeltachta&rdquo;.  Feictear domsa gur uafásach, siléigeach an freagra sin a theacht ó Aire Stáit ar bith, gur imigh míonna an tsamhraidh thart agus gan deis aige ceist seo teilifís na Gaeltachta a phlé le hAire na Gaeltachta tar éis an méid oibre a rinneadh agus an méid tuarascálacha a cuireadh ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire Stáit rudaí suntasacha eile san agallamh céanna.  &ldquo;Os rud é&rdquo;, a dúirt sé, &ldquo;go bhfuil an t-eolas uilig againn, níl aon eolas eile de dhíth orainn.  Tá an tuarascáil faighte againn agus tá sé scrúdaithe ag an Roinn Cumarsáide.  Níl le déanamh anois ach cinneadh a dhéanamh&rdquo;, agus &ldquo;cuirim béim ar leith ar an fhocal &ldquo;cinneadh&rdquo;: &ldquo;Tá mé ag súil go mbeidh cinneadh ann roimh dheireadh na bliana seo&rdquo;.  Ansin, agus é ag freagairt ceiste sa Dáil ar 2 Samhain, dúirt sé: &ldquo;Tá mé ag súil go mbeidh cinneadh ann roimh dheireadh na bliana nó ag tús mhí Eanáir&rdquo;.  Thosaigh muid i 1987 agus seo anois muid ag caint ar 1991.  Tá mé tar éis a chluinstean go bhfuil an Taoiseach le triúr a ainmniú le coiste eile a bhunú le moltaí nua faoi theilifís na Gaeltachta, a chur os a chomhair.</P>
    <P>Tá Proinsias Mac Aonghusa, Cathaoirleach Bhord na Gaeilge, Pádraig Ó Muircheartaigh, príomhfheidhmeannach Bhord Soláthair an Leictreachais agus John Sorohan, príomhoifigeach RTÉ, de réir mo chuid eolais, chun an cheist seo <Col N="1635" /> a scrúdu arís.  Cá bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta anseo?  Cé atá ag caint ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta más fíor é seo uilig?  Agus é seo tar éis an méid oibre atá déanta le blianta anuas.  Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta, mar shampla, ag tosú ar an dara cúrsa traenála, cúrsa a chuirfidh dhá chéad post ar fáil i dtionscal sin na teilifíse, ach é bheith ann.  Tá ochtar ó dháilcheantar an Aire Stáit féin traenáilte agus níl a fhios agam an bhfuil jab aige dóibh nó nach bhfuil.  Dhiúltaigh an tAire Stáit casadh le meitheal oibre maidir le teilifís na Gaeltachta agus dhiúltaigh sé trí huaire casadh le Feachtas Náisiúnta Teilifíse.</P>
    <P>Cén fáth go bhfuil an diúltú seo ann, mar deir sé linn go bhfuil chuile shórt réitithe agus nach bhfuil i gceist ach cinneadh a dhéanamh.  Ach, faraor géar, níl aon chinneadh tagtha fós agus is beag baol go dtiocfaidh.  Nach raibh cúrsaí go dona nuair a tháinig Feachtas Náisiúnta Teilifíse le chéile le linn an Oireachtais in Inis i mbliana agus gur rith siad rún, go raibh muinín caillte acu as Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta mar gheall ar an mhoill seo uilig.  Ná déanaigí dearmad go bhfuil an Feachtas Náisiúnta Teilifíse comhdhéanta de bheagnach 30 eagraíocht, cuid acu sa Ghaeltacht agus cuid lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Anois tá siad ag bagairt dul ar stailc ocrais mura bhfaigheann siad an t-eolas atá uathu.  Is dona an scéal é go bhfuil sé tagtha go dtí an pointe go bhfuil daoine ag bagairt stailc ocrais le heolas a fháil faoi rudaí atá geallta agus nach bhfuil á thabhairt, rudaí atá geallta chomh minic sin ag an Rialtas atá ag dul siar ar an méid atá ráite acu.</P>
    <P>Tá dhá ráiteas agam anseo, ráitis a thug mé féin sa Seanad ar 18 Bealtaine: &ldquo;The statistics now confirm entirely the dominant impression left by field study that Irish is now hovering on the verge of abandonment by its native speakers in all but a handful of school areas&rdquo;.  Sin ráiteas a bhí bunaithe ar staidéar an-mhór.  Dúirt mé sin leis an Aire Stáit ag an am agus d'iarr mé air rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi. <Col N="1636" /> Sa dara ráiteas a rinne an tAire Stáit é féin in agallamh le <i>Comhar</i> i mí Aibreáin seo caite, dúirt sé: &ldquo;Bhí meath ag teacht ar an Ghaeilge ar feadh tamaill.  Ceapaim go bhfuil stop curtha leis an meath sin anois&rdquo;.  Nach uafásach an difríocht idir an dá ráiteas sin?  Rinne fear, nach Éireannach é fiú amháin, mionscrúdú ar an gceist seo agus chuir sé trioblóid air féin an scrúdú seo a dhéanamh.  Dúirt sé go raibh an Ghaeilge ionann is bheith básaithe sa Ghaeltacht, agus seo aire Stáit na Gaeltachta ag rá go raibh deireadh leis an meath agus go raibh chuile shórt i gceart.</P>
    <P>Anois, cé atá ag insint na fírinne anseo? Fágfaidh mé an breithiúnas faoin fhírinne ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus ag pobal labhartha na Gaeilge sa tír.  Is eagal liom gur cur i gcéill agus cur ó dhoras atá ar bun maidir le seirbhís teilifíse Gaeltachta nó seirbhís teilifíse Gaeilge, agus é lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht, a chur ar fáil.  Cén chaoi a bhféadfadh an scéal a bheith ar aon bhealach eile?  Tá Aire againn atá in ainm is a bheith ina aire Gaeltachta ach nach bhfeicimid in am ar bith é.  Ní raibh sé riamh istigh sa seomra seo le ceist a fhreagairt faoin Ghaeltacht, ceisteanna a cuireadh go minic le bliain anuas.  Níl teacht air ag muintir na Gaeltachta, ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ná ag a Roinn féin, Roinn na Gaeltachta, sin é Taoiseach na tíre seo.  Léiríonn sé sin domsa agus do go leor leor daoine nach bhfuil ann ach cur i gcéill, gur sciob sé leis aireacht fhíorthábhachtach, gur thóg sé chuige féin é agus nár thug sé don Ghaeltacht an rud a bhí dlite di.</P>
    <P>Is é an polasaí atá anois ann ó thaobh theilifís Gaeltachta de ná polasaí cur ó dhoras.  Sin an polasaí atá ann.  Tá sé ráite arís agus arís eile nach bhfuil le déanamh ach cinneadh.  Tá an cinneadh á chur siar agus níl aon fhreagra ceart le fáil.  Is é an polasaí atá ann ná &ldquo;Mair a chapaill agus gheobhair féar&rdquo;.  Fanaigí beo, seans go dtiocfaidh sé.  B'fhéidir go dtiocfaidh sé am éigin, ach, idir an dá linn, ligfidh muid don Ghaeilge bás a fháil.  Sin díreach an rud atá ag tarlú, agus níl duine ar bith ag éisteacht.  Níl Aire na Gaeltachta ag <Col N="1637" /> éisteacht cinnte mar ní thagann sé inár láthair.  Níl Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta ag tabhairt airde nó cluaise ar a bhfuil á rá ag na saineolaithe faoin Ghaeilge.  Tá sé ráite ag mo leithéidí agus ag daoine eile, mura mbíonn teilifís Ghaeltachta ann go mbeidh deireadh go deo leis an Ghaeilge in achar glúine eile.</P>
    <P>Is aisteach liom go dtógann sé chomh fada sin do Aire nó Rialtas ar bith a n-intinn a dhéanamh suas faoi cheist seo na Gaeilge agus Teilifís na Gaeltachta. Tar éis an ama seo ar fad ó 1987 go dtí anois tá sé cloiste againn go bhfuil coiste eile le bunú leis an scéal uilig a fhiosrú. Tar éis a bhfuil ráite ag an Aire Stáit faoi seo ní thuigim cén chaoi a bhféadfaí aon mhuinín as Aire Stáit nó Aire Gaeltachta bheith ann nuair a ligtear muintir na Gaeltachta síos chomh dona sin agus ní amháin muintir na Gaeltachta ach muintir na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Ní cóir go ligfí lena leithéid agus tá mé ag rá go bhfuil tórramh na Gaeilge buailte linn.  Táimid á thuar ag an bpointe seo, tá an Ghaeilge á bású.  Níl le déanamh ag Aire Stáit, a dúirt go bhfuil deireadh leis an meath, ach dul siar go Conamara nó a dhúiche féin i nDún na nGall agus éisteacht leis na gasúir óga.  Tá an Ghaeilge cinnte ag na seandaoine agus ag na daoine meánaosta, ach céard faoin ghlúin óg mar níl an Ghaeilge á labhairt acu agus níl sí le cloisteáil sna scoileanna, nó i gclós scoile ar bith.  I mbliana b'éigean do bhuachaillí agus do chailíní as Baile Atha Cliath a bhí ar chúrsa Gaeilge thiar i gConamara eiseamláir a thabhairt do ghasúir na háite a bhí ag spalpadh Béarla lasmuigh de gheataí an choláiste.  Sin mar atá cúrsaí anois, agus an taon seans amháin atá ann chun an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú ná teilifís Ghaeltachta a chur ar fáil dúinn.  Sin an méid a bhí le déanamh agus níl sé déanta fós.</P>
    <P>Táimid uilig ar ais ag an seanscéal arís; cuirfidh muid coiste eile ar bun.  Deirim arís go bhfuil deireadh beagnach leis an Ghaeltacht, go bhfuil deireadh le labhairt na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Mura gcuirtear Teilifís Ghaeltachta ar bun láithreach le <Col N="1638" /> léas nó seans éigin a thabhairt don Ghaeilge lena coinneáil beo glúin nó dhó eile, le go mbeadh deis aici láidriú lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, tá thiar orainn. Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire Stáit a rá le hAire na Gaeltachta gan a bheith ag ceapadh coistí eile.  Má chuireann sé coiste eile ar bun leis an scéal seo a fhiosrú arís, tar éis don Aire Stáit a rá, &ldquo;Tá gach rud scrúdaithe againn agus déanfar cinneadh go luath&rdquo;, chiallódh sé sin nach bhfuil aon mheas aige ar an Aire Stáit, agus ní fhéadfadh Aire Stáit feidhmiú faoi Aire a dhéarfadh go bhfuil coiste eile ag teastáil anois.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm deis a fháil teacht isteach go dtí an Teach seo.  Is dócha gurb í an fhadhb is mó a bhíonn agam ná nach mbíonn an oiread sin ama agam chun dóthain cásanna a phlé, ní amháin an cás seo.  Má tá an Seanadóir Ó Foighil sásta dul siar sa stair, tá mise sásta sin a dhéanamh freisin.  Má tá sé ag iarraidh a bheith pearsanta, tá mise sásta sin a dhéanamh chomh maith.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhí mé faoi agallamh ar Raidió na Gaeltachta tamall ó shin dúirt mé nach raibh am ag Aire na Gaeltachta an cheist faoi sheirbhís teilifíse trí Ghaeilge a phlé liom.  Is é a bhí á rá agam nach raibh am aige an t-ábhar iomlán a phlé.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt mé go raibh an t-eolas againn agus tá mé a rá arís go bhfuil an t-eolas againn agus go bhfuil an cinneadh le glacadh agam.  Tá a fhios go maith ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil gur sin an rud a bhí i gceist agam.  Tá a fhios go maith aige gur gheall muidne seirbhís teilifíse trí Ghaeilge agus go gcuirfidh muid an tseirbhís sin ar fáil.  Cé a gheall Raidió na Gaeltachta?  Muidne, Fianna Fáil, a gheall Raidió na Gaeltachta agus chuir muid ar fáil é.  Cé a gheall Údarás na Gaeltachta?  Muidne a gheall é agus muidne a chuir ar bun é.  Cé rinne gach iarracht chun Údarás na Gaeltachta a scrios?  Níl a fhios agam cén páirtí a raibh tusa ann ag an am sin.  An raibh tú i do bhall de Fhianna Fáil, nó i do Neamhspleách, <Col N="1639" /> nó i do bhall d'Fhine Gael nó na Progressive Democrats.  Ach, an dream a bhfuil baint agat anois leo inniú, sibhse a rinne iarracht Údarás na Gaeltachta a scrios.  Chuireamar Radió na Gaeltachta agus Údarás na Gaeltachta ar bun. Gheall an Taoiseach mar Aire na Gaeltachta go mbunódh sé seirbhís theilifíse Ghaeltachta, agus cuirfear an seirbhís sin ar fáil.  Táimid meabhrach ar an tábhacht atá ag gabháil le teilifís sa lá atá inniu ann, maraon lena tionchar ar an aos óg. Tá todhchaí na Gaeilge ag brath, nach mór, ar an aos óg.  Tá suim againn sa chultúr Gaelach agus i dtodhchaí na Gaeilge agus seasfaimid le muintir na Gaeltachta dá réir.</P>
    <P>Ní mór ceist a chur i dtaobh blianta an Chomhrialtais 1982-87, nuair a bhí go leor airgid sa tír.  I 1982 bhí suim £12 bhilliún d'fhiacha náisiúnta anuas orainn, ach faoi dheireadh a dtréimhse i 1987, bhí 25 bhilliún d'fhiacha i gceist.  Léirionn sé sin an méid airgid a cuireadh amú le linn an ama ach fós ní rabhthas ábalta an t-airgead cuí a aimsiú chun an seirbhís theilifís Ghaeilge a bhunadh.</P>
    <P>Gealladh dúinn go laghdófaí easnamh na cáináisnéise ó £750 milliún go neamhnaí laistigh de cheithre bhliain.  Is é a tharla ná gur ardaíodh é go £1,400 milliún, nó mar sin.  Cuimhnímid freisin ar fhadhb dífhostaíochta an ama sin; briseadh breis is 100,000 duine as a bpostanna.  Cá raibh an Comhrialtas agus an Seanadóir Ó Foighil ag an am sin?</P>

      <P>Beidh mé ag plé leis an cheist sin, chomh maith, maidir leis an méid atá déanta.  Tháinig an Seanadóir Ó Foighil isteach sa Teach seo.  Rinne sé ionsaí fíochmhar ar oifigigh Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Dúirt sé ag an am sin dá <Col N="1640" /> mbeadh £1 mhilliún de dhíth ar an Roinn go bhfaigheadh siad é ó Údarás na Gaeltachta, toisc an oiread sin airgid a bheith le spáráil acu.  Ionsaí ar Oifigigh na Roinne a bhí a dhéanamh aige, ar oifigigh a thugadh tacaíocht dó nuair a bhí sé ina bhainisteoir ar Chomharchumainn.</P>

    <P>Tá a fhios ag muintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil cara acu anseo agus go bhfuil mé dáirire futhu agus faoin nGaeilge.  Tá a fhios acu go bhfuil an Taoiseach agus Aire na Gaeltachta dáiríre ina dtaobh, chomh maith.  Anuraidh bhí uasteorainn <Col N="1641" /> £4.5 mhilliún ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus nuair a thángamar i gcumhacht, d'árdaíomar go £9 milliún é.  Is eol don Seanadóir freisin go raibh uasteorainn £6.2 milliún ann ag tús na bliana agus go bhfuil sé os cionn £12.5 mhilliún anois. Tá se cruthaithe ag Fianna Fáil anuas tríd na blianta go bhfuilimid ag déanamh ar ndícheall ar son pobal na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá sé iontach furasta do bhaill an Fhreasúra a theacht isteach sa Teach agus a rá go bhfreagraíonn tuarascáil Údarás na Gaeltachta na ceisteanna go léir.  Is cuimhin liom go maith gur dúradh sa tuarascáil sin go gcosnódh sé £5.7 milliún chun an treallamh a chur ar fáil agus an seirbhís a bhunadh, agus, go gcosnódh sé £9.6 milliún gach uile bhliain chun seirbhís a chur ar fáil ar feadh dhá uair a chloig in aghaidh an lae.  Taobh istigh d'achar gearr, tháinig Udarás na Gaeltachta ar ais chugainn agus an Seanadoír Ó Foighil ina bhall den Údarás sin ag rá go mba leor £4.8 milliún agus go ndéanfadh uair a chloig d'am craolta cúis, in aghaidh an lae.  Nach maith an rud é go bhfuil an cheist seo dá cíoradh?  Caithfear é sin a dhéanamh.  Níl an Rialtas ná Roinn na Gaeltachta ag iarradh cinneadh a ghlacadh ar bhunús <i>&lsquo;ad hoc&rsquo;.</i>  B'fhéidir go bhfuil daoine eile ar nós an Seanadóir Ó Foighil sásta a leitheid a dhéanamh ach níl an Rialtas.  Caithfear pleanáil ceart a dhéanamh agus níl mise sásta cinneadh a ghlacadh toisc brú a bheith á chur orm ag an Seanadóir.  Airgead mhuintir na hÉireann atá á chaitheamh againn agus ní mór cúram a dhéanamh de go bhfaighfear toradh ar an gcaiteachas sin.  Tá an t-eolas go léir againn ach ní ghlacfaimid cinneadh ar a shon féin.</P>
    <P>Geallaim do mhuintir na Gaeltachta nach bhfeilfeadh sé dóibh a bheith ag feitheamh ar Fhine Gael ná ar chomhrialtas ar bith a mbeadh Fine Gael ina chuid de, chun freastal orthu.  Bhí deis acu rud fhiúntach a dhéanamh ach chuir siad £13 bhilliún déag amú idir 1982 agus 1987.  Ní raibh ceist ann i dtaobh teilifís na Gaeltachta ná i dtaobh Roinn na Gaeltachta. Is cuimhin liom nach raibh Roinn ná Aire <Col N="1642" /> na Gaeltachta sásta pingin rua a chaitheamh taobh amuigh de b'fhéidir, £10,000 le haghaidh chontae amháin, in ainneoin an drochbhail a bhí ar bhóithre uile na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>Níl morán maitheasa in Aire Gaeltachta mura bhfuil sé sásta airgead a chur ar fáil.  Tá a fhios ag an Teach agus ag an Seanadóir O Foighil go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht i bhfad níos fearr as ó tháinig an Taoiseach ina Aire Gaeltachta. Le linn ciorraithe a bheith á gcur i bhfeidhm anuraidh i Ranna Stáit éagsúla, fuair Roinn na Gaeltachta árdú de 27 faoin gcéad.  Tá eolas maith agamsa ar fhadhbanna na Gaeltachta, agus b'fhéidir gur díomá a bhéas ar an Seanadóir Ó Foighil nuair a bheidh Meastacháin na bliana seo chugainn réidh.  Tá a fhios againn an tábhacht atá le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta agus ní dhearnamar cinneadh airiamh a chuirfeadh an eagraíocht i mbaol.  Is eol don Seanadóir Ó Foighil cad iad na hiarrachtaí a rinneadh ag an am sin chun an eagraíocht a scrios.</P>
      <P>Bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta i 1979 nuair a chuir an t-iar Aire, Denis Gallagher, reacht tríd an Oireachtas.  Is as sin a bunaíodh Raidió na Gaeltachta agus táimid iontach bródúil as an &ldquo;jab&rdquo; atá á dhéanamh acu.  Sinne a bhunaigh Raidió na Gaeltachta.  Gheallamar seirbhís theilifíse trí Ghaeilge chomh maith agus cuirfimid í sin ar fáil ar an dóigh chéanna.  Níor mhór an tairbhe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a bheith ag brath ar an bPáirtí ar a bhfuil an Seanadóir Ó Foighil ina bhall.  Níl duine ar bith sa tír a chuaigh ó thaobh amháin an Tí go dtí an taobh eile, ó Fhianna Fáil go dtí na baill neamhspleácha, go dtí Fine Gael, go dtí Páirtí na Progressive Democrats agus ar ais arís chuig Fine Gael.</P>
