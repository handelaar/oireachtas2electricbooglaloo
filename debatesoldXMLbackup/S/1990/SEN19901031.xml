      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe O'Reilly that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to allocate funds towards the provision of a swimming pool in County Cavan.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to set in motion forthwith the necessary machinery for allocating appropriate public funding from the national lottery for the rebuilding of the Hirschfeld Centre in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Fóighil:</P>
      <P>Ba chóir d'Aire na Gaeltachta a mhíniú cen fáth nach raibh am aige plé a dhéanamh faoi Theilifís na Gaeltachta lena Aire Stáit Gaeltachta ó Mí an Mheithimh go dtí Mí Dheireadh Fómhair na bliana seo.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the <Col N="1194" /> Marine to hold a public inquiry into any proposed infill housing development at West Pier, Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Carmencita Hederman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to ensure that in future Presidential elections he circulates his election order direct to all members of the 32 local authorities who under the Constitution are empowered to nominate a candidate, to avoid the situation which arose in this election where a number of councils had motions tailored by members which could not be considered as they did not allow compliance with the three tier notice rule.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Joe O'Reilly, Norris, Ó Foighil and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senator O'Reilly's which will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Norris, Ó Foighil and Ross may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.  I regret I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Hederman as not suitable for the Adjournment on the grounds that it involves legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is Items Nos. 6 and 5 and from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  Item No. 66.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I have to say first that there is a certain air of unreality and uncertainty about our proceedings today.  For that reason I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we are meeting tomorrow and afterwards, if he would arrange to have a debate on the events of last weekend in Rome &mdash; the outcome of the summit in Rome &mdash; which have the most far-reaching consequences for this country, and if he would look sympathetically at a full day-long debate on that issue.  Also, could he assure us that the Order Paper will be somewhat more <Col N="1195" /> substantial in the coming weeks, should there be coming weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to raise on behalf of the Independent group a number of sensitive matters relating to the function of the Cathaoirleach as a Senator and to say that we have been concerned over the summer about certain actions taken by yourself.  I do not wish to go into them in detail and I do not wish to create any difficulty for yourself.  I will be very brief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind you that I cannot allow you to involve the Chair in the proceedings of the House. Standing Orders are very specific in that regard and with great respect to you, Senator, I must point out to you that I will rely on Standing Orders to protect the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments are directed through you to the Leader of the House.  I want to make that clear.  I ask that the functions of the Chair and the way in which the office of the Cathaoirleach should be carried out with sensitivity and with dignity and with due regard to the House and to the office and making a sensitive differentiation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind you that you are making inferences concerning the Chair that are not acceptable and you are in breach of Standing Orders. I am now asking you to desist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, a Chathaoirligh, I would ask that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges would look at the role of the Cathaoirleach in order that there would be guidelines put together by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so that this difficulty does not constantly arise.  I am saying this in the most subtle way I can manage &mdash; I am not personalising it &mdash; through the Leader of the House.  I do not wish to have a debate on it at this point.  I just feel it is something we should address.  It is something which should be clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator, you are completely out of order and I have given you very considerable latitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Leader of the House to respond on that matter, please.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House what progress is being made in relation to the televising of proceedings in the Chamber and could he give an up-to-date report to us.  Also, has the Leader any proposals to change the proceedings in relation to a smoother running of the Seanad and its business?</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí, cad iad na socruithe nua atá déanta anois le go mbeadh córas aistriúcháin comhfhuaimneach sa Seanad, agus an bhfuil aon scéal faighte aige nach mbeidh a leithéid ar fáil agus cén fáth nach mbeidh sé ar fáil.  Tá sé seo ardaithe agamsa faoi riail 29 agus beidh mé ag iarraidh ar an Chathaoirleach rialú air sin inniu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Senator O'Toole, that it is a matter to be solved and it should be solved.  While I agree with Senator Cassidy that televising of this House is an important issue and should be sorted out, may I say that, given the paucity of business in this House, there has been very little to televise over the last six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to briefly mention to the Leader of the House &mdash; perhaps he would carry it back to his colleague, the Minister for Finance &mdash; the disturbing situation we had last week when our secretaries were outside Leinster House. Thankfully now, it appears an initiative has taken place and talks will take place. All of us would be concerned about the situation if it were to develop.  I ask the Leader of the House to carry back to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, the need to recognise the seriousness of the situation and to respond positively to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the acoustics were improved in the House but clearly that is not evident at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Cosgrave has said.  I think it is very important that the valuable work done by the secretaries is recognised and appropriately rewarded because it helps to make us efficient in the performance of our proper function.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he can give us any information with regard to Government proposals to amend the law on homosexuality in line with the European Court judgment.  I so ask because it is my intention to put down once more on the Order Paper a motion identical to the one that was on the last Order Paper and particularly in recognition of the fact that last Saturday was the second anniversary of this judgment. It seems astonishing that the Government can continue to ignore this.  I would like if the Leader of the House could give some information on that.</P>
      <P>I would like simply to confirm to the House that I wrote to Senator O'Toole who is my representative on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the matter he raised which I do not intend to go into.  I am sure you, Sir, will see that it is dealt with in that committee unlike a previous matter in a previous Seanad where I directed the attention of the CPP to a misleading of the House by a Government Cabinet Minister.  That matter was never resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow that type of comment to be made.  Again, Senator, it is regrettable that you have to be constantly reminded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in accordance with the matter we are dealing with at the moment, that is, the Order of Business.</P>

    <Col N="1198" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of my confidence in the capacity of the CPP to deal appropriately with serious matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I move on to make a specific proposal about the Order of Business: that we take as the first item No. 78 on the supplementary Order Paper in the name of Senator Ross and myself:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann requests the Government to establish a judicial inquiry to establish the truth of recent statements in the press that a member of the present Government while in Opposition in 1982 applied improper pressure to a member of the, armed forces serving on the staff of Áras an Uachtaráin.</P>
      <P>I would like finally to conclude by saying that it was a matter of regret to me to be in the other Chamber and to hear the Leader of the Labour Party express dissatisfaction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator might get in touch with the Presidential candidate who is very hot on homosexuality and might support his cause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <P>Senator, I am asking you to resume your seat.  If you contributed to the type of order that is essential in this House, the Chair might <Col N="1199" /> hear exactly what Members are saying. Senator Hourigan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an intimation that the House may or may not be meeting tomorrow.  I would like, through you, a Chathaoirligh, to say to the Leader of the House that in the event of the House not meeting tomorrow perhaps accommodation could be found to discuss the crisis in agriculture.  The crisis in agriculture is extremely grave and it warrants urgent and immediate debate and attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Members of the House are most anxious to see the business of the House being conducted in a smooth manner.  I believe there are some Members in the House who misunderstand your liberal approach and that you have endeavoured to give even Independents a fair innings and a fair contribution.  That is totally misunderstood to the point where I believe that you, a Chathaoirligh, will have to recognise that those who have been so accommodated are now reaching the stage where they are abusing the facilities of this House every day to a point that is not acceptable to the majority of the Members of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I plead guilty to Senator McGowan's accusation.  I certainly misunderstand your liberal approach. Senator McGowan is absolutely correct. I would ask you to ask Senator McCarthy to withdraw the remark which he made on the record here that Senator Norris <Col N="1200" /> should consult with his Presidential colleague who is hot on the subject of homosexuality. If you did not hear it, Sir, that is what he said.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I did not hear the remark.  On many occasions I am not in a position to hear because of the confrontational situation that develops at the drop of a hat here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The second thing I would like to say on the Order of Business is that although today I suppose we are not in the limelight, and therefore we are not under pressure and the business we are discussing is not under scrutiny, I think I could ask the Leader of the House a perfectly routine question, and that is why there is only one minor piece of legislation before this House and there are 27 pieces of legislation before the Dáil?  It is an appalling reflection on this House that the business of this House is continually being run by the Government in this totally carefree and cavalier fashion.  I have not been into the details <Col N="1201" /> of what legislation could have been introduced here which is now before the Dáil, but it appears to me that several of the Bills that are coming to the Dáil could have been introduced in this House.  We have got absolutely nothing to do in the way of legislation bar one Bill.  We are discussing tomorrow statements on agriculture which may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the question.  I would like the Leader of the House to give us some assurances, if this Seanad is going to last, that we will get continuous legislation introduced in this House, no clog of legislation in the Dáil, and a fair crack of the whip in this House.</P>

      <P>I would like to get back to the real business of this House.  On exactly 1 November last year, I, with the Fine Gael group, put down a motion looking for Seanad voting rights to be extended to the junior universities, Dublin City University and the University of Limerick.  Since then a decision was made that a committee would be set up to look into the feasibility of granting the Seanad franchise.  The leader came back to us and said that it was not within the jurisdiction of a committee to decide on Seanad votes.  Does the Leader of the House intend to take up immediately the situation of extending Seanad voting rights to the two new universities and not have the discrimination that exists at the moment where there are graduates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Leader of the House would be willing to make time available for a broader discussion of the matters that are of national concern at the present time that would certainly be most welcome, considering the paucity of information or material we are dealing with today on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Secondly, would the Leader of the House give us an idea of the programme of work we are likely to face in the coming months, if there is going to be a programme of work and how he would envisage the matters being dealt with?  In the last sitting of the Seanad we emphasised the necessity of allowing this House to have the opportunity of initiating legislation. There are so many Bills at present on the Order Paper of the other House that we could easily take up some of that burden of work.  Could we have some response in relation to that matter?</P>

There is a situation here where innuendo has become the rule, where there is absolutely no truth.  There are people here who are suggesting, from a newspaper report, that an item should be placed and a judicial inquiry should be held because of a newspaper inquiry and report.  It is disgraceful that this item should appear on the Order Paper.  Innuendo should not be used to have items placed on the Order Paper.  I sincerely suggest that this item be never discussed.</P>

I want to say simply one thing that will clear up the matter.  I have not been a member of the Politics <Col N="1206" /> Department since 1987.  I have been fulltime Director of Development at University College, Dublin.

      <P>With regard to Senator Cassidy's question regarding the problem of television, I would say to the Senator that, while strictly speaking it is not a matter for the Leader of the House to report to the House on matters currently before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I feel it would be of benefit to Members if I brought them up to date on this matter and, indeed, on the matter raised by Senator Ó Foighil as well.  It is expected that the in-House televising, that is the internal monitors, should be in place and televising should commence late November or early December and that broadcasting proper should commence after the Christmas recess, probably nearer to Easter.  The time lag between the commencement of in-House television and broadcasting is to allow for a very necessary experimental period and <Col N="1207" /> also to allow for the recruitment and training of all the technical staff.  The rules of coverage are being discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at present.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy also referred to a smoother running, as it were, of the House.  I think I know the kind of things he is talking about and it is certainly something that is ongoing.  I have had an informal chat with the Clerk of the Seanad, as has the Government Whip, Senator G.V. Wright, regarding this matter.  Certainly there are loopholes in Standing Orders which I feel need to be closed &mdash; for example, the election of the Cathaoirleach.  The Clerk acts as Chairman until a Cathaoirleach is elected, but in so doing he has no power over the debate.  That kind of situation is something on which recommendations have to be made.  The question of the summoning of the Seanad for a special sitting, we had that recently.  Again, that is something that could be looked at.  There are other problems generally which need to be examined and improved upon and that is something we will do in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ó Foighil spoke about the position of the translation service.  I am aware that the Senator received a letter from the Cathaoirleach in regard to this matter.  For the benefit of all the Senators, I want to inform them that there is a technical matter involved.  The committee had to change their desired option of having a remote location translation system to an on-site system on the technical advice of the people from the Office of Public Works.  The enforced change in plan has meant a delay.  We all hoped the system would be installed for this particular session.  However, the committee have been assured that the booth and the other technical requirements will be installed during the next session.  I want to stress to Senator Ó Foighil and other Senators that it is a technical matter.  It was technically impossible to do the work as the Committee on Procedure and Privileges had asked.  May I also comment on a matter <Col N="1208" /> that has been raised over the last number of years regarding the sound system.  My information is that the sound system has been greatly improved in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked for the programme of work.  Senator Ryan sarcastically asked about the amount of work we have been doing over the past number of months.  To date we have had 47 sittings in this year.  Hopefully, we will sit another 14, 15 or 16 times, which will bring us well over 60 sittings.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it would compare very favourably with other years.  For example, the average annual sittings for the years 1965-71 was 33 days.  The average annual sittings for 1972-78 was 37 days.  For the years 1979-86, the average was 42.3 days.  I am saying that, if we continue as I hope we will, we will have sittings this year of over 60 days.  In the sittings of the Seanad in July alone, over a total of 10 days was over 100 hours.  In 1972 for the full year we sat 187 hours in total.  In 1980 we had 176 hours in total.</P>

      <P>Senator Liam Cosgrave referred to something which is not appropriate to the Order of Business, as <Col N="1209" /> did Senator Norris, namely, the question of secretaries.</P>
      <P>I have no information regarding the change of the law concerning homosexuality as the Senator asked.  At this point I am not accepting Item No. 78, which was proposed by the Senator and seconded by another Senator.</P>
      <P>Senator Hourigan referred to agriculture. As Senators know, we are meeting tomorrow to discuss that problem. Senator McGowan raised something which is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross's first point was not appropriate to the Order of Business.  He spoke about the pieces of legislation and he wants to knows about new Bills.  The position regarding this problem &mdash; Senator Costello also asked this &mdash; is that in the legislative programme for this session it is proposed to have the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Bill, the Criminal Damage Bill, the International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Bill, Destructive Insects and Pests (Amendment) Bill, Irish Land Dissolution Bill, Fóir Teo. Bill, Radiological Protection Bill, Sea Pollution Bill, The Child Care Bill which is at Report Stage as is the Companies Bill.  The latter was a Seanad Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bills in draft and which I hope will he taken before Christmas include the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, the National Roads Authority Bill, the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, the Exchange Controls Bill, the Patents Bill and the Part-time Workers Protection Bill.  There are three Seanad Bills as follows: The Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, the Contractual Obligations (Applicable Law) Bill and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question raised by Senator <Col N="1210" /> O'Keeffe was not appropriate to the Order of Business as well as the point raised by Senator Martin Cullen.  Senator Jackman again raised a matter to which I gave what I thought was the proper answer at the time and I can only add to that and say that is still the position.  It seems to me it is a matter for a body other than the Seanad to set about doing what the Senator desires in regard to that matter.  Senator Costello seconded the proposal to take Item No. 78 which I am not agreeing to.  He also asked for a legislative programme which I have already given.  Senator Lanigan made a comment regarding Item No. 78.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity of placing before the Seanad this important piece of legislation.  It is designed to remedy an injustice in the present law which can, in certain cases, result in a person losing his right of action for personal injuries before he is in a position to know that he had such a cause of action.</P>
      <P>Under the Statute of Limitations, 1957, there is a three year period within which a person who suffers injury because of the wrongful act of another may make a claim for damages from the person responsible for causing the injury. That period is expressed by the statute to run from the date on which the cause of action accrued.  The effect of this provision is that if a person does not realise that he has in fact suffered injury within three years of the act that caused it, or if he is aware of the injury but does not realise within three years that it was caused by the actionable deed or omission of another, then he may find that his legal remedy is gone before he knew he had such a remedy.  The types of cases I am talking about are generally cases in which the damage caused may not manifest itself for some years afterwards and, in the meantime, the time limit for taking an action has elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in their 1987 report entitled &ldquo;Statute of Limitations: Claims in respect of Latent Personal Injuries&rdquo;, pointed out that the law in this area was unclear and possibly unconstitutional.  A recent judgment by the Supreme Court has gone some way towards clarifying the present law in that it confirmed that the date from which time begins to run is not the date on which the injury was discoverable.  The court expressly reserved its position on the question of constitutionality of the existing law since that question had not <Col N="1216" /> been argued before it in the particular case.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in implementing the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in the report I mentioned, will remedy the injustice that exists and will also remove constitutional doubts about the present law.</P>
    <P>The Bill achieves this by providing that the three year limitation period that applies in personal injuries cases will run from the date of accrual of the cause of action as at present or the date of knowledge of the injured person. Appropriate provisions which I will go into later are also made in the Bill for circumstances where the person injured is not the claimant.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill defines the date of knowledge by setting out what one needs to know in order to be fixed with knowledge for the purposes of the Bill and in what circumstances one may be treated as already having knowledge of a particular fact.  Briefly, the date of knowledge of an injured plaintiff is the date on which he first knew that he had been injured and that the injury was significant and attributable to the wrongful act of another identified person or persons.  Such a person will be regarded as having knowledge of facts ascertainable with the help of medical or other expert advice which it would be reasonable for him to obtain but he will not be fixed with knowledge, for example, which he has failed to acquire as a result of the injury.</P>
    <P>The principal provision in the Statute of Limitations, 1957, dealing with limitation periods in claims involving personal injuries is effectively replaced by section 3 of the Bill.  This section and section 6 are the core provisions of the Bill.  The effect of the replacement is to permit the three year limitation period that applies in such cases to run from the accrual of the cause of action or, if later, from the date of knowledge of the person injured.  Section 3 of the Bill also makes similar changes to analogous provisions in the legislation dealing with the sale of goods and the control of dogs.</P>
    <P>Where a person who had a cause of <Col N="1217" /> action has died, that cause of action survives for the benefit of his estate and may be pursued by the personal representative of the deceased.  Section 4 of the Bill deals with situations of this kind by providing that a personal injuries action for the benefit of the deceased's estate such as an action in respect of certain pecuniary losses, for example, medical bills or loss of earnings resulting from the injury, may be brought within three years of the death or of the date of knowledge of the personal representative, if later.</P>
    <P>In addition, where a personal injury has caused death, the surviving dependants of the deceased may have a claim under Part IV of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, against the person responsible. Existing law provides that an action of this kind must be commenced within three years of the death.  Section 6 of the Bill applies the date of knowledge principle to such actions by providing that they may be taken within three years of the death or of the date of knowledge of any person for whose benefit the action is brought, whichever is the latest.</P>
    <P>The statute of limitations makes special provision for the circumstances where a person is under a legal disability when a right of action accrues.  &ldquo;Disability&rdquo; in this context includes incapacity because one has not attained majority as well as mental incapacity.  The law at present provides that where a right of action involving a claim for personal injuries accrues to a person while under a legal disability, the three year limitation period will not start to run against that person until he or she ceases to be under a disability.  Thus, if a person is injured in childhood, he or she may institute proceedings at any time up to three years after reaching the age of majority which is normally the age of 18.</P>
    <P>The Bill, at section 5, applies the date of knowledge principle to the special provisions for disability.  Under the new provision, the three year period will run from the cessation of the disability if the right of action accrued while the person in question was under a disability or if that person's date of knowledge was during a period of disability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> All in all, I am satisfied that this Bill achieves a sound balance between two conflicting requirements.  These are, on the one hand, the need to compensate an injured person fairly for injuries caused by the wrongful act of another; and on the other, the requirement to offer a measure of certainty and finality so that people may arrange their affairs secure in the knowledge that they will not be exposed to claims long after the event.</P>
    <P>Because of fears that the provisions of this Bill could lead to claims being made long after the event, there have been suggestions that there should be a &ldquo;long stop provision&rdquo; or a &ldquo;cut-off provision&rdquo; which would prevent any claim being made after a certain time had elapsed. The Law Reform Commission rejected that suggestion and I suggest they were correct in doing so and that there is no need for such a provision.  The courts are ever vigilant to prevent injustice which could be caused to defendants by allowing preceedings to continue long after the event when witnesses may no longer be available or when it may be unreasonable to expect them to be able to recall long past events.</P>
    <P>In putting this Bill before you, I must not neglect to express my appreciation of the careful research and analysis carried out by the Law Reform Commission in their report on Latent Personal Injuries. This Bill substantially implements their recommendations in that report.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister here today and the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill.  It has been Fine Gael policy for some years that the law on limitation of actions as applied in latent personal injuries should be amended. The Bill closely resembles the Private Members' Bill introduced by a former Fine Gael Deputy George Birmingham in 1988.  That Bill was not enacted at that time and the Bill before us replaces it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fine Gael accept the key principle in the Bill that the three year limitation period in personal injury cases will run from the date on which the person <Col N="1219" /> injured discovered or should have discovered that there was a cause of action. On most occasions this will be from time of occurrence but allows for injuries which do not immediately manifest themselves.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the Law Reform Commission in its deliberations considered and dismissed other options, such as no time limits, which would be likely to provoke fraudulent or speculative claims. Witnesses in these circumstances would become less clear in their evidence or might even die before the matter came to court and records could be lost.  A longer limitation period of, say, ten to 12 years since the time the injury was sustained would allow some latent injury cases to be processed but would not allow all.  There would, however, be difficulties with poor quality of evidence and it would reduce the incentive for the injured party to get on with their case in their own interest.  Judicial discretion to extend the period where justice required this was also considered by the Law Reform Commission. This would introduce uncertainty in the law and discretion would tend to be exercised somewhat differently from judge to judge.  This would lead to different outcomes which are impossible to reconcile.</P>
    <P>The approach taken in the Bill is the correct one.  The limitation period will run from the time the injured party could have reasonably discovered his or her injury rather than when he or she sustained it.  However, the concept of discoverability is not clear-cut.  Does the text embrace cases where the plaintiff was at all times aware of his injury but did not discover the legal implications for several years after the injury, or does it cover ignorance of the person's right resulting from bad legal advice?  Does the time run until the injured party discovers the legal identity of the defendant, say, in the case of a hit-and-run accident?</P>
    <P>On the introduction of the Bill it is evident that more claims will be admissible to the courts.  The cost of settling cases will be increased and this will be <Col N="1220" /> directly reflected in an increase in insurance premiums.  The increased costs will be borne by the policyholders in the first place and ultimately passed on to the consumer as price increases on goods and services.  This will go against the stated aim of the Government which is to reduce insurance costs which are high in comparison with other countries and represents a threat to the competitiveness of Irish firms.</P>
    <P>The Government should tackle high insurance premiums in conjunction with the Bill.  Motor insurance premiums in Ireland are four times greater than that of our nearest neighbour, the UK and public and employers' liability insurance is three times higher.  This is having a serious effect on the competitiveness of Irish industry and should be tackled. Costs to the Irish motorist are totally out of line with his British and EC counterpart and this needs urgent action.  The growth in litigation consciousness in Ireland has been criticised and rightly so. It seems to be a way of making a quick buck.  This should be controlled without removing the rights of the people.  The Bill before us will compound this problem. Have the Minister and his Government plans to counteract this negative aspect of the Bill?</P>
    <P>Section 2 states that the discoverability test must cover the person's knowledge that the injury was significant.  This covers cases where a trivial impairment of his mental or physical condition deteriorates over time.  It is logical that a minor impairment may go unnoticed but that should not militate against the injured party.  The Bill does not define the term &ldquo;significant&rdquo; which adds uncertainty to the concept of discoverability in the Bill. In George Birmingham's Bill of 1988 this was defined in section 4 (2) as follows:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this section that is reference to a person's date of knowledge] an injury is significant if the person whose date of knowledge is in question would reasonably have considered it sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages <Col N="1221" /> against a defendant who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy a judgment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to the Minister's reply.  As I said at the outset, Fine Gael have been promoting this concept for some years.  We welcome the Bill and look forward to its passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister and support the Bill.  This legislation is both prudent and necessary because under the statute of limitations the three year period applicable in personal injury claims for some time has been deemed to be inadequate.  As Senator Neville pointed out, the Law Reform Commission have looked at this under the latent defects arising out of personal injuries and have recommended that this amending legislation be introduced. Indeed, a former member of Mr. Neville's party, Mr. Birmingham, introduced a parallel Bill during the period of office of the last Coalition Government. In addition to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, the Supreme Court in a decision issued on 8 February 1990 referred to the inadequacy of this legislation.  However, in the particular case which was put before it, Hegarty <i>v.</i>  O'Loughran and Edwards, the constitutional point was not at issue but the Supreme Court adverted to the problem which existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with the unusual circumstances of some hidden or latent defect as a result of an injury coming to light some years down the road.  An example of this would be some lung diseases caused by radiation which are not clear and visible to the human eye and consequently may lie dormant in one's system for some time which could exceed the three year period set down under the statute of limitations.  At this juncture it is important to emphasise that section 2 of the Bill clearly sets out the restrictive circumstances under which this amending legislation would operate.  Under section <Col N="1222" /> 2 (a) it is necessary that the person alleged to have been injured had been injured. That must be clearly established to the court.  Secondly, the injury in question must be significant and not merely a light superficial injury which the court might decide would not warrant the inception and introduction of this amendment.  The injury must be attributable it whole or in part to the act or omission which was alleged to constitute a negligence.</P>
    <P>Another point which is clearly specified under section 2 (d) and which might answer one of the queries Senator Neville posed is that the identity of the defendant must be established.  In my view in a normal hit-and-run case &mdash; an unfortunate vacuum in our law &mdash; the postponement being suggested here would not arise.  In relation to that I am aware that under certain EC directives relating to hit-and-run accidents there are provisions whereby an injured party can have recourse to some compensation. However, the amount involved here would be minimal and I concur with Senator Neville that there seems to be a problem here.  Serious injuries can occur as a result of a hit-and-run accident and there are currently no provisions under Irish law whereby a person can have proper recourse to the law and receive proper compensation for the injuries suffered.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with a proper and prudent amendment which provides that in certain restrictive circumstances the injured person can have recourse to the courts.  This brings me to the question of knowledge of the injury.  If the injury arises out of neglect by an individual &mdash; it may be a pain in his back or head or some obvious defect &mdash; to bring it to the attention of a doctor or to seek legal advice, this provision does not apply.  It applies in three possible circumstances. An injured person with a latent injury, on his own behalf can avail of this amendment to bring an action outside the existing three year period.  There is, as Senator Neville pointed out, no limitation to this <Col N="1223" /> extension.  For example, in ten years time if somebody, as a result of a Sellafield disaster, discovers he or she has a serious lung complaint or an unusual disease arising from radiation, that person, providing he or she can come within the criteria set out under section 2, can bring an action. A person representing an injured person, or the surviving dependant of an injured person, can avail of this legislation, where the latent injury did not come to the notice of the plaintiff within the three year period specified.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  Section 7 states:</P>
    <P>...the &ldquo;date of knowledge&rdquo; principle to all causes of action involving personal injuries whether they accrue before the enactment of the Bill or after, and also proceedings pending at that time...</P>
    <P>In other words, to a certain extent it is retrospective and there is the possibility set out by Senator Neville, that it may give rise to actions against the State and have some economic repercussions for the State.  The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, and the Civil Liability Act, 1961, have been amended to take cognisance of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The measure is welcome and the fact that it is going through the House a short period after the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission issued in 1987 is to be welcomed.  From time to time the Law Reform Commission make recommendations and issue reports which are often left on shelves for decades without being acted upon.  This is not the case here and all sides of the House recognise the importance of the Bill.  It should also be noted that in 1975 in Britain the legal system and legislature decided that such amendment was necessary.  The provisions in this Bill follow those of the United Kingdom who have a common law system akin to ours.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and recommend that <Col N="1224" /> it be accepted and passed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the positive response from Members and I thank those who attended during the debate.  By so doing, they have shown their keen interest in this important, necessary and worthwhile amending legislation.</P>
      <P>This is a technical Bill.  Its provision, nevertheless, will have important legal implications for persons who are seriously injured.  I am satisfied that changes in the law in this area are necessary, both on their merits and because of the constitutional doubts which have been expressed by the courts about the present law.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville referred to the Statute of Limitations Bill, 1988, which was introduced in the Dáil by the then Deputy George Birmingham on 3 March 1988. For the information of Members, it was dealt with at column 1602 in the Dáil Official Report of that date.  Second Stage was ordered for Private Members' time on that day.  However, the Bill was not taken any further and it lapsed on the change of Government in June 1989 without being debated.  It was our intention at that time to support the Bill in principle, subject to certain amendments mainly of a technical or drafting nature. However, the opportunity did not present itself.  The Government, as I said, are of the view that reform of the law on the lines recommended by the Law Reform Commission is both necessary and desirable.  That is why the Bill is now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the reference by Senator Neville to the high cost of insurance.  Of course, we all acknowledge that the high cost of insurance is very serious for everybody but, while a passing reference is accepted, this is primarily a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. However, I can assure Senators that he and his Department are actively engaged <Col N="1225" /> in monitoring insurance costs and in examining ways of reducing those costs. The Bill, lest we take it out of context, seeks to remedy an injustice and a possible unconstitutional provision in our law.  If that results in an increase in the cost of insurance, that is the price society must pay for having a fairer system.  I should point out, however, that when changes similar to those in the Bill were brought about in another country's law, there was no significant leap in insurance costs and I do not see why there should be any major increase in insurance costs here either.</P>
    <P>I compliment Senators Neville and O'Donovan on their contributions.  Any amendments or suggestions with regard to the Bill will be dealt with on Committee Stage.  It is obvious from the contributions of Senators Neville and O'Donovan, as the two Senators who have contributed to the debate, that they welcome this amending legislation and I thank them again for their contributions.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1990,</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the draft order before the House is to amend the list of investments in which trustees may invest funds under their control.  The <Col N="1226" /> order is being made under the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958.  The principal purpose of this legislation is to protect the beneficiaries of trusts by offering a range of suitable and prudent investments.  Although a trust deed may specify wider powers of investment by the trustees, many trusts and similar funds are confined to investments authorised under the Act.  In addition, the funds held by the courts can only be invested in trustee authorised investments.</P>
      <P>Under section 2 of the 1958 Act, the Minister for Finance is empowered to amend the list of authorised investments by order.  A draft of the order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a motion of approval passed by each House before the order can be made. The list is kept under review and changes are proposed when appropriate.  The last amendment was made in 1986.</P>
      <P>The existing list is quite long and detailed and I can make copies available to the House if this is desired.  The 1958 Act set out an original series of investments and the list has been amended by order ten times since then.  The typical investments authorised are gilt-edged securities, deposits with banks and building societies and certain unit trusts. The type of investment is very much the safe and secure sort.  This is as it should be in the case of trust fund investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now ask the House to approve the addition of three new investments to the list.  The first of these investments is in interest-bearing deposit accounts with two deposit-taking institutions &mdash; the Irish Life Building Society and Equity Bank Limited.  These two institutions join the many banks and building societies already on the list.  The inclusion was recommended by the Central Bank based, among other things, on the size and backing of their reserves and their record of compliance with Central Bank requirements.  In the case of banks and building societies, to which common criteria now apply, an institution must have <Col N="1227" /> gross assets in excess of £35 million and minimum capital of £2.5 million, unless it is a subsidiary of another credit institution, in which case the parent institution must have gross assets of £100 million or more.</P>
    <P>There are a number of unit trusts already on the list.  The guidelines in this case require that the unit trust should invest only in Government securities or cash funds and that it should have been operating for three years with a satisfactory record of compliance with supervisory requirements.  This limitation on the type of investment is a basic prerequisite and applies to the two unit trusts already on the list.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to add to the list the Investment Bank of Ireland's Corporate Unit Trust.  They have given an undertaking that the unit trust will invest only in Government securities and cash deposits.</P>
    <P>There is on hand a number of applications from life assurance companies for inclusion of particular life assurance products on the list.  These applications are under examination at present and, if necessary, I will propose a further order to the House to add these investments to the list.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Trustee (Authorised Investment) Act, 1958, I am obliged to consult a number of &ldquo;referees&rdquo; in regard to any proposed Order.  These are the Governor of the Central Bank, the public trustee, the President of the Stock Exchange &mdash; Irish, the President of the Incorporated Law Society, the Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee and a Judge of the High Court nominated by the President of the High Court.  These referees have all been consulted and no objections have been raised to the terms of the draft order.</P>
    <P>The addition I am proposing will expand the investment options available to trust funds and will facilitate the operations of trustees, solicitors, accountants and the courts who are affected by this <Col N="1228" /> legislation.  Unfortunately, because of the cumbersome nature of the legislation, it takes some time to complete the process of adding new names to the list. Perhaps if we were drawing up trustee legislation now we might proceed by way of a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; order i.e. an order not requiring the prior approval of each House.  On the other hand, the House may feel, rightly, that the powers of trustees to invest funds on behalf of their principals is an important matter and that the House should be given the opportunity to see that the list of such investments is reasonable and prudent.</P>
    <P>The Houses, indeed, in all cases have agreed with proposed orders which have come before them.  Accordingly, I ask the House to give this draft order a speedy passage and I commend the motion for approval by the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this order and in so doing I congratulate the Equity Bank, the Irish Life Building Society and the Bank of Ireland in their further expansion and the success of the Bank of Ireland Corporate Unit Trust.  It is good to see more financial houses meeting the criteria.  As the Minister has said, it augurs well for the state of the financial sector that there is such a long list of finance houses, institutions and building societies who meet the rather stringent criteria laid down and reviewed under the 1958 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act has more or less levelled the playing field between the different types of finance houses and institutions in providing for all of them to operate under common criteria.  I should like to ask the Minister if this policy has proved beneficial both to the investors and to the smaller developing finance institutions. The Minister has very kindly offered to make available a list of all those institutions and I would like to take him up on that.  The long list of registered banks and finance institutions indicates that there are fewer banks on the list than there were in 1958, mainly because we <Col N="1229" /> are down to perhaps the big four commercial banks.</P>
    <P>I would disagree with one thing the Minister has said in his Second Reading speech and that is as regards section 2 (2).  I support the original legislation directing that the order should be made in a positive fashion, that the Houses should have the opportunity of confirming the order rather than what we are more used to, namely, a situation where if an order is not annulled within 21 days of it being laid before the House it falls.</P>
    <P>I think the House is certainly correct in being more prudent.  It is important in dealing with the funds of trustees that every possible piece of information should be made available and that people dealing in trust funds should have the latest information on all of the various financial institutions.  The fact that a financial institution will have assets in excess of £100 million does not count for very much in present times in trading, because you see multi-billion institutions coming a cropper with regard to market trends when you have these Black Mondays or whatever occurring.  I think that dealing especially with trust funds there has to be the utmost of prudence.  I would not like to see subsection 2 (2) being changed because, as the Minister pointed out, on each of the occasions, that a Minister for Finance has come to the Oireachtas seeking for approval for orders the orders have been approved.</P>
    <P>Looking at the list of all the institutions that meet this criteria I think it would indicate that the business of finance and the money market here is very much alive and vibrant and the people in charge of trust funds have a very wide range of options before them.  I hope that situation will continue for a long time.  On behalf of my group in the House I welcome the order as proposed by the Minister.  I wish the three additions to the list continued success and many years of profitable trading in their business.</P>

      <P>I basically welcome the <Col N="1230" /> order, specifically the extension of investments to the Equity Bank, Irish Life and the Bank of Ireland Corporate Trust Unit and again reiterate what the Minister has said that the principal purpose of this legislation is to protect the beneficiaries of trusts by offering a wide range of suitable and prudent investments.  I would, like my colleague on the opposite benches, wish these banks well and hope that in future prudent investments will prove very fruitful for those who have confidence in them.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Members for their very positive comments. I certainly take the point made by Senator McDonald in reference to the remarks I made at the opening stages of the debate.  On previous occasions here the Senator had similar views on other legislation.  We understand fully the Senator's views about this.  Really he is referring to the necessity in many of these cumbersome pieces of legislation to find ways in which the procedures might be speeded up a bit.</P>
      <P>I certainly welcome the positive contributions we have had here.  I would like to comment as well in relation to a point the Senator made about discrimination. There is not any discrimination between large and small institutions.  A reading of the list will show that there are both large and small deposit-taking institutions on the list.  Investors are well protected in relation to the deposit-taking institutions and there is a depositor protection scheme for savers introduced by the Central Bank Act and the Building Societies Act of 1989.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald also queried whether there were common criteria laid down.  The answer to that is yes.  For example, the exact same criteria apply to banks and building societies.  In the case of unit trusts obviously there will be differences to reflect the different nature of unit trusts.  The criteria applies equally and I want to assure the Senator on that.</P>
