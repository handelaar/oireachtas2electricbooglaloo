      <P>I have notice from Senator John A. Murphy that, on the <Col N="1874" /> motion for the Adjournment today, he proposes to raise the following matter.</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to extend higher education grants to the small minority of students, who, while not meeting formal academic requirements are admitted to third level institutions on the grounds of mature years.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to authorise a public inquiry into the suicide of an 18 year old man in St. Patrick's Juvenile Institution, Mountjoy, and for a further inquiry into the high incidence of deaths in prisons in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator PÛI ” Foighil of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment to make funds available to bodies of approved status for the annual maintenance of accommodation built under section 5 of the Housing Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Carmencita Hederman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Taoiseach to ensure that the Bronze Age gold collar at present in London be returned to Ireland.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Murphy, Costello, ” Foighil and Hederman as suitable for discussion in this House.  I have selected Senator Murphy's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business today.  Senators ” Foighil, Costello and Hederman may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is Item No. 3, the Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Bill, 1989 &mdash; all Stages; Item No. 4, Contractual <Col N="1875" /> Obligations (Applicable Law) Bill, 1990 &mdash; all Stages.  There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  We will also take Item No. 6 and will conclude business at 4 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is like old times to have you back.  It gives all our hearts a lift to see you in the Chair: we now know what we are missing.  On the Order of Business, I would like to raise a very serious matter with the Leader of the House on the question of the Companies Bill.  I do not want to be difficult about this but it is a very serious matter because, as I understand it, the Companies Bill will come back here after Christmas.  It will come back at Report Stage which means that the debate on the Bill will be very limited with one contribution on each section.  It is a fairly formalised debate.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the Companies Bill that left here about two years ago is very different to the Companies Bill which is coming back now.  There are about 258 substantive amendments to it.  It would be entirely unsatisfactory if we were confined to a Report Stage debate on the Bill at that stage.  I would like to suggest to the Leader of the House and to the other groups that we might be able to find some other way of examining this bill in detail. Perhaps it could be committed to a special committee of the House?  We do not have to take up the entire time of the House over a three month period to examine this Bill, but it is one of the most important Bills of this decade.  It began its life here under the former Cathaoirleach. This House had a very big input into the early stages but it is now virtually a new Bill.  I think there would be support from all groups on this side of the House &mdash; and, I am sure, from the other side also &mdash; if we could get together and find some way in which the Seanad could have a real input into what is effectively a new Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>To support the point raised by Senator Manning, we regard the matter of the Companies Bill coming <Col N="1876" /> back on Report Stage as not very satisfactory. I recognise the difficulty of getting the Bill through quickly and accept that there is need for the legislation.  I would like to point out that that Bill has had almost 300 amendments made to it since it left this House.  When the Bill left us we had put down 400 or 450 amendments. During the course of that we put in the whole new Part IX of the Bill which, in latter times, has seen the light of day as an independent Companies Bill in its own right.  We have had long discussions on this before.  We certainly should deal with this in a Committee format rather than as in Report Stage when it comes back to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the point made by Senator Manning in relation to the manner in which we can most satisfactorily deal with the Companies (Amendment) Bill when it comes back to us.  I endorse what Senator Manning and Senator O'Toole have said in relation to it.  I would encourage the Leader of the House to give very serious consideration to the points that have been made.</P>
      <P>I understand the Electoral (Amendment) Bill has just been published as a Seanad Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, published as a D·il Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>As a D·il Bill, yes.  I would like to get an indication from the Leader of the House today as to when he anticipates that Bill will come before the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had many debates on matters pertaining to the Middle East.  Today at 12.30 p.m. there will be a delegation of Kuwaitis, including the former Minister for Education, the former Minister for Justice, the chairman of the Kuwaiti Bank and the Dean of the Arts College in Kuwait.  The Dean of the Arts College at the University of Kuwait and the director of the Kuwaiti National Oil Corporation will be in the House at 12.30 p.m. in Room 741.  With the <Col N="1877" /> indulgence of the House, I ask the Leader of the House to inform any Member who wishes to question them about conditions in the Gulf to be in Room 741 at 12.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I would like to point out that the former Leader of the House berated a Member on these benches for publicising a meeting during the Order of Business.  I was ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one item and to ask if the Leader of the House would make time available for a comprehensive debate on the penal system? I have raised the matter on a number of occasions.  Rather than simply putting it down for Private Members' time it would be better to have a full scale debate because of the on-going situation in relation to imprisonment of young people, to suicides and to conditions generally in the prisons.  It would be worthwhile if the House could make time available for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say to the Acting Chairman, it is great to see you back where you look most at home in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>He says that to all Cathaoirligh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an opinion about where at least one Cathaoirleach should be which I have expressed and which is on the record of the House.  I, of course, agree with my colleagues when it comes to the idea of debating 200 amendments together.  It will, at the very least, lead to the most long-winded, complex and complicated single speeches this House has ever heard because the procedure is to deal with all 200 amendments at once which means we will have 200 speeches dealing with 200 different amendments. It is not easy, even if each amendment could be taken separately.  The procedure of this House is that when a Bill is reported back after being amended in the D·il all the amendments are debated <Col N="1878" /> together.  That is an entirely unsatisfactory procedure when there are 200 separate amendments to a Bill of that length and complexity.  Logic and nothing else dictates that it should be dealt with in a separate fashion.  It is up to us to find a fashion that is consistent with the procedures of this House.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with Senator Costello when he said that the public, the prisons and prisoners deserve the attention of at least one House of the Oireachtas by way of a debate on the penal system.  If the Leader of the House wants to call it a debate on law and order in order to give a better juicy taste to it, then let us have a debate on law and order and the crime situation.  I will quite happily use that to discuss the appalling condition of our prisons.  If he does not want to give the impression that they are being excessively liberal on the issue let us have the debate on whatever terms he wants but let us at least discuss prisons, prisoners and their conditions.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to move an amendment to the Order of Business, which is that Motion 80 on the motion, &ldquo;That Seanad …ireann expresses concern at the Government's total lack of action in meeting the requirements of last October's judgment in the European Court of Human Rights concerning discrimination against homosexual citizens of Ireland&rdquo; be taken first today.  We, on these benches, are no longer prepared to stand quietly in a country which is in flagrant violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.  We would be sanctimonious, and have been sanctimonious about the activities of the British Government in derogating from that Convention.  It is downright hypocrisy to keep on postponing it and waiting for somebody else to deal with the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very nice to see Senator Honan in her present position. Another ladies' day, I assume.  May I ask the Leader of the House to indicate if he will raise a matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?  Yesterday we had Mr. Dubcek welcomed very graciously by the Leas-Chathaoirleach. Given that that person is a statesman of such stature and that he is one of the people who was instrumental, more than 20 years ago, in bringing the developments taking place in Eastern Europe to the attention of the world, it would have been appropriate for this House to have heard him speak.  Procedures are so inflexible that it is unfortunate that that could not take place.  It is also unfortunate that each group could not formally welcome him to the House.  I appeal to the Leader of the House, within the context of overall Oireachtas reform, to look at the way in which we welcome guests and the way guests are afforded the courtesy of the House.  We should be able to hear people of Mr. Dubcek's stature speak.  It was a historic moment and it was regrettable that he could not address us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise with the Leader of the House the question of The Altamont (Amendment of Deed of Trust) Bill, 1990 which is No. 2 on the Order Paper.  The reason I raise it is because when it was debated recently in this House some Members had reservations largely because of the inadequacy of information.  My understanding is that an information memorandum was being sought in relation to this Bill.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House what progress has been made in that regard?  In making these comments concerning the Altamont Bill, I would like to join with Senator Dardis in his very apt comments concerning the functions of this House. They seem to be quite archaic.  It seems quite incredible in this age that somebody of the stature of Mr. Dubcek cannot address this House from where you are sitting, or close to where you are sitting, for example, on such occasions.  I support <Col N="1880" /> Senator Dardis' call for reform in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to second Senator Brendan Ryan's motion with regard to moving Motion 80 on the Order Paper.  The reason I do so is because the reply given by the Leader of the House yesterday was totally unsatisfactory and unconvincing when he said that this was being considered by Government.  Dr. Noel Browne raised this issue 16 years ago in D·il …ireann.  The reply given then was that the civil servants of the Department of Justice were considering it.  Sixteen years is too long.  A judgment has been given to me against this country. The Government have done nothing about it.  They are in continuing contempt of the European Court of Human Rights. We hypocritically celebrate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want speeches.  The Senator should ask a question of the Leader, and sit down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering that I put you in there today, a Chathaoirligh, I think that is most ungrateful of you.  However, I bow to your ruling as I always did in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am here without your help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just asking that we should be given the opportunity that you, Acting Chairman, also looked for, for a proper debate on this.  It is not very much to ask.  The second thing I would like to say is that I find it extremely disturbing that almost every day we meet late.  I am putting that on the record.  I have tactfully done it by saying that, perhaps, the clocks are wrong.  Virtually every day we meet five minutes late.  I am not used to that kind of unpunctuality.  I am sure there may be a good reason for the extraordinary situation this morning, but we are entitled to know what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to support Senator Manning with regard to the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  I note that Senator Lanigan got away with his lengthy advertisement <Col N="1881" /> for the Kuwaiti representation.  This indicates that there are a series of items on the Order Paper that ought to be taken, because they refer to a foreign affairs committee.  A foreign affairs committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas would be the proper place to entertain these people and listen to their discussions and not some hole&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the corner in Government rooms, which is insulting to them and reflects the antiquity of the procedures here.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask if, in the light of the controversies surrounding lottery funding, and the publication of the report, the Government will be placing on the Order Paper a motion noting the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies?  If not, I have no doubt that my colleague, Senator Shane Ross, will be placing such a motion on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House to formalise the request made by the Minister for Education last night when she addressed the Private Members' education debate. She expressed a desire to be present for an education debate once a term.  She said that even though she would be present it had to be formalised by the Leader of the House.  Education is going to be very important with the forthcoming publication of Green and White Papers.  I hope that the Leader will formalise her request so that we could have education debated regularly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to repeat Senator Carmencita Hederman's request yesterday in connection with the urgency of the review of local government.  As a member of a local authority for the last 30 years, it is a matter of grave urgency that this review be brought before both Houses as soon as possible.  In its present state, unless the review is forthcoming and the Minister genuinely looks into the <Col N="1882" /> matter of the viability of local authorities, we will become a bankrupt system.  Jobs and services are being put at risk.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to recognise that to the ordinary people in rural Ireland this is a matter of vital importance. I hope the Minister concerned will give it the necessary urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say how much I welcome seeing you in the Chair, but, perhaps more importantly, that we have somebody in the Chair whom we can hear quite clearly.</P>
      <P>I would like to repeat the call I made yesterday to the Leader of the House in connection with our getting some information about when the local government reform Bill will come before this House. This is not open-ended in that the local elections are due to be held in June.  We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where &mdash; I understand the Progressive Democrats are insisting that they be held in June 1991 &mdash; if these reforms are not introduced we will be in the position of calling for elections to be held for impotent councils.  That is what it amounts to. Forty-three Members of the Seanad are elected largely through the input of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>My question to the Leader is: does he realise and appreciate that 43 Members of this House are elected largely with an input from local authority members?  I am not one of them, let it be said.  I am elected by the University franchise.  What I am asking is: do those 43 Members feel they have any obligation to the members of local authorities to get them some meaningful <Col N="1883" /> powers, and that these reforms must take place sooner rather than later?  Can we have some time scale from the Leader as to when this will be before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning asked about the Companies (No. 2) Bill, as did other speakers including Senator O'Toole, Senator Brendan Ryan and others.  I agree with the points made that with a massive number of amendments we are certainly seeing a different Bill coming to us than was originally presented to us.  The point made by all speakers was that it would be almost unreal to have long speeches on every amendment.  Quite honestly, I do not know what can be done, but I promise that I will make inquiries.  Obviously we will have some time because I know it will not be with us before Christmas, as Senator Manning has indicated.  I would be anxious to see whether some formula could be worked out to facilitate the thoughts of Members.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to the Companies Bill.  Senator Howard mentioned the Companies Bill and asked about the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, which is a Bill for the other House.  My information about that &mdash; and a number of Members, I know are interested in it &mdash; is that it will be taken in the other House before Christmas and obviously we will have it some time in the New Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure you have all noted Senator Lanigan's request.  Senator Costello asked for a debate on the penal system.  I repeat that there is an opportunity in Private Members' time to do so.  We have a busy schedule of legislation, an important aspect of our work, to get through before Christmas.  I cannot see any chance of a debate on law and order or on the penal system, before Christmas, but there is always Private Members' time if Members want to do that.  That is the way forward.  In fact, we have seen an example of that recently with the Fine Gael motion on education.  Senator Brendan Ryan also referred to the Companies <Col N="1884" /> Bill and the question of the law and order debate, which I have mentioned, and he proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  He requests that Item No. 80 be placed first on the Order Paper. Senator Norris who seconded this felt I was unconvincing.  Maybe I was but I was being factual.  The situation is that having received the report from the Law Reform Commission, approximately six weeks ago, the Department of Justice are actively considering this report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What were they doing before that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The judgment was handed down approximately two years ago.  The Law Reform Commission the year after or thereabouts produced a temporary report.  They were asked for a full, detailed report, which has been with the Department of Justice for five or six weeks approximately, and that is being considered.  That is the position as I know it.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris also asked for a foreign affairs committee, that is not appropriate I think, to the Order of Business.  I have noted what he said about national lottery funding and the possibility of he or Senator Ross putting down a motion on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman referred to a comment from the Minister for Education. The Minister for Education &mdash; as all Members know &mdash; agreed to a debate on education, it probably would have been taken today or next week but in the meantime the Fine Gael Party put in a very lengthy motion on education in Private Members' time which is their absolute right.  We can endeavour to facilitate commitments that were given by the Minister regarding a debate from time to time because it seems to me that we are in for quite an exciting time in education over the next one or two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator John Ryan and Senator Hederman asked for legislation dealing with <Col N="1885" /> a review of local government.  I agree with them.  We have been pressing for many years for a review of local government and reports are still being prepared, but they are not finalised.  I have no doubt that when they are finalised, depending on what is in them, they will then be brought to the Government who will then prepare legislation.  I cannot say, at this time, when that legislation will be available. I think all the Members would share <Col N="1886" /> my concern and hope that that legislation will be in place as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Title>Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Bill, 1989: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice the House is emptying when we discuss the question of teachers' pensions.</P>
      <P>When I was speaking last week on the Teachers' Superannuation Bill, we had gone through the need to respond to the particular pressures that teachers nowadays are undergoing, the stress and strain of teaching, the level of burn-out experienced by teachers and the great need to have an early retirement option for them.</P>
      <P>The first measure that I can find on this subject is the 1879 Act, an Act for improving the position of teachers in national schools in Ireland.  In 1879 women teachers were allowed to retire at 50 years of age.  It seems extraordinary that, with that kind of enlightened legislation available over 100 years ago, all we have done in the meantime is to go backwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teaching is very much a young person's occupation in terms of the drain, with the strain, the energy and commitment required.  We have now worsened the situation and teachers have to work longer before they are entitled to early <Col N="1887" /> retirement.  I think the Bill is flawed.  I have looked through the changes.  Last week I gave my thoughts on the need for confirmation of any changes in the scheme, but I now want to make one specific reference to the Bill.  In my responsibility as a legislator, I want to establish that there is a problem.  Section 10 of the 1879 Act reads:</P>
    <P>At any time after the passing of this Act, the Treasury, with the consent of the Lord Lieutenant, may from time to time make rules for the administration of this Act.  Copies of all such rules shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within fourteen days from the date thereof, if Parliament is then sitting, and if not, then within fourteen days of the next re-assembling of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Lord Lieutenant is changed to the appropriate officer since the establishment of the State.  The next reference to that particular point of laying changes in the pension scheme before the Houses comes in the 1928 Act. The 1928 Act simply says:</P>
    <P>No superannuation scheme shall come into force unless it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been confirmed by Resolution from each House.</P>
    <P>I want to stress this point.  There is no conflict in those two pieces of legislation. The 1879 legislation requires that it be laid within 14 days before the House; the 1928 legislation requires that it be confirmed by Resolution of each House. We now come to 1990 and the position today is that we are asking that this legislation allow changes to go through simply by, and I read:</P>
    <P>Every superannuation scheme made under this Act... shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the scheme is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the scheme is <Col N="1888" /> laid before it, the scheme shall be annulled...</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that in order to make that legislation work the section of the 1879 Act has to be deleted, and that is within the range of the Bill.  I think we are bringing a conflict into it.  We have a conflict between 14 days and 21 days. There is no doubt, that you cannot have both.  That legislation has never been revoked, replaced or changed.  We have now reached a stage where teachers are worse of than they were in 1879.  It is extraordinary that here we are, more than a century later, and despite unprecedented levels of stress and pressure in education, the voluntary retirement age for teachers has, in fact, increased.  I would now call on the Minister to introduce regulations which will reduce the voluntary retirement age for teachers to 50.</P>
    <P>Many of our best teachers who have given 30 or 35 of the best years of their lives in the classroom are tired, worn out and burned out.  Some of them feel they can no longer contribute as effectively as they could when younger.  I believe that we owe those people and we should give them the option to exit from their profession with dignity and with financial security if that is their choice.  Let us give them a comprehensive range of options for voluntary early retirement.  Teaching is different from other occupations and professions.  The Acting Chairman, in a personal capacity, raised and discused this matter with me at other times &mdash; I am not referring to private conversations but her views are well known.</P>
    <P>Forty healthy mischievous four-year olds demand 100 per cent of a teacher's energy and skill 100 per cent of the time. The same applies to second level and third level teachers.  There is a constant drain and demand on the teacher all the time.  If the community would look askance at a couple who decided at age 50 or more to take on the responsibility of rearing a young family, why do we take it for granted that teachers in their mid-to-late fifties can each day take on the <Col N="1889" /> daunting and exhausting task of controlling, teaching and disciplining some of the largest classes in Europe?  I think it is disgraceful that we should allow this to continue.</P>
    <P>Teachers are energetic, they are enthusiastic and they are an innovative group of professionals.  They are held in high esteem by all sectors of society, and well they should be.  They give their all to what is an under resourced, and under-funded educational system.  The system is successful but only at the cost of teachers' health and welfare.  The price is too high. Every week I meet experienced teachers who have given more than 30 years' service and they ask me the same question: when will they have a voluntary retirement option, when will the voluntary age for retirement be reduced?</P>
    <P>An early retirement scheme would also carry with it many other pluses for the system and many other benefits for the education service.  It would create employment for our young unemployed teachers and it would also allow the introduction of new blood to the teaching service. It would also allow people coming fresh with new ideas into the service. It would energise many aspects of the profession.  New people bring new ideas, not necessarily better ideas, but new ideas.  It is this interaction between experience and freshness which has made teaching what it is, great.  It has allowed this kind of progress to take place and such development would be in everybody's interest and to the great benefit of our pupils and students.</P>
    <P>I believe that the teachers pension regulations, schemes etc., require that any changes in the regulations or in the scheme be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas through the presentation of an order or statutory instrument by the Minister.  I want to say quite clearly that this legislation is before us today not because there was any great need for it, or because there was a crying need to change the system.  Until now, the Minister had to come in and say: &ldquo;I propose to make these changes in the teachers' pension scheme&rdquo;.  When the Minister gets this Bill through all she will have to do is <Col N="1890" /> simply write a note to us and tell us what she has done.  The Minister of State will know that what we are doing here is covering up for inefficiency and ineffectiveness. I cannot find an order or statutory instrument that has covered the changes that have taken place in the teachers' pension scheme over the last number of years.  It does not exist, and this is a retrospective effort to cover up for inefficiency and illegality.  The reality is the Minister brought in a proposal of voluntary redundancies for teachers in 1988 and I put it to the Minister and to the Department that I can find no evidence of a statutory instrument being presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas at that time.  All the indications are that the introduction of that redundancy scheme in 1988 may well have been <i>ultra vires</i> the regulations and the legislation of the State.  I want a precise answer to that.  I want to know where the Minister got the authority under legislation to make changes which took hundreds of teachers out of the system in 1988, which worsened class sizes, which worsened pupil/teacher ratio and which was of no benefit to the system.  Where did the authority come from?  Who is going to be accountable when we find out that somebody acted illegally at that time?</P>
    <P>We are now about to do the same thing because I understand that the proposal which I had made to allow the Bill to operate by making a change in the 1879 legislation has, in effect, been ruled out of order.  If it is ruled out of order it is a poor reflection on the House that we are going to legislate today for conflict in the legislation, for an incompatibility between the requirements of two specific Acts.  That 1879 legislation is still the basis of all the schemes that have been set up in the meantime.  The Act of 1879, the Teachers' Increase in Pension Scheme of 1920, the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, and the scheme that was brought into operation in 1934 &mdash; and I have some comments to make on that &mdash; was by statutory instrument and by regulation, not by an Act.  We are governed by those schemes right along <Col N="1891" /> the line but from 1934 onwards, the scheme makes constant reference to the 1879 Act.  For instance, there are references there to &ldquo;classes of teachers&rdquo;.  I do not know what that means.  I have read through the legislation and it says &ldquo;classes as decided by the Commissioners of Education&rdquo;.  I do not know what a class of teachers is at this stage.  In the old legislation there are references to class 1 and class 2, etc.  I do not know what they are.  First class &mdash; first division; first class &mdash; second division.  It is like football, second class and third class; I do not know what these mean.  These are the references in 1879 and they have never been tidied up.  What we need is a consolidated Bill on teachers' pensions allowing a lot of changes to take place.</P>
    <P>Also under the 1879 legislation is the first place that we find the requirement which is followed through in all subsequent legislation which says: &ldquo;If the Commissioners of Education&rdquo;&mdash; nowadays the Minister &mdash;&ldquo;certify to the Lord Lieutenant&rdquo;&mdash; the Minister for Finance at this stage &mdash; that they are satisfied that a male teacher under the age of fifty-five or a female teacher under the age of fifty, who, in the case that he or she continued in the service until the age of compulsory retirement&rdquo; would be entitled to a pension. In other words, any teacher entitled to a pension &ldquo;has become incapable from permanent infirmity of mind or body to discharge the duties of his or her situation, the Lord Lieutenant, with the consent of the Treasury&rdquo; may grant a pension and gratuity to that teacher.  That is where the words &ldquo;of permanent infirmity of mind and body&rdquo; come in.  What that has left is the mess we are in at this time, because that is continued right through in section 11 (ii) of the 1934 scheme, where it says again:</P>
    <P>...the Minister and Minister for Finance are satisfied that such teacher has, while in the service, become incapable from infirmity of mind or body of discharging the duties of teacher efficiently and that such infirmity is likely to be permanent...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1892" /> That has created another mess at the cost of families, socially, emotionally and other ways.  That does not deal with modern medicine.  I think of outlying cases of people who were retired from the profession because, for instance, they had no mobility and were granted pensions and have now found, gratefully, full mobility through replacement hip operations. That is a very clear understanding that people might have, but it means that doctors can no longer say that the infirmity is likely to be permanent.  What doctor nowadays, with the advances of modern medicine, will write down about anybody that it is highly unlikely that that person will ever be cured?</P>
    <P>We have a situation in the last two years &mdash; I referred to this last week &mdash; of a teacher who resigned on disability because she was suffering from terminal cancer.  That is what was written on the form.  That teacher, who was not expected to live for six months, has, thankfully, made a marvellous and full recovery and is now back in the system. She has now lost the pension and I am sure that she is happy enough to be back to full health, but the point I am making is that that doctor wrote in good faith two years ago that the teacher was unlikely ever to be cured.  That is perfectly understandable. Here was an opportunity to clear up that mess.</P>
    <P>There is a further one.  The disease of ME is quite real.  It exists.  Everybody knows it is there and everybody knows somebody who is suffering from it.  The reality about ME is that it can stop at any time.  I know teachers in the system under stress who can no longer teach.  You know how ME affects the energy levels, and such teachers are now clearly disabled. They cannot do a day's work and there is no doubt about that.  The Department accepts this, as do the Department's inspectors.  Their doctors know it, but the one thing that the doctor cannot write on the form is that this disability is likely to be permanent because the nature of the disease of ME is that people eventually come out of it.  It might be two, five or ten years, but simply because the doctor cannot say that it is permanent as is <Col N="1893" /> required under the scheme, the teacher loses out.  I know two teachers at this moment who cannot work, who can barely move around, and yet the Minister's Department have callously said they are not entitled to a pension, even though they are clearly disabled and even though the Minister's Department know that.  It is extraordinarily insensitive and uncompassionate that we could not address this at that time.</P>
    <P>I also feel that the way we have approached this tiny aspect of pensions to date is utterly unacceptable.  I represent teachers every day of the week.  I understand what teaching is about.  I spent 20 years in a classroom myself.  I know exactly the strains and pressures that are there.  I also know that there are people who come to a stage where they know that they can no longer give to that job what they wanted to give and what they have always given before.  They do not have the energy to cope with the job of teaching after 30 or 35 years and I believe we should allow them an exit with dignity and with financial security.  There is a responsibility on the Minister and on management to do that, and indeed there is a responsibility on teachers' unions to push this particular point.</P>
    <P>Looking through the legislation that exists, I believe that the lack of Statutory Instruments over the last number of years is creating a huge problem.  I would ask that a number of changes be made to the scheme.  I have bent over backwards to try to amend this Bill in a way that would be acceptable to the Government.  None of my amendments is acceptable to the Government.  I have proposed that we reduce the voluntary retirement age to 50.  I have proposed that we make changes in the arrangements which would allow for a disability pension to be given under different circumstances reflecting the changes in modern medicine and reflecting likely changes and technology advances in medicine also.  I have also proposed that there should be an opportunity for people who cannot do the job, apart from those who want to voluntarily resign, to opt out if they want to do so.</P>
    <P>I have made these proposals with a <Col N="1894" /> number of objects in mind.  I have made them as a response to the needs of those particular teachers at that time.  I have also made them in response to the needs of the education service.  We need people who can deliver that service and deliver it effectively and efficiently.  I have also done it bearing in mind the need to have professionals in education coming through at different ages all the time.  We need an annual infusion of new energy and new blood to the educational service. That is our responsibility and there is a consensus view out there that education is a priority.</P>
    <P>In the last two months alone, Margaret Thatcher's last act as Prime Minister in a reshuffle was to promote her Secretary of State for Education to the Treasury Department.  He was replaced by the Secretary for Health, which gives an indication of the importance they attach to it.  John Major's first speech yesterday identified education as a priority issue for him and identified the need to pay teachers a substantial salary in order to attract the best people into the job.  We have seen the UK Labour Party establish education as a priority issue.  The OECD this year has established education and the need for in-service education and training as a priority.  We need to respond to change and we need to have fresh people and new people coming in to cope with change.</P>
    <P>The last time I spoke on education in this House I gave an example.  I was discussing the need for in-service education and retraining with a member of one of Europe's largest corporations. He pointed out to me that he was working in the computer industry, he was 40 years there, and that any of his staff who were 40 years there with him have had to be retrained to five different generations of computers.  As I pointed out to him, in the same period of time the teachers in their classrooms would have been lucky to have had one opportunity for in-service education during that period of time. We have neglected the needs of society on that issue.</P>
    <P>In the 1934 scheme, section 8, it is made quite clear that: &ldquo;There shall be <Col N="1895" /> established for the purpose of this scheme a fund, and such fund shall be maintained and managed by the Minister&rdquo;.  Where is the pension fund?  How much is in it? What goes in every year?  What is going in next year?  Can we see the fund?  Has anyone ever given us figures for it?  Is it ever audited?  I also believe that we are in breach of that legislation.  There is no pension fund in the Department of Education.  Pensions are paid out of current account.  I do not know if there is a fund set up there that we can consider on that basis.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the legislation that is before us today I wanted to propose amendments but they have been ruled out of order.  I will certainly come back to them at the end of Second Stage with a view to allowing me to explain the point at issue.  We are legislating a conflict and it is impossible to work through what is there at the moment.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we have an Act of 1879, an Act of 1920, an Act of 1924.  We have schemes based on that legislation from 1934 until now.  There has been no statutory instrument brought forward in the past number of years.  All the changes made in recent times have been made without authority, in flagrant breach of statutory requirements, and I certainly want to hear how in effect the Minister complied with her own legislation when she introduced the redundancy scheme in 1988.  I will leave my contribution to the debate until the Committee Stage when we can discuss various sections of the Bill.  I ask the Minister to respond in detail to some of the points raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to apologise for the absence of the Minister as she is representing the Government at the funerals of the Army men who were tragically killed in an accident recently in her home town of Athlone.  She very much regrets not being here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for a very forceful contribution, as usual, and I take many of the points he has made.  At the <Col N="1896" /> outset, they are irrelevant to the current legislation being discussed in that this is only enabling legislation.  Perhaps I should deal very briefly with some of the aspects mentioned.  Let me totally reject the charge of callousness by our Department in dealing with teachers who wish to retire on grounds of ill health.  There are regulations in place and those regulations are implemented by my Department in a sensitive and flexible manner. Senator O'Toole mentioned a situation and if he would like to bring it to my attention I will certainly have that case examined.  Senator O'Toole, like everybody else, will accept that the case for retirement on the basis of ill health is always one where each case must be taken on its merits and decisions have to be taken by the relevant authorities based on the facts of those cases.</P>
    <P>The other major point Senator O'Toole mentioned is the question of the Minister being in breach of legislation in regard to the voluntary retirement scheme that was brought in last year. May I explain that the early retirement scheme was for both national and post-primary teachers and was part of a general public service early retirement scheme.  The terms of the scheme were approved by the Government in advance of the necessary amending schemes which are at present being prepared in my Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as weak an answer as I ever heard.  The legislation requires it to be done beforehand.  It confirms what I have said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely standard practice across the Civil Service that the schemes would be brought in place once they are approved by Government and that amending legislation would be put in place as quickly as possible.  I have to take major issue with Senator O'Toole because my experience is that the teachers involved wanted to get on with <Col N="1897" /> their voluntary retirement as quickly as possible.  Is Senator O'Toole telling me that it is the view of those teachers who retired that they would have much preferred to wait for quite a considerable period until the amending legislation was brought into place?  I have certainly not met any teacher who wants this.  In fact, all the pressure from teachers on me, as Minister for State in the Department of Education, and on the Minister, was that we would get on with this programme of early retirement as quickly as possible. As Senator O'Toole will be aware, many hundreds of extra teachers wished to be part of the scheme and, unfortunately, we were not able to accede to this because of the lack of money which was available. There is no problem with the way in which this is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no conflict between the 1879 Act and the 1928 Act. The method of making schemes is standard in the public service generally. There is no diminution of the control of the House in superannuation matters since it is open to the House at any stage within 21 sitting days to amend or annul a scheme which has been laid before it. The proposed arrangements will streamline the procedures for making schemes. As I say, there is absolutely no basis for the claims the Senator is making.</P>

      <P>Before we agree Second Stage, I just want a ruling from the Minister. I have a worry that what we are doing is incorrect.  Is it possible that we <Col N="1899" /> would direct the Committee to look at it?  Despite what the Minister says, I do not disagree with this legislation but it has left loose ends.  Can we direct the Committee to examine the width and breadth of this legislation on Committee Stage?  There are references there which, if we let them go through, create flawed legislation.  I would like a directive from the Chair as to what we can do in that situation.</P>

      <P>May I make my point that I believe we are likely to get ourselves into a position where we will be in breach of the legislation there at the moment if we do not make one additional change.  It is not a change that affects the working of the Bill.  It is not in opposition to what the Minister proposes in the Bill. It just means that there is a conflict between 14 and 21 days in the legislation. We just need to delete a section.  Can we direct the House to deal with that at this point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 1, I have tried to make reference in my Second Stage speech to a number of items.  To my mind this line in this Act, the Principal Act &mdash; The Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928 &mdash; is not sufficient.  I think we also must make reference to the earlier Acts, the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1920, and the Teachers' Superannuation Scheme Act of 1879.  I am convinced of that and it leads me straight to the point of how can we ignore the Act of 1879?  That Act requires us to do certain things.  What <Col N="1902" /> this Act is doing is changing that without making any change in the original Act. This Bill only seeks to change the 1928 Act, even though the 1879 Act is now going to be in conflict with it.</P>
      <P>I have an amendment in there on the number of days, which is as precisely relevant as I can imagine to anything in the Act.  I recognise that I cannot raise that with the Chair but I will certainly raise it on the section.  I do not know how we can ignore the Act of 1879 and the Act of 1920, particularly the 1879 one, which specifies many aspects of what we have just been discussing and in fact is referred to as the Principal Act here.  In other words, the 1928 Act refers back on a number of occasions to the 1879 Act and it makes it clear in the 1924 legislation that it applies to teachers who were covered by the 1879 Act and it allows the definitions from the 1879 Act to remain in effect.  It also allows the conditions for the changes which are referred to in this Bill before us today to remain in effect.</P>
      <P>As the Minister quite rightly said in his speech, and where I would agree with him, is that there is no conflict between the 1924 Act and the 1879 Act.  I never said there was.  The conflict arises now with the 1990 Act and the 1879 Act. Anybody who can read can see that there is a conflict there.  I cannot understand the obduracy of the Government in not recognising that they are creating a problem in legislation.  I do not understand how we can ignore that particular fact.</P>

      <P>All the sections which are being amended do not refer to the 1879 Act.  While we are satisfied that there is a legal basis for what is being proposed, I take sincere objections that Senator O'Toole has, while I do not agree with them.  What I am prepared to say is that the legal basis on which the amendments are being made will be further examined in the context of the education Act which will deal in a much more fundamental way with this whole area.  I want to assure the Senator that the sections which are now being amended do not refer to the 1879 Act at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but that is not a response to my argument, although I take the Minister's point on it.  I do not have a difficulty with what he says in the sense that section 2 does not make reference in 1879.  That is why I am on my feet.  I am saying it should make reference to it and I am referring to something that is going to come after it, but I have to use it to illustrate the point I am making.</P>
      <P>This Bill before us that we are now about to pass refers to the number of days that it takes and it says that we are going to make a change to say that a certain number of days are required.  That is not in the 1928 Act.  It simply says that it must be confirmed by the House.  The reason that there is no conflict between the 1928 Act and the 1879 Act is that it says in the 1879 Act that &ldquo;Copies of all such rules should be laid before both Houses of Parliament within fourteen days from the date thereof ...&rdquo; or 14 days from the next reassembly.  There was no conflict between those two pieces of legislation, so consequently in 1928 they did not require a change to that legislation.  But in simply making a change to the 1928 legislation now somebody has forgotten to advert to the fact that it does have a reference back to the 1879 Act.  It is there in front of our eyes.  We are now going to a situation where we are passing legislation today which says that the scheme is passed by the House within 21 days etc. whereas in this particular one here we are saying that it has to be lodged within 14 days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The 21 days, as I understand it, is under Standing Orders of the D·il.  That is where, perhaps, the Senator misunderstands the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I know that I am right in what I am saying because none of my questions has been answered. It has no relevance whatever to the Standing Orders of the D·il.  What we are talking about here is the number of days required under legislation, not under Standing Orders.  We are requiring that it be laid before the House within the next 21 days while we are saying in another Act within 14 days.  That is a <Col N="1904" /> conflict.  A child can see that.  It does not take any legal brain to work that out. What has happened and the Minister and I know it, is that somebody did not notice it.  It has slipped through and I have now adverted to the fact.</P>
      <P>The thing that should be done is that we should now interrupt Committee Stage if you cannot take an amendment and let it be referred back to the legal people for amendment that will bring the legislation into order, because it is not in order at the moment.  That is the reality of the situation.  You cannot have both 14 days and 21 days in effect and they are both in effect.  What we are doing is irresponsible. The easiest way I can think of is to simply delete the sentence from the 1879 Act.  I am not trying to change the Bill; I am accepting it but I am making sure that it works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator O'Toole has said in the last few minutes is logical. Fudging the issue and suggesting as the Minister did, that it will work out at the end of the day under an education Act does not help.  The introduction of a new education Bill was proposed a couple of days ago.  It worries me what the outcome would be if this flawed legislation, as Senator O'Toole has rightly stated went through.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with antique legislation. The language Senator O'Toole used is antique.  We are reverting back to 1879 and 1920.  I ask that in legislation there be statutory obligation on Government to review legislation at least every 20 or 25 years.  If there is nothing to be done that is fine but we should not dismiss what Seantor O'Toole has said.  He knows what he is talking about.  The 14 and 21 days are contradictory and cause confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of bringing legislation to the Seanad is to iron these matters out. If there is a flaw surely the Minister is big enough to say, &ldquo;we will look at it again&rdquo;, otherwise we might as well not have Committee Stage where such technicalities can be ironed out.  This is not just a technicality, it is a major contradiction between two Acts.  The Minister should be big enough to call a halt <Col N="1905" /> to this and to look at what Senator O'Toole has suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case we have legislation which says that it must be brought as soon as may be, we have legislation which says that it must be brought within 14 days and we have legislation which says that it goes on until 21 days afterwards.  How can &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; equate with 14 days?  They are two different requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case we have to state so.  That is my point and I thank the Minister for accepting the argument. If he put that line into the Bill we would not be arguing.  The reason we are changing the legislation is to make one Act supersede another.  Of course, it should supersede.  The Minister is logical in what he is saying and that is the reason I am on my feet.  One piece of legislation superseding another must amend the other, and must make reference to that Act which has been superseded or deleted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said already that there is no conflict between the 1879 Act and the 1928 Act.  Therefore, there is no basis <Col N="1906" /> for the argument that the Senator is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the arguments I must agree that Senator O'Toole is putting forward a valid and sound argument.  The Bill is an Act to amend the Teachers Superannuation Act, 1928.  The last section says that The Principal Act in this Act may be cited together as the Teachers Superannuation Acts, 1928 and 1989.</P>
      <P>We have not gone back to the 1879 legislation and there are contrary provisions in it.  If there are contrary provisions in that legislation we have to address them in this Bill, otherwise we are seeking to bring into existence legislation that should have been introduced long ago to try to consolidate the teachers' superannuation schemes and bring them into line with what exists in the vocational, the local authority and public sectors.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that the Bill covers the situation that arises from the 1879 legislation.  There is no reference in this Bill to that.  If there is not some reference, and some amendment to separate provisions, then I cannot see how this legislation is valid.  Either we accept amendment now or go back to the parliamentary draftsman to see how the 1879 legislation conflicts with what is in this Bill and iron them out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges (T. 287) dated the 14th November, 1990 be adopted.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to adopt the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the televising of proceedings and on the restoration of a procedure to allow for the Seanad to be addressed by distinguished persons.  This report, which has been circulated to Senators, is not a complicated report and is, to a large extent, self-explanatory.  The authorisation of televising of proceedings was set in train last July by a Resolution of the House.  The committee were entrusted to draw up matters of detail, such as the rules of coverage and the programme format.  These are set out in detail in the report, and there is little need for me to expand upon them here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules of coverage are almost identical to those adopted by our parliamentary colleagues in the D·il, but come down ever so slightly on a less restrictive <Col N="1910" /> approach in regard to showing reaction camera shots in certain circumstances. As with every innovation, the rules being applied are, to a large extent, open to review in what has to be seen as an experimental period before broadcasting proper commences.</P>
    <P>Televising of proceedings will open a new era for the Seanad and give people an opportunity to see the House in action. Hopefully, it will remove many of the misconceptions that do the rounds on the role of the Upper House.  I know that all Members will be conscious of this and will be anxious that the Seanad puts its best foot forward when the proceedings are televised.  That is not to say that the Seanad should turn itself inside out just because it is being televised.  The whole idea is that the proceedings will be shown as they occur as far as possible and that this, of course, should be in the best possible light.  If it transpires that the rules being proposed today are found to be inadequate or too liberal these arrangements can be changed, if and when the need arises.</P>
    <P>The proposed programme format is very similar to the existing format for sound broadcasting with the additional caveat that broadcasters can be requested to submit their programme plans to the monitoring subcommittee.</P>
    <P>In regard to the procedure for addresses by distinguished persons &mdash; this was referred to this morning by Senator Dardis and I apologise again for not replying to him on the Order of Business &mdash; this procedure was first adopted as far back as 1981 but it lapsed without ever being availed of.  I know it is a facility that all Members will welcome, as it has been talked about for some time.  The committee are taking the opportunity of restoring the procedure now in conjunction with the televising of proceedings. The address procedure has been altered slightly.  The final say on a particular invitation is now in the hands of the House rather than the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which retain their right to nominate an appropriate person.  The title &ldquo;distinguished person&rdquo; may be off-putting in that it may seem to <Col N="1911" /> be very narrow in scope but in reality, the range of invitations can be quite open. It is something the Committee on Procedure and Privileges can consider on an individual basis, as it arises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this report and the two items contained in it.  We have all been involved in the preparation of this report for quite some time.  The two items are part of a wide ranging series of reforms which were considered by the last Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and have been moving, though not with the same speed as at present.  We need to get down to look at the other items on our agenda for updating our procedures as a matter of urgency.  This may be dealt with as we go into what, hopefully, will be a calm political climate for the next couple of months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;years, but the third part of my bet still stands but it may be Christmas next year rather than Christmas this year.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome these proposals. The televising of the Seanad is potentially the most exciting thing that has happened in this House over the last number of decades.  One of the fundamental aspects of democracy is the right of the public to know what is happening.  There is not much doubt in my mind that in recent years the amount of information going to the public has seriously declined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me elaborate on that point.  I would like to go back to the time of my grandfather and great-grandfather &mdash; the Parnellite time &mdash; a time when there was an intense interest in politics.  The newspapers at the time carried virtually verbatim accounts of what occurred in Parliament.  It was a frequent occurrence in most towns around the country that the local school teacher would daily read out the accounts of what happened in Westminster.  That particular generation, many of whom had no formal education were very familiar with the names of the principal speaker's in the House of Commons, not just from the Parnellite party, <Col N="1912" /> but the other parties.  They were familiar with the great issues of the time and indeed, with the procedures of the House of Commons.  They had all that knowledge as well as today's generation would know about football stars or television stars.  There was a tremendous degree of knowledge which Irish emigrants were, in turn, able to put to great use when they emigrated to the States in large numbers at the end of the last century and the beginning of this century.  This gave them a great headstart over other groups when they got into politics there.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years, the coverage of political events has declined. The humdrum is now never reported. The routine matters rarely get coverage. There is a great temptation for politicians, in order to get coverage, to playact or seek out eccentric or controversial issues in order to get some coverage in the newspapers.  That is unfortunate because the nature of the best Parliamentary business is that it is dull, routine, methodical and is examining in detail the smaller things that will become part of the law and will affect people over many years to come.  Much of that gets left behind in the coverage.  Newspapers have their own particular demands.  They are, perhaps, responding to the demands of the market.  Certainly the amount of coverage of parliamentary activities in the newspapers in the 1980s was far less than was the case in the 1920s.  That, I think, is a commentary either on Parliament and its relevance or on the newspapers.</P>
    <P>The advent of television will change that.  I would like to see a situation such as that which exists in Canada and other countries also where there is a separate television channel devoted entirely to Parliament.  With 17 or 18 channels available at the moment on most television sets &mdash; maybe more, 26 or 27 &mdash; there is no reason why there could not be a separate television channel which would, when Parliament is sitting, broadcast live the proceedings of either or both Houses, so that the considerable number of politically interested people outside could actually see what is being done in their names and on their behalf in the Houses of Parliament.  What we are seeing today <Col N="1913" /> with this Order, which will make a reality of the televising of this House on a limited basis, may be the first step towards a situation where people can actually watch from their own living rooms or workplaces what is happening in the Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Clearly there will have to be safeguards, and they are laid down.  I am glad that this House is taking a slightly more relaxed view about the presence of television than the other House.  Clearly we are all into a learning experience.  We must remain flexible to see what does work and what does not work.  We also have to be alert to the possibilities of some of our colleagues abusing the presence of television to bring this House into disrepute.  We must have a strong collective view on that.  This is not a question of somebody with a legitimate point of view being denied the right to put that point of view as strongly, as forcefully and as elaborately as is necessary.  There is always a danger of a House being hijacked by people for their particular interests against the better interests of the overall House.  We would have to be ready to take whatever steps are required to see that that does not happen in the larger interests of Parliament itself.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us have any great worries about the arrival of television in Parliament.  It will probably force us to sharpen up some of our procedures.  It may induce people to change their style of dress.  We may see a profusion of brighter colours in the House and louder neckties or more subdued clothes, depending on the particular image the person concerned is trying to project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure my sartorial standards will pass the test when the time arrives.  To get back to the serious question, the safeguards drawn up, as the Leader of the House has said, are flexible. They are subject to change if there is a need for change as we move into this <Col N="1914" /> experiment.  As I said yesterday, I want to commend the people on the broadcasting committee and those responsible for broadcasting services for the speed with which they moved once the initial decision was taken to televise this House. The work was expedited very satisfactorily indeed.  We should be having our internal runs by 10 December and be ready for broadcasting early in the New Year.</P>
      <P>There are safeguards, obviously, against the abuse of material so that excerpts from the Houses are not crosscut in a way which could bring the House into disrepute.  We need to bear that in mind, without being too paranoid about it.  We are far more sensitive in this country on these matters than our friends across the Channel.  I do not think that a programme like &ldquo;Spitting Images&rdquo; would ever be allowed much currency in this country, and perhaps rightly so.</P>
      <P>To conclude on the question of television, I certainly welcome it as a step towards broadening the public's fundamental right of access to the proceedings of the House.  They cannot be here physically, but they can see what is happening.  It is a fundamentally important development in democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the question of distinguished personages, I am really sorry it has taken so long to make a reality of this.  I know that you, Chairman, had, as one of your most heart-felt wishes, that this would happen and happen very quickly.  That it did not, I think, is a pity but at least now today we are about to make a reality of it.  Yesterday it would have been wonderful to have accorded the honour to Mr. Dubcek and to have heard him talk to a House of the Irish Parliament about his experiences and his hopes for the new Europe and for his own particular country. Again, as the Leader of the House said, the word &ldquo;distinguished&rdquo; does not have to be too narrow.  It can include people who have a message and who have something important to say to us as a House. We must always be open to ideas and messages.  The committee who will decide who will fall under this heading will, I hope, be flexible and imaginative as to the type of person they invite conferring on that person an honour, but <Col N="1915" /> perhaps also such a person will be honouring us by their presence.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I welcome this report.  I welcome the two measures included in it. I hope that the other work of reform will now move at a much faster pace than has been the case over the past number of months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this report which has been laid before us.  It is a fairly straightforward document and there is nothing very controversial in it.  I also thank the Leader for referring to his oversight this morning, which I know was an oversignt, in not alluding to a matter which I raised on the Order of Business. I intend now to return to that matter, to take it in reverse order and to begin with the section of the report which deals with the distinguished visitors and how we should treat them and what sort of facilities we should accord to them.  I would take a very liberal definition as to what constitutes a &ldquo;distinguished person&rdquo;, who should be entitled to address this House.  I would go so far as to take a very liberal view both domestically and from a foreign point of view.  There are people within the country who have distinguished themselves in areas other than politics and it would be very useful and constructive from the point of view of development of the economy and of Irish society in general to hear their views and accord them a platform where those views could be given to Parliament.  That is not to say that people from limited interest groups should be accorded such facility, but I believe that there are people within our society whom it would be very useful to hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Mr. Dubcek's visit yesterday, I found it quite embarrassing that somebody of his stature, somebody who is an internationally recognised statesman, who is the Speaker of his country's now democratic Parliament and someone who had suffered so much to bring the democracy to Eastern Europe which is now emerging, and who began that process more than 20 years ago, should have had to sit in the Visitors' Gallery while we conducted our domestic affairs.  I am <Col N="1916" /> sure he was interested in how our Parliament conducts its business, but I also found it embarrassing after he was accorded a very gracious welcome by the Leas-Chathaoirleach that Members had to troop through the distinguished Visitors' Gallery to shake hands with him one after the other.  I thought it diminished the dignity of the House.  It reflected badly on what, after all, is our reputation for hospitality.  If that reputation exists within the country, as it does I am sure, it should also exist within our Parliament. We should reflect the society from which we come.</P>
    <P>The way in which he attended here yesterday was not satisfactory.  I certainly would have very much welcomed being able to hear what he had to say.  He is obviously a person of immense experience. He is a person who has gone through a lot.  He is not less worthy than, say, Nelson Mandela of addressing the joint session &mdash; and I do not, for one moment, deny that Mr. Mandela should have been accorded that honour, but I do believe we should have been able to hear Mr. Dubcek yesterday.  I had a certain sense of embarrassment about what happened yesterday.  I am glad that within this report those matters are being covered.  We wish to have people, not just of his stature but of even lesser stature, come to us and we wish to adopt the facility of allowing distinguished persons to address the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It is not as if we do not have the time because we do.  However, I would be very much in favour of not having a restrictive definition as to who should address us.  In that connection, when we discussed last week European political and economic union at that stage I said I found it quite extraordinary, and indicative of our general indifference to the institutions of Europe, that we did not have some facility where our MEPs could have an input into our domestic Parliament.  That is not to say that they should actually have a legislative function, but we should at least know what is going on in Europe. After all, the European Parliament is a very important facet of European life and it will become an even more important facet as the trend towards European union develops.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> I also recorded on that occasion &mdash; and I will say it again &mdash; that when I visited the European Parliament earlier in the year I was able to sit in the Chamber when a committee on German unification was meeting &mdash; I could sit in the Chamber. At that meeting the chairman invited two people from the West German and East German Parliaments to address the meeting.  They had no status within the European Parliament but they were invited to address the meeting quite informally. One of the problems we have is that we derive so many of our models from the institution across the water.  As someone who has been here for a year, it strikes me that our procedures and our way of doing business are more appropriate to the Victorian age than they are to the age in which we live.  Parliaments, in general, in Europe, take a much more flexible approach than we do.  We seem to derive our model from Westminister. I do not think that is very healthy.  It would be more advantageous to us if we looked to the European model.</P>
    <P>I also said on that occasion, that I would wish the Seanad to take a more liberal approach as to who can address us, and that should include our MEPs and addresses even by, say, European Commissioners from whom, I am sure, we could learn.</P>
    <P>In relation to the television aspects of this report, we must concede that television as a medium has positive and negative features, as do most things in life. One of the positive things which television has done is that it has accelerated the movement towards breaking down the barriers in Eastern Europe.  The fact that people in East Germany and other Eastern European States could see across the wall, so to speak, through the medium of television, and see the society in Western Europe and wish to have the living standards and the freedoms which that society in Western Europe enjoyed, was a very powerful impetus towards the change which has taken place in Eastern Europe.  Television, in that respect, has had a very positive impact.  It could be argued that in some ways it is leading us towards a global society and that some of the barriers that existed and some of the very nationalistic obsessions which <Col N="1918" /> people had are disappearing to an extent because of television.  That is a development which is to be applauded.  I find it curious and regrettable that we have not had television in both Houses of the Oireachtas until now.</P>
    <P>When I was in Hungary earlier in the year, every evening on the news bulletin we saw the proceedings of the Hungarian Parliament.  We also saw voting electronically rather than through the lobbies. In that respect we have some way to go even to catch up on Eastern Europe. I agree entirely with Senator Manning who said that it is the right of the people to see what happens in their Parliament &mdash; to see what happens in both the D·il and in the Seanad &mdash; in order to judge whether what is being done here is effective. The most immediate way in which the workings of both Houses can be brought to the attention of the people is through television.  They have the discretion not to watch, of course and they probably will exercise that discretion to a fairly high degree.  At least they are entitled to see, to hear, as they do at the moment on RTE, and to read about what happens within the Parliament.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Manning's view in relation to the older press standards where the business of Parliament was reported.  It now seems to be the case that people can attend here for the Order of Business, perform for the benefit of a headline, then leave the House and not contribute in any substantial way to the proper business of the House, which is to legislate on behalf of the people.  That is regrettable.  One of the reservations I have in relation to television is that it could lead to an even more accentuated disorder, if that is the word.  People will perform for television.  I hope the committee can institute some standards to prevent that happening.  It would be regrettable if the only things we saw on television news bulletins were disorder, rows and people making silly points for publicity purposes.</P>
    <P>Members must conduct themselves in an orderly fashion, being conscious of the fact that they are Members of a sovereign Parliament.  That does not mean we should stand on our dignity or on our vanity to such an extent that people are <Col N="1919" /> not entitled to know, see and hear what goes on here.  That is the very foundation of democracy.  From that point of view, I hope the development of television reporting can be accelerated.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to the cameras in the House and how they do not fit in with the magnificent surroundings. Last week Senator Manning raised this matter and clarified it.  Where I come from they would be called &ldquo;yokes&rdquo;: there are three &ldquo;yokes&rdquo; in the House. Given the level of technology which exists today, I cannot understand how this cannot be done more discreetly with a smaller camera.  There was an advertisement in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday for a video camera which you could hold in your hand.  If they can bring back television pictures from space via satellites we can do more with the technology which exists today than we appear to have done.  I would say to the people responsible for installing those cameras to look again and come up with a more satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>I am led to understand that RTE may take a visual feed direct from here and will be able to edit it at their discretion, but they would take the sound feed by way of the television cameras and use that on the radio programmes, which they already broadcast from the Oireachtas. I am not so sure that is a satisfactory arrangement.  It obviously has implications from an employment point of view as well as from other points of view. That is something which possibly needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>Both of these matters, in terms of the distinguished persons and of television, bring us on to one other point I would like to make before I conclude and that is total Oireachtas reform.  There is an onus on us to bring our procedures into the modern age to reflect the society which is a modern society and not be out of touch with the needs of that modern society.</P>
    <P>Many of our procedures are very much based on the British model but there are more liberal and flexible models we could look at quite usefully.  Above all, we must be able to respond to the issues of the day.  Our present procedures seem to prevent <Col N="1920" /> us from doing that.  When people die or when there is some other momentous event of that nature we are accorded time to comment but a lot of the time when something of an economic nature, of an agricultural nature, of a social nature develops within the country and is being spoken about by every citizen within the State, we come in here and we are unable to talk about it until we have time and by the, time we are given time or time is available, the subject is no longer an issue, so what we have to say is not relevant. In those circumstances we need to be more responsive to the issues of the day but I do believe profoundly that the conduct of Members needs some degree of regulation when television becomes the medium by which we address the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the two matters contained in the report and I would also like to support Senator Dardis's call in relation to the whole question of Oireachtas reform.  At times what we are dealing with may not seem to be important and we cannot raise what we should be dealing with under our rules.  How often the Cathaoirleach or the Leader of the House says something is not appropriate to the Order of Business and, strictly speaking they are probably right under the present rules, but there should be the opportunity there for change.  There are a couple of things that often occur to me about the Seanad.  Perhaps there should be a limited form of Question Time to Ministers or officials.  It may be that on an adjournment debate too much time is given to one person and that if, say, three Senators have important matters on any one day three ten minute slots would be more appropriate.  Most problems do not necessarily require 20 minutes speeches with people perhaps wondering if they can keep going for the 20 minutes, and then there is the Minister's response. Maybe the grievance, or injury, time procedure that has been introduced in the D·il would be examined by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for the Seanad to make it more relevant. It often occurred to me with regard to <Col N="1921" /> debates in both Houses, that it would be better if the quantum could be halved and the content doubled in clarity and in points rather than having long winded speeches and repetition.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the whole question of the televising of proceedings.  The televising of proceedings will I hope bring a response from Senators, all of us probably improving our performance, improving our contributions, maybe giving more thorough indepth thought to debates and to research.  Obviously we are all at times busy people with many things to do.  In addition to our work here we have our constituency work and all that entails to deal with.  However, one would hope that with Oireachtas reform there will be greater research facilities, and more people available to enable one to find information.  The televising of proceedings will, we hope, bring to the public an awareness of our work here, making it, perhaps more relevant to their daily lives, whether it is in relation to legislation being passed, matters being raised, the problems of a region being discussed or whatever.  We are fortunate here that a certain amount of our dealings get publicity in the papers and a certain amount, too, in &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; on the radio and on television.  However, that is limited. Only one of our national papers has a regular Seanad report, others deal with things as they arise.  As Senator Dardis mentioned it is sometimes the wrong things that are reported.  One thinks of, say, some Senator who could be regarded as a gallery seeker, rising at 10.30 a.m. with a sort of Oscar performance and being gone from the Chamber by 10.35 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At times there are question marks regarding the contents of certain RTE programmes or regarding individuals appearing on programmes.  There is a perception that at times certain individuals either from this House or from the other House have only to lift a phone to certain producers to be invited there and then to participate in programmes. It is not right that anything of that kind should happen.  One may say that television or radio stations are entitled to have who they want on programmes but clearly, in the case of some <Col N="1922" /> programmes, the same individuals appear suddenly.  From time to time I have issued statements which I considered relevant to an issue, relevant to my capacity as a spokesman on Defence and Labour, only to find that they did not get a mention.  Yet at times other matters seem to get star billing, and these from the same individuals each time.  What we all want is a just system, a system of fair play and for a national organisation, a national broadcasting medium there has got to be this balance.  It is important that I make the point so far as certain programmes are concerned.  I hope that the televising of the House will show that there are people here, apart from those who appear most on television, who are getting on with their work.  The official report is really for the history books. While some people may be interested enough to read it, it is not read widely.</P>
    <P>We have all seen in recent weeks what has gone on across the water.  It was compelling viewing.  If a group outside make a suggestion on something like the Finance Bill and our spokesperson raises it, then I would like if they, were able to see what was said on their behalf, what the Minister's response was, whether an amendment was accepted, or rejected and the reasons for it.  All of that would make people out there, who at times criticise TDs and Senators and criticise the working of the D·il and Seanad, and some of the criticism certainly is justified, realise what is being done.  I hope that the televising of our proceedings here will improve the performances of all of us and also be of benefit to the public.  No doubt we all look forward to seeing the likes of Senator Manning in a new Louis Copeland suit or whatever.</P>
    <P>The matter of inviting distinguished guests is very important.  It is unfortunate that that custom was allowed to lapse.  I hope that the committee will think ahead as to who our early invited guests may be.  We should be very broadminded in this regard, whether we are talking of distinguished guests such as the one who was here yesterday, experts in a certain field, and so on.</P>
    <P>I hope to be calling for a special debate in relation to children, their rights and also the problems in the whole area relating to children.  This will be in the light <Col N="1923" /> of the UN charter the Taoiseach signed some time ago.  In such a debate it would be advantageous if some experts could come in here and give their views as a start-off on a debate, and then Senators could respond instead of the Minister, who gets advice from his officials.  It might be better if we had a representative of a health board and so on come here to say what the problems and difficulties are.  Members could question that person rather than put questions to the Minister who takes advice from his officials.</P>
    <P>The committee should be looking ahead to see who is visiting this country, whether they are human rights activists, parliamentarians or groups representing another country.  It is important that we should consider the distinguished guests we invite, listen to them and get their views.  We should be very broadminded about this and limit the restrictions on such visits.  We know not to invite someone who would lower the dignity of the House.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader consider what I have said in relation to this and, hopefully, the committee will look at some of the other matters, particularly in relation to Oireachtas reform.  We all hope that the televising of proceedings will improve our image with the public, will do us all good and that we will improve on our performance. There is a lot to be said for keeping speeches short, and not permitting long-winded contributions.  It is important that they are concise, clear, well thought out and well researched.  I hope that with the televising of proceedings a greater sense of fair play will emerge on how politicians are judged by the public.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report.  I would like to know what is the rough timescale?  Will the trial be held next month and the public showing of the proceedings after Christmas?  I echo what has been said in relation to the equipment in the Chamber. If it can be tidied up or reduced in size we would welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this report and I <Col N="1924" /> intend to be as brief as possible.  As a Member of the all-party committee on the broadcasting of proceedings of the D·il and Seanad I would say this is a timely report to come before the House. Obviously, I welcome the move by Seanad Eireann into the television age.  I am pleased that the various suggestions made over some time have been incorporated, to a great extent, in relation to the televising of the proceedings of the House.  I am not going to go into any details on this as my colleagues have covered much of the ground.  Obviously, there is general agreement on the way the proceedings should be televised.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the format for televising the proceedings will be somewhat different, and I would think an improvement, on that which currently pertains in the House of Commons.  Most of our citizens are familiar with that format but practically every parliament in Europe is now televising its proceedings.</P>
      <P>There has been some controversy in relation to the location and size of the equipment which has been placed in this House.  I have sympathy to a great extent with those who believe that the equipment affects the aesthetic appearance of this wonderful Chamber.  I do not believe it should be in any way despoiled.  Unfortunately, the age in which this Chamber was constructed, and the marvellous restoration work by the Office of Public Works on the ceiling lead to a culture clash with the technological advances of the late 20th century.  However, I am sure that further discussion on this will resolve the difficulties for all Members and that, ultimately, the equipment permanently placed in this Chamber will not in any way upset the ambience of the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased &mdash; this matter came up on the Order of Business this morning &mdash; that there will be provision for addresses to Seanad …ireann by distinguished persons.  We had the presence of Alexander Dubcek in Seanad …ireann yesterday and it was incredible to be within feet of a man of such stature in the world of international politics and have the unique pleasure of shaking hands with him.  His hands, so to speak, changed the world utterly.  I am glad to say that, unlike Yeats, a terrible beauty has not been <Col N="1925" /> born but a new order has been created out of the activities of Mr. Dubcek.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that I address this aspect of the report.  I would support any move to ensure that distinguished visitors of the stature of Mr. Dubcek have an opportunity of addressing the House.  Not only would it be an opportunity for us to listen to what distinguished visitors have to say but I have no doubt it would further enhance the image of the second Chamber within the Houses of the Oireachtas and, more importantly, with the citizenry outside it.  In that context I hope that the provisions incorporated in this report will be acted on at the earliest possible opportunity. Overall, I welcome the thrust and content of the report.  One can only welcome Seanad …ireann once again into a new age.  As they say in a different context &ldquo;God bless all who sail in it&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I welcome this report. It is about the third report in this vein I can recall but, unfortunately, the others were never acted upon.  Over the last number of years &mdash; at least since 1981-82 &mdash; successive Houses have given a lot of thought to the desirability of having the facility of hearing persons other than Members of the House.  Of course, the Seanad has been for many years looking forward to having its proceedings broadcast and televised.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works, their architects and, indeed, the House closely monitored the progress and expenditure of £2 million in revamping the House and restoring the ceiling.  During those negotiations with the then Cathaoirleach &mdash; my distinguished colleague &mdash; we pointed out the desirability of the House opting for televising the proceedings. That was before the proceedings of the House of Lords and the House of Commons in the UK were broadcast.  Since then the public have shown an interest in viewing the proceedings of the Houses across the water.  Those proceedings are watched with a considerble amount of interest here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After spending £2 million on the ceiling of the Chamber it is asking a little much of us to impose three outrageous cameras which surely are an intrusion on the architecture. <Col N="1926" /> If it was the desire just to make the ceiling safe and not have it fall on our heads why did the Office of Public Works, and the powers-that-be, spend over £2 million and have the House working in most unsuitable conditions for almost two years and then offend the majestic lines of this House by the intrusion of those cameras?  During those negotiations the Cathaoirleach, myself and others asked the architects in charge of this building if they would not recess alcoves to take those cameras &mdash; those walls are three or four foot thick.  They were built in 1734. We were told it was not possible.  Are successive generations of Senators to look at this new fangled machinery?  The European Parliament in 1973 or 1974 put in a very extensive televising system in the then new building in Luxembourg, which is now almost obsolete except for committee meetings.  While there was absolute and complete cover there, the only visible signs of a camera was a three inch diameter opening in the wall.</P>

      <P>I thank the expert for his help and his kindness.  I accept that he is this House's expert on radio and in that area he performs and operates very well.  Nevertheless, after almost 30 years here I feel I am entitled to express a view, more especially since I chaired the Committee on Standing Orders for four or five years and put a lot of work and thought into it.  I would like to have an opportunity to express a few views on that experience.  I was charged, with three other colleagues, in 1976 with looking at the working conditions of members of federal and confederal parliaments. My subcommittee visited the Federal Parliaments in the United States of America, in Canberra, the Cantons in Switzerland, the Supreme Soviet and the Federal Houses in Germany.  Our brief was to look at the facilities that members of the directly elected European Parliament ought to expect when they were elected in 1979.  In the course of the <Col N="1927" /> review it was possible to see the kind of services and conditions that Members of Parliament ought to have at their disposal so that they could give the best service possible to the people who elected them and for whom they voluntarily opted to serve.  Facilities in any Parliament are of extreme importance.</P>
      <P>It is important, more especially in the difficult times we are in, with the great changes that are taking place especially in the European Community and across the world, that this House should have every possible facility to carry out its functions, to hear important people at first hand.  The Acting Chairman will recall that we even raised the dais nine inches, which did improve the House to some extent, so that a VIP standing in front of the Chair would not be looking down on the Chair.  We have been thinking about this for a long time and it certainly is moving too slowly.  I would hope that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges would not waste much more time before giving this House the opportunity of hearing very distinguished people who pass through our city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a call almost on a weekly or monthly basis in a House of the Oireachtas for a foreign affairs committee. The Standing Orders available to us are the nearest we can get to a foreign affairs committee.  This is not a large House, so from that point of view it is the ideal venue to hear foreign people, such as the distinguished visitor we had yesterday, to hear a message from them and to be able to consider it ourselves. Instead of talking about a foreign affairs committee let us utilise the facilities we have.  It is important that we conserve this Chamber.  We have suffered the difficulties of working outside it for almost <Col N="1928" /> two years during which time the place was restored &mdash; a marvellous job by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>With those few comments I support and compliment the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the progress to date and look forward to the finished product we can expect in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their support and approval of this very important report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on televising of proceedings and a provision of an address to the Seanad by distinguished persons. As I said in my address it is a new era for both Houses of the Oireachtas.  For us in the Seanad it is a particular challenge and I would like to think that for the people of Ireland it will mean a greater awareness of the whole political system which has a real bearing on the lives of the people.  I am talking about areas like education, social welfare, agriculture and so many other areas important to the lives of our people.  They will now have an opportunity to see the proceedings in both D·il and Seanad and how this system works.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis extended the debate a bit and asked for Oireachtas reform. Indeed, I have noted all his comments with regard to that matter, but while I am totally in favour of this idea, obviously it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  This was also referred to by Senator Liam Cosgrave.  I have no doubt it is something that they will take on board in the year ahead.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 5 December 1990.</P>
