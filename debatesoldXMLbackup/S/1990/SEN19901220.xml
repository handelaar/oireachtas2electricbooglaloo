      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Jackman that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Transport to clarify if he proposes to continue with his policy of current compulsory stop-over of transAtlantic flights at Shannon particularly in view of recent announcements by Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to review the case of a prisoner in Arbour Hill (name supplied) with a view to exercising his ministerial prerogative of commuting the sentence in the light of its comparative severity taking into account the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to outline the criteria used in the distribution of national lottery funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make provisions for the retention of the health research board laboratories in Trinity College, Dublin, which has made a huge contribution through fundamental research in combating leprosy and other diseases.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to construct a community school at Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Jackman, Norris, Ross, Costello and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Jackman's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Norris, Ross, Costello and Neville may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>Before I call on the Leader of the House, I wish to announce a correction to the Order Paper.  In motion No. 3 the reference to item 4 should read &ldquo;4a&rdquo; which is the motion on the supplementary Order Paper circulated.</P>

      <P>Before we take the Order of Business, may I say that today is the last meeting of the Seanad before Christmas.  I would very much like to wish the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, all Senators, the Clerk and other staff, the Ushers, the Official Reporters of the Seanad Debates, the various, reporters and journalists of the press and in particular Mary Cummins, Jean McKenna and Reg Cullen who are regular friends of ours, Barry Kavanagh and his colleagues in RTÉ, and all friends and families of those I have mentioned, peace, joy, happiness and, above all, good health at Christmas.  My very best wishes for now and the New Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this House we do not agree all the time.  We have the occasional row and I see this as part and parcel of the cut and thrust of politics.  Politics is a very honourable profession.  Even if we have <Col N="559" /> disagreements, we can all agree on one thing.  In our own way, we are all playing a role in providing a better country economically, socially and culturally, whether we are labelled academics, pseudo-academics, brilliant academics or people like myself, mere mortals from the greatest university of all &mdash; the university of life.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I know we in this House have our critics.  I do not say that to embarrass Senator Cullen, Senator Keogh or Senator Dardis because I regard them as three excellent people, excellent Senators, who are enjoying themselves in this House.  We are 60 Senators, and no matter what people say about this House, there are surely not 60,600 or 6,000 but probably more than 600,000 people who would like to be in our shoes today.</P>
      <P>I again wish the Cathaoirleach and all our families and friends best wishes for Christmas and the New Year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is, items Nos. 3, 4 and 5.  We will take all Stages of No. 5 first followed by items Nos. 3 and 4.  As you, a Chathaoirligh, have indicated item No. 4a will be debated in January when we resume.  If the Unit Trust Bill is finished at about 12.30 p.m. or thereabouts we continue with the business but if it goes on to 1 o'clock we will have a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 o'clock and, hopefully, commence the Appropriation Bill at 2 o'clock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not try to compete with the Leader of the House in the Comprehensive nature of the good wishes he bestowed or, indeed, to digress &mdash; as he so eloquently did &mdash; but may I, on behalf of my own group, join with him in wishing all Members of the House, especially the staff who serve this House so well and <Col N="560" /> the media named by the Leader of the House who give us a particularly good service, a happy Christmas.  If at times we complain we do not get the coverage which I think we deserve, it is not the fault of those who report on what happens. It is due to a wrong sense of values and priorities by the editorial staff and, perhaps, we should try to persuade them to change in the coming year.  I thank the ushers, the reporting staff, the Clerk &mdash; I am not sure whether we have a Clerk Assistant as yet &mdash; and all members of the office of the Clerk, and wish them a very happy Christmas and a quiet New Year.</P>
      <P>I will not join with the Leader of the House in discussing the different types of Senators we have.  I do not think it would be very helpful at this stage but the Leader of the House has brought a great stability to the position of Leader of the House and has dealt with all parties in a very courteous, helpful and positive way. He has been open-minded to suggestions for change.  He would like to see more changes taking place and, hopefully, in the new year some of them will become a reality.  Certainly, he has been most helpful to all sides.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he can give us a definite date for the return of the Seanad.  I do this on purpose because the Leader of the House, for all his charm, is often very hard to pin down. Frequently, at this time of the year we are told we are coming back two weeks or a week before the other House but, invariably, we do not for reasons usually outside the control of the Leader.  If we have him pinned down today and he gives us a definite date for the return ahead of the other House then there will be no way out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago this House agreed to a new procedure whereby distinguished persons can be invited to address the House.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he has any plans in the coming year to invite any such persons to address the House or, if not, will he put together a small all-party committee to suggest names of people whom it would <Col N="561" /> be appropriate to invite to address the House under the proposed change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the good wishes which have been flowing around in an uncharacteristic manner this morning and to wish the Cathaoirleach wisdom in 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rosss</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Fallon for his kind remarks and ask that his remarks on academics should be responded to by the only professor in this House, who is seated on his left.  I should like to echo the words of Senator Manning in wishing the staff of the House a very happy Christmas but I would urge a certain amount of caution on the suggestion that we have distinguished visitors to address the House.  Apart from the fact that we are addressed by distinguished people at every sitting, it is unwise that we should rush into that and give discretion to Members to invite people to address us. It could bring this House into some controversial areas which we do not want to go into.  It sounds a very good idea on the surface but it needs very careful examination.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to single out the Progressive Democrats for particular attention today.  They are always welcome here, even at Christmas.  It is very unfair of the Leader of the House to single them out for a particular welcome.  That welcome will be here next year, the year after and, when they begin to accept this House, it will be there also.  I wish them also a very happy Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the seasonal good wishes to the Cathaoirleach. I join Senator Ross in wishing you wisdom, patience, understanding and an increased tendency to indulge people from time to time when they stray from the straight and narrow of what is before us.  I want to pay a special tribute to the Leader of the House, Senator Fallon, for his courtesy and the attention with which he treats every Member on the Order of <Col N="562" /> Business.  It would be ungracious of me not to pay a special compliment to him arising from his success in having the Environmental Protection Agency Bill debated here before it goes to the other House.  I raised this consistently and I am very pleased he succeeded.  On that note, I join in the good wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader and other Members of the House in wishing you, Sir, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, and all Members of the House, a very happy and peaceful Christmas and a prosperous New Year and also the Members of the staff, the press, the ushers and everybody who has been mentioned by the Leader. We are very gratified to have the Leader, and people on the opposite benches, pay us personal good wishes for Christmas. We very much appreciate those wishes and the attention is welcome.  While we are here, and naturally we shall be here for several years to come, we will contribute fully, as we have done in the past, to the workings of the House.  We will contribute in every way we can to preserving its dignity while it exists.</P>
      <P>Finally, I endorse what Senator Manning said about inviting distinguished persons. I hope we will be as flexible as possible in extending a welcome to distinguished people to come to address us. I have already mentioned that I was embarrassed that Mr. Dubcek who had promoted the freedom which is spreading in Eastern Europe had not been able to address us and had to sit in the Visitors' Gallery when visiting Ireland.  I hope that will not happen again and that an Irish welcome will be extended to people who come to visit us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the good wishes that were extended and to thank the Leader of the House for his kind comments.  On the question of people addressing the Seanad, I feel the Seanad has a major role to play.  Perhaps, we should look at that a little more often and emphasise it a little more.  If we are to have distinguished visitors address us the invitation should be extremely restricted.  Mr. Dubcek, both for his <Col N="563" /> enormous international reputation and also because he has been appointed chairman of the new free democratic Czech administration, was a particularly appropriate person to address the Seanad.  Only the most distinguished people should be invited to address us.</P>
      <P>On a slightly sad note, this time last year there was a great deal to celebrate in Eastern Europe but the news this morning that Mr. Shevardnadze has resigned is very sad.  I want to pay a special tribute to him and express some concern at the manner and nature of his resignation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the general goodwill of the season and also express this on behalf of my Independent colleagues, including those who are not able to be with us this morning.  I would like also to point out that it is not just a question of goodwill.  There are strong spiritual values attached to the season of Christmas in this country.  However, this is not always recognised.  I recall being in a court in Dublin when a constitutional defence was entered for the Hare Krishna who had been arrested for disturbing the peace.  The young barrister representing them said they were exercising a constitutional right to practice their religion. The judge who had appeared comatose up to then snapped up and said: &ldquo;young man, what defence do you think that is in my court, practising a religion indeed. What do you think would happen in this country if everyone went around doing that?&rdquo;  Perhaps I offer this as a kind of Swiftian Christmas thought on what would occur if we actually practised the Constitution and made this a Christian and democratic State in the fullest sense of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the sentiments expressed generally about the efficiency and courtesy of the Leader of the House and all the staff which are very deeply appreciated. I believe the occasional friction and tension to which the Leader of the House referred add a good real of vigour to the House.  Although strong views are held and strong positions taken I believe there <Col N="564" /> is no malice between individual Members.  That is the way it should be; that is the way democracy works.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Ross's reservations about the invitations to distinguished visitors. It could lead us either into controversy or boredom.  As Senator Manning suggested, if this is going to be done, a committee should be set up representing the various interests in the House to ensure that no inappropriate invitation is ever issued.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have received very fair treatment in terms of Adjournment debates, and, as always, I greatly appreciate this. However, I have had an item concerning what I believe is a miscarriage of justice down for a number of weeks.  Because the person concerned will be incarcerated over the Christmas period I hoped I would have had an opportunity to raise this matter.  I do not in any sense question the selection but I hope this matter may be taken early in the New Year.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to thank Members for their support, co-operation and the enthusiasm which they can, without permission, generate from time to time.  This can be helpful in many respects but it can also cause a little difficulty on occasion. I want to sincerely thank all Senators for the assistance, support and co-operation they have given the Chair over the past year.</P>
      <P>I should also like to thank the Clerk of the Seanad and her staff, the staff of the House, the press, the ushers and everyone who has contributed to the good working of the House.  I wish everyone a happy and joyous Christmas and hope that you will be safe in your homes and on the streets.</P>
      <P>I now call on the Leader of the House to reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that more statements were made than queries raised on the Order of Business this morning. Senator Manning asked if I could give a guarantee when the House would resume.  I want to give the Senator a positive guarantee that we will be back before the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>That positive guarantee will be honoured.  He queried what the position was in regard to issuing invitations to distinguished people.  Some weeks ago we set in place procedures for inviting distinguished people to the House.  I do not propose to set up a further committee to consider the matter &mdash; procedures are in place and we must abide by them.  I am very conscious of the wisdom of Senator Ross who indicated that we will have to exercise caution in this matter.  Senators Dardis and Conroy also referred to this.  We will be very careful not to lower the prestige of this fine House.  Obviously we will not invite every Tom, Dick or Harry.  We will only invite very distinguished people.  As other speakers have said, we will exercise extreme sensitivity in this matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton asked about the Environmental Protection Agency.  I am very pleased to be able to say that a Bill on this matter will come before us shortly.  As I said yesterday, it will be a large and important Bill.  I ask Members to analyse the Bill in great detail and to get information either directly from the Department or through our Whip so that we can do justice to it when we come back.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Norris's comment about the judge was a sort of statement from the bench.  I have noted what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wright correctly paid tribute to Senator Michael Howard.  I would also like to thank Senator Howard who was a very responsible Whip.  He will not be in that position any longer, from choice.  I thank him for his great efforts in the smooth running of this House.  I strongly believe in the Whip system which, as <Col N="566" /> Senator Wright said, is essential for the smooth running of the House.  I know Senator Liam Cosgrave, who succeeds Senator Howard, will be as helpful and responsible as Senator Howard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank will, under this Bill, become the designated statutory authority for the supervision of unit trusts.  The other main objective of the Bill is to provide for developments in accepted international practice with regard to the supervision and operation of unit trusts since the Unit Trusts Act, 1972, was passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The scope of the Bill continues to comprehend unit trust schemes providing for collective investment in securities or any other property whatsoever.  The Bill is also designed to cater for the tailoring of supervisory requirements to the varying characteristics of the different types of unit trust schemes which now exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transfer of supervisory functions from myself to the Central Bank is part of a wider process which has been ongoing for a number of years, with the objective of reducing, as far as is practical and desirable, the range of supervisory authorities responsible for the financial <Col N="567" /> services sector.  In this context, the Central Bank, in addition to their responsibility for the banking sector, have already been given regulatory powers with regard to building societies and trustee savings banks, as well as supervisory powers in relation to the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the specific area of collective investment schemes the Central Bank are already the supervisory authority for UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) under the European Communities (UCITS) Regulations, 1989, and they will assume a similar supervisory role for variable capital companies under Part XIII of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, which has just completed its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas and is awaiting signature by the President.  The Unit Trusts Bill, 1990, will complete the adoption of a consistent approach to the control and supervision of this sector of the financial services industry.</P>
    <P>The consolidation of regulatory control for these financial services in a single supervisory authority will result, I believe, in a more efficient use of scarce resources and the ready availability of a pool of expertise should enhance the quality of supervision by providing for a consistent approach in different sectors and helping to eliminate any gaps in the supervisory structure.</P>
    <P>Such a supervisory authority will help ensure that the rules impact evenly on all institutions operating in this sector and allow for a coherent response to events, having regard to the rapid and substantial developments in financial services in recent years.</P>
    <P>The other main objective of the Bill is to update the provisions of the Unit Trusts Act, 1972, to allow for developments in accepted international practice concerning the operation and supervision of unit trusts.  Since the passage of the 1972 Act, this sector of the financial services industry has developed and expanded enormously and this has been <Col N="568" /> reflected internationally in changes in the form and degree of control and regulation.</P>
    <P>From being a relatively new investment vehicle in Ireland in the early seventies &mdash; in 1973 only two unit trusts were registered in Ireland &mdash; unit trusts are now firmly established.  At present, there are some 30 registered unit trusts with investments worth just under £1 billion.</P>
    <P>With supervisory systems in existence in most developed countries for many years, the unit trust industry has now, in contrast to the situation prevailing when the 1972 Act was enacted, a body of well known and accepted rules and best practices.  To take account of the situation facing existing and future unit trusts in the nineties and into the 21st century, it is necessary, I believe, to adapt our supervisory system to accommodate these new circumstances.</P>
    <P>I believe that the best way of dealing with this situation is to adopt an approach which allows for more flexibility in dealing with modern practices yet maintains the fundamental principles of investor protection enshrined in the 1972 Act. This approach will allow the supervisory authority to respond more rapidly to developments by using the powers devolved on them in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition I consider that this Bill, in updating our supervisory system, will, without any reduction in supervisory standards, enhance the attractiveness and competitiveness of Ireland, including the IFSC and Shannon, as a location for investment fund management services.</P>
    <P>I would now like to summarise, for the benefit of Senators, the general thrust of the most important sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the Central Bank establish and maintain a register of authorised unit trust schemes.  This provision is similar to that contained in section 2 of the 1972 Act.  In addition the section also covers other public discolosure requirements imposed on the bank.</P>
    <P>The necessary conditions, similar to those of the 1972 Act, for the authorisation of a unit trust are set out in section 4.  These include the bank being <Col N="569" /> satisfied with the competence and probity of the management company and trustee; the financial resources and corporate status of the management company and trustee; the independence of the management company and trustee from one another; the trust deed's compliance with the provisions of the Bill and its deposit with the bank; and the name of the unit trust scheme.</P>
    <P>This section also empowers the Minister to direct that authorisations be subjected by the bank to specified conditions or requirements, as long as these do not constrain the prudential supervision of a scheme by the bank.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives the bank power to impose conditions for authorisation of unit trusts either generally, individually or of a particular class.  This will allow the bank to regular the operation of unit trust schemes, taking due account of the different characteristics of schemes.  For example, a scheme which offers units to the public would probably need to be subjected to more rigorous conditions than a scheme whose unit holders are a select group of major institutions.</P>
    <P>In the event of a refusal of an authorisation by the bank, section 6 provides that the management company or trustee may appeal to the High Court. Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill require that the approval of the bank is necessary to any alteration in the trust deed, or change in name or replacement of the management company or trustee of a scheme. Section 8 also gives the bank the power, where it is in the interests of unit holders, to replace the management company or trustee, who would have the right to appeal any such decision to the High Court.</P>
    <P>In section 9 the Sale or purchase of units, or any solicitation in that regard, by unauthorised unit trusts is prohibited unless approval has been received from the bank, who may attach conditions to any such approval.  This prohibition extends to any arrangements, resembling unit trusts, which provide for the participation of the public in profits or income from securities or any other property.  This prohibition does not <Col N="570" /> extend to private trusts.  Neither does it cover collective investment schemes linked with life assurance nor companies incorporated under the companies Acts or by statute or charter, building societies, friendly societies or industrial and provident societies, which are all already covered by separate legislation.  The effect of this section is to prohibit the operation of unauthorised unit trust schemes and is similar to the provisions of section 7 of the 1972 Act.  Section 10 prohibits the advertising of unauthorised unit trusts, as defined in section 9, unless approval has been received from the bank, who may attach conditions to any such approval.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the Bill depends not only on prohibiting unauthorised schemes from carrying on business but also on preventing them from advertising. The bank will have the power to exempt foreign newspapers and magazines with only a small circulation in Ireland from compliance with this provision.</P>
    <P>Effectively sections 9 and 10 prevent unauthorised unit trusts from operating in Ireland and so avoiding the duties and responsibilities attendant upon authorisation. The intention is that trust law should continue to be a key element in the safeguarding of the interests of investors in unit trusts schemes.</P>
    <P>A general principle of unit trusts is that the proceeds of the sale of any units or any income in respect of the assets of a scheme that is not distributed to unit holders shall be assets of the scheme and be treated accordingly and this continues to be provided for in section 11.  Following amendment in the Dáil, this prohibition shall not apply to the sale by a management company of units purchased by it on its own account, to the extent that the Bank may specify in conditions attached to the authorisation.</P>
    <P>Another principle is incorporated in section 12 which obliges the management company, as soon as may be, to purchase units from unit holders who so request. The section allows for the temporary suspension of such purchase in exceptional <Col N="571" /> circumstances in the interests of investors. There is also provision for the bank to specify other limited circumstances under which this stipulation need not apply.</P>
    <P>Section 13 prohibits a management company, or connected persons, from making profits from transactions in any assets held under the scheme.  It also prohibits a management company or trustee borrowing or lending on the scheme.  The bank will be empowered to allow such practices under conditions it might impose in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The bank, in setting conditions on authorisation, including those abating the provisions of sections 11, 12 and 13, will be required to so do in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of unit trust schemes.  Strict liability of trustees under authorised unit trust schemes is provided for in section 14, which is in itself a re-enactment of section 15 of the 1972 Act.</P>
    <P>The application to authorised unit trusts of certain provisions of the European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations, 1989, is provided for in section 15.  These adapted provisions relate to the temporary suspension of the purchase of units, reporting and auditing requirements, keeping of records, appelate procedures, revocation of authorisation, the bank's power of intervention and the review of the bank's decisions by the High Court.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by saying that this Bill is designed to provide a continuing framework of control and supervision allowing for the protection of the public interest and the interests of investors into the next century without inhibiting the development and growth of this sector of the financial services industry.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the general thrust of the Bill.  Indeed, I welcome it but there is a number of matters on which I seek clarification which I expect will be forthcoming from the Minister.  The Bill has two main <Col N="572" /> objectives one of which is to transfer the supervisory role, which heretofore has been exercised by the Minister, to the Central Bank and to establish new and enhanced powers for the control and regulation of unit trusts schemes.  I intend to raise the question of whether these controls and regulations are adequate. The second main objective of the Bill is to update the provisions of the Unit Trusts Act, 1972 to provide for developments in accepted international practice with regard to the supervision and operation of unit trusts.</P>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge, in the main it is the small investor who avails of unit trusts schemes.  While I have no problem with the thrust of the Bill I want to raise a number of queries and make it clear, even though there are others who avail of unit trusts, that I want to focus attention on the small investor.  In their case the sums involved are small and represent their savings, in some cases their life savings, or redundancy payments and their main purpose is to ensure that bit of security in their later years which is very commendable.</P>
      <P>It has to be accepted that their expertise in financial and related matters is not very extensive with the result that they have to rely greatly on the expertise of those who run and control unit trusts schemes, in other words, the management companies and trustees of such schemes.  Should at any stage the expertise of those management companies and trustees prove to be inadequate the results could be disastrous for the unit holders I am referring to.  Therefore I suggest to the Minister, having regard to the fact that these unit holders have to rely on the expertise of others to secure their investment, that the key question is that of the expertise and honesty of the management companies and the trustees involved.  In addition to laying emphasis on the integrity and status of the trustees emphasis must also be laid on the investment vehicles used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that foreign companies who wish to operate in this field will be welcomed.  It will also be open to them to advertise <Col N="573" /> their services.  I would like an assurance therefore from the Minister that the safeguards are adequate as I have my doubts, having read the measure, as to whether they are.  Can we be given a guarantee, in relation to both home and foreign investment vehicles, that investors' funds will be secure?</P>
    <P>I am a bit reluctant to raise the following matter but feel it is necessary to do so.  There is always the possibility of bad management and this can present problems.  However a far greater problem, as we know from experience, for small investors is that so often in the past they have been the victims of fraud.  I have my doubts as to whether these safeguards are adequate to deal with that problem.  I paid attention to what the Minister had to say this morning and listened to what the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, had to say in reply on Second Stage in the other House where he seemed to suggest that nothing like this has ever happened in the past 60 years and that therefore our fears are unfounded.  That may be so but there is a duty on us to ensure that adequate safeguards will be in place in the event of risks emerging.</P>
    <P>Let me put my query in the following terms.  Are there loopholes which will allow agents and others to get around the regulations and can we be satisfied that the funds of small investors will be fully protected?  Can we further be certain that all small investors will be protected if they invest with the principal parties who control investment vehicles &mdash; the trustees, the management companies and agents of both foreign and home based companies?</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with another matter which was raised in the other House but which the Minister did not respond to when replying to the Second Stage debate.  As I have not got a copy of the Official Report of the Committee Stage debate I find myself at a disadvantage in that I do not know whether that matter was satisfactorily disposed of at that stage.  Let me therefore put the following query to the Minister.  Given that the small investor may lose his <Col N="574" /> savings either through bad management or fraud on the part of anyone who manages and controls these funds, why is a provision on compensation not included in the Bill?  That responsibility could be vested in either the Central Bank or some other body who has a function to discharge under the Bill.  If the Central Bank are to be the regulatory authority why are they not to be held responsible if, for example, their judgment or regulations are found to be faulty and prove damaging to some of the investors concerned?</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to respond to the question of the fees to investors charged by management companies.  I understand each investor will have deducted from the sum invested a certain percentage to cover management charges. In legislation of this sort would the Minister not have been wise to insert the scale of charges perhaps to provide guidelines, or is there provision for him to do that?  What protection is there for the small investor against excessive charges being put on by those involved in the administration and management of the scheme?</P>
    <P>On the question of costs, what control rests with investors in relation to the level of profits retained or, so to speak, disposed of?  As far as I can see, this decision as to what is done with profits arising rests very much with the management company.  Therefore, if the management company wish to retain profits, for example to build up the funds, and if, on the other hand, at the same time the investors wish to distribute a greater share of the profits, then who adjudicates? Who resolves the situation at that point?</P>
    <P>There is an obligation placed on the management company to repurchase units at the request of the unit holders. Is there control of the level of charges, fees or deductions which management may charge?  If not, why not?</P>
    <P>I am raising a matter in a general way here because in the light of the Minister's response it may not be necessary to pursue it further.  The Minister in his speech has referred to the powers <Col N="575" /> retained under section 4 which will enable the Minister to direct that authorisation be subjected by the bank to specific conditions or requirements as long as these do not constrain the prudential supervision of a scheme by the bank.  Section 4 (2) provides for a review function being reserved by the Minister.  I know the query has been raised in the other House as to whether the Minister is transferring control and the regulatory functions from his Department to the Central Bank. Why retain this power, as it were, under section 4 (2) particularly to issue directions? I raise this matter simply to get clarification on it.  It may well have been dealt with on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  I do not share the fears that have been expressed elsewhere that it is wrong that the Minister should retain his power there.  Whether in relation to this or any other function of administration, I have always held the view that if a citizen, in this case a unit holder, is in difficulty with bureaucracy involved with the Central Bank, there is nothing wrong in providing a reserve to the Minister the power to intervene in those circumstances.  We all are politicians and we have to answer for our actions to the public.  On the other hand, bureaucrats do not have to do that. Therefore, I do not altogether share the reservations expressed elsewhere.  Nonetheless, the matter requires clarification and I am sure the Minister will provide that.</P>
    <P>Interest was expressed in the other House in having agents and intermediaries included within the provisions of section 4.  I do not believe the Minister accepted that and I would like to hear him in his reply to this debate give the reasons for that.</P>
    <P>A matter raised was the extension of the terms of the proposed legislation here to countries outside the EC.  I do not believe the Minister accepted that either. Therefore, what is the position if the legislation is confined in its application to Ireland and other countries of the EC? What protection and safeguards are there in relation to investment vehicles that <Col N="576" /> may have their base outside the EC and ourselves?</P>
    <P>By and large I support the thrust of the Bill before us, subject to clarification on the questions I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are legislating to put the EC UCITS Directive into law.  The main objective of the Bill is to update the provisions of the 1972 Unit Trusts Act and to set the way forward for future development concerning the whole operation and supervision of unit trusts.  It took 15 years for the Directive to be written and it is probably generally agreed that the past four or five years in particular have seen many significant changes in collective investment which necessitate the updating of the legislation. While the Directive has been successful in establishing a great deal of investor protection for the UCITS funds themselves, I am of the opinion that it probably falls short in the implementation of best advice by leaving marketing and selling regulations to member states and not covering all forms of collective investments.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</P>
      <P>The basic supervisory structure established under the 1972 Act has been very largely maintained under this Bill, the two obvious and main changes being the transfer of the supervisory functions from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Central Bank and more open or perhaps more flexible attitudes to authorisation.  Though I understand many people may not agree, I agree with the new role of the Central Bank in the monitoring and supervision of unit trusts. I feel we need a unified control in our financial services which are developing and to which we are giving a great deal of attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from my experience of the control of financial and deposit-taking institutions of some undesirable activities in recent years.  It is right and proper that we allocate responsibility very clearly and ensure that that type of responsibility be efficient and thorough.  Obviously we must ensure that savers' interests are protected at all times.  While many people, <Col N="577" /> somehow, are of the opinion that UCITS are for the small investors only my understanding is &mdash; and perhaps the Minister would confirm this &mdash; that there are many big players or investors in this area also. But, from the savers' point of view, large or small, it is important that unit trusts be allowed operate with freedom, to yield good returns on investments and, generally, be allowed an air of flexibility and freedom.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would comment briefly on section 3 which provides that the Central Bank establish and maintain a register of authorised unit trust schemes.  Any additional information the Minister can provide on that section I shall welcome.  In general I welcome the Bill which I believe will afford the public and investors' interests greater protection over the next decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I have to say that, whenever I detect consensus and unanimity about a Bill of this sort &mdash; especially when it is introduced in the run-up to Christmas before an empty House &mdash; I become a little suspicious. While there would appear to be no grounds for suspicion I do not think a Bill of this sort should be allowed go through the House without criticism and without examining the reasons for its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more I look at this Bill the more difficult I find it to accept not only its provisions but the principle behind it we are being asked to accept.  Whereas it sounds right that we should transfer unit trusts and other financial instruments and institutions to one authority, under one umbrella, whereas it sounds innocent that we should do so, we must question the reasons for so doing.  While I applaud any effort by the Minister or Government to bring our law with regard to financial services up to date and on updating the Unit Trusts Act, 1972, obviously necessary in the changing financial environment in which we live, we should be cautious.  I think that caution crept into the Minister's introductory remarks here today and in another Minister's remarks <Col N="578" /> in the Dáil when he mentioned the Financial Services Centre.  We should be cautious in that we should not necessarily adjust our law to attract those who are looking to Dublin as an attractive Financial Services Centre.  The word &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; in the Minister's introductory remarks &mdash; which I think appeared in another form in the words &ldquo;less rigid&rdquo; in the other House &mdash; means there are dangers in that we have not been able to balance the conflict between investor protection and the requirements of the Financial Services Centre here.  There are dangers in trying to render Dublin a particularly attractive financial environment in that there may be pressures to change rules, to loosen or take what is described as a &ldquo;less rigid&rdquo; approach to investors' protection.  That is a danger which is apparent in this Bill, not in the principle but in the practice behind it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's introductory remarks and the discussion in the Dáil were very short on information.  They were very short on how, in the past the Department of Industry and Commerce had treated the policing and regulation of the unit trust industry, which has grown from a very small base in the early seventies to just short of £1 billion.  That is not very large in terms of other financial instruments but is very large in terms of what it was.  I do not know what the Department of Industry and Commerce did, what the Minister's officials did in the last 18 years, to ensure that unit trusts were properly regulated.  I would be interested to know what practical steps, detailed and regular steps, were taken to examine this industry.</P>
    <P>Whereas the principle of the transfer to the Central Bank is a good one in that it is an attempt to put one more financial service under a single supervisory body, the Central Bank may prove to have been an unfortunate choice.  The Minister will correct me but I think the Central Bank administer the banks, the Trustee Savings Bank, the building societies and the Financial Services Centre and will now have unit trusts under their umbrella. If we accept that the Central Bank will regulate and supervise this industry we <Col N="579" /> should ask what is the record of their regulatory and supervisory authority over the other institutions they supervise.  It is not fashionable to criticise the Central Bank.  What I say is not necessarily the fault of the Central Bank but I do not think that the Central Bank have a proud record in their supervision of other institutions in this State.  Let me start with the Exchange Control Bill passed in this House only this week.  Basically the provisions of that Bill renewed exchange controls under the supervision of the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance announced that certain regulations were going to be lifted and relaxed.  My experience of exchange control &mdash; I hope the House will forgive me for talking about it in a personal way &mdash; really began in 1979 when the break with sterling was introduced.  It would not be unrealistic to say that that caused absolute turmoil in the financial markets because nobody knew how exchange control would operate; nobody was ready although it had been well signalled that this might happen; none of those who were in the financial markets was ready to impose exchange control or knew how it would operate.</P>
    <P>For those of us who had been delegated this authority by the Central Bank, as stockbrokers or bankers, there ensued an extremely unhappy and uncomfortable period during which we worked, to a large extent, in the dark.  That would be forgiveable and understandable; it would be understandable that the Central Bank were unable to administer this in that immediate context &mdash; which was the break with sterling &mdash; but, in the ensuring years, those exchange controls continued. For at least ten years &mdash; because as a stockbroker authority was delegated in me and in other stockbrokers &mdash; I recall having to impose those exchange controls on behalf of the Central Bank.  Certainly I was aware of the outlines and obligations imposed on me by the Central Bank in refusing people the right to exchange money in certain circumstances and in enforcing the rules of the Central Bank in having them repatriated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> What astounded me was that in that decade when the Central Bank imposed rigid exchange control, not alone was there never a prosecution for breach of exchange control but I can never recall the Central Bank once inspecting the books or having any sort of inquiry into breaches of exchange control.</P>
    <P>It is utterly unrealistic to expect that there were no such breaches, whether wilful or not.  It seems to me that the Central Bank was a totally inadequate body to impose those controls.  It simply does not have the staff or the resources or the department, to do this.</P>
    <P>In the area of banking also it seems that the Central Bank has not had a particularly happy history in recent years. Granted, it is impossible to discover where it has prevented difficulties, scandals, or collapses of banks.  It may well be that there are areas where banks have been in difficulty or have breached rules and have been drawn back into line by the Central Bank, but we have had unhappy experiences.  We have had the Gallagher experience all too recently and no warning of that; and, regrettably we have had no prosecution as a result of that.  That is something I regret, and that is not to the credit of the Central Bank. We have also had the collapse of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland &mdash; which indirectly was within the Central Bank's ambit in that it was wholly owned by Allied Irish Banks &mdash; which rocked the Irish banking system to its foundations.  It is not sensationalism to say that somehow, somewhere that should have been detected early.  There was no early warning system; there was certainly no early warning system that worked which gave AIB, and therefore the Central Bank, a warning that the whole banking system was in danger of a major catastrophe at that time.  Really, the buck stopped in that case as well with the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I am uneasy about the bland acceptance by this House, and all sides of this House, that it is a good idea to put unit trusts into the hands of the Central Bank. The Central Bank has not proved itself a good policeman of the financial services industry, maybe through no fault of its <Col N="581" /> own.  Had it been better equipped with that pool of expertise &mdash; as the Minister called it this morning &mdash; maybe some of these things could have been prevented. As it stands at the moment, I do not believe the Central Bank structure gives us grounds for confidence that the unit trust industry will be any better policed than any of the other industries it policed before.</P>
    <P>That is not a reflection on the unit trust industry.  I do not believe there is any suspicion of any wrong doing or danger or even impropriety in the unit trust industry.  The unit trust industry has up to now, as far as one knows, been impeccable in its behaviour and has not given rise to concern.  I would be interested in what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to say about this because his Department have been policing it in the past.  I am sure that, whether it has been policed effectively or not, the unit trust industry has always behaved in a manner which is above reproach and which is different, I suspect, from other areas of financial services in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to look for one moment at the sort of regulatory environment that exists in this country, and the sort of regulatory environment which we are trying to create in this Bill to impress overseas investors and to induce people to come to the financial services centre. The fact of the matter here is that we decided not to imitate the British Financial Services Act which was introduced in 1986 for reasons which I have never quite understood.  It has always, I think, been maintained by people in the financial services area that that particular Act was too rigid for Ireland, that we did not need and did not suffer from the sort of abuses that existed in the United Kingdom at that time.  That is debatable, but the fact that we have not suffered so notably and so obviously from these practices is a result of bad policing rather than non-existence of the offences for which the British Financial Services Act was introduced.</P>
    <P>The environment here into which this Unit Trust Bill is being introduced is one <Col N="582" /> with very few financial regulations.  It is one which is open to abuse and, undoubtedly, where there is a financial environment which is open to abuse, it is abused. That is the law of money, and it is the law of greed.  I regret that there are no strict regulations in this country of the sort that were introduced in the UK. We only have to look at the leak of the inflation figures last week which caused such a stir in financial markets.  One of the problems about this particular leak was that there was no provision for doing anything about it and no provision for investigating it.  It happened in an area hitherto unsuspected and unthought of as a primary area for abuse by legislators or those in charge of regulating financial markets.  Insider dealing was always thought to be restricted to equities and to individual companies in Ireland.  The possibility of a leak in the area of Government stocks, had not been imagined; and what would be done or who would be there to regulate it if there were to be a leak in the area of Government stocks had not been discussed.  I suppose it is fair to look at the reaction of the Government and the Stock Exchange to this and to ask about the regulatory environment in which we live.  Why should the Government have to order an inquiry into a leak of this sort?  Why is there no mechanism already established within the Government system and the Stock Exchange system for an inquiry into a leak of this sort?  It should not take an order from the Taoiseach in Rome to initiate an inquiry into a serious leak of price sensitive information. There should be a mechanism there for doing it immediately.  First there should be a mechanism to prevent it, which I think is there; but also there should be a mechanism within Government circles and within the Stock Exchange for looking at leaks and preventing them and for detecting the source of leaks and punishing those who have acted as a result of those leaks.  No such mechanism exists.  The financial environment in which we live is lacking.  The Stock Exchange, a self-regulatory body &mdash; which it should not be in a small city such as Dublin and a small country such <Col N="583" /> as Ireland &mdash; should have held an inquiry immediately that leak happened.  It seems utterly wrong to me that the Stock Exchange should leave it to the Government because the Stock Exchange is a self-regulatory body.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on both parties here to have an inquiry into a serious leak.  There is an obligation on the Government to find out if it came from a Government Department, and to prevent it happening again.  There is also a serious obligation on the Stock Exchange to carry out an inquiry to find out who dealt as a result of that information and whether they were insider dealing, and to take measures immediately to stop that happening.  There should have been two parallel inquiries.  The weakness of our regulatory financial environment is highlighted by the fact that the Taoiseach had to order an inquiry from Rome.  That is absurd and is something which I hope will never happen again.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question. For instance I am not suggesting that this happens but it is an important question which must be tackled &mdash; if a leak comes from, say, the National Treasury Management Agency, are they immune from prosecution?  Are public officials in the Central Bank immune from prosecution?  If so, this is a new area, a hitherto undiscovered and unthought of area which is protected.  This Bill is being introduced into a regulatory area which is totally inadequate.  It seems the Minister should look again not only at the Central Bank, which are so inadequate in their resources and expertise in this area, but also at all self-regulatory bodies, and consider bringing them under the supervision of one body, not necessarily the Central Bank.  It is simply unfair &mdash; I have experience of this &mdash; to ask the Stock Exchange in Dublin to police its own members.  That is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that under self-regulation the Stock Exchange has been unable or unwilling to convict anybody of insider dealing, and nobody suggests it does not happen.  That is one of the tragedies of self-regulation here.  It <Col N="584" /> should be considered.  It is not necessarily their fault; it is just that we live in a very small, incestuous financial environment whereby people who meet each other day in and day, out find it very difficult to police each other.  That kind of self-regulation must be looked at.  It is relevant because the Unit Trusts Bill is being introduced to some extent as a sop or a flag to induce foreign investors here.  We are putting the cart before the horse.  We are choosing unit trusts when it is not really necessary, when we should be concentrating on totally different areas.  I do not know enough about the insurance industry to make a comment on it but I suspect that industry also ought to be looked at and brought under the same supervisory umbrella, although not the Central Bank in their present form.</P>
    <P>There are other important areas which were touched on by Senator Howard and which were omitted from this Bill.  There is a real danger that the unit trusts area will be discredited by the fact that this Bill does not go far enough.  The lack of proper regulation in the financial services area means that anybody can call themselves investment advisers and put up a brass plaque anywhere in the country.  As a result, the public &mdash; no-one is more gullible than the Irish public who have a few bob in their pockets &mdash; are impressed by the title people carry and are very happy to part with their money.  I have seen this in action, and there have been very well documented cases of it.  The danger for this Bill in that context is that someone can set up as an investment adviser without being regulated by any body and can advise people to buy unit trusts.  By doing so he is piggy-backing on the goodwill of the unit trusts management, trustee and company.  It would have been an ideal opportunity, in the introduction of this Bill which is after all only piecemeal, for the Minister to tackle the problem of people operating in this unregulated environment in an unscrupulous way.  It would have been helpful if all those who set themselves up as advisers, consultants or whatever one wants to call them, in the financial world were regulated and had to work under <Col N="585" /> very strict rules, as is the case under the Financial Services Act in England.</P>
    <P>There are certain practices which ought to be outlawed here.  There are people setting themselves up in extremely plush offices, issuing very colourful, glamorous and impressive brochures and working on huge commissions. They can very skilfully separate people from their money, but they are not regulated by the law or by any self-regulating organisation.  This is a yawning gap which the Minister has failed to tackle and it is in danger of discrediting the whole financial services industry. There is no obligation on those who set themselves up as investment consultants or advisers to declare to those from whom they extract money for investment what commissions or benefits they are getting or what interest they have in the investment. That is a particularly dangerous area which, I gather, will be covered &mdash; I do not wish the Minister to take this as an out &mdash; by a 1993 European directive, but in the meantime with which apparently we shall have to live.</P>
    <P>They also practice a rather unethical method of code calling, ringing people up from a list, which is illegal in many countries.  This is thought to be a particularly pressurising way of extracting money from people.  There is no comeback for the people who part with their money, whereas in the self-regulatory Stock Exchange, with all its inadequacies, at least there is a compensation fund.  The insurance industry also protects its investors.  There are, and have been cowboys advertising openly and without restriction in a way which extracts money from people who are very vulnerable.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for those of us who are educated in the financial world &mdash; we are all so educated to a certain extent &mdash; and are suspicious of it to realise how extraordinarily vulnerable people with small sums of money are.  People who are not used to money and who inherit small sums between £10,000 and £20,000 have no experience in this world and do not know who to go to.  They do not know <Col N="586" /> the difference between a reputable stock broker and an investment adviser or consultant. They are impressed by the fact that people can advertise on the back of reputable newspapers and presume as a result that they are particularly good at what they are doing, honest in their endeavours and will give them sensible advice, but that is not the case.  Those people need protection but are not given it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a whole area in the financial services sector which is open to abuse, which is not regulated and which has been abused.  I have probably said enough on Second Stage although I will have some questions to ask the Minister on Committee Stage on the detail of the Bill, in particular about why ministerial powers are retained in it.  Senator Howard touched on that as well.  I am not certain whether it is a good or bad thing in the present circumstances to maintain ministerial powers on these regulations.  I do not understand why they are retained if the Bill is necessary and if there is trust in a Central Bank, which I do not share.  I will leave that until Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is necessary and indeed in many ways overdue.  It is an extraordinary development that almost £1 billion is invested in unit trusts in this country.  A very large percentage of that has probably been the investment of small shareholders although there is a substantial institutional element.  I would like to look at this very briefly from the point of view of savings of developing capital in this country.  As we have seen in some of the other Bills we have been looking at recently, one of the essentials we require if we are to have a continuing healthy economy, if we are to join, in economic terms, the stronger countries of Europe, is a healthy development of capital to encourage savings.  We suffer very much by comparison with most other countries in the amount of savings, and the percentage of savings, which people make out of their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> As Senator Ross implied, a large number of people do not have any particular financial experience or investment or financial advisers; they have sums of money to invest, perhaps small sums in themselves but very large to the individual concerned and, in total, amounting to enormous sums of money. In that regard there is a gap in our legislation to which Senator Ross has drawn attention.  One can always think of additional things one could add to a Bill or of other Bills which could be introduced. This Bill is, if anything, overdue partly because of the growth in trusts to date but also because of the likely growth for the future.  Even though we have 30-odd unit trusts here, it is still a minuscule development compared with the number and range which we are probably likely to have in the future, indigenous and, as the financial markets open, we will be exposed to the possibility, or opportunity, depending on how you look at it, of investing in the vast number of unit trusts in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. In some ways there will be an almost bewildering number of investments in various types of business, commodity, shares or geographical regions of the world.  Indeed, unit trusts can go down; there is no guarantee that because you put money into unit trusts it will automatically increase year by year unless there is a specific guarantee built into that particular trust, and even then there may be difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that there should be regulations and fairly comprehensive legislation.  Whether that legislation should be drawn up by a Government Department, the Central Bank or some other body is a very interesting point. The Central Bank in this country, by an large, have done a good job.  I would agree that their staff and resources should be very considerably increased.  Perhaps the devolution of their authority and requirement to carry out investigations where necessary and to have a closer involvement with the various institutions and markets which they are at present <Col N="588" /> charged with regulating should be made clear.</P>
    <P>Even in the United States where there is very comprehensive legislation regarding securities and the Stock Exchanges, the necessity for companies to produce information and many other requirements in relation to securities, trading and very detailed banking regulations, does not mean you can avoid financial difficulties.  The financial difficulties of the banks in the United States are far greater than any difficulties we have seen. Indeed, the Central Bank and the Government of the time did a magnificent job in the way they averted an extremely dangerous situation which could have become critical.</P>
    <P>If the Central Bank are to be the regulatory agency &mdash; this is the trend whether we like it or not and there are many good arguments in its favour &mdash; we must also take into account that we will have, effectively, a European Central Bank grouping.  It is important for our own Central Bank to have somewhat comparable powers and, I would argue, very considerable autonomy.  This is not a very new idea.  Until the early part of this century, less than 70 or 80 years ago, the Bank of England were an entirely autonomous, independent &mdash; indeed not long previously &mdash; private institution; yet right up to the 1914-18 war the Bank of England carried at least as much weight as the Treasury in the United Kingdom. The balance has tilted very greatly in the inter-war years and since the Second World War.  Now there is no doubt that the balance is moving steadily back towards the Central Banks.  This is a very major aspect and I am not altogether sure it is one that has received a great deal of thought or attention in this country, although there is evidence in this Bill that some people, at least &mdash; and the Minister obviously &mdash; are considering the implications of this trend.  I welcome the Central Bank's involvement.  I strongly urge that their entire position is reviewed and their staff and resources very considerably increased.  I welcome the Bill, and perhaps there will be a few more <Col N="589" /> points on the sections as we go through it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their remarks in relation to the Bill which were generally favourable and supportive. I will try to deal with some of the points that have been raised by a number of Senators.  Senator Howard expressed some concern about the position of small investors who were heavily reliant on the expertise and probity of the management company and the trustees.  The Senator asked why this Bill did not contain any arrangement whereby if a loss were sustained, the Central Bank, or some other agency, would make up that loss to such an investor.  We do not have those arrangements by and large.  It is really impossible to have such arrangements. Everybody who invests in any form of security necessarily takes some risk.  The purpose of this Bill is to minimise the risk but neither the Central Bank or any other supervisory agency can give a copperfastened guarantee that a loss will not accrue.</P>
      <P>Unit trusts are quoted daily.  They go up and down and reflect the value of the underlying securities which are invested in the trust.  If the securities fall, obviously the value of the unit falls and, therefore, the investor stands to incur some loss if he chooses to sell at a time when the unit price has fallen.  He cannot be guaranteed against that.  If a small investor wants an investment where the value of his capital, at least in nominal terms cannot fall, he would be better advised to put it in to a bank, savings certificates, a building society or something like that.  He may in inflationary times suffer a loss there, whereas in inflationary times he may make a gain if he is in equities.  That is the nature of the thing and it is not possible to guarantee people against losses.  It would be an intolerable and impossible burden if the State or any of its agencies were to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator raised the question of fraud causing loss.  There is some risk of that.  All I can say in regard to unit trusts is that they have been in existence as <Col N="590" /> authorised and supervised entities here for 18 years and we have not had any loss through fraud or otherwise.  That is a reasonably good record.  There is not any guarantee that it will not happen in the future.  If people are of a fraudulent frame of mind or intent, almost no form of supervision can prevent them acting fraudulently.  The best that a good supervisory system or authority can hope to do is try to pick up the fraud or recognise it as quickly as possible before substantial losses are incurred.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard queried the Minister's powers under section 4 (2) and asked why that residual power was retained.  It is retained because at the moment the only regulatory authority in regard to unit trusts is the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is being transferred, but I thought it prudent that I should retain some residual overall policy power of direction.  I emphasise that it would relate only to broader issues of policy and not to day-to-day prudential supervision or the things that make that up.  It is not unreasonable that somebody who is directly accountable to the Oireachtas might retain such residual power, because the Central Bank are a rather remote body who are not answerable to this House.  The Central Bank are independent under the various Central Bank Acts and it is no harm to have some level of accountability in these matters even if it is a relatively slight one and a residual one.</P>
    <P>The question of intermediaries was raised as was the question of the regulation of agents, for example, the people who nowadays describe themselves as investment brokers, but who are not recognised under any statute so far as I am aware, and have no organisation or professional body dealing with them.  I recognise that there is potential for difficulty in that field.  It has been recognised in Britain, and it is dealt with under the 1986 Act in Britain.  This is an area we will have to face up to.  I have spoken with the Minister for Finance about that, because I am concerned about it.</P>
    <P>We have now regulated insurance intermediaries very strictly for example. <Col N="591" /> Stockbrokers are regulated and the actual schemes, such as unit trusts schemes and UCITS, are now subject to relatively stringent regulation.  The one weakness in the whole chain is the non-regulation of those who act as intermediaries for these schemes between the principals in the schemes and the public.  If a loss occurs there, the investors have very little redress.  They only have redress against the person concerned or his company if he is a company.  I regret that there was a case of such a loss in the last month or two.  It has given rise to some concern. Happily, while the amounts involved are considerable for the small investors involved, the total amount is not great. It has to be a matter of concern that people have lost money due to the default of an intermediary of this kind.</P>
    <P>The appropriate Minister in all the circumstances to introduce legislation on this matter is the Minister for Finance. The time for that to be done would more appropriately be after the adoption by the Council of Ministers of the draft investment services directive which is before the council at the moment.  It is before the ECOFIN Council and is being handled there by the Minister for Finance. It is not before the internal market council.  Once that directive has been adopted it will be opportune for us to introduce legislation here which would have the effect of bringing the directive into effect in Irish law.  We could then use the opportunity to broaden the terms of the directive so far as our requirements are concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross spoke about some doubts he had with regard to the principles underlying this Bill.  I understood him to say he did not regard the Central Bank as necessarily being the be-all and end-all in so far as being a supervisory authority is concerned.  I agree that there were instances in the past where the Central Bank in regard to certain aspects of supervision may not have been all that was entirely desirable.  We can say that with hindsight.  I am satisfied that the Central Bank is no less qualified than my own Department in this matter.  Senator <Col N="592" /> Ross and others laid some emphasis on the necessity for resources, people and so on, in the Central Bank.  I mentioned this in the Dáil and immediately I drew a number of comments.  The Central Bank is in a far better position to recruit further expertise, as and when they need it, than are my Department.  My Department are strafed for numbers due to the embargo.  People in the supervisory area, particularly, are trying to cover a far wider area than, ideally, they should.  The Central Bank does not seem to suffer from this problem.  The Central Bank is independent as a monetary authority and seems to carry its independence in this respect far beyond what may have been in the mind of the Oireachtas when the legislation was passed.  I am not aware of any inhibition on the Central Bank on recruitment at present.  It is uniquely lucky in that respect.</P>

      <P>They do generate a substantial surplus.  If the surplus happens to be about £1 million less because they spent it on things they wanted to spend it on, apparently nobody can say boo to them.  I wish we were all in that position; that the poor over-worked Department of Industry and Commerce were in that position.  However, it is as well to accept the reality that whatever doubts or reservations one may have had in the past the Central Bank are in a better position now to act as a supervisory authority in respect of these matters.  It certainly makes sense to try and bring all these analagous forms of financial service under the same supervisory authority, otherwise there will be serious anomalies in the way in which schemes, unit trusts, UCITS, SICA Vs and so on are authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross made the point that we should not change our law just to suit financial services centre companies in Dublin and I agree with him.  At the same time there is a happy medium.  Shannon, which everybody forgets, has the same <Col N="593" /> rights as Dublin to promote these financial services but it is not used as much. In the establishment of the Dublin centre we would be very foolish if we did not in legal and supervisory terms put ourselves on roughly a level playing pitch with some of the other major centres.  If we had law that was entirely rigid and reflected the thinking on these products &mdash; as it was in the early seventies &mdash; then we would not be in a position to facilitate the setting up here of many companies and schemes of different kinds who would be free to go to other major centres, perfectly respectable centres such as Luxembourg. I take the Senator's point that we should not be falling over ourselves to change the law generally to get them to come here and we should not lose sight of the necessity to protect investors.  I hope this Bill meets the balance that needs to be struck.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross queried my use of the word &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; and I can understand that up to a point, because if you want to you could insinuate by the use of the word &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; that there was a certain flexibility of principle or whatever and that the principles could be bent in favour of individual companies.  I certainly hope the Central Bank would not do that.  It is not my experience that they have done so and if I thought there was any danger of it I would give them a direction under section 4 of this Bill not to do so.</P>
    <P>Senators would probably agree on reflection that a certain sensitivity &mdash; I use that word as opposed to &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;&mdash; to the changing nature of the products in the financial services area is necessary, otherwise we exclude ourselves from things that would be entirely beneficial to us.  It is no harm to have that sensitivity built in &mdash; as I think it is &mdash; to this legislation without losing the advantages of control and protection.</P>
    <P>Senators Ross, Conroy and others referred to certain things which happened in banks and insurance companies within the past ten years.  It may not be appropriate for me to refer to the detail of those incidents now but in the merchant banking case I have already expressed the view that I find it difficult to understand why <Col N="594" /> there were no prosecutions.  It was not a matter for me or for the Government, it was a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions but, for some reason that I cannot understand, he chose not to prosecute. It appeared in that case, from the report of the liquidator, that apart from matters relating to fraud and breaches of the law generally there were specific breaches of the Central Bank Act.  Why they were not prosecuted I am not clear. I do not have the Act in front of me so I cannot say whether the Central Bank can prosecute in its own name.  Whoever is the prosecuting authority under the Central Bank Act did not take prosecutions even though there appeared to be clear evidence of breaches of the main Central Bank Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>Some major amendments have been made to the Central Bank Act since the merchant banking case in 1989.  They have taken account of difficulties that came to light in that case.  The AIB-ICI affair which was referred to is one that is still so sensitive that I would prefer not to get into it because it is not yet over.  I did note with some interest that Senator Conroy complimented the Government and the Central Bank for sorting out what could have been a major banking problem. Senator Conroy said certain things &mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is why I highlight what the Senator said.  I have heard in my present capacity very strenuous arguments from another quarter to the effect that this had nothing whatever to do with banking or the banking industry.  For that reason I will not pursue this point any further.</P>

I know the Minister was requested in the other House to extend this provision to include bodies incorporated outside the EC.  I left the Chamber for a few minutes and perhaps the Minister dealt with this point in my absence.  If he did, I regret I was not here.

      <P>The question raised by Senator Howard does not seem to arise under section 3 which is simply confined to the keeping of a register of authorised unit trust schemes.  His question seems to arise under section 4 and perhaps we can deal with it when we come to that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague on this point.  Senator Howard's point relates to an amendment which was tabled on Committee Stage in the Dáil but which was not accepted by the Minister. We would have liked to have tabled a similar amendment today but we were aware of the futility of doing so in view of the day that was in it and the arithmetic <Col N="596" /> being what it is in this House.  The amendment tabled in the Dáil proposed that section 3 (1) should read as follows:</P>
      <P>The Bank shall establish and maintain a register of authorised unit trust schemes including such unit trust schemes managed by bodies corporate incorporated under the law of the State or any other member State of the European Communities or of any other State as may be authorised by the Bank in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</P>
      <P>The point raised by my colleague, Senator Howard, is that section 3 (1) should be amended to include the wording in that amendment.  Perhaps we could have the benefit of the Minister's wisdom as to why he felt unable to accept that amendment in the Dáil.  This reasonable amendment proposed extending the register of authorised unit trust schemes to schemes in any other state as may be authorised by the bank authorities in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 deals with the authorisation of unit trust schemes and their registration by the Central Bank. They are founded on the analogous provisions of the 1972 Act, as amended in 1977, to take account of our responsibilities in the Community.  They provide a suitable framework within which the bank can enforce their supervisory requirements or conditions as necessary in accordance with their powers under this Bill.  I would not be satisfied if these incorporation requirements were extended to allow incorporation in countries outside the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirements for the management company and trustee to be incorporated in Ireland or any other Community country are not likely to be objectionable to those who are seeking authorisation for unit trust schemes to operate in Ireland.  It would be very difficult for the Central Bank to supervise schemes registered in Liechtenstein, the Cayman Islands, the Netherlands, Antilles and <Col N="597" /> other favourite places outside the European Community.  We have direct access to those schemes which are registered in the Community and can exercise a control over them which we could not exercise over schemes in Liechtenstein, the Cayman Islands and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of those who are likely to want to establish unit trusts for sale or investment in this country will feel hard done by in being asked to register either in this country or in some other European Community country as the risks which would be involved otherwise would be too great for the investors.  I believe this provision is satisfactory. Questions may well arise in regard to the definition of the European Community. People forget that the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are not in the European Community.  However, I do not think that matter need concern us too much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a query with the Minister in regard to the powers being retained by him under section 4. I understood the Minister to say in his Second Stage reply that the powers being retained by him were of a general nature. Section 4 (1) provides that &ldquo;Upon application to the Bank in accordance with this section by the management company and trustee under a unit trust scheme, the Bank shall authorise the scheme if, but only if ...&rdquo;.  It seems to me that that provision will apply only to applications for a specific scheme.  Section 4 (2) provides that &ldquo;The Minister may direct the Bank to make any authorisation by it under this section subject to the imposition by it of conditions or requirements specified in his direction ...&rdquo;.  If I interpret the section correctly, the Minister will be able to give certain directions to the Central Bank in regard to an application made to them.  I think the Minister said the powers being <Col N="598" /> retained by him were of a general nature but from my reading of the section he will also have authority to intervene in regard to specific and individual applications. I have a difficulty in reconciling the two positions and perhaps the Minister will clarify this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously that is a question which will arise under this section. The difficulty with the section is that it had to be written in very generalised language.  It is peppered with words such as &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;, &ldquo;prudent&rdquo;, &ldquo;probity&rdquo;, &ldquo;competence&rdquo; and &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo;.  I understand why the section has to be written in that way.  I also understand that at the end of the day someone will make a judgment on that basis but I am not clear how this can be done.  Will the Minister be able to invoke the safety net powers being given to him under subsection (2) if he thinks the provisions in subsection (1) are not being complied with properly? I accept that it is not possible to specify this in the Bill but would the Minister give an indication of the requirements or conditions under which it would be appropriate for him to utilise the powers under that subsection so that we would have a pointer as to what his requirements might be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>In passing I wish to thank the Minister for the reply he gave on Second Stage.  It is very refreshing to find a Minister coming into the House to tackle the issues raised.  It is even more refreshing to find a Minister coming into the House to acknowledge that there is a problem, not sweep it under the carpet and give a bland answer such as &ldquo;yes, there is a problem and I will have a look at it&rdquo; to queries raised.  We are quite used to Ministers coming into the House to deny that problems exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only question that needs to be asked about section 4, in view of the fact that the purpose of the Bill is to transfer the supervisory role to the Central Bank, is why this power is being left with the Department of Industry and Commerce who have always held it?  This may be only a residual power but it is a power <Col N="599" /> nevertheless.  Having asked the Minister why it is necessary for them to retain that power I would like to ask him to indicate what their experience has been in the past in supervising unit trusts.  Is this procedure necessary?  By what procedure are they supervised or is it the case that they are supervised once every year or six years or have the Department just sat waiting for unit trusts to come up and hit them in the face with something?</P>
    <P>I do not know what the term &ldquo;supervision of unit trusts&rdquo; actually means.  I know what it ought to mean but I do not know what in practice it will mean or what the Central Bank are going to do about supervision.  Perhaps the Minister, who tackled this issue very well on Second Stage, might put pressure on the Central Bank &mdash; I presume he is capable of doing this &mdash; to allocate, if not employ, more staff and resources to the supervision of the bodies they are in charge of. One of the points the Minister did not respond to on Second Stage is why is it in all the time the Central Bank have been supervising exchange control there have been no breaches of exchange control. That is an extraordinary record and only implies that there have been no breaches.  I do not believe that and it appears that the policing and supervisory role of the Central Bank is seriously inadequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last point first.  The principal reason I did not deal with it on Second Stage is that in no sense, either now or at any time in the past, has the enforcement of exchange control regulations been a matter for me. I have no official knowledge of it and my Department tell me they know nothing about it.  The Senator complained that there have been no prosecutions.  I take his word for that as I could not say from my knowledge whether there have or have not.  It would be correct to say &mdash; the Senator may well agree with me &mdash; that there has been a lot of enforcement in the sense that people are penalised for breaches of the regulations, if and when they are discovered.  They may not be <Col N="600" /> taken to court as I think there is a provision under the Act whereby penalties can be imposed in the way the Revenue Commissioners do.  If, as the Deputy suggests, there has been little or no enforcement I would be surprised because many people go to great trouble to comply with the regulations and would not do so if the Central Bank were not constantly inquiring from them as to what the position is.</P>
      <P>I am not here to answer for the Central Bank.  I have no responsibility for them and have only very peripheral knowledge of what they do in this regard.  In so far as it would be a matter for any Minister, it would be a matter for the Minister for Finance obviously.  There is a substantial section within the bank which deals only with exchange control.  The need to be concerned about exchange control is one that is diminishing very rapidly because, as the House is aware, the Government, and the Central Bank, have decided, as a result of developments in Europe, that exchange control should gradually be run down.  That process has been in train for the past two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>By the end of 1992 it will have disappeared altogether.  Therefore, it is less important now than it might have been in the past.  The Senator's question is because he alleged the bank were not assiduous in enforcing this in the past, will they be equally lacking in determination to enforce certain other powers that are now being given to them? My answer to that is that I hope not.  It is very important that powers of this kind be thoroughly enforced in a determined fashion because if they are not people stand to lose.  Under the exchange control regulations it was the State who stood to lose rather than individual investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not to be taken as accepting that the Central Bank were other than vigilant in enforcing those regulations.  I am aware of no evidence that they were not. The only evidence adduced by the Senator today is that they did not bring <Col N="601" /> prosecutions.  One can enforce many laws without bringing people into court.  Happily, many people here, like in any other democracy &mdash; democracy by consent &mdash; are quite happy to obey the law because it is the law and are not obeying it simply because if they do not do so they will be hauled into court.</P>
    <P>In relation to subsection (2), I have been asked the question &ldquo;why?&rdquo; and my reply is &ldquo;why not&rdquo;?  That subsection empowers the Minister to direct the bank to make an authorisation under the section, subject to the imposition by it of conditions or requirements specified in the direction &mdash; being conditions or requirements which relate to such matters, which the Minister is satisfied, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank, do not constrain the prudential supervision by the bank of a scheme.  The bank are required to make authorisations subject to every condition or requirement so specified and such conditions or requirements would then form part of the bank's overall conditions for a scheme.</P>
    <P>The power this subsection gives to the Minister is entirely residual and non-prudential and for this reason it will be rarely exercised in practice.  The Minister's role, as envisaged in this subsection, is therefore purely precautionary but as a matter of principle it is important that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has this power.</P>
    <P>The Minister has responsibility for the provisions of Part XIII of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987 dealing with a particular form of investment company, variable capital companies or SICA Vs.  The Minister is also the sponsoring Minister in respect of UCITS authorised under the European Communities Undertakings for Collective Investment and Transferable Securities Regulations, 1989. These are analogous instruments.  It is proper, therefore, that the Minister should maintain some form of accountability and responsibility for unit trusts schemes to which this Bill relates.  If he has a legislative connection with SICA Vs and UCITS it would be very strange if he did not have a similar residual, even <Col N="602" /> though somewhat tenuous, connection with unit trusts which are in the same broad stable or family as SICA Vs and UCITS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is a need for accountability.  My question relates to how this is to be achieved.  The Minister interprets the phrase &ldquo;prudential supervision&rdquo; and he might decide to allow the bank to have an element of prudential supervision, according to his definition of that phrase, but it can only be interpreted in a given set of circumstances.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on the types of conditions and requirements he might impose.</P>
      <P>Section 1 contains a list of requirements by the Central Bank before giving approval.  Does the Minister envisage additional requirements or will he impose requirements because in his view those listed in section 1 have not been met? Could this arise in a case where the Minister might decide that the bank did not give adequate recognition to the requirements listed in the Bill?  On the other hand, might the Minister decide to impose some completely new requirements? Is the Minister trying to guard against new developments in this area or is he trying to guard against a lack of vigilance by the Central Bank under the terms of the subsection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole is wrong in saying that the Minister can determine the areas in which he can intervene or give a direction.  He can only intervene or give a direction in non-prudential matters and he must be satisfied that a matter is non-prudential after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  Therefore, both of those would in practice have to be satisfied also that the matter was non-prudential and they would have to give their agreement.  I would envisage broader policy matters or matters which go outside the scope of the Central Bank. It is not possible to define now every instance in which this might happen.  We are dealing with a developing situation, not a static one.  Things which cannot be <Col N="603" /> foreseen may arise in the future and it is valid that the Minister should have a residual power, provided it is not concerned with the supervision of the scheme from a prudential point of view.</P>
      <P>The Minister could give a direction if he deemed it desirable in the interests of consumer information and protection, for example, that a scheme's prospectus contain information of a particular nature which may not be of direct relevance to the Central Bank's responsibilities under the scheme.  I could see that situation arising.  It might relate, for example, to certain particulars being given of the management company or the trustee or of its directors.  This is immaterial from the point of view of the Central Bank as long as they know who they are, but the Minister might consider it desirable that the public should know too.  Another example is that it might relate to the manner in which the projected rate of return to a potential investor is given.  It might simply be a statement that the value of units may fall as well as rise, or it might relate to defining the degree of independence between the management company and the trustee to satisfy the requirements of section 4 (1) (d).  It may relate to particulars contained in the reporting requirements of a scheme, for example in the annual report.  The Minister is responsible for setting the legislative requirements in respect of a company's accounts and its annual report and he may deem it desirable that unit trust schemes follow a similar line in regard to the presentation of information.</P>
      <P>These are some examples that occur to me as of now.  Perhaps more important are instances which may occur in the future which one could not now foresee and for which some residual power should properly be retained.</P>

      <P>This section forbids advertising by unauthorised unit trust schemes. There is an exemption in cases of magazines and foreign newspapers having a small circulation in Ireland.  What is considered a small circulation?  I might mention a special interest magazine such as <i>Business and Finance</i>, which would have a very good circulation within the constituency at which it is aimed, but in the overall scheme of print media circulation it would be rather small.  What is meant by &ldquo;small circulation&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank will now determine it.  Apparently I must have determined it up to now, although I was not aware of it.  It was thought to be necessary in 1972 and it is equally necessary now in order that papers that would have a very small circulation here but would carry an enormous amount of information and advertisements on unit trusts should not be banned from this country simply because the unit trusts are not authorised for sale in Ireland under our law.  Advertisements of that kind in the United States often contain provisions to the effect that such offers are not valid in a state in which it is not legal to make the offer.  We need a general presumption to that effect, otherwise every time the <i>Financial Times</i> came in here those who advertised in it would be liable to some form of prosecution.  That would be unreal because in general the readers of that journal are capable of making up their own minds and are not likely to be misled by advertisements contained in it, nor is it likely to carry the kind of advertisement that might mislead <Col N="605" /> innocent small investors.  That paper would not print them.</P>
      <P>A financial journal printed and published in Ireland would obviously have to comply, even if its circulation was small and amounted to only 1,000 copies per month, but it would be easy for it to do so because it would only be producing the one edition.  One could not expect the <i>Financial Times</i> or <i>The Economist</i> to produce a special edition for such a tiny market as ours.</P>
      <P>We have had the same absence of difficulty over the years in regard to cigarette advertising.  Our laws in this regard are much more stringent than those in certain other countries, but there are provisions which allow journals with a small circulation to carry advertisements which would infringe Irish law if printed in Ireland.  It has not caused too much difficulty, which is also the case with the provision we are discussing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Turning to what the Minister said earlier about the quality of the support in his Department &mdash; and since one of the provisions of this Bill is to transfer responsibility from his Department to the Central Bank &mdash; is this just a clause inserted or does the Minister envisage certain expenses reverting to this Department arising from the implementation of the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad if one of the reasons the Minister felt the need for this Bill was that he simply did not have available to him, not so much the level of expertise &mdash; because he made it clear he does have the requisite expertise &mdash; but the amount of expertise in terms of personnel available to him.  Does it not really make a joke of public service cutbacks when a Minister <Col N="606" /> cannot undertake the work he or she wants to do?  We are here transferring authority or supervisory powers from one part of the State to another, from the Minister's Department to the only nationalised bank we have.  As the Minister said himself, we are not even entitled to recoup from the Central Bank its profits but rather must be content with this vague term of surplus on an annual basis, which is certainly a significant amount of money.</P>
    <P>What expenses does the Minister envisage arising from the implementation of the provisions of this Bill?  In addition, would the Minister not agree that it is somewhat ridiculous that he is being constrained from doing the work he would like to undertake because of public service cutbacks, perhaps also unable to offer a sufficiently attractive salary to people he would like to retain in his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I was not.  But I was, if you like, lamenting the lack of quantity, certainly not the quality, in my Department.  Of course, it is regrettable, all other things being equal, that I or any other Minister, does not have available to me as many people as one would wish in order to do all of the things one would like to do.  But we must also recognise the reality that we live in a country which has a public debt of £25,000 million, which pays out more than £2,000 million a year in interest alone on its borrowings; which has a debt/GNP ratio well in excess of 100 per cent, which unfortunately renders us almost unique in the Western world, or at least within the OECD member countries.  We must take account of that.  If one of the consequences of trying to come to grips with that huge <Col N="607" /> underlying problem is that all Departments have fewer staff than ideally a Minister or the Department would like, then unfortunately we have got to live with that fact.</P>
      <P>With regard to what expenses I envisage incurring under section 19, all I can say is that this section is invariably inserted in Bills of this kind in respect of which administrative costs might arise. Senator O'Toole asked me to speculate on what expenses will arise under the provisions of the Bill.  All I can honestly think of, in the short time at my disposal, is the possibility of hiring a removal van to take a lot of files from Kildare Street down to Dame Street and shunt them in there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to extend to the House the Minister for Finance's apologies at being unable to attend today to address the House.  He is, unfortunately, tied up <Col N="609" /> with other important business.  However, he has asked me to state that he will follow the debate with keen interest.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the annual Appropriation Bill is to give statutory effect to the Departmental Estimates for the supply services, both non-capital and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates that were voted and approved by the Dáil since the enactment of the previous year's Appropriation Act.  The 1990 Bill appropriates to the various services set out in the Schedule to the Bill, the sum of £6,620,550,000 comprising the Estimates totalling £6,452,222,000 as set out in the revised post-Budget Book of Estimates, Supplementary Estimates of £168,327,000 and £1,000 in respect of a 1987 excess on the Superannuation and Retired Allowances Vote.</P>
      <P>The Bill also authorises the use of certain departmental receipts amounting to £713,887,748 as Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The 1987 excess on the Superannuation and Retired Allowances Vote arose due to, firstly, an upsurge in voluntary retirements in the first half of 1987 arising mainly from the salary increase awarded to principals and assistant principals in the Civil Service which improved retirement lump sum payments and, secondly, because of the difficulty in accurately estimating the pattern of deaths among former officers and spouses which varies widely from year to year.</P>
      <P>These excesses were not offset by savings elsewhere on the Vote and even though there were additional Appropriations-in-Aid available which would have more than covered the excess on the Vote, these could not be used as an offset because a Supplementary Estimate had not been moved.  In accordance with established financial practice the committee of Public Accounts have examined and approved this excess Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A final important function of the Bill is to provide the statutory basis for calculation of the &ldquo;four-fifths&rdquo; issues which the Minister for Finance is authorised, under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965, to make from the Exchequer towards meeting the cost of next year's services during the period <Col N="610" /> before the Dáil has an opportunity to consider and pass the various individual Estimates.</P>
    <P>The occasion of the Second Stage debate on the Appropriation Bill also offers the Seanad an opportunity of discussing the wider economic developments which have occurred over the previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to be able to report to you today that 1990 has been another very successful year for the Government's economic and budgetary policies. Growth in output and employment has been strong, inflation has been low and further progress has been made in correcting budgetary imbalances.</P>
    <P>This year GNP growth is likely to be close to 5 per cent &mdash; broadly similar to the growth rate last year and again ahead of the expected EC average.</P>
    <P>While consumer spending increased by 5¼ per cent last year, some slowdown in the growth rate is indicated by the trend in retail sales in 1990 to date.  Nevertheless, personal consumption is likely to increase by about 3½ per cent this year.</P>
    <P>A major aim of the economic policies we have been pursuing has been to lower inflation and to keep the rate of increase in our costs in line with, or below, that of our trading partners.  In the period 1987-89, our inflation rate was kept down to little over 3 per cent on average &mdash; low by international standards.</P>
    <P>Before the Gulf problems arose our inflation rate had been brought down to just under 3 per cent &mdash; around the same as the rate in Germany and considerably lower than the high level then prevailing in the United Kingdom.  Despite the higher price of oil this autumn, we have managed to keep the lid on inflation.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware inflation fell again in November to 2.7 per cent and the average inflation rate for 1990 remained modest &mdash; at 3.4 per cent.  Our present inflation rate is the lowest in the European Community and lower now than the German rate.</P>
    <P>Investment is again performing strongly in 1990.  In the period to September this year, imports of capital goods were up an estimated 8 per cent in real <Col N="611" /> terms on the same period in 1989, a clear indication that business is continuing to invest.  Activity remains strong in the construction sector where Structural Funds are having an impact.</P>
    <P>This year industrial output has risen by just 4 per cent in the first eight months. The slower rate of growth has been most evident in the high technology sectors. The remainder of manufacturing, which includes the more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; sectors, has, however, maintained satisfactory growth.</P>
    <P>In 1988 and 1989 we had a balance of payments surplus of around 2 per cent of GNP and the surplus is being maintained this year despite having to pay more for our oil imports.  We are now clearly paying our way in the world.</P>
    <P>The most conclusive proof of the success of present policies has been the growth in employment.  The preliminary results of the 1990 Labour Force Survey indicated an increase in total employment of 30,000 in the 12 months to April 1990.  Since April clear evidence of further growth in employment has emerged: in the three months to June manufacturing employment, seasonally adjusted, increased by over 2,000, giving a net annual increase of 7,000.  Employment in the larger private sector firms in building and construction grew by 9 per cent in the first nine months of this year as compared with the same period of 1990.  There is also evidence that private sector services employment has grown strongly, particularly in tourism-related areas.</P>
    <P>Despite the gains in employment, unemployment is still a major problem. We expect an average reduction of about 7,000 in unemployment, as measured by the live register this year.  This is less than we had thought at budget time and reflects a slowing of emigration because of the deterioration in the UK and US economies.</P>
    <P>I think Senators will agree that the progress made in recent years in correcting the imbalance in the public finances has been nothing short of dramatic. Just four years ago, in 1986, Government <Col N="612" /> borrowing stood at nearly 13 per cent of GNP.  By the end of this year, borrowing will have been reduced to less than one sixth of this.  The EBR is now lower than it was any time within the last 40 years. The Debt-GNP ratio which rose by 41 percentage points over the period from 1980 to 1986, and stood at 131 per cent as recently as 1987, fell to 119 per cent at end-1989 and the expectation is that the 1990 figure will show a further significant reduction in the ratio.</P>
    <P>This year's budget represented a further step along the path of responsible financial management.  It was welcomed as a sympathetic and balanced response to the needs of those seeking jobs, of taxpayers and of the least well-off in the community, through a well thought out package of measures.</P>
    <P>In particular, the budget made a significant further reduction in the burden of personal taxation, so as to improve incentives to work and facilitate pay moderation; reduced VAT and other indirect taxes so as to bring our rates closer to European levels, and to help keep inflation down; continued the fundamental reform of the corporation tax system, initiated in 1988; further developed the self-assessment system by placing self-employed taxpayers on a current year basis; provided for a 5 per cent general increase in all social welfare weekly payments with a further supplement for the long term unemployed; gave special assistance to those on low incomes, by exempting from PRSI contribution employees whose gross earnings were £60 or below a week, and by increasing the general exemption limits for income tax and the child addition to these limits.</P>
    <P>These measures in conjunction with the steps taken in 1988 and 1989 not only met the commitments given by the Government in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, but actually went further in many respects.</P>
    <P>Looking at budgetary performance this year, I am glad to say that for the fourth year in succession the indications are that Exchequer borrowing will come in below the budget target.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> The buoyancy of tax revenue is once again the main contributory factor to the good budgetary performance this year. Corporation tax revenues are well ahead of expectations and PAYE receipts are also set to come in ahead of projections.</P>
    <P>Corporation tax receipts indeed could end up over 50 per cent above the budget estimate.  This reflects the introduction of self-assessment for companies as well as the cumulative effects of the changes made in the corporation tax regime over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The improvement in PAYE receipts reflects the impact of better collection from employers and a better employment performance than had been expected at budget time.  At that time the expectation was that non-agricultural employment would increase by 16,000.  In fact, present indications suggest that the actual figure could be over 20,000.</P>
    <P>As evidenced by the sum of over £168 million in Supplementary Estimates included in this year's Appropriation Bill, there will be some overruns on the expenditure side of the 1990 budget. However, let me say at once that the figure of £168 million in Supplementary Estimates overstates the position somewhat and should not be viewed as indicating a loss of control on expenditure on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>Some £70 million of the total provision for Supplementary Estimates arising on the Second and Third Level Education votes relates to the possibility that timing factors relating to the receipt of EC ESF aid might result in a failure of these receipts to materialise this year.  These supplementaries are therefore precautionary in nature and were moved to avoid the possibility of major excess Votes if the ESF receipts do not come in until next year.  The expectation is that this money will come in in 1990 and the authority to spend more, conferred by the Supplementary Estimates, will not in fact be required.  This coupled with offsetting savings on other Votes in 1990 which of course do not show up in the Appropriation Bill will ensure that the actual expenditure overrun this year will be considerably lower than the £168 <Col N="614" /> million suggested by the Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    <P>Despite these overruns and the prospect of a shortfall in EC receipts generally this year, mainly, down to timing factors, the improved tax revenue receipts will compensate, with the effect, as I have said, that the budget target should be bettered for the fourth year in a row.</P>
    <P>As Senators know the 1991 Abridged Estimates Volume and Summary Public Capital Programme were published on 7 December last.  The later than usual publication of the Estimates this year stems from the difficult task which faces the Government on the expenditure front in 1991, and the painstaking and detailed way in which the Government set about the job of determining the Estimates, line-by-line, so as to keep expenditure at its lowest practicable level in 1991.</P>
    <P>A number of factors are putting upward pressure on expenditure in 1991, such as the £100 million carryover cost of this year's budget welfare increases, the need for us to spend more on programmes attracting EC Structural Funds, and the carryover cost of sanctioned special pay increases.  Despite having to provide for these factors, the Government managed to restrict the increase in the provision for both non-capital spending and total Exchequer-funded expenditure, current and capital, in 1991 to 4 per cent, marginally above the projected inflation rate for next year of about 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Government have found that a policy based review of spending programmes followed by a detailed line by line analysis of spending demands is an effective approach to expenditure determination and this is how they approached their task this year also.  For the 1991 campaign, the Expenditure Review Committee were reconstituted and their recommendations were considered in the autumn along with the detailed spending bids from Departments.</P>
    <P>As in previous years, the Government's approach in settling the Estimates was firmly based on the principle that there must be continuing constraint on <Col N="615" /> expenditure.  Allocations for 1991 were allowed to increase only where there were decisive economic or social arguments for it.  As the Minister for Finance stated in the Dáil on the Estimates &ldquo;take note&rdquo; motion, public spending is, and will remain, under firm control.  The Government intend to review the published Estimates allocations before budget time to seek out further reduction possibilities in the light of the emerging outturn figures this year and the changing domestic and international economic environment.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the small increase in spending in 1991 is partly due to the need for us to spend more in order to draw down our EC Structural Funds aid.  The Structural Funds now have an important influence on our spending and investment programmes. Already nine of the operational programmes under the Community Support Framework for Ireland have been approved and the remaining three programmes, rural development, vocational training infrastructure and training of trainers, and Objective 4 &mdash; occupational integration of young people &mdash; are expected to be approved shortly.  The commitments to Ireland under the funds for 1991 will amount to almost 767 MECU or £591 million, an increase of 21.5 per cent over the commitments relating to 1990.</P>
    <P>Monitoring of the implementation of the Community Support Framework is vitally important and the Government are devoting considerable resources to it. Monitoring committees at both the CSF and operational programme level are operating well.  An extensive range of instructions on monitoring and reporting has now been sent by the Department of Finance to all lead Departments responsible for implementation of programmes or measures.  The commitments mentioned above do not take account of the additional funding which has yet to be allocated to Ireland under the new Community initiatives.  The full list of initiatives and the resources to be devoted to each have now been decided by the <Col N="616" /> Commission.  There are 12 initiatives in all, of which ten are applicable in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The member states have six months from the publication of the approved initiatives in the Official Journal of the European Communities to submit programmes. Only three of interest to Ireland have so far as reached this stage: the others are still at the discussion stage. Our ENVIREG programme, which deals with measures to combat pollution in coastal areas and toxic waste management, has already been submitted to the Commission and is being discussed with them.  Our programmes under STRIDE, which deals with science and technology, and INTERREG, which deals with cross-border development and which we are preparing jointly with the Northern Ireland authorities, will be submitted early in the new year.  We are continuing our negotiations with the EC Commission on these new initiatives to ensure that the maximum possible share of aid is obtained for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead to next year there are many reasons why 1991, more so than recent years, will prove to be a difficult one on the budgetary front.  The difficulties are evident even from the published Estimates figures.  Given that we have to provide for special pay increases, a new general pay round and welfare improvements it is clear that there will be very limited room for manoeuvre next year.  It is absolutely critical that we remain on course to achieve our medium-term goals in relation to the public finances and the debt-GNP ratio.</P>
    <P>It is imperative, therefore, that the successful policies we have been pursuing on the economic and budgetary fronts are maintained and built upon.  The Government's task will be to continue to foster confidence in the Irish economy by the firm pursuit of sound economic and fiscal policies.  I commend the Appropriation Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for his presentation, but his rosy slant on the state of the nation's economy is not reflected by the outturn in many of the Departments.  The main problems of <Col N="617" /> unemployment, emigration and long hospital waiting lists in practically all specialities, together with last night's announcement that the Minister has decided to increase the charges for hospital care by 25 per cent, do not reflect what the Minister said this afternoon. The Appropriation Bill gives us an opportunity to look very closely at the state of the economy.  While I would not like to give the impression that I am taking a very negative view of the achievements of Government policies, nevertheless there are significant areas where we would hope to see improvements.  We hope that in the budget the Government will avail of the opportunity of redressing these matters.</P>
      <P>In the Estimate for the Department of the Environment £580 million has been provided for supply grants.  I would like to mention a few areas to which those of us engaged in local government would like the Minister for Finance to pay attention. As regards infrastructures, in practically every county the standards are rapidly falling.  In my constituency the road infrastructure is deteriorating and there has been no housing programme for the past three or four years.  I am availing of this opportunity to make a very special appeal to the Minister for Finance to consider the allocation under the HA5/84 programme for special housing categories.  The Government should read the latest statistics published.  They indicate &mdash; I am sure they will be borne out by the next census &mdash; that by the end of the century there will be a significant increase in the number of retired persons here, almost an 80 per cent increase over the 1984 figure.  Yet in the counties with which I am fairly familiar the housing stock, and the provision of housing, is not keeping pace with the demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last few years there has been a significant response from a large number of voluntary housing associations across the country to the section 12 housing programme.  As a person with a very keen interest in this area I note that the loan facility, which in 1985 was 80 per cent of the capital cost of housing, has been reduced to about 60 per cent.  That means <Col N="618" /> the voluntary housing organisations have the impossible task of raising the shortfall between the cost of the housing and the section 12 loan that the Department of the Environment provide via the local authorities.  Unless the present ceiling of £20,000 per unit is increased to about £30,000, most of these housing associations will not be able to provide the excellent community service they have been providing over the last number of years.  Since the local authorities are not involved in the house building programmes to the same extent, as they had been for the last 20 or 30 years, it is important that local initiatives be supported.</P>
    <P>I make a very special appeal to the Minister to increase in next year's budget the allocation to about £30,000 per unit. Local authorities must be given the finance to carry out that special housing programme, which is of great importance to many elderly people living on their own.  The community care programme adopted by all these voluntary housing associations is of the greatest importance.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme for decentralisation should be extended to the Department of the Environment, the ideal Department for decentralisation as their work is spread across the 27 county councils and many borough councils.  I ask the Minister, and indeed the Government, to consider 100 per cent decentralisation in the Department of the Environment.  That would release the Custom House which would make an ideal museum because it is one of the classic buildings in the city which rose, phoenix like, from the ashes.  It is a very historic building.  As Dublin will be the cultural city of Europe next year, why not mark the occasion by transferring the museum, which is greatly restricted for space to display artefacts to full advantage?</P>
    <P>The space in Government Buildings could be adequately used by the Houses of the Oireachtas, especially if we expand the committee system in a fashion that is required.  Because of the changes in Europe and with 1 January 1993, coming closer, we need to be prepared and to <Col N="619" /> have a committee system that will be able to take the workload so that we will be able to monitor the situation and have an input.  Unless our Minister and civil servants who are servicing the committees and study groups in Europe have an input to these policies there is no use talking about democracy.  They should be able to convey the situation as perceived by the public, to the Ministers of the day.</P>
    <P>In approaching the next budget I ask the Minister to look with progressive eyes at our prison system because it is of the utmost importance that we assess and reassess the role the prisons are expected to play.  For a number of years I have had the onerous task &mdash; and honour &mdash; of being a visitor to the prison in Portlaoise. When I went there first I did not have much sympathy for the inmates, but when I looked deeper at the problem, no matter what the prisoner is detained for, I realised there should be a greater element of rehabilitation.  At least we should be able to demonstrate that we are a Christian society, that there is such a thing as forgiveness, that the ambience of the place should lend itself to demonstrating and trying to seek out the good that is in all of us.  I would like to see greater resources being allocated to the prisons.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government, and indeed successive Governments, on the design, excellence and facilities provided at the new Wheatfield Prison.  Perhaps we could embark on a programme of prison refurbishment that would bring all our institutions up to that standard.  The main criteria should be that no matter what the category, there is clearly be a policy of rehabilitation and improvement and greater educational facilities.  The living conditions, especially in the lounges, television rooms and recreation centres, should be designed to be more like a home than the austere, drab places they are.  I am sure that in the coming year we will have an opportunity to develop that particular theme further but it is an area that has been neglected for far too long.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is an industry that touches <Col N="620" /> the homes, pockets and lives of a high percentage of people.  Listening to the Minister's speech this afternoon, one could be pardoned for thinking that everything was rosy in the agricultural economy and in regard to agricultural incomes.  It is far from that.  Even the Minister for Agriculture and Food admits that there has been an 8 per cent reduction in agricultural incomes this year, whereas Teagasc say the reduction in incomes is 30 per cent and farm organisations place it at 40 per cent.  That is alarming and it reflects badly on the policies of the present Administration.  I hope the Government are aware that their policies, good, bad or indifferent, are just not working.  One cannot say to a white collar, a blue collar worker or a worker in any other sector, that they will have to take an 8 per cent or 30 per cent cut in income this year.  That is just not on and we must get away from this attitude in the agricultural area as well.</P>
    <P>The Government seems to have set their face against utilising the European system, utilising the facility of the disadvantaged areas scheme which would appear, having regard to the swings and changes in the VAT negotiations and having regard to the entire trading patterns not only in Europe but in the world, to have lost the initiative in adapting the opportunities offered to benefit the widest possible percentage of farmers in this country.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Fine Gael Party for some years has been that the entire country should be classified as less severely handicapped and then we would be able to confer a higher designation on the significantly poorer areas so that the people who are most acutely affected and most severely disadvantaged by virtue of the land or their situation would be able to benefit to a greater extent from the facilities that the European Community is providing and has budgeted for.  If I may speak as one elected on the agricultural ticket, we have certainly entered a very difficult and uncertain period. There has been a reduction in the price of milk this year and a continuation of that policy is promised for next year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> The position of the beef industry is absolutely tragic.  We can easily produce the best quality, most palatable and succulent beef in the world.  We have been subjected to accusations with regard to additives and implants and this has caused a lot of unease and uncertainty among consumers.  There has been a reduction in the consumption of beef despite the fact that Irish beef, by most standards, is way ahead of anything available throughout the world.  The Department and the Minister for Agriculture must be aware of the problem.</P>
    <P>Animal disease is something which has been hamfistedly handled.  The regulations introduced over the last six or eight months will not make one bit of difference to the system or to the health of the national herd.  A lot of money has been squandered in this area and the results do not bear comparison to the cost.  If a scheme does not produce the results why can the Department not take stock and bring in a new scheme with radical changes to try to tackle the problem? It is not good enough to allow the farming economy to dwindle so much so that there is very little return for the amount of energy and money invested in farming.</P>
    <P>The Department and the Government have been negligent, having regard to the uncertainty created about the Sugar Company.  The Sugar Company should have been refinanced and given an opportunity to serve the public.  The organisation is capable of making a greater contribution to the national economy. They need Government support and financing to allow them to do that.</P>
    <P>It has been a disastrous year for agriculture. I hope the Government will take a lead in future.  The reduction in State aid to agriculture is frightening.  It is unfortunate that at a time of difficulty we are witnessing such a drastic downward trend in support to this industry which is responsible for such a high percentage of our GNP.</P>
    <P>There is much dissatisfaction in relation to education.  People expect a greater and more professional approach from the Department of Education.  Last <Col N="622" /> September three or four schools in my area were amalgamated and I was horrified to find that the schools opened without adequate toilet facilities for the influx of girls.  There does not appear to be any forward planning in the Department of Education.  That is a poor reflection on 70 years of self Government.  The fact that things are expected to happen overnight places too much strain and responsibility on the shoulders of voluntary committees who are almost expected to work miracles when it comes to providing services even in areas of education which we would expect to be controlled completely by professionals if we are to give the next generation any worthwhile opportunity in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I understand that agreement between the Whips is that we should have a very cursory debate on this important Bill because we will have an opportunity early in the new year to go into the entire appropriations-in-aid account, when the House is recalled.  I take this opportunity to wish Senator Reilly and my colleague, the Minister, the compliments of the season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House as an extremely able Minister who is always welcome among us. The Minister was previously a Senator and he has excelled himself as a Minister in the last Government and in this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion on this Bill gives us an opportunity to assess Government performance and to note in particular the striking turn about in the economy since 1987.  One can only fully comprehend the scale of our achievements if we look back at the economy in 1987 before the Government's programme was put in place.  The crisis facing the country at that time demanded a decisive response if disaster was to be avoided, a response in terms of a soundly based strategy to achieve stability and to regenerate the economy.  That response commenced <Col N="623" /> with the negotiations with the social partners and the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  Senators will recall that the objective was to achieve strong and sustainable growth in employment.  The key element was fiscal discipline, pay moderation and a suitable exchange rate for the Irish pound within the EMS.  These policies improved our competitiveness and brought about a reduction in our interest rates.  Throughout the programme we have had a disciplined adherence to the basic tenets of the programme, so much so that at long last we have restored credibility to fiscal and monetary policies for the first time in many years.  Credibility was achieved as a result of consensus and because the policies laid down by the Government were realistic and attainable.</P>
    <P>Over the three year period of the programme we have seen real growth in GNP.  There have been significant reductions in the Exchequer borrowing requirement and in the ratio of the national debt to GNP.  Employment has grown by 40,000 in three years up to last April.  This year the budget target was for 16,000 new jobs.  I understand that we will surpass the target and will attain 20,000 new jobs.  That is no mean performance.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> progressed until private sector non-agricultural employment increased by over 70,000 persons.  This improved employment is particularly welcome, representing as it does the beginning of success in the long battle to defeat unemployment, which is central to all our fiscal and economic objectives.</P>
    <P>It is important at this time to have a look at taxation and to see what has happened in that area.  Under the programme, tax reductions to the cumulative figure of £25 million were promised.  What has happened over the last three budgets is that the reductions will be in excess of £800 million &mdash; that is more than three times the programme commitment. Both the standard rate and the top rate of personal taxation have been reduced <Col N="624" /> by five percentage points.  The proportion of taxpayers in the higher rates have been reduced and the tax exemptions have been increased significantly.  I suggest these tax reductions, combined with low inflation, have enabled living standards to improve even with moderate pay increases.  As a result, over the duration of the programme a single person earning an average manufacturing wage will have gained an increase of 9 per cent in real take-home pay.  That is significant when you consider what inflation has been over the intervening period.  The reduction in the VAT rate from 25 per cent to 23 per cent and other excise rates shows that there has been a consistent improvement in overall taxation reductions.  This is something everybody has called for.</P>
    <P>I would like to expand further on a number of areas we are looking at in a cursory way at present.  I would like for a moment to have a look at the IDA and their role.  I compliment the IDA on the manner in which they have been successful in attracting industry to this country given the fact that we are on the periphery of Europe.  The IDA have identified niches which transgress our peripherality; they have pinpointed the electronics industry, the computer industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the health care industry as well as the financial services sector.</P>
    <P>Any company looking at Ireland as a possible location would realise straight away that we have an extremely young population, a population that is also very well educated, something which has tremendous advantages for any company wishing to set up here.  Another advantage we have in Ireland is that the 10 per cent corporation tax has now been extended to the year 2010.  If one looks at the economic parameters, with low inflation, low interest rates, a cut in industrial costs and, most important of all, industrial peace, one will see this is a good region in which to base an operation.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one thing that bothers me at this time and that is our graduate output.  There is a suggestion that because we are relatively new in the industrial sector we have never <Col N="625" /> developed what one would call entrepreneurial flair and that there is a shortage of top management.  The IDA have pointed out that in the next ten years there is a possibility that we will have a real shortage not alone in top management but in middle-management, in graduates with the relevant skills and also top technicians and shop floor operatives. If we are short on top management skills, <i>ergo</i> that top management will not be able to provide the jobs required at the lower levels.  This is something we should look at seriously.  In many respects Intel has brought home to us the present difficulties; that they are now in a situation where they will talk about immigration rather than emigration and they are looking beyond this country to bring back the expertise we had exported previously to meet the needs and demands of their operation.</P>
    <P>In relation to graduates, a recent survey has suggested that by 1995 the number of computer science graduates which will be required on an annual basis in Ireland will be 1,050; at present my understanding is that we are producing roughly 240, which is about one-quarter of the demand.  That is serious for us as a nation, it is serious for our third level institutions, it is particularly serious as well for FÁS as a training agency and it is something that will have to be looked at immediately.  If you look at the electronics sector which is the major growth sector you will find that the survey again shows that we need 630 graduates per year, my understanding is that we are producing 175, one-third of the need.</P>
    <P>We need to look again at the role of education, training, co-operation and coordination required between the Department of Education and the Department of Labour regarding future manpower skills.  I am aware &mdash; and I will be parochial for a while &mdash; that in Cork we could have a waiting list for a computer-related course in FÁS of 300 to 400 people.  In the centre, two 26-week courses are run in the year producing 60 trained technicians at the end of the period.  I wonder whether there should be greater liaison between FÁS and the <Col N="626" /> educational establishments who have computer expertise available to them during summer periods when use could be made of the available facilities and which have not up to now been put into use.</P>
    <P>I would also like to look at the role of the IDA versus the local authorities. There is no doubt in anybody's mind that we will need to have a national overseeing agency.  In the White Paper on local authorities produced in 1972 it was stressed that local authorities were a development agency.  Frequently I find that local authorities and the IDA are competitors.  I will give an example.  Not too many years ago in Carrigtwohill, in County Cork, the IDA and the local authority had sites available.  The council property was more attractive to the incoming enterprise.  A price was quoted, yet the following day the IDA underquoted that price.  In that case we had two State agencies vying with each other to attract the business. It makes sense that the local authority, which is a planning authority and produces development plans for five to seven years, takes into account demographic trends, and makes practical decisions based on centres of population in towns.</P>
    <P>Why are local authorities not given distinct functions to those of the IDA? Would it not make more sense to tell the IDA it is their function to grant aid companies setting up in Ireland and that it is the responsibility of the local authorities, who have development plans, who are aware of the amenities and infrastructure in their areas and who know where planning permission can be given, to tell industrialists where they can and cannot go?  I want to expand further on this point and if I am parochial, I ask the House to forgive me.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council took a decision to set up two satellite towns, one in Carrigaline, which has a population of 10,000 at present, and the other in Ballincollig, which has a population of 15,000.  The IDA have not put any significant industries into those areas since that plan was brought into being and the population in both towns is set to rise by <Col N="627" /> between 10,000 to 13,000 over the next ten years.  If the IDA do not put industries into those areas over the next two years difficulties will arise.</P>
    <P>The policy of the IDA to set up industries in the major areas of population only continues the problem of emigration which bedevils this country.  If the decision to locate an industry was left totally in the hands of the local authority, I believe local councillors would use enough pressure to ensure that suitable sites were identified in the areas designated for major population growth. I ask the Minister to bear this point in mind when he is reforming local government. I believe that instead of co-operating with each other these two bodies are in many instances going against one another.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty understanding the close relationship between education and training in FÁS and where they overlap. It would appear from recent IDA projections that foreign industry will be of major significance over the next ten years.  In January the IDA launched a programme for the creation of 100,000 new jobs for the manufacturing industry over a five year period and it is expected that jobs created by foreign industries will account for 45,000 of these.  If the IDA can tell us that 45,000 new jobs are expected to be created over the next five years by foreign industries then surely it should be within our remit to anticipate the demands of those industries in the electronics, computer, pharmaceutical and medical areas.  I believe much work could be done co-ordinating our response to the likely demands of these industries.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred to local authority housing.  I think everyone accepts at this stage that there is a difficulty in local authority housing.  Two years ago we could not give away houses in Dublin, Cork and many other cities but suddenly there was a difficulty in this area.</P>

      <P>When one county council were asked by the Department of the Environment to report on local authority housing it was indicated that there were 64 acute cases on the waiting list.  However, the report produced by the county manager last week showed that there were only 25 acute cases and that many people had been housed.  I believe there is a need for a further housing programme.  We have asked the Minister on many occasions to ensure that there will be some housing development in our area next year and I am confident that such a housing programme will be introduced.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the cost factor in local authority housing.  I remember when three bedroomed local authority houses cost between £27,000 and £30,000 and one could buy a three bedroomed private house for £24,000.  Obviously times have changed and house prices have increased. Perhaps local authorities should consider buying private dwellinghouses in an effort to save money and to help social integration.  If they bought more private sector houses they could help integrating local authority tenants into private housing estates.  I believe this concept is well worth considering and I ask the Minister to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator O'Keeffe has amply demonstrated, the debate on the Appropriation Bill has become more in the nature of an Adjournment debate than a debate on appropriations.  Perhaps that is not a bad development.  Despite my remarks during his contribution &mdash; I apologise for interrupting &mdash; I have to agree with much of what the Senator said in regard to the difficulties being experienced in his area.</P>
      <P>The first thing which struck me when reading the Appropriation Bill is the provision of £1,000 for superannuation and retired allowances for the year ended 31 December 1987.  I do not know the reason for this provision but I remember having rows about pensions during the year. Vote 18 includes, among other things, extra-statutory pensions, allowances and gratuities.  I should like the Minister to explain precisely what those extra statutory pensions are, for whom they are, who gave them, how they are distributed and who makes the decision on them.</P>
      <P>I am interested in this Vote because we recently passed legislation on pensions and superannuation for teachers. At that time I made the point that many of the statutory requirements of the pension regulations have been ignored.  I am not for one moment saying that these extra statutory pensions are illegal &mdash; they are probably for some group who are not covered by legislation &mdash; but I ask the Minister to identify who they are for. The figure of £1,000 is of importance to me because I am firmly of the view that the extra costs incurred under the heading of superannuation in 1987 were incurred illegally.  I have stated that in this House before.  That scheme was introduced even though the regulations covering public service and teachers' pensions required the agreement of both Houses of the Oireachtas before being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year I ask a question on the Vote for the secret service but I have yet to get <Col N="630" /> an answer.  A sum of £170,000 is being allocated &mdash; I am concerned about our secret service &mdash; and I would like to know where this money is invested.  I acknowledge that the Book of Estimates last year gave an indication of where a small portion of the money allocated was spent but, without mentioning names, I would like to know where the money was spent and through which channels was it directed. It would be extraordinary if the £170,000 supports some kind of foreign service &mdash; I presume it does not &mdash; but I would like to know where it will be spent and on what.</P>
    <P>Vote 27 is for first level education.  In that Vote no attempt was made to meet, either in this document or in the Estimates, the costs of implementing the recommendations put forward by the primary education review body.  It is remiss of us not to deal with that matter.  I had hoped to see a much larger sum of money in this Vote.  As everybody is aware we have the worst pupil-teacher ratio in Europe, the most overcrowded conditions and, in many cases, an extremely small sum provided for building at primary level.  It annoys me no end that the provision for building at primary level is being reduced this year from £15 million to £13 million.</P>
    <P>The question of education and training, which was referred to by a previous speaker, should be addressed.  There is a need to amend the Treaty of Rome which is being considered by Governments at Intergovernmental Conferences.  The only place in the world where a distinction is made between education and training is in the Treaty of Rome.  The reality is as the Minister is aware, that the European Community is not entitled to direct money towards, invest money in or provide money for education but it can do so for training.  As a result we have witnessed educational authorities, departments and colleges applying contortionist techniques in trying to define the difference between education and training.  It has not worked.  Forces were at work in the early fifties when the Treaty of Rome was signed to ensure that the State, and in particular Europe, did <Col N="631" /> not get too involved in education and it was kept at home.</P>
    <P>We have long grown out of that attitude and brought many things into line. It is now time that the distinction between education and training was abolished.  No distinction should be made in the allocation of grants.  Very few of the principles which are applied to education cannot be applied to training at some stage and <i>vice versa</i> as they are interrelated. It is totally illogical to fund one and not the other.  We are losing millions, if not billions, of pounds from Europe for education as money can only be provided for training.  If a project is termed &ldquo;educational&rdquo; no money is provided.</P>
    <P>The head of the Department of Divinity at Oxford College recently made a very interesting case to the European authorities.  He urged that each of his graduates would take up employment in whichever Church they represented, that his course at the Department of Divinity and Philosophy at Oxford College was clearly a vocational and training course, that he was sending them all out to work and therefore he should be entitled to funds from the Social Fund.  I do not know how well that man is doing but his case is a good example of how ridiculous the European law is.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the guiding light for politicians of all shades should be the creation of an environment where there is free access to education, health and the law.  I have dealt briefly with education. It is not possible for me to refer to all the elements at this stage except to say that all the children of the State passed through first level.  Therefore, any investment in primary education represents an investment in the youth of the country, in the next generation.  We will reap the rewards many times over.  If we are to invest or inject money in education that is the sector to do it.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers made reference to the related issues of emigration and demographic trends.  I have stated previously that I have yet to see a report on demographic trends which has turned out to be true and I have studied a fair <Col N="632" /> number of such reports during the past 20 or so years.  If people have any doubts about that all they need do is go down to the Library and take out the demographic projections put forward in 1980, 1970 and 1960 and for the years in between.  They will see that none of them proved correct. One of the great problems is that we do not get such reports from demographers. They always seem to be presented by economists, either the ESRI who employ economists, or the Central Statistics Office who employ statisticians.  There are very few demographers in the country and we never seem to ask them for their opinion.</P>
    <P>In simple terms, I suggest we will face huge problems in the services area in the mid-nineties.  It has been projected that our birth rate will continue to decline and emigration will not continue at high levels.  Recently the Minister stated in this House that the rate of emigration had fallen to 24,000 per year.  The reality is that the rate of emigration will fall to either 12,000 or 14,000 per year within two years.  I have been saying that in this House for the past two years and anywhere else where people were willing to discuss it but I cannot get anyone to agree with me.  However, I am aware that all of the decisions that will be made in relation to the provisions for education and the health services during the next ten years will be based on an annual net emigration figure of 25,000 but this will not be the case.</P>
    <P>A report issued by FÁS within the past two weeks indicates that many people are returning from the United Kingdom in particular.  Yesterday I spoke with the Australian Ambassador who told me that the number of people who moved to Australia this year was down by approximately 40 per cent on the figure for last year and continues to fall.  FÁS, who have ten divisions around the country, have been asked to express an opinion on why changes have taken place in the employment-unemployment figures in their areas.  It is my information, and I have to check this, that many Irish people are now leaving the United Kingdom on account of the poll tax which is <Col N="633" /> extraordinary.  This has been pointed out by three different sources and time will tell if this is true or not.  It is absolutely amazing the things that can bring about a change.  It is obvious that that country has its unemployment problems but that is one of the reasons for the change outlined in the reports forwarded by some FÁS divisions to their head office, that people are not prepared to stay over there as they cannot avoid the poll tax.</P>
    <P>If the emigration figure is lower than the one Government advisers would have us believe let me put forward a very simple equation.  If the figure turns out to be either 12,000 or 13,000 a year on average during the next ten years, rather than the figure of 25,000 or 26,000, in simple terms this will mean that there will be an extra 14,000 people in the country each year.  They will be in the years of fertility between 16 and 40.  This means that every year for the next ten years there will be an extra 7,000 fertile women with a fertility rate of roughly 2.2: it is 2.4 at present but is projected to decline to 2.1.  Cumulatively this means there will be an extra 16,000 people per year.  This will require a huge number of teachers. I am convinced we will run out of teachers if we do not keep this factor in mind.</P>
    <P>Everybody tells us about the fall in the fertility rate and the drop in the birth rate, but the figures in the recently published OECD report are quite startling. In all except three countries in the EC, fertility rate increased during the past 18 months.  The three countries in which it did not increase were Spain, Italy and Ireland, the three Catholic countries who learned only lately about some of the gadgets which change things around.  I do not have a figure for Germany because the changes there made it impossible to get statistics.  In case anybody thinks there is a facile explanation for this, I have also looked at the fertility rate amongst migrants as opposed to the stable population.  I do not believe that the Irish fertility rate will drop below 2 for any significant period.  It might drop slightly below 2 for a short period but it will stabilise just slightly above 2.  The replenishment of the population is 2.1, <Col N="634" /> allowing each woman to have slightly over two children.  We are a breed of survivors and, if necessary, we will ensure that there are people to pay our pensions or to turn out the light in 30 or 40 years' time.  We as a nation will make it easy for people to have larger families.  We should remember that each child represents one thirty-fifth of a teacher's job.</P>
    <P>Vote 45 is concerned with the payment of lump sums and related payments resulting from early retirement in the public service.  I have spoken regularly during the past year about the need for an early retirement plan for teachers. There is a need to allow teachers who can no longer cope with the stress, difficulties and pressure of the job to retire early. Perhaps the Minister will specify what this money is for and who in the public service was getting early retirement in 1989.  I do not know who they are.  Is the early retirement scheme still available?  I have no doubt that if the Minister meets teachers in his constituency &mdash; particularly but not exclusively primary teachers &mdash; they will tell them they are in the fifties and can no longer give the job what it requires and ask to be allowed to retire with dignity and financial security. This would also create jobs for younger teachers who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred earlier to the excellent amenities in Wheatfield Prison.  I have not been inside the prison but I recently saw the outside of it when I visited a travellers' halting site at St. Oliver's Park, beside the prison.  I was in the company of the sister of a Senator on the Government benches who gave me a guided tour of this appalling site.  One woman who had a large family was trying to keep warm in a run-down trailer by using two electric bar heaters powered from her own generator.  The heaters were, of course, a fire hazard.  She pointed to the prison and asked what one had to do to get into those facilities. When people have to ask such a question because they cannot get decent accommodation from the State we have a lot to answer for.  I am not pointing the finger at this Minister.  This is a responsibility we all share.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> I have indicated to the Government Whip that I would welcome a discussion on the whole question of travellers.  Many Senators are members of local authorities and this is a local authority issue.  I believe a greater amount of money should be made available to the travelling community. It is appalling to visit this site in Clondalkin adjacent to our most modern prison and to see people living under canvas, trying to survive and rear families in horrific conditions, without even a decent electric light.  It is an indictment of our community and we must all accept some of the responsibility.  It is an issue we should discuss at some length.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan attempted during the week to raise on the Adjournment the £500,000 which the Government had made available for the homeless but which has not been spent and is being returned to the Exchequer.  That is disgraceful, particularly in the light of the problems of the travelling community.  I could easily spend that money on behalf of homeless people.  Twenty five young children are being educated in a so-called classroom in St. Oliver's Park by a teacher who shows an admirable level of commitment.  It is something like a Portacabin which is damp, dirty and smelly &mdash; the antithesis of a learning environment.  I cannot find out who is responsible.  It is not the Department of Education, the Department of Health or Dublin Corporation but appears to involve all three.  If it transpires that £500,000 is available which has not been spent on the homeless, Senator Ryan has a serious grievance in asking what is happening to this money.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked me to raise the question of funds for the Hirschfeld Centre.  He has raised this matter many times and has been in contact with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and various others.  He will develop this point during the debate in January.</P>
    <P>The final matter I wish to raise in which promises were made which have not been kept relates to Telifís na Gaeltachta. Cúpla bliain ó shin i rith an toghcháin thug an Taoiseach geallúint go mbeadh <Col N="636" /> £500,000 ar fáil chun Teilifís na Gaeltachta a chur ar fáil nó, ar a laghad, scéim phíolóta a thosú.  That has not happened. About 18 months ago the Minister of State represented the Minister when this matter of the £500,000 for Teilifís na Gaeltachta was raised by me on the Adjournment.  Níl aon dul chun cinn déanta ó shin i leith, ach tá a lán oibre déanta ag muintir na Gaeltachta chun creatlach de scéim phíolóta a chur ar fáil agus tá siad ullamh le dul ar aghaidh leis. Ní thuigim in aon chor cén fáth nach mbeadh an Stát toilteanach dul ar aghaidh leis sin.  Bheadh jabanna ann, thar aon ní eile, agus ba dheacair teacht ar scéim níos fearr ná sin chun infheistíocht a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I therefore register my disappointment that we have not made any progress on that issue over the last year.  Ba mhaith liom brú a chur ar an Aire, ar an Rialtas, agus go mórmhór ar an Taoiseach, mar eisean a thug an gheallúint go gcuirfí brú orthu an t-airgead a chur ar fáil chun seirbhís teilifíse Gaeltachta nó Gaeilge a bhunú.  Chuala mé argóintí i gcoinne sheirbhís teilifíse Gaeltachta ó dhaoine áirithe, ach níl mé ag brath na buntáistí ná na míbhuntáistí a phlé ag an bpointe seo; níl mé ach a rá go bhfuil géarghá le seirbhís teilifíse sa Ghaeltacht chun cuidiú linn an Ghaeilge a shábháil.  Ní féidir le múinteoirí seo a dhéanamh, trína ropadh siar i scornacha na leanaí óga nach bhfuil acu sa bhaile ach Sky, BBC agus cláir Bhéarla an t-am ar fad.  Níl mé ag cur in éadan na gclár Béarla sin ach oiread.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that Gaeltacht children should be restricted to Irish channels or Irish language programmes only, far from it.  I would take quite the opposite view, having been brought up in the Gaeltacht myself and seen many of my Gaeltacht friends and colleagues suffer from not having been allowed develop in English as well.  There should be the option for those tuismitheoirí atá báúil don teanga, go mbeadh seans acu siúd teilifís Ghaeilge nó Ghaeltachta a chur ar fáil dá leanaí óga.  In that way, at least, they would perceive Irish as a natural part of their growth, environment and <Col N="637" /> home.  Molaim sin don Aire, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh dul chun cinn éigin ann maidir leis an gceist seo i rith na bliana seo chugainn.  Such is the nature of the Appropriation Bill it would be possible to continue to debate it all day in all its different aspects.  I have referred to the major points on which I wished to comment. The Appropriation Bill, and the discussion thereon, does allow us to examine where we are, as a nation, at this time of year.  It is a debate that is enjoyable from that point of view in that we are not here pressurising one another but rather examining, opening out its provisions. This debate should set the agenda for the work of the House &mdash; apart from its legislative work &mdash; in ensuing months.</P>
    <P>I have raised issues such as education which were discussed at length two or three times in this House in the past year. The Minister for Education has suggested that we should have a comprehensive debate on education.  I would welcome such an opportunity because it would enable people put forward their points of view.</P>
    <P>I have raised the question of having a more comprehensive debate on the state of travellers and gave some examples of what I had in mind.  I met recently the Dublin Travellers Education Group whom I found to be highly articulate, clear, cogent thinkers.  They are the kind of people who can tell us of their experiences first-hand.  I would like to bring their experiences to this House and see a debate on that aspect of Irish life.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, as a nation, as legislators, we need to lay out a direction for ourselves so that we at least make some attempt to do what was called for in the Proclamation of the Republic, that is try to &ldquo;cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;.  It is my greatest regret, as an Irish citizen, that successive Governments have managed to conspire &mdash; I cannot think of a better word &mdash; to omit those words from our Constitution &mdash;&ldquo;to cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;.  I hope I live to see the day when those words are inserted in an Irish Constitution.  I hope I also live to see the day when our citizens understand <Col N="638" /> that they are not incorporated in our Constitution at present.  I constantly meet elected representatives who think they are included in the Constitution: little do they know.</P>
    <P>The next issue I want to raise is that of access to education, to the health services and to the law.  If we could form a nation which would ensure that all our children were treated equally then we would have something of which we could be proud.</P>
    <P>The only test to which any society need be subjected is that of what I might call the maternity ward test.  If one walks into the maternity ward of any hospital in this State at present, particularly in a city area, one need only show me the children and their addresses &mdash; I need know nothing else about them &mdash; for me to predict what will be their life profile.  For example, if their address happens to be Darndale, Ballymun or some such place, I can predict what those individuals are likely to be doing over the next 20 or 30 years; one could work down the scale of our class structure.  I am not trying to create a revolution overnight.  But is it not ridiculous that this country, which would appear to cherish life so much, can still not show any care whatsoever about the quality of life we offer these citizens? There must be something wrong with a society which creates, within the same geographic area, the poor, the unemployed, a potential prison population and so on.  Why is it that such a large proportion of the prison population come from disadvantaged areas?  Are they born difficult?  When one looks at babies in a maternity ward, they all look exactly similar &mdash; my children, your children; one cannot pick one out from the other.  Yet, over their lifetime it appears one takes one route and another a very different one.  I believe that is because we do not look after them at that early stage.  That must be on our agenda as elected representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the fact that we are spending £170,000 on the Secret Service.  He wondered where that money went.  My view is that it is expended simply to protect one secret, <Col N="639" /> namely, that we have no secret at all.  I suspect that that expenditure will increase protecting that simple fact.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the Appropriation Bill, 1990 as the economy faces into a stormy period, with great uncertainty in the world, the Gulf crisis building up to climax, with the GATT talks continuing, which are turbulent and difficult as far as this country is concerned.  There is great instability in Eastern Europe which inevitably will manifest itself in this country.  There is a recession in the United States and in the United Kingdom and it is now generally believed that there will be no recovery in world prices in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe, using carefully selected statistics, illustrated that there has been a period of growth over the past few years.  Nonetheless that period of growth has made little difference to the lives of many people.  Indeed, many have seen their standards of living decline over that period.  Over the past two years there has been a widening gap between the income of different sectors of society, with the wealthy becoming wealthier, when we have been exposed to arrogant displays of greed amounting to a glorification of materialism.  For some segments of Irish society there would appear now to be no such thing as a social conscience, of concern for the poor, for others, for the under-privileged, the old, the lonely; such concern is seen as being weak willed.  The homeless have been forgotten.  Many of the old values have been eroded or washed away and are irrelevant to some segments of our society at present.  The middle income groups continue to find the going tough &mdash; mortgages present difficulties for them, education costs increase and health insurance costs escalate, all happening within an environment of heavy taxation. There is the silent constituency of the middle income groups who have been the target of most of the unfulfilled promises, the people who worked hard in the belief that, if they made sacrifices for a few years, it would reap dividends.  It now appears that their expectations and hopes <Col N="640" /> will not be realised.  They will get more of the same in 1991 and will be expected, over that year, to ensure in silence, to act responsibly demonstrating continued patience as their standards of living are further eroded.</P>
    <P>The farming community have experienced a dreadful time this year.  It would not appear that the coming year will be any better for them.  There was a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in farm incomes, depending on which set of expert figures one relied.  As far as the farming community are concerned, the GATT negotiations simply represent a damage limitation exercise.  The important thing here is the degree to which such damage will be limited because it will amount to damage no matter how one perceives it.</P>
    <P>Developments in Eastern Europe will lead to growing exports from those countries to the European Community further reducing farmers' prices.  The outlook for many small farmers is exceptionally bleak.  It is estimated that of the order of 50,000, one third of the present farming community, will be made redundant between now and the turn of the century.  Where are they to go?  What is to become of them?  What will become of their communities?  What will become of the culture of which these people are the embodiment?  Will their children be returning in times to come seeking their roots, trawling through heritage centres wondering who they were, where they came from and so on?  They will be the lucky ones, the fortunate and successful because they will have the capacity to come back.</P>
    <P>There will also be other people who will be simply statistics in the emigration figures.  There will be those people we heard about on radio this morning, the residents of cardboard city in London and other parts of that cardboard world.  They will be the theme of new, evocative songs by the Ralph McTells of the new generation.  The Appropriation Bill we see in front of us this afternoon offers very little hope for them.</P>
    <P>The poor and those who depend on social welfare must see little hope in the <Col N="641" /> Estimates.  They can expect no improvement. Their children can expect education, housing and the prospect of work to remain an unfulfilled dream. Anyone who doubts that has only to look at the figures for returning emigrants at the weekend.  We are talking about something of the order of 200,000 returning to this country.  These are our emigrants coming back who could not find employment in this country.  The Appropriation Bill offers relatively little hope for them.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is in a very bad state.  The infrastructure of agriculture is now beginning to fall apart.  Teagasc are in the doldrums and the future looks very bleak for that great organisation and their predecessor who contributed so much to the development of agriculture.  Their budget has been slashed.  Their chairman has taken to attacking them.  There has been a significant reduction in the ERAD budget.  Farm animal disease remains an intractable problem which we cannot afford not to solve.  We will run into tremendous difficulties in the years ahead if we cannot get on top of TB and other problems of farm animal disease.  One way in which you cannot go about that is to reduce the amount of money we are investing in the eradication programme when the problem remains as serious as it is.</P>
    <P>I see little hope of change or improvement in the Appropriation Bill in the area of marketing Irish food products.  There is a great need which has been identified for years for further investment in that area.  Yet, we seem unable to make the investment or to organise from one source or another.  There is a growing problem of the standard of quality in our foods.  It is a good week now when we do not find a case type of food poisoning particularly during the summer months. In the recent past we had an outbreak of listeria in cream.  That has to have a very serious impact on the image of the quality of Irish products.  There is also a question about our capacity to tackle the problem of implants and additives.  Newspaper reports of angel dust being fed to Irish cattle are very alarming, and we need further investment to solve that problem. <Col N="642" /> To be fair to the Minister for Agriculture and Food he has at least taken a very positive and desirable approach to that problem, but I do not believe enough money is going in to provide the solution. However, I compliment him at least on his attitude.  His thinking is entirely right, and I would like to see him ensuring that much more investment is made in guaranteeing that none of those products make their way into the Irish food chain because their impact on our food will be disastrous in the effect it will have on consumers, Irish and worldwide.</P>
    <P>There is little hope in this Appropriation Bill for those on social welfare. The Commission on Social Welfare's report has not been implemented.  The notion that people on social welfare should be paid £60 per week in the case of adults remains a dream and aspiration. We have a long way to go before we get that far.  It is accepted by experts that children under the age of 11 would need £16 per week.  Again, we have a long way to go before we reach that target.  It is estimated that children older than 12 years would need £20 per week to be able to be properly looked after when they are on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The unemployed young adults whose entitlement is based entirely on the family income are left in a dreadful position and in a dilemma as to whether they should move out of their family home if they are to get income from social welfare.  Alternatively, they are left with little or no dignity if they remain in the home if the family happens to have a worthwhile income.</P>
    <P>There is the continuing cycle of social welfare which seems as if it is going to be just that, an everlasting cycle.  The dependents of social welfare are very likely themselves to be the children of social welfare recipients.  That cycle has gone on and on for years and I see little hope in this Bill of any change.  The ugly face of moneylending is again beginning to appear on the Irish scene.  That is just one more indication of how awful things are for those who are poor in our society.</P>
    <P>There is little prospect of improvement in the health service.  Funding for health <Col N="643" /> is going to remain static.  The waiting lists will continue to be unacceptably long for those people who cannot afford to pay and those waiting lists will continue to drive people in the direction of private medicine.  The Appropriation Bill holds out very little hope for the 800 or so mentally handicapped people who are in need of residential care.  They are going to have to take their chances among the thousand and one other areas of demand on the health boards as they seek to spread out the few extra pounds they have been given.  The case of the mentally handicapped has been very well stated and explained by their association and I wish the Minister for Health would pay much more attention to it.  They have been described as &ldquo;special&rdquo; but I believe that to a large extent they have been forgotten.  I hope their needs will be given the priority they deserve.  It is appalling that the families of mentally handicapped people have to drive across the city of Dublin to see their children out in Portrane which is a full day's work on a Sunday afternoon given the traffic in the city.  I hope something can be done to alleviate the problems of these people.</P>
    <P>There are dreadful problems for old people who have mentally handicapped children &mdash; I should not say children, I should say mentally handicapped adult dependants because some of these people are now in their thirties and forties and are being cared for by their parents who are in their sixties, seventies and even older and who worry dreadfully about what is to become of their children when they are no longer able to care for them. It is an appalling prospect they have to consider and try to cope with, as if they had not enough on their plate already.</P>
    <P>I am pleased there has been some improvement in the amount of money allocated to the Health Research Board. I am sorry there is not a great deal more. It is not nearly adequate.  The Health Research Board have been at the receiving end of savage cutbacks over the past few years.  If health research is to make the contribution it has the potential to make, then it is very important that <Col N="644" /> investment be made in the type of health research which is carried out by the Health Research Board.  It is easy to get money for research on the development of new drugs because down the line there is the prospect of profit for a drug company but the type of health research carried out by the Health Research Board will not bring profits to an entrepreneur. It is the type of research which will pay dividends for the community at large, and I wish the Minister would reconsider the situation there and perhaps try to stretch the budget somewhat to give that research group a greater contribution.</P>
    <P>I am also sorry to see that there is no real prospect of the Minister investing more money in preventive medicine and, particularly, in health education.  Investment in this area would have a very worthwhile spin-off.  Many of the diseases of modern society are diseases of lifestyle. There are the various diseases that arise from smoking, from excessive drinking, those that arise because we refuse to modify our diet and will not take enough exercise.  In many cases these diseases could, if not eliminated, be postponed if an awareness was created.  I accept that there is some awareness but it is not nearly as great as it could be.  I would like to see the Minister paying more attention to that.  I suppose he is an expert on this topic, given that he is a medical practitioner.  I wish he would use his professional expertise to try to expand on that area of investment.</P>
    <P>One of the more disturbing aspects of yesterday's announcement was the decision by the Minister to increase the health charges for those with long term illness and those who are in public hospitals. We are talking of an increase of 25 per cent which seems very large and will represent a tremendous burden for people on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke at considerable length about education.  There are a few items I would like to add.  In the primary sector the pupil/teacher ratio continues to be excessively high.  There is a great need at primary school level for more investment to reduce the pupil/teacher <Col N="645" /> ratio and provide an adequate level of support services for schools, to provide adequate funding to employ people such as caretakers and secretarial assistants. These people have a vital role to play in the proper and efficient functioning of schools.  Without them teachers will find their time taken up carrying out functions which should not be expected of them.</P>
    <P>There is a need for an end to the interminable rounds of fund-raising which most schools, teachers and parents' associations now find themselves involved in.  There are the race nights, the raffles, the cake sales, the marathon runs and the whole rigmarole.  It should not be necessary for teachers and parents to be involved in that type of income generation, nor should it be necessary for teachers to be put in a position where they are forced to seek voluntary contributions from parents.  I do not blame teachers for doing that.  I have no hesitation at all in acknowledging that they do it with the greatest degree of sensitivity possible but they should not be put in that position.</P>
    <P>Many primary school teachers are under great personal stress as a result of what they are expected to cope with during their work.  A lot of the work of primary teachers is centred around fund-raising, which they should not have to get involved in.</P>
    <P>There is no increase planned for capital investment in second level education services despite the fact that the capital investment in second level education is now 60 per cent less than it was four years ago.  Ireland still has the largest classes in Europe, it has the lowest <i>per capita</i> spending on second level education and it is the only European country without a six year cycle at second level.  Again, I am very disappointed that something is not being done about that.</P>
    <P>Probably one of the most disturbing areas of education is the question of access to third level education.  Access to third level education here is an appalling commentary on our sense of fairness to those who come from lower income groups.  The chances of the lower income groups getting into third level education <Col N="646" /> are somewhere between minimal and non-existent.  It is an eye-opener to go through the statistics.  I recommend that every Member of this House read the report by Paddy Clancy on going to college.  It certainly is an eye-opener.  The chances of those who come from the low income segment of society getting into third level education are pretty well nonexistent and we continue to do nothing about that.  It is a disgrace that that problem is not being tackled.</P>
    <P>I work in the third level education sector and in that sense I should declare an interest.  Having done that, I must say that third level education is very, very expensive for the parents of those who are now going through the system.  Many of those parents are in the middle income bracket who are struggling to maintain their children in college, and are finding the going very tough.  There has been a great squeeze on funds for third level education.  One of the great difficulties that this creates is its effect on standards. The standards in third level education here are comparable to the best anywhere, but we cannot continue to reduce funding to third level education without putting those standards in jeopardy.  We have just about gone as far as it is possible to go and any further cutbacks will result in a reduction in standards.  The effects of that, in the long term, will be disastrous.</P>
    <P>I note that there is an £8.8 million increase on the Estimates for spending on Third World aid.  Seven million pounds of this will go to help countries affected by the Gulf crisis.  What that means is that there is an increase of £1.8 million in Third World aid and that part of the world which is in greatest need of aid. When one works out the figures, what has really happened is that this country's contribution to Third World aid declined this year from 0.16 per cent to a projected 0.15 per cent of gross national product. That is awful.  I have mentioned this before in the presence of the Minister. That is the meanest of all the cuts and we are getting meaner by the year.  That is a shocking commentary on our values when one bears in mind that each day of the order of 40,000 children in the Third <Col N="647" /> World die needlessly.  The basic reason we do not make a greater contribution to Third World aid here is simply because there are no votes in it.  I accept that.  I am out on the ground as a practising politician and I believe that the basic reason is that there are no votes in it; but I do not think that in matters like this what we do should be determined by whether or not there are votes in it.  This is a fundamental moral issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reduction from 0.16 per cent to 0.15 per cent of gross national product.  We are miles away from the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent and we are now approaching half of what it used be four or five years ago when we reached a figure of 0.25 per cent.  Many others have spoken about this but I am simply driven to despair by it.</P>
      <P>There are now 20,000 applicants for local authority housing.  There has been a projected increase of £11 million which I understand is sufficient to provide for the building of 200 extra houses.  It will meet about 1 per cent of the need.  Ninety-nine per cent of those on the housing list can expect to be there next year.  That is a chilling statistic for those people.  In fact, the 200 or so extra houses we can expect to be built next year will not even keep pace with the growth in demand for housing.  That shows how pathetic this investment is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I can be permitted to be parochial; in the part of Dublin where I do my political work housing is at crisis level, and has been for a long period.  There is gross overcrowding, and marital problems, and intra-family feuding and stress are generated as a result.  I am sorry to say that nothing of significance is likely to be done about that next year.  There is, of course, the continuing and shocking problem of the 5,000 or so homeless people in this country, many of whom are children, and that, too, is an appalling reflection on the way we do our business here.  There is one final paradox I want <Col N="648" /> to mention, and Senator O'Keeffe dwelt on this at length.  I always like speaking after Senator O'Keeffe.</P>

      <P>I would like to make some very brief concluding remarks at this stage.  Let me first extend the customary thanks to the House for facilitating the Government in getting this very important piece of financial legislation through the House today.  I would also like to thank all those Senators who contributed to today's discussion and I propose to come back on some of the points raised here today in some detail and others when we resume the discussion in the New Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I already referred in my opening remarks to the difficult budgetary position facing the Government in 1991. This situation is made even more acute by the less favourable external environment we will be facing next year.  This was emphasised by Senator Upton.  During recent years when our economy improved so much the international environment was good.  All the indications now point to a situation where the immediate outlook for our main trading partners, which looked so favourable until recently, is now much less optimistic. The reality now is that both the UK and the US economies are moving <Col N="649" /> into recession.  The Gulf crisis and the difficulties stemming from it is a major blot on the horizon and I express the hope &mdash; and I am sure all Members of the House would concur with the sentiment &mdash; that a peaceful solution is found to the present impasse in the Gulf and that we do not find ourselves with a major world military conflict when this House resumes in the New Year.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we cannot hope to remain immune from all these developments and we simply have to face the fact that our export markets will be growing less rapidly than recently.  This means that we can expect lower export growth next year compared with the very strong growth experienced in recent years. There is no doubt that this more subdued export growth will have implications for growth both in domestic demand and in employment.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is even more imperative that we maintain competitiveness so as to at least maintain and hopefully increase our market share and thus aid employment and income growth, and it is vital that we maintain progress on reducing the debt-GNP ratio so as to reduce the exposure to the risks attaching to a relatively high ratio in the context of an economic downturn.  The high debt ratio, notwithstanding all that has been achieved, continues to place a huge burden on the economy, pre-empting resources that could be better utilized elsewhere.  Even though the debt ratio has been reduced from 131 per cent in 1987 to 119 per cent in 1989, it still remains at a level of £25 billion, the equivalent of £24,000 for every household in the country, and moreover it continues to grow if even at a much slower pace.  Despite the transformation in the public finances since 1987 we will still be incurring £400 million in new borrowing this year, which simply adds to the debt and debt servicing costs.</P>
    <P>While I have no wish to argue with Senators on the opposite benches, coming as we are to the season of goodwill, it has to be said that a great number of the contributions, particularly that of Senator Upton, highlighted the <Col N="650" /> stark reality of a demand for considerably increased expenditure on every front. Even though Senator Upton was tempted to accuse Senator O'Keeffe of skimming over certain statistics, it would be fair to request him to suggest where some of these resources might come from.  We must take into account the fact that between 1982 and 1987 the national debt grew by £12 billion, and the interest alone on the annual repayment, without dealing with the principal, is equivalent to the total expenditure on education or the total expenditure on health.  The suggestion that the problems of Overseas Development Aid or any problem with housing or poverty would be best served by transferring to future generations the obligation to pay for a service which we insist on getting now but are not prepared to pay for, is certainly not a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>I tried to emphasise in my initial statement and here again that as a small economy depending on market growth, we have to make sure that we are competitive in order to increase employment.  When we increase the borrowing ratio, four things automatically happen: there is an increase in inflation, in interest rates and in borrowing repayments and a lower competitive position, reducing sales and reducing the prospects for growth and employment.  I do not want to sound as if I am lecturing because on all sides of the House in the last couple of years there has been a consensus on the national economic programme &mdash; and hopefully that will be the case with the next one.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely imperative that we control public expenditure to get our economy into a healthy state for the future.  We accept that this has created problems, but we have tried to keep social welfare increases above the inflation rate, with particular emphasis on those who are on long term benefits, and despite the problems in education and health, the Government have been endeavouring to find the maximum resources to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>Vital to our prospects over the medium-term are the very important negotiations currently underway with the <Col N="651" /> social partners on a new programme for economic and social development.  I think Senators from all sides of the House will readily acknowledge the very important role which the consensus underpinning the present <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> played in the economic and social progress we have experienced in recent years.  It is highly desirable that we harness that consensus once again.</P>
    <P>Our aspirations for the economy have not changed; they are to maximise growth in sustainable employment and to continue the process of fiscal adjustment. The continued attainment of these objectives requires that any new programme must ensure that we have pay moderation so that we can continue to improve our competitiveness.  Without this, the investment and employment growth which the economy requires will be put in jeopardy as indeed will the Government's medium-term fiscal objectives, objectives which have only recently been endorsed by the National Economic and Social Council in their report <i>A Strategy for the Nineties.</i>  What we must do now is be faithful to the sound economic and budgetary policies that have proved so successful and beneficial up to now.  If we do this there is no reason we should not look forward to an even stronger economic growth in the medium term.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald, as he so gracefully does, covered the midlands in expert style.  He is a long-serving Member here and knows how to cover that ground fairly well.  He raised the question which was raised by other Senators in the context of housing.  Nobody will deny that there is a problem in relation to local authority housing in many parts of the country.  However, it is not just a simple question of asking the Government to provide more money for housing.  We have to look at this question on a new scale.  For instance, it is only a couple of years ago that the reality of the previous policies meant ghetto-type developments, where we concentrated a great number of families together simultaneously on a particular site.  There is <Col N="652" /> the view, of course, that we should have more scattered development, that we will obviously have to bring the private sector in and provide flats and houses for lone parent families and to meet society's other needs.  In regard to the previous policy &mdash; I am speaking off the cuff here &mdash; my recollection is that we were paying something like £80 million annually to repair the existing block of local authority houses.  These were largely minor repairs that had to be carried out on houses which were built by the Exchequer, the taxpayer, and at subsidised rent to the tenants, and which still required something like £70 million or £80 million to have repairs carried out.</P>
    <P>It was proved more socially beneficial and more economically desirable that these houses would be sold at preferential value to the tenants, and that scheme was lauded around the country.  People had the opportunity of owning their houses at a price they could afford and were, therefore, responsible for their maintenance thereafter.  For the future we must look at a combination of different ways to try to solve that problem so that such housing will not be a continual burden on the taxpayer but will embody innovative thinking in terms of how we deal with the housing question and how we ensure that we do not have the growth of massive areas without essential amenities and facilities that are required to enable communities to develop properly. I want to assure the House that the Minister for the Environment is giving very active consideration to these matters at present.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe mentioned the question of graduate output in the high tech area, an area in which I am involved personally with discussions with the Minister for Education at present.  All the indicators are that, not only in relation to graduates but moving right into the diploma and certificate areas, we will be unable to supply in sufficient numbers the growing workforce needed in the future in the high-tech, electronic and pharmaceutical areas.</P>
    <P>That has to be looked at, not only in the context of increasing numbers in third <Col N="653" /> level but also in the mishmash existing in third level at present.  Clearly we have people who are qualifying in certain disciplines for which there is not, in Ireland, an immediate opportunity for them to use their talents.  There may well be the need to look at some of the graduates in terms of crash year courses to add a further discipline to their qualifications to enable them to satisfy the labour market in some of these areas.</P>
    <P>As well as that we have to consider what is happening in the world as a whole because it is not only important to have the computer, engineering and technical qualifications, but you must also have the market into which you will sell this product.  It may, from an engineering point of view be perfect, but if it cannot be sold at the price, if it does not suit a particular customer &mdash; and since we are a largely exporting economy we have to know what the customer wants outside &mdash; it will not sell.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to what Senator Upton said in relation to quality.  He is not keeping abreast of what is happening in terms of the move towards quality in Ireland.  We were slow to get involved in this but we are now second in the league of countries, with the greatest number of companies qualifying for the ISO 9002 standard management certificate.  We also have a great number of companies qualifying for the Irish quality award. Very often we use opportunities like this to condemn but I would like to pay tribute to the many companies and the people involved in them who have introduced, on a systematic basis, quality systems rigorously examined and continuously put under test.  This is exemplified in 15 per cent of an annual growth in exports over the past three or four years which were won in the teeth of international competition and in spite of the distance from transport and problems of that kind.  We should reflect from time to time on the people who are contributing in our trade unions, management and middle management throughout the country to make that possible.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Senator O'Keeffe that the points he raised are at present being <Col N="654" /> actively considered.  I hope we can make some progress in discussions between the Government and the third level sector, bearing in mind the requirements in the market area and of course the overall parameters on education which have not necessarily 100 per cent all the time related to what is happening in the market.  There is also the freedom to have some facility to deviate from the crystal economic aspects because it is important to have the broader educational area covered as well.  That has to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam cén fáth nach bhfuil teilifís na Gaeltachta a cur ar fáil.  Rachaidh me i gcomhairle le Aire na Gaeltachta agus an tAire Cumarsáide, an Teachta Burke, in a thaobh sin.  Is léir go bhfuil gá len a leithéid de sheirbhís chun croí agus pearsantacht na gceantar Gaeltachta a chur os comhair an phobail. Beidh mé lán sásta iarracht a dhéanamh go gcuirfí an teilifís sin, atá molta cheana, ar fáil.</P>
    <P>I said I would not be covering all the points but there are one or two economic matters that were covered, specifically relating to the Appropriations Bill.  I wanted to make sure that I would at least deal with the specific questions related to the Bill in question.  I think there were perhaps only two other matters; that is not meant to reflect on the House because opportunities to have the freedom to talk about demographic patterns, the impact of returning emigrants, etc. is very important.  We should devise policies which are not only economically desirable but which also have the social character and basic understanding of how people are motivated and helped, working from the ground up in a way perhaps that we have not done before. That is covered in the way you decentralise and give an opportunity to local communities like Telifís na Gaeltachta so that the sort of individual personality of the region and its local strengths are harnessed in a new and better way.</P>
    <P>Two points were covered, one was the question by Senator O'Toole as to why teachers in 1989 were not allowed to avail of the early retirement scheme.  I have no <Col N="655" /> doubt that Senator O'Toole knows the answer, but I will put it on the record of the House, though I do not think it is necessary in the context of the speaker's comments to give it to him.</P>
    <P>There was a net increase in recruitment to teaching which meant that one could not have a retirement scheme obliging one to pay somebody to retire while at the same time having to create a new resource to employ somebody in one's place.  The basic principle relating to early retirement involved a reduction in numbers. That was the basic philosophy and it has been maintained in the few areas where it still operates.  There was not any scheme at any time in relation to early retirement which facilitated increasing recruitment while, at the same time at the other end of the scale, the taxpayer had to cover both situations.  People on all sides of the House will clearly understand that.</P>
    <P>The superannuation and retired allowances Vote was questioned by Senator O'Toole.  People waited a long time towards the end of the year to make up their minds in 1987 as to whether they would opt for the scheme, with the result that we had a preponderance of people taking early retirement at a very late stage in the year.  On the figures available to me it seems there was an increase in deaths as well.  All of that combined to create the excess Vote.  We will be coming back in the New Year to cover other matters in detail.  It only remains for me to wish all Senators a very happy Christmas and a peaceful New Year.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Although I thank the Minister, Deputy Smith for staying here, I am disappointed that the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Brennan cannot be with us.  However, I know the Minister present will be sympathetic to my pleas in the motion which is asking the Minister if he proposes to continue with his policy of compulsory stop-over of transatlantic flights at Shannon.</P>
      <P>I have raised this because of the continuing controversy and widespread concern not just in the mid-west but in surrounding counties, for instance Counties Galway, Mayo, Kerry, Cork, Offaly, Tipperary South Riding, who are all very concerned regarding the status of Shannon Airport and the possibility of transatlantic flights over-flying it.  There should not be a change in the status of Shannon either for scheduled or shorter flights.  Any change, as Minister Brennan has been told on many occasions would have detrimental effects regionally and nationally, with no apparent gain to the country.  There is widespread concern among the management and staff at Shannon Airport, among industrialists, workers, commercial and business people, hoteliers, guesthouse owners and people involved in all aspects of tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> Shannon Airport with its transatlantic status has made a very significant contribution to the social and economic development of the area, not just the mid-west but adjoining regions.  It has also made a contribution nationally.  Its removal as a transatlantic gateway would seriously undermine that role.  There is no evidence that changing the status of Shannon would lead to any increase in North American tourists to Ireland. What would be most likely would be a radical shift in the distribution of tourism expenditure away from the west and mid-west regions which have invested so heavily in infrastructure.  How easy it would be if passengers were disembarking in Dublin, to lure them to the delights of the Wicklow Mountains and the Mourne Mountains and forget about the delights of Connemara and Kerry. This would have a significantly negative impact on industry and services in the west and would inhibit the location of future industrial investment in the region.</P>
    <P>What about regional economic balance? Shannon has been to the fore for a long time, as a model for regional development for the other regions.  In the drawing up of the national plan that was submitted to Brussels for peripheral funding, Shannon was the prototype. Without the mid-west region there would not have been the same ease with which that national plan was drawn up.  Now we are moving away from the whole European concept of regionalisation and we are moving back to centralisation which is not Euro-policy.</P>
    <P>Performance in the mid-west was second to the east and well ahead of all the other regions in overall economic performance from 1971 to 1988.  The region thus provided a national counter balance to the increasing centralisation in the east.</P>
    <P>The change of status at Shannon would be most unlikely to increase the total North American tourist traffic to Ireland. In fact, 71 per cent of North American tourists on direct flights currently choose to disembark at Shannon.  Surveys of visitors to Ireland show that only 2.5 per <Col N="658" /> cent of North American visitors travelling to Dublin indicated that stopping at Shannon posed a problem.  The vast majority of US tour operators do not perceive Shannon's status to be a problem for the market.  Shifting the distribution of North American tourists away from the west to the east would put a significant number of jobs at risk in tourism and related industries.  Everybody realises the infrastructure of hotels in the Shannon region.  They are nationally and internationally known.  There are hotels like Dromoland and Adare Manor and they have a very high dependency on North American traffic.  About 90 per cent of their trade comes from North America and it is estimated that 32 jobs will be lost or seriously threatened in these hotels if the fly-over takes place.</P>
    <P>In relation to industry, 2,300 airport and tourist-related jobs will be at risk. Employers in the region have indicated that a reduction in the frequency of US flights at Shannon would result in inefficiencies and increased costs.  The data processing companies in Shannon rely heavily on a daily flight service to the US. Eight hundred and fifty people employed in seven companies indicated that a change would lead to inefficiencies and increased costs and that it would lead to a need to review their siting in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to time saving, there is only an insignificant loss of time.  About 45 to 55 minutes are lost between disembarking and continuing on to Dublin. There is a saving of from two to three hours as a result of immigration pre-inspection and if one were to think in terms of the problem of travelling from Dublin Airport into the city centre, I cannot see that there is any great difference in time.</P>
    <P>Looking at EC policy on regional development and peripherality which is so much in vogue, the EC would support the maintenance of Shannon's status.  In relation to congestion and decongestion, a recent IATA European study showed that Dublin would be one of Europe's most congested airports in the nineties. Shannon does not suffer from air traffic congestion now nor has it been predicted <Col N="659" /> for the future.  There are no terminal capacity restrictions at Shannon.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what will happen in respect of European directives which will cause problems for us in 1992 regarding duty free facilities.  At least the Minister can govern national decisions.  How does he intend compensating for jobs lost through a loss in revenue, in trade and in tourist traffic? What are his plans for developing Shannon as an aviation centre of world status? It has potential for both the travel and tourist industries.  We know the jobs are forecast in those two areas.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister commissioned any study of future trends in world aviation traffic?  The expansion at Shannon arises from developments by Aeroflot.  Since glasnost two major factors require study and consideration.  First, in view of the accepted insecure position of Mr. Gorbachev, and because of the introduction of free market conditions with consequential potential knock-on adverse effects on Aeroflot, has the Minister evaluated the potential loss to Shannon in the event of any upheaval in the USSR which could result in part or total termination of Aeroflot's flights?  What about the future of the Aer Rianta managed duty free shops in Moscow and Leningrad? Has the Minister considered a study of world aviation trends that may lead to opportunities of exploiting Shannon Airport's regional geographic position?</P>
    <P>Finally, we know &mdash; and the Minister of State will agree &mdash; that the entrepreneurial spirit is very much alive and well in the region and has been for decades. All interest groups in the Shannon region are not sitting back and relying totally on the special status of Shannon Airport.  They are diligent and innovative in attracting new industries and in formulating industrial and tourist plans.  The aviation centre, GPA and novel tourist projects are in the area but a flyover would devastate the region and result in the continued centralisation of the Dublin access.  I do not think the Minister of State would disagree with me that what <Col N="660" /> we are seeking is a retention of vibrancy in the mid-west and adjoining regions to counterbalance the ever increasing pressure on Dublin.  Any decision by the Minister not to continue with his policy of the current compulsory stopover would surely be devastating.  I would like to have his views in that matter.</P>

Tá mé buíoch de as an ngeallúint a thug sé go ndéanfadh sé iarracht seo a phlé le hAire Stáit na Gaeltachta agus leis an Taoiseach féin, Aire na Gaeltachta.  Tá áthas orm freisin go bhfuil sé i láthair inniu agus an cheist áirithe seo á plé againn mar baineann sé le réigiún iarthar na hÉireann.  Is maith an rud freisin go bhfuil an Leas-Chathaoirleach sa Chathaoir mar, os as Ciarraí dó, tuigeann sé na cúrsaí seo go maith. Cuireann sé as dom go mór go bhfuil caint ann faoi bhaint den stádas atá ag Aerfort na Sionnaine.</P>
      <P>Táimid rannpháirteach san EC, agus tá páirt mhór againn ann.  Tá an Rialtas ag rá, dála an phobail go léir, go gcreidimid go láidir i réigiúnachas, agus tá dhá réigiún chinnte sa tír a gcaithfear glacadh leo mar atá siad.  Nuair a théann tú siar thar an tSionainn, tá tú i réigiún amháin, iarthar na hÉireann; agus nuair a théann tú soir go hAth Luain, tá tú i réigiún eile, oirthear na hÉireann.  Go dtí seo, na buntáistí is mó a d'eascair as beartas ar bith a bhfuil baint aige le réigiúnachas, is in oirthear na hÉaireann a fuarthas seo: cósta thoir na hÉireann nó Baile Átha Cliath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tabharfaidh mé sampla amháin, an DART, an córas iarnróid, a chosnaigh £150 milliún agus tuilleadh, agus táimid anois ag caint faoin ngnó is tábhachtaí in iarthar na hÉireann, an turasóireacht.  Níl sna raflaí seo atá ag dul thart ach caint, ach, ar ndóigh, bíonn sé éasca caint a dhéanamh, ach bíonn orainn súil a choinneáil ar chúrsaí agus cluas le héisteacht bheith againn.  Ba bhuille tubaisteach é d'iarthar na hÉireann &mdash; agus nuair a deirim iarthar na hÉireann, tá mé <Col N="661" /> ag caint faoi chuile áit ó Chiarraí go Dún na nGall, cósta thiar na tíre uilig &mdash; agus ní ghlacfaí leis san iarthar dá ndéanfaí rud ar bith a bhainfeadh de stádas Aerfort na Sionnaine, mar ansin bheadh leath amháin den tír ag dul i saibhreas agus an leath eile ag dul i mbochtanas.

Tá súil againn uilig go mbeidh athrú agus feabhas tagtha ar an scéal ionas go ndéanfar beart cinnte faoin ábhar sin sa bhliain atá romhainn.  Ba mhaith liom freisin a chur in iúl don Seanadóir Jackman agus an Seanadóir Ó Foighil nach bhfuil aon athrú tagtha ar pholasaí an Rialtais maidir leis an gceist atá á plé againn.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise again to Senator Jackman and Senator Ó Foighil there is no change in existing Government policy on the Shannon stop.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport, over the past few months, has received a number of submissions from various organisations and interests both for and against the change, including one from myself, and I will leave the Senators to guess what case I have made in that area.  His Department are at present studying the submissions in the context of plans and trends within the European Community and wider aviation trends.  It is not possible to answer the detailed questions asked by the Senator in relation to the possible changes in the duty free area, and so on in the post-1992 era.  It is clear that this issue will have to be dealt with extensively within the context of the total negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> I would ask the Senator not to forecast the demise of a very prominent international leader in the Soviet Union this soon.  Mr. Gorbachev requires the greatest possible international support in his efforts to deal with very complex and difficult problems.  While I am not lecturing anyone I do not think we in Ireland should tempt fate at this stage by suggesting that he cannot overcome what, admittedly, appears on many fronts to be insurmountable difficulties. Such difficulties have been approached and overcome in the last couple of years and I hope the same will happen this time.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deviate from the question but the Senator will recognise the contribution Mr. Gorbachev has made to bringing about changes in the world and in ending the Cold War.  He has also been very instrumental in bringing about the developments which have taken place in Eastern Europe.  The domestic problems in these countries are not as complex as those in his country.  I do not want to say much more about this other than to say I would not want the Senator's view to be taken as representative of the view of all people here.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Transport has had extensive contacts with major international airlines in recent months about inaugurating new services to Ireland from the US.  He is anxious to open up new gateways from the US into Ireland and see existing services expanded as a means of facilitating access for additional US visitors to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government's target of doubling tourism numbers in the period 1988-92 and, in the process, creating 25,000 new jobs is an ambitious one.  This target has been met so far but it gets more difficult each year.  The one area where we are underperforming is North America which is one of the prime tourist markets. There are obvious reasons for this under-performance at present, including the recession in the US and the weakness of the dollar.  Nonetheless we must continue to seek increased market share from the United States.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> In this context the Minister for Tourism and Transport has recently indicated to Aeroflot his approval for a fifth freedom service between Shannon and Miami.  I hope the new service which will commence in April next will bring many more US visitors to Ireland.  In addition, Delta Airlines have indicated that next summer their service from Atlanta to Shannon and Dublin will operate daily.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate to the House the commitment of the Government to the future development of Shannon Airport and the Shannon region as a major centre <Col N="664" /> of economic growth.  Like Senator Ó Foighil we would like to see dynamic regions like Shannon being developed throughout the country.</P>
