      <P>I have notice from Senator Shane Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to conduct a proper and orderly market in the Irish Government stocks which ensures that they are offered for sale to the public.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Pól Ó Foighil of the following matter:</P>
      <P>That the Minister for Health takes note of the complete lack of a proper service for the sufferers of Alzheimer's Disease and the lack of planning and commitment from the health boards for carers and respite programme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to urgently provide permanent accommodation and proper facilities for the pupils of St. Aidan's Christian Brothers Secondary School, Whitehall, Dublin 9, to replace the present totally inadequate prefabricated structure which has been in existence for over 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators <Col N="1782" /> Ross, Ó Foighil and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Ross and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Ó Foighil and Costello may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today: item No. 2 will be taken first and it is hoped to finish this item at about 5 p.m.  If it is finished by 5 p.m. we will move on to item No. 3, which is the Local Elections (Specification of Local Election Year) Order, 1990.  If we find that the Larceny Bill will not conclude by 6 o'clock we will adjourn discussion on that Bill until 8 p.m. and finish the Larceny Bill today.  It is proposed to take the Limerick Markets Bill at 6 p.m. until 6.30 p.m. and it is proposed to take the Fine Gael motion from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I congratulate Senator Fallon on his appointment as Leader of the House.  We all know him on this side of the House to be a very decent, straightforward and helpful person and we can assure him that he will have the full co-operation of the Fine Gael group in making the House work efficiently and, hopefully, in expanding the horizons of the House.  I hope that before very long he will be able to come to us not just with an agreed programme of work but also with ideas whereby the role of the House can be enhanced in a meaningful way.  I promise him our full co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pay my own tribute to the outgoing and former Leader of the House.  Over the past three years I found him at all times to be a person of great courtesy and decency and very straightforward in all his dealings with the Opposition.  It is unfortunate he has had to pay the penalty for mistakes which were not his but that is politics.  It is a rough business at times, but I want to assure him that he has the respect and good <Col N="1783" /> wishes of all Members, I am sure, of this side of the House.  We thank him for his help and courtesy over the previous years.</P>
    <P>We cannot agree to the Order of Business today for one very strong central reason, that is, that the use of Standing Order 90 in this case to recommit the Larceny Bill is, we believe, contrary to the spirit of the way in which these matters should be resolved.  On only two occasions in the past has a Bill been defeated in this House; the Bill to abolish PR in 1959 and in the mid-sixties the Pawnbrokers Bill, when the present Taoiseach was Minister for Justice.  On neither of those occasions was any recourse made to Standing Order 90, which we believe is a sneaky way of going against the constitutional spirit of what the role of the Seanad should be.  It is our strong view that the Larceny Bill should go ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Senator but to point out that what he is addressing at the moment I do not recall being ordered when the business was announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Leader of the House said it was intended to take the Larceny Bill today and it is my understanding from the Government Chief Whip that it is proposed to recommit to Committe Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest to you, in your own interest as well, that if that were to be the situation you might wait until it is confirmed for you because you could be speaking hypothetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I had a very clear and a very courteous intimation from the Government Chief Whip in the other House last Friday that that was the intention.  I bow to your judgment in this matter, but we want to discuss the question fully.  I thought the Order of Business was the appropriate place to do so.  If you say it can be <Col N="1784" /> deferred until later on, I will simply note now that we will be very strongly opposing this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, it was only that, if it does arise in the way that you perceive it, you might wish not to repeat yourself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Some things are worth repeating.  Is the Bill coming in to continue where it left off last week or is it proposed to recommit it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the contrary is shown, I have to take it that it is coming in at the point at which it was terminated the last day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps two debates could be prevented if the Leader of the House could clarify this point at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be my intention to move a recommittal notice at the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes more sense then if we combine both debates at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House is agreeable to that there is no difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point that essentially we would regard what is being proposed as contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.  The very clear intention is that if amendments are made in this House, whether they be sensible or daft does not really matter; if amendments are made they should go from this House, they should then be considered in a proper way by the other House and the final view taken there.  I think that the use of Standing Order 90 is not appropriate in the circumstances and for that reason we will be strongly opposing the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that there is a perception of the House that it is in a shambles at the moment.  There is a <Col N="1785" /> great perception of incompetence.  I was asked at the weekend if it was true that Fianna Fáil Senators were still on the roof.</P>
      <P>I would like to go along with the points made by Senator Manning.  In all my dealings with Senator Lanigan as Leader of the House, I found him to be honourable and dependable, despite the fact that we had many differences of opinion and rows.  I would like to put that on the record.  My differences of opinion with the previous Whip were well known.  I have not been attending the meetings of the Whips since last November because of the difference of opinion and the way I felt that I was being misrepresented.  I did indicate to the House that I felt this type of situation could not have continued. I now would like to make it clear &mdash; and I have made it clear to the new Chief Whip of the Government side &mdash; I will be attending and that the Independent group will be represented at Whips meetings from now on.  We wish to see the House working competently, effectively and efficiently and we will do all in our power to ensure that that is the case.</P>
      <P>I would also like to extend congratulations to the new Leader of the House, Senator Séan Fallon, and to assure him of my best co-operation.  Of course, there will be differences, there will be votes, there will be arguments, there will be rows.  That is the nature of politics, that is the nature of debate.  I would put forward the point of view that people in this House have all got different points of view on issues but that they all should have one guiding principle also and that is to make the House effective in its operation.  By taking that point aboard it should be possible, if not to reconcile all differences, at least to promote those points of agreement and to make progress in that way.</P>
      <P>I would also like to extend congratulations to my colleague from Dingle, Senator Tom Fitzgerald, on his elevation to the position of Assistant Whip and to wish him well in that post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> We are now faced with the first argument: the proposal on the Order of Business today to have an item recommitted. I would also like to put on record &mdash; and I would wish the Leader of the House and Chief Whip to take it on board to save the question being asked over the next six months &mdash; that the Independent group operate as a group.  For people on both sides of the House who do not know the difference between a group and a party, I would advise them to read the Standing Orders and they would all then be aware of the fact that the Independent group are an Independent group for the purposes of the Standing Orders of the House as outlined by the Standing Orders of the House, and for no other purpose. That is not a difficult matter to accept or to understand.  We are not a party.  In fact, there is no mention of parties in the Standing Orders of this House or in the Constitution, which governs the operation of this House.  The fact that some Members of some groups happen also to be members of a party is a matter of pure coincidence as far as the Constitution is concerned.  We should note that fact and operate on that basis.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the Order of Business, we hope the Government side will make every opportunity to clear some of the outstanding business which is now on the Order Paper, which is extraordinarily long.  That means that the nettle must be grasped on a number of issues.  I repeat again the need to extend Private Members' time.  I do not believe it is a threat to Government, I do not believe it is a threat to the operation of the House, I do not believe it is a threat to the legislative programme of the Government that there should be more Private Members' time allowed in the House.  I ask the Leader of the House, as a first request from here, to consider disposing of Private Members' Business on a weekly basis &mdash; in other words, to have a three hour debate per week; to propose it and dispose of it in a week.  It is not something on which I expect a yes or a no from the Leader of the House in his reply to me, but I am putting it on the record.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" /> On the question of the recommittal, I think it is quite clear that the Government have been seriously embarrassed by the decision of the House here last week. It is important to record that it was a decision of the House.  It is also important to recognise that the Government party are quite entitled under the Standing Orders of the House to recommit. Nobody is denying that fact; there is no question of using any questionable tactics. The Government were defeated last week on a procedure and they are now fighting back with another procedural reply.  Those are the rules of the House, that is the way they operate and nobody can object to what they are trying to do. However, what we do object to, and the reason we would also object to the recommittal, is the reason for it.  We believe it has only peripherally got to do with the nature of the amendment and has far more to do with the fact that the Government do not wish to have to discuss this matter again in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Standing Order is there in order to allow some serious mistake to be retrieved.  There is no mistake in this case.  The House properly, democratically, under this Standing Order and through the structures of the House, decided to reject a certain aspect of the legislation.  The operational rule is that it should now go back to the Dáil; it should be considered in the Dáil again. It is quite clear that many of the matters which it will raise are matters which the Government do not wish to consider in the Dáil and that it is in an effort to avoid debate as opposed to an effort to institute debate that the Government have decided to propose the recommittal.</P>
    <P>I would certainly say that they should just take their medicine at this stage. They were defeated last week for whatever reason &mdash; it was gone into all over the place last week and everbody knows the ins and outs and stories about it.  I think they should just take their medicine, bring the Bill back to the Dáil, deal with it there, face the debate and the objection there and come back here with <Col N="1788" /> the amended Bill when we can deal with it again.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if Senator Manning proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  There is a slight procedural problem here.  I understand we are dealing with the Order of Business and that it is proposed to take the Larceny Bill, followed if time permits by the Local Elections Order, followed by the Limerick Markets Bill, then the Private Members' motion on Telefís na Gaeltachta, with a return if necessary to the Larceny Bill at 8 p.m.  We do not object to that.  I find it impossible to have a debate on the Order of Business to include what I understand to be the first proposal coming from the other side under the heading of the Larceny Bill: a motion under Standing Order 90.  I am not sure how we can vote for the Order of Business and vote in opposition to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the fear I had at the outset.  I understood initially that the Order of Business was proposed in the normal way by the Leader of the House.  When I interrupted Senator Manning it was to point out to him that there was no motion to recommit the Larceny Bill and that he might wish to leave it until such a motion was formally put.  The Leader of the House has indicated he proposes to put such a motion but until that is done, which I understand will obviously be after the Order of Business, and has been concluded, it is not at this time part of the Order of Business.  We are dealing only with the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the clarification. The position there is quite clear. From my own point of view I would have no difficulty with supporting the Order of Business.  However, on the basis that the Larceny Bill covers two items, the first of which is the proposal under Standing Order 90 to recommit certain amendments and sections of the Larceny Bill, I certainly would be opposing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, is it <Col N="1789" /> not a fact &mdash; and I look for your guidance on this &mdash; that the motion we have come to expect in relation to Standing Order 90 dealing with the Larceny Bill should be on the Order Paper as a motion as such?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In the circumstances there is provision for the motion to be moved without notice.  That can be done at any stage.  Clearly, the Order of Business is being dealt with at this time without that motion having been put as part of the Order of Business.  I now call Senator Pat Upton in order of the arrangmeents we concerned ourselves with last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  At the outset I want to congratulate Senator Fallon on his appointment as Leader of the House. I wish him well and assure him of our co-operation in his work.  I also look forward to co-operating with him particularly in relation to new initiatives he might introduce to make this House a more effective part of the whole constitutional process. I would also like to extend my congratulations to Senator G. V. Wright and to Senator Tom Fitzgerald.</P>
      <P>I must say I am sorry to see Senator Lanigan go.  I always found the Senator to be an exceptionally pleasant, decent and honourable person and on a personal level I very much regret the fact that he is no longer Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the previous speakers we, too, will certainly be opposing this Standing Order 90 stratagem as a means of rectifying what happened last week.  There are a variety of reasons for doing this. The notice we are being given is certainly very short.  The Seanad is meant, as I understand it, to work as part of a whole process of checks and balances and this stratagem which is being used is simply being used as a damage limitation exercise to try to cut down on the amount of harm which was done to the Seanad by the proceedings here last week.  Certainly, I find this kind of strategy irreconcilable with the notion that the Seanad is going to be afforded the proper level of dignity and respect it is entitled to as <Col N="1790" /> part of the whole constitutional process. For those reasons we will be opposing this strategy being used by the Government party this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity, as the other Fianna Fáil Senator from County Westmeath, to congratulate Senator Seán Fallon on his appointment.  He has brought great honour indeed to our county and to his family with his appointment.  Going back to 1967 as a member of Westmeath County Council, he is, I can honestly say, one of the most hardworking, dedicated public representatives we have had in our county for quite a long time.  He has our total support and I would like to wish him well in his appointment.  Having said that, I would also like to wish Senators G. V. Wright and Tom Fitzgerald the best of luck and success and assure them of full co-operation from me personally in their work and endeavours as Whip and Deputy Whip.</P>
      <P>As a Senator here for eight years, under the stewardship of Senator Mick Lanigan, I would like to pay my tribute to him.  I knew him first on the hurling field with his great county, Kilkenny.  He has been a tower of strength to me personally since I arrived here as a young Member and I want to thank him for all the kindness and courtesy he has shown to me.  In regard to the other officers, Senator Paddy McGowan, and the other two Assistant Whips in their term here in this Seanad, I want to thank them for the great services and kindness shown to me as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to ask the new Leader of the House if he has any further comments with regard to item No. 87, which refers to the question of the addressing of both Houses of the Oireachtas by Mr. Nelson Mandela.  I quite understand that the last day it was not possible to give a clear answer.  I wish it would be done because I understand that the reason given &mdash; that Nelson Mandela is not a Head of State &mdash; did not operate when Nelson Mandela addressed both Houses of the American Congress. <Col N="1791" /> I also understand from authoritative sources that this is being construed as a snub in senior circles in the ANC.  I believe this House has a perfect right to be present and to be addressed by a gentleman who is to be made a citizen of this city.  I ask you, Sir, to take this matter up as a matter of urgency and as a very serious matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the ordering of business, I would like of course first to congratulate you, Sir, on your appointment as Leader of the House, through the Cathaoirleach, and to say that I cannot give you the <i>carte blanche</i> that has been so emotionally presented to you by some of my colleagues because I respect you&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not expect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as somebody with both a sharp mind and a sharp tongue.  I shall co-operate with you, Sir, when I think it is appropriate.  I do not imagine you would expect me to co-operate when I thought it was inappropriate, when I thought that you were wrong.  Of course, when you are &mdash; on the many occasions I have no doubt you will be &mdash; absolutely in the right, you will find me to be a constructive Member of a constructive Opposition group in this House.  As such, I would like to point out that although I was the Member who aimed the gun and pulled the trigger &mdash; a gun which had been ably loaded by Senator Joe Costello, assisted by Senator Dan Neville &mdash; I have some understanding of the Government's position and it would be appropriate for me to say in support of what my colleagues&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a speech.  It is less of a speech, may I say, with great respect to yourself, Sir &mdash; a respect which I cannot always extend to the Government's benches &mdash; than many of the contributions that were made here, but perhaps it is more telling.  Perhaps that is why it is not liked.  I think they should <Col N="1792" /> wait until they hear the substance of what I am going to say.  My colleague, Senator Joe O'Toole, was perfectly correct when he said this was a procedural device by the Government.  Of course, it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, a point of order, are we discussing here the Order of Business or the proposed amendment?  Are we going to rehash the whole thing again?  If we are discussing the Order of Business here, let us get on with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House, Senator Fallon, is to move the motion after the Order of Business has been made known and, consequently, it is being referred to in that context.  It is convoluted, but it must be taken in the form we have been dealing with it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. I appreciate your ruling and I understand it.  I hope it is understood on the Government side.  I mentioned this was a procedural tactic, a manoeuvre by the Government.  Of course, it is.  It is a perfectly appropriate one.  Why should I deny them this capacity since it was a tactical procedural manoeuvre that I employed against the Government &mdash; in my opinion perfectly correctly &mdash; on the last day.  The Standing Orders, as interpreted in discussion in this House this afternoon, indicate that such an employment of Standing Order 90 may be used to rectify a mistake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of getting the Order of Business concluded I would ask you, as I have asked other Members, not to deal with something that is not formally put to the House because, quite honestly, it seems a waste of your time and everybody else's at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not dealing with the substance; I am dealing with the procedural matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedural matters have not been invoked as of now <Col N="1793" /> and they will only become relevant when the motion is formally proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I take your guidance and I will reserve the opportunity to speak again on the procedural matter.  I will, I may say, also wish to address the substance at the appropriate time; and I do know the appropriate time and I will have quite a lot to say at that point.</P>
      <P>I would like, finally, to refer to a point that was raised by Senator Manning and express my concern.  He mentioned in his contribution, during which he was not interrupted, that he has been informed by the Government Chief Whip in the other House.  I wonder, Sir, if you take as seriously as I do the constant implications we have that there is an interference in the business of this House by the Chief Whip in the other House.  Perhaps I misinterpreted this, but I would be very interested to hear something on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, absolutely finally, I would like to add to the genuine tributes that have been paid to the former Leader of the House, Senator Mick Lanigan.  The words that other people have used are the words that have automatically sprung to the lips of everybody who has spoken from this side of the House: &ldquo;decent and honourable&rdquo; and certainly this is something that can be said of Senator Lanigan &mdash; decent, honourable, approachable.  It cannot be said of all of us &mdash; and I include myself &mdash; that there is not a malicious bone in their body; it can certainly be said of Senator Lanigan, and I regret on a personal basis that he has had to leave this office.  However, could I say that, as Shakespeare said in a play which for superstitious reasons I will not mention in this House lest it bring upon me bad luck, &ldquo;Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it.&rdquo;  He behaved in a most gracious way at a difficult time when he accepted responsibility as the captain of a team and, as a former sportsman, I think Senator Lanigan understood exactly what that meant.  I compliment him on the years I have had the pleasure and privilege of knowing him in this <Col N="1794" /> House and on the very graceful way in which he left a job to which he brought certain particular human qualities that were appreciated on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I crave your indulgence and I hope to be more brief than the learned Senator opposite.  We in the Progressive Democrats also welcome the appointment of Senator Fallon as Leader of the House and we congratulate him. During my time in this House, and I know I speak for my colleagues on this, he has always behaved very courteously towards us and I know that he will fulfil his job very well.  He can look forward to our co-operation in fulfilling his duties.</P>
      <P>I would also like to join with the other tributes that have been paid to Senator Lanigan.  I knew Senator Lanigan shortly before I arrived in this House.  Outside and in the House both I and my colleagues have been treated with nothing but the utmost courtesy.  In every respect he has been kind to us.  We thank him for that and I wish him well in whatever activities he continues to pursue in the Seanad and outside it.  I would also like, on behalf of my colleagues, to congratulate Senator G. V. Wright and Senator Tom Fitzgerald on their appointment as Whips.</P>
      <P>I hope now we can finally get on to the proper business of this House, that is to fulfil its legislative programme.  I know that the Leader will do everything in his power to facilitate that.  I would not know what <i>carte blanche</i> was, we would probably need córas aistriúcháin to elucidate that for us, but I take Senator Norris's point.  We, for our part, look forward to co-operating with the Leader of the House.</P>

I have also found Senator Farrell and Senator Lanigan courteous and helpful at all times and I want to put that on the record.  I want to congratulate Senator Fallon, Senator Wright and Senator Fitzgerald on their appointments and hope we will have a happy and productive relationship from now on.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Order of Business, I want to raise a matter in relation to motions Nos. 44, 48 and 50.  These are motions relating to one aspect or other of the prison service.  I raised this matter the last day on the Order of Business and the then Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan, agreed he would speak to me afterwards.  I requested at the time that a statement should be allowed by the leaders of the groups in relation to the prison situation arising out of the rooftop protests, the various crises, the visiting committee report and particularly arising out of the publication of the annual prison report which was issued last Friday.  I asked that the Leader of the House would take that into consideration and either allow a statement to be made or else allow time for a debate on the issue. Senator Lanigan was to come back to me on it but I understand that in the circumstances that would have been rather difficult.  I hope the new Leader of the House will address that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the request for Nelson Mandela to address the other House, I think it is a snub to this House that we are not being included in the address.  In fact, the request was made first in this House that Nelson Mandela be invited to this House before it was made in the other House.  It is improper that an excuse should be put forward as to why <Col N="1796" /> the two Houses should not be addressed by Nelson Mandela.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other little matter that is causing some dispute, that is the Larceny Bill, I must say I am amazed at what is happening here today because we have on the Order of Business the statement that Report Stage will be resumed and now we find that it will be subject to Standing Order 90.  Of course, in relation to that we also have Standing Order 91 which allows for a response at least from a Senator who opposes the motion.  No notice of that has been given to us.</P>

      <P>The last item I wanted to raise is in relation to the overall Order of Business.  One of the biggest problems in the House is that there has been no legislative programme, there has been no clear indication to Senators as to where we are going from one end of the session to the other.  A lot of the frustration that has been caused, a lot of the trouble that has arisen in this House has been due to that fact.  Senators, particularly on this side of the House, feel they are being treated unfairly, that they do not know from time to time what is coming up, that <Col N="1797" /> there is no opportunity to debate motions and Bills on the Order Paper.  Unless and until we have a proper structuring of the Order of Business, I believe it will be very difficult to have proper co-operation on both sides of the House.  I address those remarks particularly to the new Leader of the House so that we can get moving on a positive note from now on.</P>

I am particularly pleased to note that every Member who spoke here today paid tribute to the previous Leader of the House, Senator Langian. All the words used were genuine and they could not be anything else because Senator Lanigan is a gentleman and without malice.  I regret this has happened to him; he has accepted the blame publicly for something that I do not believe was his fault.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the Order of Business and what is likely to crop up &mdash; if I am out of order, a Chathaoirligh, I will be pleased if you will bring me to order &mdash; Senator Norris made reference to the business of last week and the matter that caused some problem.  He made a long speech and quoted Shakespeare.  At that stage I felt like using the words of Brendan Behan.</P>

      <P>When I require Senator McKenna's advice on the phrasing of my speech, I will ask him.  In the meantime, I would be glad if you would teach him some manners.  Apparently, the Taoiseach in his directions to the party last week forgot to tell them to behave themselves.  I would like also to extend my good wishes indeed, as always, to Senator Lanigan and to endorse what has been said about him.  He and I met each other first in a somewhat abrasive encounter, he will recall, in 1977 but I like to think we became friends and remained friends thereafter.</P>
      <P>I am very glad the Taoiseach has at last shown a serious interest in this House.  I have frequently referred to the fact that the Taoiseach's interest in Seanad Éireann heretofore has been confined to gala occasions.  However, I welcome this new interest, más maith is mithid.  I am only sorry that his reforming zeal cannot be applied retrospectively and that it was felt apparently only when the party discipline began to crumble, not when the interest of the Seanad as a whole was at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respect your ruling on the other matter but I really just wanted to make a very brief point, simply to endorse what Senator Manning said, that though the Government are perfectly within their rights and within Standing Orders in moving recommittal they are, I think, morally in contempt of the House.  The impression was given here last week by the Minister that somehow the fact that <Col N="1799" /> the amendment was passed was irresponsible. There was a total ignoring of the fact that it is the constitutional right of the Seanad to pass amendments like this, even though it does entail inconvenience. The Constitution does not anywhere spell out the word inconvenience. I believe that recommitting this matter is an attempt to short-cut the consitutional process even though Standing Orders provide for it legally and I repeat I will oppose it because I believe that the irresponsibility really lies on those who tried to get back by the back door what was fairly, legally and constitutionally passed last week.</P>

      <P>I want to join in the words of congratulations to Senator Fallon, Senator Wright and Senator Fitzgerald on their promotion and I look forward to working with them in harmony and goodwill.  I want also to express my appreciation of the co-operation I got from Senator Lanigan, Senator McGowan and Senator Farrell.  We may have found at times that there were issues which we had to work hard at resolving, but at the end of the day we did resolve them.  There was good co-operation there and I want to thank them for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want in particular to be associated with the tribute that has been paid to Senator Lanigan and may I repeat the very many compliments which have been paid already.  I agree with every word that has been said as a genuine tribute to him.  We came into the Seanad the same day, and practically on the same count and indeed I have nothing but the utmost <Col N="1800" /> respect for him during the years since then.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, may I say I am very conscious of the fact that it was the absence of the Members from the House that has led to the problems which have arisen in the case of Senator Lanigan and his two other colleagues.  On that point, I am reminded of a statement made by the late James Dillon.  It may have been made by others also but I am referring to that particular gentleman because of the resounding way he could say things.  He made the statement that it is an honour for any person to serve in the Parliament of their country and that is something that should be borne in mind.  There are 3.75 million people in this country and of that number only 60 at any time are privileged to serve in this House.  I believe that privilege carries responsibility and respect for the position.  May I say that I have been concerned, particularly in recent years, at the attitude of some of my colleagues, and this is not confined to any particular side of the House either.  It often appears that these seats are too hot to sit on and that people find it difficult and often try to avoid coming into them.  I feel it is necessary to make that point.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat the statement that I made earlier which was, of course, the statement of a very fine parliamentarian. It is an honour to serve in the Parliament of one's country.  I think that respect for that position and that privilege alone should encourage a top-class performance by Members of this House.  If it does not, there is another point that should be borne in mind and that is that there are hundreds out there that would be very glad to occupy these seats and serve the interests of their constituents.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to get clarification on a point.  We agreed at the Whips meeting earlier today to take the Limerick Markets Bill from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  If it is not taken today.  I understand it will lapse.  I want confirmation that if by any chance the debate on Second Stage is not concluded at 6.30 p.m. that there is no problem in relation to the Bill, that it still stands on the Order Paper.</P>

Tá mé ag druidim i dtreo meánaoise ó thaobh mo bhallraíochta den Teach seo agus ó thaobh mo bhallraíochta den chine daonna.  Dúirt an Seanadóir Murphy rud éigin nár chuala mé agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil sé níos fearr nár chuala mé é.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to compliment Senator Fallon on his appointment and, at the risk of repeating myself but it is a form of repetition that I am sure you will permit, to join in the tributes to Senator Lanigan.  He knows without my saying much that what I say is sincerely meant and I say that as one who has had many spectacular confrontations with him here.  I know the difference between a political row and a personal vendetta.  I do think that it is a pity that this House cannot address the fundamental question in detail of what is wrong in this House. I accept the indications of goodwill which have been offered both inside and outside the House from the Government side that we will do better, but we do not have a legislative programme.  We do not yet know what we will do in a fortnight's time.  We will perhaps know soon and it may well have been agreed but we have progress to make.  May I say, since perhaps they are not allowed to say it, that it would help a lot if we did not have an impression in this House that Fianna Fáil Senators are perpetually silenced by Ministers to get business through quickly and if they were allowed and encouraged to take a full part in debates as the previous Coalition Government allowed and encouraged we would have a much more vibrant Seanad.  To have 31 Senators from one party who seem to be subdued and silenced to the extent that very often they do not know what business we are doing is unfair to them and unfair to this House and I suggest that if the Minister is pushed they should not allow themselves to be pushed.  They have rights too. I am opposed to the Order of Business for the reasons that have already been <Col N="1802" /> given and, therefore, I will be supporting Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>May I say in conclusion, however, that I regret the fact that four very decent people on the Government side were forced to resign because of a mistake.  If we are to restore this House to its previous position we have to go a bit further, may I repeat, because once it is said it cannot be unsaid, that we can only restore this House if you, even at this stage, Sir, choose to resign.</P>

The words &ldquo;abrasive&rdquo; and &ldquo;garrulous&rdquo; have been used.  If I had been garrulous or abrasive I might not have got into this situation. May I assure the House, and in particular the new Leader of the House and the new Whip and Assistant Whip, that I will be totally behind them in their efforts to ensure that this House gets back to what it was in the old days.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach, the former Cathaoirligh and the staff of the House.  I would like to compliment Senators McGowan, Wright and Farrell for the work they have done over the past number of years.  For many years, in previous Seanaid, I had only one Whip, and that was Senator Willie Ryan, and he had one assistant at one stage, Senator Sean Haughey.  I would like to thank everybody, particularly the leaders of the Opposition with whom I dealt and, when I was in Opposition, the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that this House regains its self-respect and it is only from inside this House that that can be done.  I commit myself with the whole House, I hope, to regaining the confidence of the people in this House and I know that <Col N="1803" /> under the leadership of Seán Fallon this can be done.  I thank Senators for their kind comments.  I shall do my utmost to ensure that this House plays its proper role as part of the legislative structure.</P>

I greatly regret he is no longer in that position and I regret the circumstances which have led to it.</P>
      <P>Unlike Senator Murphy, I did not welcome the intervention of the Taoiseach in the affairs of this House during the last week.

      <P>On a point of order, we had a meeting of the Whips at 1 o'clock today and, as I understand it, the only items that are before us on the Order of Business are the Larceny Bill, 1989, the Local Elections (Specification of Local Election Year) Order, 1990, the Limerick Markets Bill, 1989 and Private Members' business.  If that is the Order of Business we will not be voting against it.  We will, however, when the motion comes up be voting against the motion.</P>

He did not interfere with this House and I think it is despicable that Senator Ross should have even suggested it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to thank all the Senators for their expressions of congratulations and I know that those good wishes will be matched with what might be an easy way of life for me.  Hopefully, that will be the case.  I would have to say publicly, as I have said many times, that I pay tribute to Michael Lanigan, the former Leader. He has been a friend of mine for many years, long before we went into politics. At all times, he had my support, my loyalty and my admiration for the man has not diminished one iota as a result of what has happened.  Equally, in the case of Senator McGowan and Senator Farrell, I want to congratulate them for the job they were doing very well.</P>
      <P>On the order of Business, Senator Manning referred in anticipation of what might happen, or to what is on some Order Paper, not the Official Order Paper.  My understanding, and it may cover points made by Senator O'Toole and other Senators, is that while the recommittal procedure has never been invoked in respect of amendments already disposed of on Report Stage, there is a precedent in the Dáil in the case of the Judicial Separation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further point made by Senator Manning is, if amendments agreed to on Report Stage are undone, say, on recommittal, it could not be said that the Dáil is being denied any constitutional right to consider amendments made by the Seanad.  Whether the Seanad has made <Col N="1807" /> amendments to a Dáil Bill does not arise until the Seanad has passed the Bill and the message to the Dáil with the Bill and amendments has been returned to the Dáil for its consideration.  That is covered under Standing Orders 116 and 118.</P>

      <P>Among other things that were suggested was a three hour debate each week.  I am not sure that will happen.  I will think about it and come back to the House on it.  Senator Doyle had a query as to why a motion in relation to the appropriate Standing Order was not on the Order Paper.  I have checked that matter out and have given the explanation.  The points made by Senator Upton and Senator Cassidy have been covered.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to Nelson Mandela.  My understanding is, as he said, that as Nelson Mandela is not a head of State protocol demands that we are not to be represented, in the matter, much as I and others would like to be.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis supported the view of most of us that we proceed with the full legislative programme of the House.  He can have my assurance on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Harte had a query which was not appropriate to the Order of Business. Senator Costello referred, among other things, to prison matters.  It is something I will discuss with him.  In particular, he referred to the prison report.  I suggest to the Senator that it might be a matter he would consider putting down in Private Members' time.  Senator Hanafin <Col N="1808" /> referred to other questions which were not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>I have noted Senator Murphy's point. Senator Jackman referred to the committee. I am not sure of that.  I will check it out but it is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard paid tribute to Senator Lanigan and others.  He also referred to the Limerick Markets Bill.  In relation to that Bill, which is a private Bill, I would like to point out that the Second Stage of the last four Private Bills were passed without debate.  However, to facilitate some Senators who may wish to speak, I have suggested that the Second Stage be taken at 6 p.m. this evening until 6.30 p.m.  That has been agreed with the Whips.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan talked about the question of a legislative programme. On that point we can find out what is the programme by checking the Dáil Order Paper.  Bills that are there will come to us soon.  Hopefully, more legislation will come to us and will be given time.  The Finance Bill will be debated here in two weeks' time.  I accept the points made, that Senators would like to know in advance what legislation is coming on and I will try to keep the House informed on that point.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan made his own contribution. The final speaker was Senator Ross, who had no comment to make on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Larceny Bill, 1989: Motion to Recommit.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Larceny Bill, 1989, be recommitted in respect of the new section inserted by amendment No. 1 on Report, section 3, amendment No. 2 and related amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of this motion is to put right the unsatisfactory state in which the Larceny Bill was left after the two <Col N="1809" /> contradictory votes last week on amendment No. 2.  The outcome of that is that as things now stand the Seanad has decided to delete words from the Bill but has also decided not to replace them.  We, therefore, have an incomplete sentence in the Bill which, if let stand, would have to be disapproved of by the Dáil.  It would then be necessary to return the Bill to the Seanad in order to take appropriate action.  In other words, the Bill has been left by the proceedings of last week in a clearly defective state and recommittal is necessary to give the Seanad an opportunity to correct the situation.  It will also facilitate the early enactment of this important Bill on the principle of which all sides of both Houses have declared their agreement.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 was grouped for discussion with amendment No. 2 on Report Stage last week because the subject matter of both amendments is closely related.  It would be unreasonable, therefore, to recommit amendment No. 2 and not at the same time permit the discussion on amendment No. 3 to be re-opened. That is why the motion to recommit includes amendment No. 3 as well.</P>
    <P>The recommittal procedure also gives the House an opportunity to reconsider its decision on amendment No. 1, the effect of which would be to decriminalise a form of blackmail.  Having had an opportunity to reflect on the effect of amendment No. 1 the House will welcome the opportunity to reconsider its decision.</P>

      <P>Standing Order 91 provides for the Leader of the House to propose the motion and make an explanatory statement.  He has done that. It also provides for opposing Senators to make their contributions.  I am anxious that that will occur and that the various groups will have their representatives speak in opposition to the motion rather than having everybody contribute.  If we take the latter formula, we are not going to make any progress.</P>

I have studied the Standing Order carefully.  There is no intention on this side of the House to lengthen this more than is necessary.  I have no intention of speaking on the motion but I believe that we should allow the debate to proceed without ruling that there will be only one from each group.  It would be regressive and I appeal to you to delay making that decision.  Is it necessary to make that ruling at this point?  I appeal that you would let this thing simply take its course and perhaps rule if you feel it necessary in a while.</P>

It is with that in mind and the wish to avoid that that I feel if I get the support of the House it will not be necessary to make the ruling.</P>

      <P>Motions and amendments, save such as are allowed by these Standing Orders to be proposed without notice, shall be in writing, signed by a Senator as proposer and another Senator as seconder.  Motions and amendments may not be moved on a day unless they shall have reached the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the fourth preceding day in the case of motions and not later than 11 a.m. on the second preceding day in the case of amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>What this House needs like a hole in the head at the moment is a wrangle on procedure.  As an indication of our goodwill in this matter and our desire to see the business of the House, not expedited, not rushed through but at least back in operation, we will offer only one speaker on this and I will be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sympathy with the point made by Senator Fallon.  The case he makes is a reasonable one, that there is a certain sense of defectiveness about the Bill as it would be sent to the other House in its present state.  However, against that, <Col N="1812" /> there is what I think is a stronger principle and that is the principle that when an amendment has been made in this House made properly, under proper procedures, it is preferable that the normal course as envisaged in the Constitution takes place and that the Bill goes back to the other House where it can then be considered.  For that reason we have a conflict here.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the case made by Senator Fallon.  However, we will be opposing it.  I am not going to elaborate.  In my earlier statement I said why we opposed it; for that reason we will be opposing it.  I also say I do not want to get the House bogged down in procedural wrangles at this stage.  I want to see the House back to discussing the substance of the Bill as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Manning has said is more or less my own position. I can understand the position of the Government.  I do not think there could be any hard feelings with the employment of a tactical manoeuvre.  This situation was created by a tactical manoeuvre.  As I understand it, among the reasons the Government would wish to put forward is that the impact of amendment No. 1 that was successful is probably directly contrary to the intentions of those who put it down and is, therefore, confusing.</P>
      <P>I do not want to get into the substance of this issue.  I merely draw the attention of the House to how this arose.  It arose because it was a voice vote.  That is an important point.  I would like to point out that I did not, in fact, either propose or second the amendment.  There is no inconsistency in whatever stance I may subsequently decide to take with regard to the substance of the amendment which has caused the referral of this Bill.  It is a very sophisticated point of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened over the past few days is a classic example of what is wrong with the Seanad.  I do not intend to apportion blame to any side here.  It is not particularly the Government's fault, except that they were caught napping.  I would like to put in a sentence here.  I think the public perception of what went <Col N="1813" /> on is incorrect.  It is not correct to say that nobody was doing their job in Leinster House that day.  Many people like myself were listening on the monitor.  I managed to get here in time and speak.  I really do think it behoves everybody on every side of the House to say that people do their job not alone in this Chamber but also in their offices where they are consulting with constituents, on the telephone to constituents, writing letters and listening to the monitor.  That point needs to be made.</P>
    <P>Anybody who feels that Fianna Fáil alone are guilty of dereliction of duty should consult the record of the House. I will say no more because I am going to have to work more closely with people on this side of the House than perhaps with people on the other side of the House.  All sides of the House have been in some difficulty.</P>
    <P>However, the real problem &mdash; and this addresses directly this procedural problem &mdash; is that this is a sort of delicate, sophisticated legislation that cannot satisfactorily be dealt with in an <i>ad hoc</i> way. There will be people coming into the House and voting on issues they do not fully understand.  You may have people on both sides doing so.  This Bill and matters like it should be in committee.</P>
    <P>I have looked at this very carefully and there is a clear argument, but it is a very refined argument, in favour of Senator Costello's amendment and I will try in my contribution on the main part of the debate to deal with this issue.  I understand the Government's motivation quite clearly.  It is an honourable one and one that is perfectly justified.  I think, however, Senator Costello can sustain an argument.  How strong that argument is remains to be seen this afternoon.  This kind of legislation should be dealt with in committee.  I believe we have a Minister who is amenable to good sense.  I am sure he must be aware as I am of the irony of himself appealing to the concept of blackmail when they have singularly failed to reform the law internationally known as the blackmailers charter.  I will leave it at that because I think it is important, long-winded as I tend to be, to <Col N="1814" /> get beyond this procedural stage into the main discussion by a vote.</P>
    <P>The main point is, if we are all serious &mdash; and I believe that Senator Fallon is serious and the Fianna Fáil people are very much committed to making the House run efficiently &mdash; we must look at a committee system of discussion where the technical intricacies of a Bill can be teased out by those who have a real interest in it and who are prepared to do the homework necessary to understand what is going on.  We will avoid this kind of wrangle if we do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I would like to make.  One of them is certainly that what happened the other day is not unprecedented.  I saw it happening in the early seventies.  I meant to check it today but I had not the time; I think it was the Forcible Entry Bill that was being introduced by Deputy O'Malley.  At the time there was an outcry from all sorts of groups that all the liberties of people were to be taken away; that it was the end almost of a type of society and it would have terrible consequences. At that time when Senator Cranitch finished speaking the Cathaoirleach looked to the Opposition benches and there was no one there, just as happened here last week.  It is a thing that can happen; it is also something that should not happen.  There was another case when Senator Dooge was Cathaoirleach. It can happen and it has happened. None of us likes the feeling of being wrong.  If we were wrong on this side quite a considerable number of Senators on the other side were also wrong.</P>
      <P>In studying the words that were deleted I begin to wonder if the Senators knew what they were at.  My advice is &mdash; and I take it from somebody I have great respect for and who is respected in the legal profession &mdash; that what they did was to take away the protection for homosexuals that was in the Bill.  That is what they have succeeded in doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the legal opinion <Col N="1815" /> I have received and I have very good reason to respect that opinion.  That is what they succeeded in doing.  I do not believe they meant to do that.  Blackmail is the lowest crime there is and I do not know if there is a sentence long enough for the blackmailer.  Homosexuals have suffered in the past from blackmailers.  It is dreadful to think of what they may have gone through because of blackmail. No matter what the crime involved may be, blackmail is a horrible thing.  I do not know if the Senators realised what they were at because that is exactly what they have done.  They have done away with the protection the section afforded to homosexuals against blackmail.  It is a very good reason for putting this through now.</P>

It did not enter any of our heads that anyone would want to delete the words.  No one denies Senators the right to use any parliamentary tactic they see fit to use.  It certainly never occurred to me or to anybody else that Senators would want to delete such a section.  What should be done is to have the section amended without delay and then we should forget the whole business because nobody came out with honours last week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify the position, I understand we are currently dealing with the motion under Standing Order No. 91 regarding the recommittal of this Bill.  I want to make a couple of brief points.  It is quite clear and unequivocal that the motion before the House is proper and correct.  I am surprised that there has been some dissent and objection to it by the other side, both from Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> The first time this motion was used and this precedent established in parallel circumstances was in the other House less than two years ago when on the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill the eminent and well-respected lawyer and parliamentarian, Deputy Alan Shatter, used this tactic successfully and with the whole-hearted support of Labour.  It is very unbecoming that within such a short period of time that particular Senators on the Labour side should have such severe objections.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to endorse what my friend, Senator Des Hanafin, has said, that the implications of the amendment which succeeded on the last occasion here were not fully understood.  I fully support the point he made.  We are not talking purely about protection for homosexuals. It could be rapists or other people.  That point should be made.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Cathaoirleach.  We are at this juncture discussing whether this motion be accepted.  That should be decided first and if the motion is accepted, we can then debate the relevance of amendments.  I would urge that rather than prolong the debate, covering ground already ploughed, the question should be put as to whether the motion is accepted and if it is accepted, we should then deal with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity of speaking.  I was the person who put down the amendment.  Everybody seems to be an expert on it now and seems to take responsibility or credit as the case may be.  When I was here in the House with Senator Neville we were looking on all sides for support.  It is amazing what you can hear after the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Larceny Bill was introduced some time ago.  I put down 24 amendments to that Bill because I regarded it as being a very inadequate updating of the Larceny Act of 1916.  I debated them here with the Minister and again we were virtually on our own on this and the other side of the House.  I remember quite well facilitating the Minister when the now Chief Whip, Senator Wright, requested me, so <Col N="1817" /> that the Minister could get out to a meeting he had to attend at 5.30 p.m.  I do not like to be criticised as the House was criticised on the last day for in some way obstructing the Minister and delaying the process of this Bill because I certainly did not obstruct it and I was the person who was dealing with the greatest amount of amendments and taking the Bill through the House for the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>May I point out in relation to amendment No. 1 that the amendment is seeking to delete a particular offence, which is, as it is put, the abominable crime in relation to homosexual acts.  What is being done is to assert that crime in the Bill and then to perpetuate the protection against blackmailing.  Already in the civil law there is protection against blackmail. Why perpetuate it and assert it in the new Larceny Bill, especially since the Law Reform Commission has urged that it be deleted?  That is what we are talking about.  It is a desirable amendment because it is a deletion of a section of the old 1916 Act and that deletion is recommended specifically by the Law Reform Commission.  There is very good reason for allowing that amendment to stand.</P>
    <P>I have been extremely surprised that this Standing Order is being introduced at this time.  I remember quite clearly hearing on the radio that a question was asked in the Dáil of the Taoiseach as to what he was going to do in relation to the Larceny Bill now that amendments had been put through in the Seanad and he said he would bring it back to the Dáil and would deal with it in the Dáil.  Suddenly we find that is not what is to happen.  What are we to believe?</P>

      <P>The motion was properly put, there was no Government Senator in the House at the time and the motion was passed.  A subsequent division took place, a second amendment was put and was carried.  Those two amendments were properly put and properly carried. The Government are now trying to overturn them by means of a Standing Order which was introduced as a beneficial and a positive order that would allow some situation that needed rectification to be remedied.  It was not intended to obstruct the business of this House as properly conducted and properly voted on.  That is why I am opposing this Standing Order at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an obstructionist means, it is a negative one, it is not in the spirit of the Standing Order.  If somebody stands up, as one or two Senators have done, and states that it is in line with previous use of similar Standing Orders in relation to the Dáil, I say that is not true.  We have gone through the proper process of voting.  Everybody on this side is satisfied that no amendment or part of an amendment requires rectification.  That is an abuse and it is overturning a democratic decision that has been taken.  It is being introduced at the present time by the Leader of the House and by the Government to save the embarrassment of having to go gack to the Dáil, not because there is any great rush and not because there is any delay in getting the Bill through.  This Bill had gone through the Committee Stage prior to the Easter <Col N="1819" /> break and it could have been dealt with at that time.  To say we are obstructing the business, to say the Minister must deal with it urgently and that it cannot go back to the Dáil is something I cannot accept as a valid argument.  I feel it is anti-democratic, it is against the spirit of Standing Order 90 and it is overturning a democratic decision that has been taken here in this House.  It is another reflection of how this House is held by Members of the Lower House and by the Taoiseach. For those reasons the Labour Party will be opposing this Standing Order and seeking that the Bill be dealt with in the proper fashion as intended and as stated by the Taoiseach in the Lower House a week ago.</P>

      <P>I am in a peculiar position because I came in here to oppose the Government's motion.  I have to confess I was absent last Wednesday as well and I was relying on newspaper reports. I understood at that stage that Senator Costello had introduced an amendment which I would have supported enthusiastically, to dispose of our primaeval, penal and reactionary legislation to deal with homosexual acts in private.  I have since been educated to the fact, while I accept that was his intention, that that is not what the amendment does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> I am sorry for dealing with the substance but I want to explain why I am taking this unusual position.  The amendment would simply eliminate the possibility of prosecuting people who blackmail people for doing those things. I have to say &mdash; and I say it to Senator Costello who is one of my oldest friends in many a battle against the Establishment &mdash; that I cannot agree with him. Because I cannot agree with him, I will actually support the Government in the recommittal of this Bill to have what I regard an unfortunate, erroneous amendment deleted.  I will have my say on the amendment about the appalling delay of the Government in restoring this country to full compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights which is a separate issue.</P>
    <P>I will have to support the Government proposal, having listened to the arguments to recommit the Bill because I believe it is a perfectly correct way of dealing with what seems to me to be a mistaken amendment in the legislation.  I do that with considerable reluctance.  I am not in the habit of giving aid or comfort to any Government but I have listened to all the arguments and I will be voting with the Government on this issue if there is a vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 24 and 25 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>.&mdash;Section 29 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion in subsection (3) of the words &ldquo;or any solicitation, persuasion, promise or threat offered or made to any person whereby to move or induce such person to commit or permit the abominable crime of buggery, either with mankind or with any animal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not intend to unduly delay on this as most of the things I have to say are already on the record of the House from last Wednesday.  Certainly, as I said before, there never was and never will be an intention to obstruct the Order of Business and the introduction of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I regard the Bill as inadequate.  The purpose of this amendment was to seek to eliminate some of that inadequacy and to amend a section by the deletion of words which I thought were appropriate and were in line with the decision in the Norris case in 1988 and in line with the Law Reform Commission recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned in section 29 with the offences of extortion and blackmail in the Larceny Bill.  People might think it strange that matters of this nature in <Col N="1823" /> relation to an offence of homosexuality should come into a Larceny Bill but we are talking about extortion and blackmail in relation to that.  I was intent on deleting that section which asserts the criminalisation of homosexual acts in terms of an abominable crime and the Bill goes on to protect those from blackmail for the crime it is seeking to assert and to perpetuate. Of, course, homosexuals are vulnerable to blackmail but making homosexual acts criminal offences and then putting through a law that protects homosexuals by introducing legislation against the blackmailing of homosexuals is very much an Irish solution to an Irish problem.</P>
    <P>We should be looking at it the other way in terms of introducing the decision on the principles in the European decision and we should be moving away from the situation we have in the 1861 Act, the Offences Against the Person Act, and indeed which is stated in this Bill, the reference to the criminalisation of homosexuals.  I consider that the matter in terms of protection from blackmail is adequately covered by the civil law and that is the area that it should be dealt with, that would be the intent of any reforms introduced.  I would like to see this section go through which would have the effect of removing the category of criminal offence in relation to homosexuality and, therefore, there would be no need for protection from blackmail because there would be no criminal offence as such within this legislation. The matter would be dealt with in the normal manner under the civil law.</P>
    <P>That is a perfectly reasonable amendment to introduce at this stage.  No doubt it would have the added effect of opening up the debate of these matters which are the subject of the Law Reform Commission deliberations at present.  Indeed, the Minister was not able to indicate to me any precise time scale when any new legislation would be introduced in relation to this matter.  Perhaps this would have the effect to some extent of <Col N="1824" /> putting the skids under the Department of Justice and dealing with a matter which has been, to my mind, deliberately neglected for too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a Committee Stage debate so any Member as I understand it can speak at any time.  We have debated this matter twice &mdash; first in Committee and then on Report Stage last week.  We are now discussing it again.  We are discussing it again because the section, if enacted into law would remove an important protection against blackmail.  I am not prepared to see that happen as I intend to show the effect of the section has been totally misrepresented by the Senators who supported it.</P>
      <P>The Government have two objections to this section.  The first objection relates to the undesirability of tidying up certain parts of the 1916 Larceny Act in an <i>ad hoc</i> and piecemeal fashion.  Of course, the 1916 Act needs an overhaul, and in that process I have no doubt that certain provisions of it will be dropped completely, or will not see the light of day again in anything like the same form.  However, that is a matter which will be considered in the context of the Law Reform Commission's proposals on the reform of our laws on dishonesty, when they are received.  As was made clear on Second Stage the purpose of this Bill is simply to reform the law relating to receiving of stolen property following the report of the Law Reform Commission and not to carry out a general review of the 1916 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second objection is on principle. Before I outline it in detail I want to correct the impression that has been given in the media about the effect of the Labour Senators' amendment.  To judge by these reports this new section would decriminalise homosexual acts.  Senator Costello has so represented his amendment, and his statements to that effect <Col N="1825" /> have been reported uncritically and without any attempt to check the true position across the full range of our national media.  Of course, this amendment would not decriminalise homosexual conduct.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell the Seanad the precise effect of the section if it passes into law.  The section amends section 29 of the Larceny Act, 1916.  That section contains a number of separate, but interrelated offences, each of which attracts a punishment of penal servitude for life. To talk about putting it into the civil law would totally misrepresent the seriousness with which the law takes this question of blackmail.  The severity of that penalty shows how seriously these offences are viewed.  It is sufficient to refer to the 3 main offences: uttering a letter of writing demanding property with menaces; uttering a letter which accuses or threatens to accuse a person of a crime to which the section applies, with intent to extort or gain property; accusing or threatening to accuse a person of such a crime, with similar intent.  All of these are forms of blackmail.</P>
    <P>The section affects the second and third of these offences, which involves an accusation, or threat to accuse, a person of any of the crimes listed at subsection (3) of the section.  The section would delete from that list of crimes solicitation to commit buggery or bestiality.  Thus, the section would abolish an offence consisting of a nasty form of blackmail.  It is important to note in the particular context of this section that the guilt or innocence of the victim of the demand is totally irrelevant.</P>
    <P>Does the section abolish the criminality of homosexual conduct?  Not at all.  That can only be achieved by a substantive amendment to the laws, in particular the provisions in the Offences against the Person Act, 1861, and the Criminal Law Act, 1885, which make homosexual conduct a crime.  That is something that the Government have to consider because of the ruling of the European Court in the relevant case.  The matter is under examination by the Law Reform Commission, which has already made tentative proposals about what action might be taken in a consultation <Col N="1826" /> paper published last year.  The Commission's final recommendations are awaited, and when received they will be considered in the context of the Government's response to the ruling of the court.</P>
    <P>Far from decriminalising homosexual conduct, the section would in fact decriminalise a form of blackmail which threatens to accuse a person of soliciting or inducing buggery.  Do Senators seriously believe that that is a good change to make?  Can you imagine the row that would erupt if the Government were proposing to do as the Senators propose?  Would they not agree that the removal of this offence in the criminal law removes an important protection against blackmail?  On the Second Stage of this Bill on 1 March 1990, Senator Norris quoted &mdash; with approval I presume &mdash; the Wolfenden report, which described the two Acts of 1861 and 1885 as a blackmailer's charter.  If that is what he feels, why now does Senator Norris support a proposal which would remove a protection against blackmail?</P>
    <P>Let us be under no illusions about the effect of this section.  Blackmail in any form is an unsavoury business; and this amendment would deprive all our citizens, no matter what their sex or sexual orientation, of the protection afforded at present by a law which punishes severely a particularly nasty form of blackmail. That is what the section would achieve.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to put the matter again before the House today in some detail.  Whatever the fate of this particular part of section 29 in the 1916 Act, it is not something that should be tinkered with in this Bill.  I would prefer to leave section 29 there in its entirety, at least until the question of other legal changes is considered, as a protection for all our citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that my words in any case will remain on the record of the House, so I am quite happy with that.</P>
      <P>The Minister, of course, is perfectly right in certain aspects.  I think he is quite correct to go back to the source of the problem, which is the Larceny Act, 1916. He has directed our attention to section 29.  The section is headed &ldquo;Demanding money etc with menaces&rdquo;.  It deals, of course, with blackmail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person who utters, knowing the content thereof any letter or writing demanding of any person with menaces without any reasonable or probate cause any property or valuable thing; (2) utters knowing the content thereof any letter or writing accusing or threatening <Col N="1828" /> to accuse any other person whether living or dead of any crime to which this section applies.</P>
    <P>Section 3 applies to</P>
    <P>any crime punishable with death or penal servitude to for not less than seven years or any assault with attempt to commit any rape or any attempt to commit any rape or any solicitation, persuasion, promise to threat offered or made to any person whereby to remove or induce such persons to commit or permit the abominable crime of buggery either with mankind or any animal.</P>
    <P>Now, in parenthesis, I would like to come back to this question of the language. The language is important.  It is offensive; it enshrines religious prejudice. &ldquo;Buggery&rdquo; comes from the Middle French, <i>bougre</i>, which means a Bulgarian, and it was a Papal accusation against the people of Bulgaria &mdash; the Alligensian heresy &mdash; that they were guilty of unnatural practices and so on. It has nothing whatever to do with the Act.  It is very vague in legal terms.  The same with &ldquo;sodomy&rdquo;, which comes from a complete misreading of the ancient biblical text.  This is the kind of quagmire we are in when we are dealing with these ancient antiquated laws.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the learned commentary on the Leaceny Act, 1916, where it deals with the question of demanding money with menaces.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 to 31 of the 1916 Larceny Act, which contain the law of what is colloquially termed blackmail, have been described as an ill-assorted collection of legislative <i>bric-a-brac</i> which the draftsmen put together with scissors and paste.  The sections represent the collation of a series of piecemeal statutory provisions which were enacted from the 18th century onwards.  Moreover, certain forms of blackmail amounted to robbery at Common Law, in particular extortion by threatening to accuse the prosecutor of having engaged in &ldquo;unnatural practices&rdquo;. There still remains an overlap between the offences contained in <Col N="1829" /> these sections and those of robbery and assault with intent to rob although its extent has not been accurately identified. The uncertainty is aggravated by an element of inconsistency in the authorities and in Ireland matters are further confused by a dearth of reported cases which we might flatteringly believe to be a reflection of the national character.  The gravamen of the offences contained in these sections is the making of improper threats in order to gain some benefit.</P>
    <P>So, to a certain extent the Minister is right.  We are dealing with the offence of blackmail; there is no doubt about that. But we are dealing with poorly drafted law.  We are dealing with a rag-bag of offences collected together.  We are dealing with the enshrining of prejudice.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by the Minister's humanitarian concern and compassion with regard to the question of blackmail. I am very glad he was paying attention when I quoted Sir John Wolfenden describing the 1861 &mdash; it is not 1961, Minister, I am very glad to say; if it were 1961 I would be seriously concerned&mdash; Offences against the Person Act and the 1885 Labouchere amendment, the section under which Oscar Wilde was convicted. However, I would be more impressed by the Minister's agonising over blackmail if any Minister for Justice had really attacked this question of the blackmailers' charter.  I consider this Minister has gone some way in, for example, the incitement to hatred legislation. This Minister had the courtesy, good grace and intellectual honesty to accept the arguments advanced in the Seanad; and here I would have to say it was very important to note the role played by the Seanad in securing those amendments which were vigorously opposed by a previous Minister for Justice in a previous Seanad and using tactics of which I had necessity to complain.  I will not reopen that because it would simply be divisive but the Minister will know what I am talking of.  I command him and compliment him for having allowed the situation to be re-opened and <Col N="1830" /> introduced very important, significant and far-reaching amendments which have been noted worldwide.  However, the Government will have to tackle the substance.  If the substance had been tackled the question of blackmail in the provisions of this Act would not arise.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in voting for Senator Costello's amendment.  None whatever, and I will tell you why. Because this concentrates the focus on the anomalies, on the discrepancies.  It sharpens our understanding of the situation. How can the Government maintain on the one hand that they are worried about blackmail and still they do nothing about the blackmailers' charter?  They are worried about the offence of blackmail but they still maintain the charter that gives the blackmailers' their rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister will know that politically one of the best methods of applying pressure is to sharpen the focus, to point out the discrepancy, to point out the contradictions. This is not at all a party political point because all Governments have taken a similar defensive attitude.  A line that was taken, for example, in the European Court case that has been quoted was similarly contradictory; that on the one hand these laws were necessary; the 1861 Act, and the 1885 Act were necessary to sustain the moral fibre of the Irish people.  That is one argument.  The other argument, held simultaneously, was: &ldquo;Sure, we never implement them anyway&rdquo;.  So what happens to the moral fibre of the Irish people?  In other words, the Government's position is riddled with contradictions.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy for the Minister because I think he is a humane man.  I believe him when he says he is concerned about blackmail, but that simply further heightens the contradictions and the nonsensical attitudes enshrined in the present legislation.  The Minister did, of course, refer to the Law Reform Commission. When I reread the report of the Seanad debates last week I thought he was referring to the consultation paper, but he is of course a very conscientious and a very accurate Minister.  This is why I think it is important out of respect for the Minister <Col N="1831" /> and the technical advisers &mdash; and I have sometimes quite misunderstood the information they were giving the Minister and I have apologised to them for it &mdash; a committee system is the only thing that will deal with this kind of situation adequately.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite correct, of course, in saying it is not a Law Reform Commission report; it is a consultation paper.  But look at the size of it.  Look at the weight of it.  Look at the amount of expertise enshrined in it.  The consultation paper extends to 233 pages and we may well ask why there is not a Law Reform Commission's report on the offences that are dealt with in this section. Why is there not?  The reason is because, despite urgings in letter, on radio, on television from myself and others, no Government has ever referred this to the Law Reform Commission.  So the Law Reform Commission has to include it in a completely inappropriate place.  They have put it into the question of child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>Do you think that gladdens my heart? Do you think I feel it is appropriate that the question of homosexuality should be discussed accidentally in a report on child sexual abuse?  I certainly do not but I listen with respect to what they say.  I am not going to take the time of the House in idle discussion so I will refer not to the substance, the body, of the actual consultation paper itself &mdash; although I commend it to anybody who wishes to read it &mdash; but to digest, the summary. One of the principal recommendations contained in the summary is this:</P>
    <P>1.  The repeal of the present laws which at present render criminal all homosexual acts at any age.  This will bring our domestic law into harmony with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>That point is worth underlining.  Senator Costello is perfectly right.  The Government is in contempt.  If I was caught cycling on my bicycle with no light, I could be summonsed, charged.  I could be brought before the District Court.  I could be fined <Col N="1832" /> a small amount, £10 or £15.  If I did not accede to the jurisdiction of the District Court of Dublin and pay that fine I could be committed to prison for contempt. The Irish Government are in flagrant and open contempt of the European Court and are getting away with it.  So, I will seize every opportunity, including the opportunity so valiantly provided by Senator O'Toole, to embarrass the Government on this issue.  It is right that I should so do.</P>
    <P>I would point out, with regard to this issue, why do we not have a free vote on these sort of matters?  I well recall when we were discussing the question of the Incitement to Hatred legislation and I introduced a document into this House which demanded the burning, the destruction of places frequented by members of the Gay community and I have been involved in the Hirschfield Centre which was destroyed by fire.  The Minister sat in that chair and said that this was subject to the criminal law.  I wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions who assured me that it was not, that that was inaccurate, and yet every single member of the Government side voted with the Government on this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will move on to the second recommendation of the Law Reform Commission:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of an offence of anal intercourse with persons under 17 years to correspond with the present <Col N="1833" /> sexual intercourse offence in respect of girls under 17, which would be retained.  The severest penalties would be provided where these offences were committed with the very young or by persons in authority.  Thirdly, the replacement of the present offence of indecent assault with consent by a new offence of sexual exploitation.  Older children would also be protected from this form of exploitation where the perpetrator was a person in authority.</P>
    <P>I have accepted that the Minister is a decent, humane and compassionate man. I have accepted that there is an intellectually sustainable case for his attitude towards the amendment but I have to say it is not so simple as he maintains.  Senator Costello can, for the reasons I have outlined, honourably continue to support his amendment, although it does not do what is appeared, apparently, to him to do in the beginning.  I cannot read his mind; I do not know.</P>
    <P>I can say that the Minister is, of course, absolutely right to say that reports carried did imply that there was a degree at least of decriminalisation implicit in this. There was not.  When I returned to the 1916 Act and read these things together, this quickly became clear to me.  I am sure the Minister, who is a fair man, will agree, if he listens, for example, to what I said on the radio, that what I said was very careful: I said that what was involved here was not a decriminalisation; it was the removal of the offence of buggery from a recital of a shedule of offences and was merely a technical issue.  It put it up to the Government, and so it did.  It is a political situation and it is one for which Senator Costello has a justification.  It requires a more sophisticated approach than merely suggesting that it decriminalises homosexuality to sustain his arguments.  It is quite possible honourably to vote on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to finish by commending to the Minister, with regard to blackmail, a full and proper review of the whole question of blackmail particularly as was undertaken in the reform of the Act <Col N="1834" /> similar with a test Act in the United Kingdom in 1968.  I did place an amendment, signed by myself and Senator Brendan Ryan, on this, because I agree absolutely with the Minister.  The question of blackmail is fundamentally important but it cannot just be isolated and treated in relation to homosexuality alone.  Senator Costello is also quite correct in saying that you can be blackmailed over things that are not criminal offences, so you can retain an offence of blackmail even though you decriminalise homosexuality, and I commend the Minister to do so.</P>
    <P>I would like simply to read into the record the alternative that you a Chathaoirligh, have had to rule out of order and I appreciate that you have done so properly.  I regret it.  I commend this amendment, however, and I think it is appropriate to include it in the argument for the information of those who may wish to read this debate subsequently. What I would have suggested is replacing the amendment of Senator Costello with an amendment making a wider deletion, deleting the whole of section 29 of the 1916 Larceny Act and putting in the following a new section 29 and putting the plain, simple word &ldquo;blackmail&rdquo; beside it &mdash; because that is what we are dealing with &mdash; and saying as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  A person is guilty of blackmail if with a view to gain for himself or another or with intent to cause loss to another he makes any unwarranted demand with menaces and for this purpose a demand with menaces is unwarranted unless the person making it does so in the belief (a) that he has reasonable grounds for making the demand and (b) that the use of the menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand.</P>
    <P>(2)  The nature of the act or omission demanded is immaterial and it is also immaterial whether the menaces relate to action to be taken by the person making the demand.</P>
    <P>(3)  A person guilty of blackmail shall on conviction on indictment be liable <Col N="1835" /> to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.</P>
    <P>I am not going to deal with the substance of that because, again, it is quite complicated and it is open to misinterpretation by people who are not versed in the law.  But I think those who are will regard it as at least an interesting pointer to the direction in which this debate ought to go; and in particular we should concentrate our minds, if we are so worried about blackmail, on, first of all, removing the source.  Is it not ridiculous to affect to be worried about blackmail and still to retain in operation the blackmailers' charter, and just to remove one?  I do not accept that.  Secondly, it is important to deal with blackmail as a complete entity in this new section.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister says.  I accept his advice is good in as far as it goes but it does not go far enough.  There is a clear political point in the Government's embarrassment.  Embarrassed they most definitely should be on this issue.  If it helps to focus their minds and if it helps to impel them towards a proper consideration &mdash; 13 or 14 years ago a Minister for Justice from the same party in the Dáil replied to Dr. Noel Browne that they were considering the reform of this legislation.  I am all in favour of due consideration but I really do not think that even the slowest of thinkers needs 14 years to deal with a situation like this. Can I remind the Minister that we are now alone in Europe, in our shame and in our humiliation, with regard to these sections of the 1885 Act?  Why do we not purge our shame, purge our contempt of the European Court and get rid of those things?  Then we will not have this trouble.  All this trouble is consequent upon the Government's inaction in a really important matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the fact that Senator Costello has put down these clauses.  I welcome the fact that my esteemed colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, has put down sexual orientation clauses.  In the beginning, I think I can say, I helped <Col N="1836" /> pioneer this kind of approach, but I am more than delighted when other people take it up.  It has much more impact and effect when it is done by someone other than myself.  I look forward to the day when people of conscience on the Government side will be permitted to express themselves and to vote, as I am sure some of them would, to demonstrate their respect for the European Convention on Human Rights which, I would remind the House, was principally initiated by a former Minister of an Irish Government, the late Seán MacBride.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the amendment. I congratulate the previous speaker on his great oratorical abilities, driving his own bull to the fair, so to speak but there is another forum for that. Whereas I appreciate and accept that there is need for change and that this matter will have to come before this House and the other House, we are losing sight of the kernel and the thrust of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This was a very carefully prepared Bill and I must compliment the Minister.  At all stages in the other House and here the Minister has acknowledged fully the need for reform of the Larceny Act, 1916, and other legislation but this Bill was brought before the House purely to rectify a serious on-going situation.  Its prime purpose is to introduce a new category of crime, that of handling, to replace the crime of receiving stolen goods.  This is done for very good sound reasons.  We have had an on-going situation in this country.  The statistics last year showed that the value of goods stolen came to £34 million whereas only £3 million was recovered.  The prime thrust of the Bill is to try to rectify that pressing situation.  It is urgent and the Bill should not concern itself with other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the point made by my learned colleague, Senator Costello, on the other side, but I feel he is mistaken. I would ask him seriously to reconsider the position.  I agree with what the Minister has said &mdash; and I have researched it very thoroughly &mdash; that, instead of improving the situation, as Senator <Col N="1837" /> Costello believes, it would be taking away an existing protection for homosexuals and other such people.  That point should be made clearly and unequivocally.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains new and necessary regulatory provisions.  The introduction of this first amendment is totally irrelevant. It is unnecessary and it does not in any way improve the situation, which the Bill initially set out to do.  The people on the other side should rethink the situation. The Bill is here primarily to establish a necessary category in the criminal law, that is, of handling stolen goods. Everybody accepts that.  We must not lose sight of that by bringing in other matters.  I could name another 20 issues in the Larceny Act that need attention. There are several issues under different legislation going back 150 years or more. We all accept that, but it is an on-going process.  I differ with Senator Norris in so far as that this process is on-going and it will be going on when we have left this House.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill must not be lost sight of.  I urge the people on the other side to accept this vital fact and to withdraw this amendment.  It is irrelevant and it is time delaying.  It is frivolous, and in this instance somewhat vexatious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris has said a considerable amount of what I would like to say.  I think Senator Costello was right in introducing the amendment.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  I do not think we should need a consultative paper from the Law Reform Commission followed by a report from the Law Reform Commission to decide that it is none of our business what adults do of a sexual nature in private.  We are carrying on our backs a collection of hang-ups, attitudes and primaeval instincts about matters sexual and the sooner we got rid of them the healthier we will be.  To suggest that we need two reports &mdash; one a consultative document and the other a report from the Law Reform Commission &mdash; to make up our minds that these things are none of our business, in so far as they apply to the behaviour of adults, seems to be so self-evident that <Col N="1838" /> the opportunity to discuss the matters and to persuade the Minister he does not need a barrage of consultative documents, of reports, of warnings, to decide that these things are none of the legislators' business goes without saying.  It is because we insist as a society on all these strange antediluvian views about sexuality that we need this sort of legislation, not the wording but the principle of the 1916 Act.  Not all of those who are gay in our community are openly and publicly assertive of that fact.  Many of them, perhaps the majority, are vulnerable, frightened, uncertain, confused people who feel threatened by their own sexuality, who feel threatened by what people would say about them if their own sexual orientation was publicly known, who are susceptible to threats, who are susceptible to prejudice, who are susceptible to a whole lot of things.</P>
      <P>It is because of that and not with any great enthusiasm or with any great happiness that I have felt obliged to take the position I took today which is to support the recommittal not because for one second I have a sympathy with the enormous delays.  This sort of amendment to get rid of the so-called offences should have been introduced 20 years ago.  They should never have been on the Statute Book of any civilised society.  The only issue that ought to be in our competence to regulate, in my view, is the whole issue of sexual exploitation.  That involves the age at which people should be free to engage in sexual activity and the fact that people should be allowed a free choice without external coercion of any form in the way they choose to express their sexuality.  That is our limit, to protect people who are young from exploitation or people who are older from exploitation, and to ensure that people can have a free choice.  Beyond that it ought to be, should be and would be much healthier for all of us if we accepted it was none of our business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why it is so singularly offensively and inappropriate, and Senator Norris is right about references to the decriminalisation of homosexual acts <Col N="1839" /> contained in a document which refers to child sexual abuse.  It has the unhappiest of connotations.  I am sure it was not the Law Reform Commission but it probably reflects even the prissiness of that august body that it could not issue a report on something as self-evidently correct as the fact that it is none of our business what consenting adults do in private of a sexual nature, that they had to insert the reference into something else.  It is also a reflection of the remarkable prissiness of successive Governments that we want to wait for another report before we do anything about it.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the Minister has shown a considerable reforming zeal, I will not be able to make a final judgment on his reliability on this issue until I see legislation.  If I do not see it soon I will have to form a negative conclusion.  This is not complicated legislation, this does not require a huge, long Bill.  Three or four sections would be enough to deal with our appalling breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I do not know who it is we are afraid of.  Is it ourselves?  Is it the Church?  The Church is a great excuse for all sorts of inactivity in our society, a huge excuse.  You can always say: &ldquo;We would love to do it but the Church will not let us&rdquo;.  I actually think the real failing is inside ourselves because we are unhappy and not comfortable with issues like homosexuality.  It is time we became totally at ease with them and accepted homosexuality as a perfectly natural sexual orientation which happens to happen to about 10 per cent of the population, about which nothing can be done, which is not an ailment, a disease, a sickness or anything else.  It is just the way people are and they ought to be allowed to be the way they are without us giving them lectures about how to behave and trying to remedy something that cannot be remedied.  I am very glad Senator Costello introduced this amendment because all those things need to be said in this House, and said in the other House over and over again.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment as it stands, in my view, and I have listened <Col N="1840" /> carefully, the balance of advantage lies with retaining the present legislation.  I would not have a scruple about voting for something like this to cause political embarrassment to the Government if I thought that would serve a purpose.  I have been a Member of this House for nine years and I vote on issues in terms of what is political.  I am extremely unhappy about continuing efforts to embarrass the Government politically at the expense not of the open, assertive, vocal, Gay community but at the expense of the vulnerable, silent, suppressed sort of frightened Gay community which is probably the majority of the Gay community because of the attitudes we retain.  On balance, I have to accept that the Minister perhaps will do something about it. I have to accept that he is at present able to argue with some plausibility that he is waiting for a report from the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>I do expect, and I think this House, Irish society and European society is entitled to expect that within a relatively short time we will have purged our contempt of the European Convention on Human Rights and will have instituted the minimalist changes that are needed to get us away from a regulation of what people do in private as consenting adults. It is absolutely, totally and completely ludicrous to attempt to legislate for those sorts of matters.  We would serve ourselves much better by getting rid of it.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I have to say I believe the amendment on balance would leave some people who are vulnerable already even more vulnerable although it would, of course, have been very helpful if the Minister instead of simply opposing this amendment, since his Leader in the House has proposed recommittal, had actually responded to the sentiments of this amendment and proposed an amendment to the sections on blackmail similar to the one that Senator Norris and I attempted to introduce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity this Bill get knocked down, as it did, because it set out to try to put an end to robbery and plundering with violence and menace of <Col N="1841" /> all kinds.  The media and everybody is saying that something should be done to end that situation.  We know that nothing can ever be done until we get some grip on the receivers.  If there were no receivers or takers there would be no stealers.  People are stealing now to order and this Bill was designed to put an end to that situation.</P>
      <P>I wonder were the people who voted against the amendment the other day thinking of higher motives or merely of embarrassing the Government when they got us offside for a few minutes.  I am fully convinced that was the reason and they lost all sense of direction, they were so hell-bent on causing embarrassment. On 21 March that very same amendment, word for word, was proposed by Senator Costello and debated and withdrawn by him.  If he felt so strongly about it here last week, why did he withdraw it on Committee Stage?  I think that is the answer and nobody opposed it at that stage.  Why did it become such a big issue then on Report Stage?  We all know that it is on Committee Stage that most of the debating, talking and researching is done but nothing was done there.  It was withdrawn.  So it was obviously a cheap, snide move to try to embarrass the Government.</P>

      <P>I did not provoke any exchange.  Everything I have said on this Bill since we began has been extraordinarily reasonable, far more reasonable than I often am, because I think the issue is extremely serious.  I will suffice with this.  Senator Farrell's speech was the finest argument I have ever heard for the decriminalisation of homosexuality; that people who are gay in this country should have to be subjected to that sort of a rant is the finest argument I have every heard for sorting out the law.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to contribute but I feel I must put on record my deep disgust with the tone of the contribution of Senator Farrell.  Normally I take your ruling and have no difficulty at all in accepting your decisions or in understanding them but I feel the use of the word &ldquo;pervert&rdquo;, given the amendment we are discussing and the particular issue we have been talking about today, and the preceding remarks of Senator Farrell, I found extremely offensive.  I think in this House above everywhere we must be tolerant and respect personal liberties.  I think it augurs very badly for the future if we start off only one hour after the good intentions that were <Col N="1845" /> offered on all sides on the Order of Business today with the tone of the debate we have now.  I am sickened as well by the tone of that contribution.  I find it hard to express in words how I feel.</P>

      <P>As a long-serving Member of this House I would like to support Professor Conroy.  It is very late in the day to appeal but I have the respect and support of everybody in this House. The Minister came here today absolutely sincere and with his contribution he tried to pull us back to where all Members want to be, and to correct unhappiness that has been in the House in the past few weeks.  I did think, in fairness to the Minister, Deputy Burke, that Senator Costello, who has become a friend of mine also, would agree with him.</P>
      <P>Let what happened last week happen. If I had been on the other side and what happened last week happened, I would have pulled my party back from scoring the type of political goal that was scored. Today I listened to Senator O'Donovan. In all our contributions today we were very constructive.  We thought we were doing right but this unhappy tone has crept in again.  At this late stage, as a Senator since 1977, I appeal to everybody to let this Bill go on and conclude.  As Senator O'Donovan said, it really went off-key with the amendments.  Really, the Larceny Bill was to deal with stolen goods.  I thought that was the main thrust of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the greatest respect to Senator Costello, he should look more carefully at amendments.  I appreciate that the Senator has gained much experience in a very short time, much more so than I when I had been that time in the House. I ask that if in future he saw where an amendment which he might well have put <Col N="1846" /> down in good faith was leading this House he would think about it again.  I say that to Senator Costello with the greatest respect.  We should all cool ourselves because it pays us in politics to do that at times, and try to pull the Seanad back from the brink.</P>

      <P>I would like to express my abhorrence at the outburst of Senator Farrell.  I would also like to welcome the Minister's clarifications on the implications of the section.  It was obvious last week that the Minister was not fully informed and not in a position to fully inform the House of the implications.</P>

      <P>I must say at the outset that I was disappointed by the remarks of Senator Farrell particularly when he described the amendment which is in my name and that of the Labour Party as a cheap, snide attempt to embarrass the Government.  I think everybody in the House will agree that was not the intention at any stage.  The only reason the Government were embarrassed was because there were no Senators on their benches on the occasion.</P>
      <P>I have argued this amendment and the other amendments with the Minister and we have done it in a polite and reasonable fashion.  I am glad all of the other remarks by the Government and by the Opposition Senators were made in that courteous and polite fashion.  I am also delighted that Senators Honan and Conroy dissociate themselves from the remarks that were made by Senator Farrell. They were improper, discourteous and indeed totally unacceptable in any circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment was put down in good faith.  It was an attempt to delete a section of the 1916 Act and not to decriminalise. If you read the debates of last week you will see that what we were seeking was deletion rather than decriminalisation.  I had hoped the Government would have taken action before now in relation to the decision of the European Court.  The amendment I put forward was on the lines of the recommendations, not of the Law Reform Commission but the Law <Col N="1847" /> Reform consultative paper which is a massive tome.  That is the gist of what this amendment is about.  If action had been taken by the Government in relation to decriminalising homosexual acts, then there would be no crime referred to in the Larceny Act.  Therefore, there could be no blackmail for a non-existent crime.  What I was doing was pushing this a bit further, making the Government face up to the situation that no action had been taken and also referring the situation to the civil law courts, that that is where action could be taken if an instance of blackmail did arise.  It was not an attempt to embarrass the Government.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has given an undertaking that the whole area is being investigated by the Law Reform Commission and that he will be looking at it &mdash; not, as he put it, of tinkering with the 1916 Larceny Act &mdash; in terms of the comprehensive proposals in this area.  In that context having had a thorough debate, having drawn attention to the substantial matters underlying it, at this point the Labour Party do not intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Neville said that in some way or other my contribution to the House left the matter in question last week.  This matter was clarified in great detail during Committee Stage as to exactly what was involved in Senator Costello's amendment.  It was clarified by me again last Wednesday at columns 1626 and 1627 of the Official Report of the Seanad of 9 May.  It showed exactly the clarification in relation to blackmail, etc. It was clarified at great length when we debated it here.  Senator Costello put down the amendment on Committee Stage and the implications of that amendment in relation to blackmail were clarified. I am glad the Senator is not pushing his amendment at this stage.</P>
      <P>While I am not a Member of the House, it would be remiss of me not to say that I found some of the phrases and words used by Senator Farrell to be personally unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 31, to delete &ldquo;14 years or to a fine or both&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;seven years or to a fine or to community service or to make compensation to any injured party or to any two of these penalties&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment was moved last week and I have little to add to it except to state that the intent here is to extend the range of sanction options available to the judge.  In the principal Act and in the Larceny Bill, 1989, there is just a range of two options, a prison sentence or a fine and I am seeking to extend that to a fine, community service, compensation to an injured party or to any combination of two of these penalties.  At the same time this amendment seeks to reduce the maximum sentence from 14 years to seven.  The intention is to bring it into line with the overall recommendations of the Whitaker report which stated that their experience was that institutionalisation in prison occurred after seven years of imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we should be looking in a more positive fashion to try to get alternatives to imprisonment, particularly in the context of what is happening in our prisons.  We have got overcrowded prison conditions which are not conducive to rehabilitation and a long period spent in prison in present circumstances is not of benefit to the offender.  I believe it is a very reasonable amendment to direct the judge towards the variety of sentencing options that are available.  No harm can be done by taking it on board and a lot of good can be done.  Indeed, all future legislation should include as wide and varied a list of sanction options as are in existence in this country.  I suggest that <Col N="1849" /> this amendment could be accepted by the Minister without any opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment.  I will be brief in my remarks.  The Minister on the last occasion quite clearly set out his reasons with which I concur.  The handling of stolen goods is becoming one of the most serious and regular crimes concerning large sums of money.  Because of its increasing popularity with the criminal element in this country we must have a suitable penalty here to fit the crime and that is the 14 year term.  That must stay and I urge the Opposition to support me in this respect.  It is a very serious crime, one that has been escalating gradually in the past ten or 15 years.  Last year alone something like £31 million or £32 million of stolen property was not recovered. There are major criminal elements involved in it and the sentence of 14 years is quite reasonable and should be retained.</P>
      <P>In relation to the community service, I cannot understand why &mdash; this is a matter I have raised here before and I am not being in any way disrespectful to the Senators on the other side &mdash; there is the necessity to include community service. It is inherent and inbuilt in our criminal system and jurisdiction at the moment that the district justice or Circuit Court judge have the power in any given situation to apply community service as an alternative to a custodial sentence.  This point should be made emphatically because from time to time the public are being misled by this.  There is no need for this amendment as far as the community service is concerned.  I have seen several district justices operating the community service option on an increasingly successful basis.  I am aware that the President of the District Court has urged that it be used.  The situation is already dealt with and I would urge, in the circumstances, that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, as I did the last day, to support the extension of the <Col N="1850" /> range of penalties from fines and imprisonment. I mentioned a few of them the last day.  Briefly, there are other approaches that should be taken, such as confiscation of property, payment of fines by instalments and so on.  I expect the support of Senator Donovan on amendment No. 3 because it expresses his view that for crimes such as larceny a sentence equal to the penalty for receiving should be available to the courts.</P>
      <P>I made a comprehensive speech on the section last week which is on the record. I do not propose to delay the House by going into it again in great detail now. There is an approach developing of almost glamorising prisoners.  It must be realised that these people are in jail for committing serious crimes.  Many of them have committed murder, rape, child abuse and so on.  We must be careful.  I would urge Senators on the other side of the House to read my contribution on amendment No. 3 last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 in the name of the Labour Party Senators seeks to have the maximum sentence provided in the Bill for handling stolen property from 14 years imprisonment to seven years and this is totally unacceptable. Amendment No. 3 in the name of Senator Neville seeks to increase from ten years to 14 years the maximum sentence provided in the Bill for larceny and other related offences and this is equally unacceptable.  A maximum sentence for larceny and similar offences is provided in the Bill at ten years and it is my view, the view of the Government and of society generally that handling stolen property is a more serious offence than the principal offence by which property is misappropriated.  This is because handling and handlers of stolen property encourage further crimes by creating and maintaining a market in stolen goods. For this reason, we want the Bill to give both to the courts who are charged with determining sentence in each case and to the criminals who promote and profit from illicit trade a clear measure of the seriousness with which handling is viewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1851" /> The message the Bill as it stands sends is that the most grevious individual crime of handling is deserving of a penalty 40 per cent greater than a penalty for the most grievous individual crime of simple larceny.  I expect that the courts in dealing with the less grievous incidents of larceny and handling will maintain this proportional difference whether they decide in any case that a custodial sentence, a fine, community service or any of the other penalties available to them is appropriate.</P>
    <P>I might mention here, in passing, that the ten years maximum specified by the Bill is for simple larceny and related offences such as fraudulent conversion and embezzlement.  The 40 per cent differential created by the maximum sentence specified in the Bill is between handling and simple larceny.  Larceny with violence or the threat of violence, in other words robbery is viewed as being so much more serious than the deed of simple larceny or handling that the Legislature has specified a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for that crime.  No one expects that the courts will hand out a 14 years sentence on handlers on a regular basis, any more than they are likely to hand out a ten year sentence on thieves, or life sentences on robbers, with any frequency.  The maximum sentences are there to cater for the most gross occurrence of such offences.</P>
    <P>Without labouring the point, I want to make one thing clear, that is, that the present maximum sentence for receiving is 14 years.  The Bill does not bring about a change in the position.  What it does is highlight the difference between the most serious cases of handling or receiving other than those of theft and other offences covered by section 9 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The new section 33 must specify a maximum custodial sentence for the offences specified in it and on that there can be no argument.  Because the offences are felony, then unless the legislation also specifies a fine the court may not impose one and this legislation specifies that a fine may be imposed in addition to or instead of a prison sentence.  There <Col N="1852" /> is no need, however, to make any reference here to the powers of the court under the Criminal Justice Community Service Act, 1983.  To do so would be just as superfluous as to make reference to the court's power to suspend sentences or to apply the provisions of the Probation Act.</P>
    <P>As regards the reference in amendment No. 2 to the payment of compensation, I have repeatedly in the debates both here and in the Upper House given a commitment to have the whole question of compensation in the context of crime generally examined in my Department as resources permit with a view to preparing comprehensive legislative proposals for consideration by the Government.  In the light of that, it does not make sense to deal with the matter piecemeal in relation to the offences dealt with within this Bill alone.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville's amendment would destroy the relationship set up by the Bill and indicated by the maximum sentences specified in it between the seriousness with which society views handling on the one hand and simple larceny on the other. It does not stop there, however.  It would have the effect of equating simple larceny with burglary, a crime which in addition to a possible larceny element has the aggravating element of entering as a trespasser.  Because burglary also attracts a maximum sentence of 14 years, the effective message which Senator Neville's amendment would send to the criminal fraternity and the courts is that burglary is no more serious than larceny. I hardly think Senator Neville would intend that and I certainly would not find it acceptable.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have here two amendments which would move the maximum sentence provisions of the Bill in opposite directions confirms to me that the middle course proposed in the Bill gets the right balance.  I urge the House to reject both amendments.</P>

      <P>In relation to the reduction of the period of imprisonment from 14 years to seven, in that context I had been seeking to introduce a particular quantity or value of property for which there could be a penalty of imprisonment. As it stands, the amendment simply refers in a blanket fashion to the handling of stolen property and there is no reference whatsoever to a value over a certain amount for an offence.  That was the context in which the earlier part of the amendment was being introduced. Also, it was being introduced in the context of prison sentences and the effectiveness of prison sentences and getting the Minister to think in the context of the value of imposing huge prison sentences that do not seem to have the effect for which they were imposed.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which the Minister has not addressed, but which Senator O'Donovan has addressed &mdash; and I compliment him on the manner in which he has addressed it, which is entirely in line with what I have been saying &mdash; that is, that there is great value in having a range of alternatives.  I want this Bill to state the alternatives so that they are drawn to the attention of the judge, so that he sees specifically what is available to him in terms of an alternative range of sanctions other than imprisonment. There are two penalties there: imprisonment or a fine.  Why can we not let our judges know the full range of sanctions that are available?  The Minister has not addressed that.  He did not address it on Committee Stage or on the previous Report Stage.  That was the one area that I am particularly unhappy about.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is considering comprehensive legislation in relation to compensation and we will await that.</P>

      <P>This Order, which has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas was made under section 2 of the Local Elections Act, 1973.  It is designed to postpone for one year the local elections which would otherwise be held in June 1990.  Section <Col N="1855" /> 2 of the 1973 Act empowers the Minister by order to specify the year in which elections should be held, once he is satisfied that they should be postponed.  The order cannot come into effect without confirmation by resolution of each House.  The order has already been confirmed by the Dáil and the motion which has just been moved requests the Seanad to confirm the order as required by law.</P>
      <P>The reason for this postponement is a very straightforward one.  It is to enable a full and urgent review of the local government system to be carried out.  In order that a proper review be finalised and changes put in place it was essential to take this step of postponing the elections due next June.</P>
      <P>It is the firm intention of the Government to see to it that the necessary changes will be in place in time for the holding of local elections in June 1991.</P>
      <P>There would have been no point in going ahead with local elections this year under the existing system.  If we were not serious about local government reform and if we were only paying lip service to the whole matter we could have let matters stand.  We could have gone ahead with the election of an entire range of councils for a further five years knowing that major structural changes were in the pipeline.  However, we were against such a charade.</P>
      <P>The Government are serious about reform and have set down clearly how they intend to go about it in a business like way.  Members of the House will be aware of the recent statement which set out the details of this programme.  The review of the local government system is being carried out at the highest level by a Cabinet subcommittee.  That statement also announced that a special committee of experts would be set up to advise the Cabinet subcommittee.  The members of the House will be aware that this group of experts has now been appointed and I am confident that they will have a very valuable input to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's debate also gives the Members of the Seanad a chance to make an input <Col N="1856" /> on the important matter of local government reform.  I have no doubt but that the Seanad will use this opportunity and I look forward to positive and constructive input from Members on all sides.  The Government did not take the decision to postpone the local elections lightly.  They made the decision for one reason only &mdash; that is to enable the complex and technical problems of local government reform to be tackled in a determined way. We want to put in place a system that will work well and serve the needs of the people in the years to come.</P>
    <P>We are used to dealing with major issues in both the Dáil and Seanad.  We deal with matters that have a significant bearing on the economy and on society as a whole.  We deal with matters of international importance.  I hope though that we would not tend to regard local matters as being less important.  In fact, I would put it to you that the areas for which local authorities are responsible are among those that have the greatest impact on the day-to-day lives of all the people.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have the job of providing the services on which people depend most, services such as housing, water, sanitation and fire protection.  The local authorities are responsible for matters which have a great bearing on the quality of life of the people; the environment, local amenities, planning and development.  Local authorities play a major role in relation to economic development through the provision of roads, water supplies and all the other essential items of infrastructure.  The local authorities themselves are indeed an important sector of the economy by virtue of the significant volume of public expenditure for which they are responsible.</P>
    <P>I would put it to you that local authorities have done a good job and much gratitude is due to the dedicated service and hard work of local authority members and officials down through the years but there have been great changes in recent years and these have had a big impact on the role of the local authorities. There have been major social changes. The economic scene has been transformed. <Col N="1857" /> There has been a huge growth in legislation.  New and more complex needs and demands have arisen.  The problems which local authorities have to deal with have increased both in number and in complexity.  The one thing that has not changed much is the local government system itself.  It is an old system: the structures date back in the main to the last century.  It is not a system that was designed to meet the problems and challenges of the modern era.</P>
    <P>There is a need for change.  I doubt if any Member of the House would disagree strongly with me on that point.  Nor would they disagree when I say that change is overdue because although local government reform and reorganisation has been talked about for many years very little action has resulted.</P>
    <P>When I say that changes are needed I mean changes that will work and that will produce a better and more efficient system of local government.  A system that will last and that will be responsive to the needs of the people it is designed to serve must be the aim.  In order to achieve that objective, it is necessary to go about the job in the right way.  I am confident that the approach which the Government have taken is the correct one and that it will yield results.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into detail about issues which will need to be tackled.  Even if there was enough time to do that it would not be proper for me to prejudge or pre-empt the work of the committee. I would like, however, to refer in a very general way to some of the main areas that will clearly need to be looked at.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that it will be necessary to look at the local authority structures themselves.  As I have said, they are antiquated.  We must ensure that the structures and the system are suitable to the needs of today.  The system must be flexible and able to respond to the needs of individuals, communities and businesses.</P>
    <P>The powers and functions of local authorities must be revoked.  Local authorities must have adequate power to take action where it is needed for the good of their areas.  They must not be tied down unduly <Col N="1858" /> by unnecessary controls and outdated procedures.  There is also a need to review central controls on local authorities.</P>
    <P>Much of the legislative framework within which local authorities operate dates back over a century.  It must be reviewed, updated and consolidated.  The question of reserve and executive functions needs to be considered as does the operation of the section 4 procedure.</P>
    <P>The committee will also need to consider the possible financial implications of their proposals and they are being asked to make recommendations on the criteria on which the contribution from central funds to local authorities should be made on a statutory basis.  No doubt the committee will also have regard to the important practical reforms which have been introduced in the financial area in recent years such as the replacement of the outdated loans and subsidy system and the continued elimination of statutory demands and levies.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that the task facing the committee is a major one.  The range of issues involved is wide and complex. There are no simple or readymade solutions. Much careful consideration will be needed.  However the course which the Government have taken will ensure that the matter will be tackled with the utmost urgency and energy and I, therefore, commend this motion to the House.</P>

      <P>The Senators and I know that is the situation.  The promise of local government reform is, indeed a <Col N="1859" /> myth.  One reflects on the policy of that party over the last number of elections. They continually spoke about local government reform, in particular at the 1985 local elections where, I must confess, they were very successful.  I have no doubt that the reforms they spoke about then played a major part in that campaign. Three and a half years later, what have we got: certain reforms introduced but all of them reducing the powers of local authorities.  I put on the record of this House seven clear cases of this.</P>
      <P>I want to join with the Minister in paying a tribute to the members of local authorities who have operated with dedication and commitment for a very long number of years and have given a lot of service free of charge.</P>

      <P>If I could have the protection of the Chair, it would help.  Let me point out one of the first things the Government did when coming into office in 1987 &mdash; it was to abolish the regional development organisations and this at a time when all of Europe was talking about regional development.  The midland regional organisation which was doing such excellent work and which involved all of those midland counties with Roscommon, was abolished.  That is a fact of life.  I believe it was a tragedy that was done.  The Midland Regional Development Organisation, together with all other regional development organisations were doing excellent work. I regret very much they were abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, more recently, the Government got involved in a cosmetic exercise where they were supposed to be examining the needs and requirements of regions <i>vis-á-vis</i> Structural Funds.  We all know again that the county councils were ignored; one member from each council was allowed on the particular body but it was an advisory body.  Decisions were taken by the Executive.  Again, I believe that was a disaster.  It is deplorable of this Government to try to tell us that they are interested in local government reform <Col N="1860" /> and returning powers to local authorities when the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>May I hasten to add, the ACOT committees or the county committees of agriculture were abolished by this Government &mdash; a fact of life &mdash; and we now have a situation where local authorities have absolutely no input into agricultural matters thoughout the country. Whether we like it or not, every county except Dublin and Cork depends to a very large degree on agriculture and in many counties agriculture is the motor of the economy.  Yet, those committees were abolished.</P>
    <P>We can consider the local health committees. How many Members here have sat on a local health committee in the last two years?  They have all been abolished. That was a disgraceful situation, which arose from a penny-pinching exercise.  It was done solely to stem criticism from those local authorities of Government health policy over the past three years.</P>
    <P>Let us examine other areas, for example, where local authorities' powers were curtailed.  The Government had an ideal opportunity last year when, to satisfy the Progressive Democrats, they decided to give local authorities a role as to how lottery funds should be allocated. There was a cosmetic exercise of schemes coming from Dublin to the local authority and being examined there.  Of course, every local authority gave approval because it had no power to categorise the schemes in order of priority.  If the local authority were to have any meaningful role it should have got that power.  The local authority examined the files, sent them back to central Government who some day will take a decision on where the funding goes.  I cannot understand why the funding has not been allocated. There are five months of the year gone. There are projects in the Department awaiting sanction.  I am told there is money available but worthwhile projects from many rural communities have not been approved.</P>
    <P>This is a scandal and shows a clear lack of commitment to give powers to local authorities.  I cannot see why an allocation could not be made available to <Col N="1861" /> each county council who could then examine the proposals before them and allocate the funds accordingly.  That would be real progress.  It was an opportunity the Government had but which they failed to grasp.</P>
    <P>There was another glaring example some days ago where the Minister for the Environment totally disregarded the wishes of Dublin County Council and imposed a toll on a road that was built by taxpayers' money and EC funding.  That was a scandal.  It was the clear wish of Dublin County Council that that should not happen.  Yet the Minister in a dictatorial manner, imposed a toll.  This is another glaring example of the clear failure of this Government to be committed to local authority restructuring.  I do not believe they have any commitment other than for the sole purpose of deferring the local elections to appease the Fianna Fáil councillors.  That, whether we like it or not, is the reason we have this Bill before us today.  It is mere camouflage to say it is for the purpose of local government reform.  Every Member on that side of the House knows that what I am saying is true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this Bill which will amend the Limerick Markets Act, 1852.  As a result the trustees are restricted from working as a viable unit in that they cannot raise their fees.  It is proposed to amend section 30 of the principal Act of 1852.  This market was set up in 1852 because there was no suitable place to sell agricultural produce in the Borough of Limerick.  While there was not established in the said Borough at the time any type of sufficient market for the sale of live cattle, other livestock, dead pigs, corn, butter, hay etc. it was <Col N="1862" /> decided that the Limerick Market trustees be set up to provide premises to sell these commodities.  At the time Limerick Corporation were responsible for administrating the Limerick Markets Act, 1852.  In 1921 subsequent legislation was passed that Limerick Markets trustees be set up, which comprised nine members of Limerick County Council, nine members of Limerick Corporation and nine members of the chamber of commerce.  They were still subject to the restrictions of the 1852 Act.  They are in receivership over 90 years because of the restrictions of this Act.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to amend sections of the Act, section 3 proposes to amend section 30 of the principal Act.  The principal Act stipulates that pigs, butter, fish, fowl, eggs, potatoes, food, vegetables, hay and all such produce can be sold.  The trustees consider it desirable that this Bill covers all such marketable commodities as the trustees shall decide from time to time.  They consider this desirable having regard to the different market trends that exist nowadays, particularly having regard to the fact that supermarkets are selling food and vegetables in such large quantities that would never have been anticipated in the 19th century.</P>
      <P>Section 4 proposes to repeal section 25 of the Act of 1852.  The reason for seeking this amendment is primarily because the market trustees hold certain property which was purchased under the authority of the Act and, which as the law exists at present, they have power to sell if in their opinion the property is not necessary for the purposes of the Act.  However, certain of the lands and property they own were not purchased under the authority of the Act but were handed over to the trustees by Limerick Corporation who would have been the previous owners and managers of the markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing legislation, therefore, it could be argued that the trustees have power only to sell land they have acquired subsequent to the 1852 Act, and any land that has been transferred to them by the Corporation in the management and control of the markets they would not have power to sell.  This section is purely to <Col N="1863" /> enable the trustees to sell any of their lands if they so wish and if, in their opinion, such land is surplus to their needs and would benefit the functions of the market trustees.</P>
    <P>The powers of the trustees to collect tolls are extremely limited.  Tolls are in Limerick Markets for a long time and the method of assessing these tolls is outdated. It is evident that the existing legislation provides that all produce supplied by retailers to the markets has to be assessed for the purpose of fixing the tolls to be charged.  These tolls are outdated and the method of assessing them is too cumbersome. It is essential for the market trustees to enable them to continue as a viable commercial, non-profit making organisation to charge a realistic fee to allow the various members of the farming community and otherwise to sell their produce within the market area.</P>
    <P>Section 6 entitles the market trustees to charge a proper rent for any property they own whether it is property they acquired subsequent to the Act or property transferred to them by the Corporation. The trustees would have power to rent whatever property they have for purposes other than what was laid down in the original Act for any viable benefit or for the promotion of agriculture or any other commodity which would be of benefit to the city, the community and the market trustees.</P>
    <P>Section 7 repeals section 26 of the Act of 1852 and section 3 of the Act of 1862. These two sections enable the trustees to borrow sums of money up to £40,000. These two sections entitle the trustees to borrow at the rate of interest but not exceeding £5 per £100, that is 5 per cent. As Senators know, where can money be got at five per cent today?  Nowhere. Clearly in modern commercial living it is not possible for the trustees to borrow any money at the rate stipulated in the present legislation.  The hands of the trustees are very much tied by virtue of the fact that they are in a sense totally restricted from borrowing.  Any proposition they would have for improving the markets, extending them or developing <Col N="1864" /> them in any way, would be very much restrictive on account of the virtual prohibition on borrowing funds.</P>
    <P>Section 9 amends section 56 of the Act of 1852.  The legislation as it stands obliges the markets to employ an auditor. The section stipulates that the auditor shall receive a reasonable remuneration not exceeding £2 every day he shall be fully employed in auditing any accounts under the Act.  Again, this is totally impractical in this day and age and it is thought essential that this section of the Act be amended so that the market trustees can run their operation in an efficient and commercial manner and, indeed, in compliance with the legislation.</P>
    <P>The House can understand the restrictions the Limerick Market trustees are operating under, this very outdated 1852 Act which was put on the Statute Book in Victorian times.  There is definitely a need for change.  I remember going into the market myself selling calves to people from the Acting Chairman's area in Roscommon or Leitrim.  Now that has been sold and there are no calves being sold there.  There was a total charged.  The market trustees had to sell it because of the necessity for money, I believe Limerick Fire Brigade are there now.  The Limerick Markets trustees still have property, and in order that they retain that property and in order that the Limerick Markets survive it is essential that this Bill be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Acting Chairman will keep an eye on the time for me because I intend sharing the time with Senator Neville.  Like the previous speaker, I welcome the Bill.  We are dealing with the rather bizarre situation of something that has been in receivership for almost 100 years which qualifies it for entry into the Guinness Book of Records. As Senator Kiely said, the Limerick Markets trustees were set up under the Limerick Markets Act, 1852, so we are going back to Victorian times.  He has outlined a situation and I do not wish to repeat it. The receivership ended in February 1988 and since then there has been no amending <Col N="1865" /> legislation other than the Act of 1921 which was passed for the purpose of updating the tolls.</P>
      <P>Since the receivership terminated, the property and management of the Markets was handed back to the trustees. Amending legislation is essential for the survival of the Markets trustees and also because the Market area &mdash; those Senators who are familiar with the capital of the mid-west are aware of this &mdash; is in a very important centre and close to the commercial life of Limerick at the moment particularly in relation to urban renewal and the need for the Market trustees to have the power to dispose of an exceptionally valuable property.</P>
      <P>The other day we were brought to a press reception which outlined a commercial development within the inner city.  It was interesting and showed that Limerick is up and running as regards revitalising the commercial life of its inner city.  There are two reasons for this Bill.  First, there is the bizarre 100 years receivership and, secondly, because you cannot have such outdated legislation holding back exceptional development within the city.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to look back at the tolls that were exacted on produce at the time. We know that the Act stipulated a list of commodities such as pigs, butter, fish, fowl, eggs, potatoes, fruit, vegetables, hay and so on.  There is a greater availability of produce today and if you want vegetables you have the option of going either to markets or to supermarkets.  It is obvious that there are different market trends 100 years later and that fruit and vegetables are being sold in commercial activities which would not have been anticipated in the 19th century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 shows that the Markets trustees hold certain property purchased under the authority of the Act and which, as the law exists at present, they have power to sell, if in their opinion the property is not necessary for the purposes of the Act.  However, certain of the lands and property which I referred to are in very valuable inner city locations and what they own was not purchased but was <Col N="1866" /> handed over to the trustees by Limerick Corporation which would have been the previous owners and managers of the Markets.  Under the existing legislation it could be argued that the trustees have power only to sell land they acquired subsequent to the 1852 Act and that any land that was transferred to them by the corporation in the transfer of the management control of the Markets they would not have the power to sell.  That section is there to enable the trustees to sell any of their land if they so wish, if in their opinion such land is surplus to their needs.  I can tell the House that the property speculators are queueing up to acquire such land though it is being held back at the moment because of this Act. The tolls are archaic and the Markets Trustees, if they are to continue as a viable commercial but non-profit organisation, would need to charge a realistic price to allow the various members of the farming community to sell their produce within the Markets area.</P>
    <P>Section 7 repeals section 34 of the Act of 1852, which is an extraordinary situation, where the trustees can borrow sums of money up to £40,000, which is a very small figure by today's standards.  They can borrow at any rate of interest but not exceeding £5 per £100.  That clearly belongs to another age.  In modern commecial living it is not possible for them to borrow any money at the rate stipulated in the present legislation so their hands are tied.</P>
    <P>Section 9 amends section 56 of the 1852 Act in which the auditor gets what was considered a reasonable remuneration not exceeding £2 every day he was fully employed.  I would like to hear auditors comment in relation to £2 a day in view of their high qualifications.  That is totally impracticable in this day and age.  This section must be amended so that the Markets trustees can run their operation efficiently and commercially, and in compliance with the legislation.  To put it in the context of the century to which it belongs, we are talking about tolls of 6d in old currency for every barrel of 280 pounds of wheat, rye, beans or peas &mdash; it is a pity we do not live at that period &mdash;<Col N="1867" /> hampers of eggs or other packages at 4d. We are talking about baskets of eggs at 3d.  It is unbelievably bizarre to think this is still holding in the legislation of the Limerick Markets trustees.  I hope this item will be completed this evening to ensure that Limerick can take its place in the commercial centre of the mid-west and that the Markets will expand as they should.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which is very important to Limerick.  I would like to thank the former Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan, for accepting my request last week to debate this because if it was not taken this week the Bill would have lapsed and we would not be in a position to process it into law.  It is important for several reasons that the Markets in Limerick are maintained and updated to improve the commercial aspects of the town.  This is complemented by the excellent urban renewal scheme which has changed the face of Limerick.  I congratulate everybody involved in the urban renewal scheme, the corporation, Shannon Development and the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  The principal Act was set up in 1852 to manage the Markets in the city to sell pigs, butter, fish, fowl, eggs, potatoes, fruit, vegetables, hay and all such agricultural products.  There was no silage those times.  The position with regard to all those items has been changed and it is necessary now to extend the range of commodities that can be sold to develop the Markets.  It went into receivership in 1898 because of insufficient income at the time and came out of receivership on 15 February 1988.  No amending legislation has been made since 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 allows the trustees to decide the extent of the marketable commodities, as it sees fit and desirable, <Col N="1868" /> thereby extending and allowing them to develop the Markets.  Trends have changed since 1882 and supermarkets have changed the market in agricultural commodities.  They have removed to a large extent from the markets items such as fruit and vegetables.  Therefore, it is obvious that the Act of 1852 is totally out of date.</P>
    <P>Section 4 repeals section 35 of the principal Act.  The Markets trustees hold certain property which they have purchased and are entitled to sell that but they are not in a position to sell land which they obtained at the time from the corporation. This section will amend that and allow the trustees to sell any land they do not require for their needs.</P>
    <P>Section 5 refers to tolls.  Under the Acts of 1852, 1962, 1872 and 1921 the powers of the trustees are very limited. The system is outdated and cumbersome. To quote the tolls from an agricultural background: for every bull, steer, cow or heifer, one old shilling; for every calf not one year old, lamb, fat or weaned and goat, 6d; for every sheep, ewe, ram or hogget 6d; for every horse, mare, filly or yearling, two shillings; for every mule, one shilling and a donkey, 6d.  Senators can see how outdated the Bill is and the need to update it.</P>
    <P>Section 7 repeals section 34 of the principal Bill.  The present Bill only allows them to borrow up to £40,000 at a rate of 5 per cent.  That is totally outdated.  The new Bill allows them to operate at commercial rates in order to borrow from the financial institutions to improve and extend the Markets.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with section 9.  This section stipulates that the auditor shall receive reasonable remuneration not exceeding £2 per day fully employed, again totally outdated.  I would like to put down a marker here and maybe it would be considered on Committee Stage.  I believe the Bill may be slightly defective in that it does not bring the Markets trustees under the ambit of the relevant Minister for audit purposes.  I am not sure whether it is the Minister for the Environment as it would be in the case of a local council or the Minister for the <Col N="1869" /> Marine in relation to a harbour board. The Minister should be in a position to make orders regulating the accounts to be kept by the trustees.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister should also be in a position to order the form, number and description of the accounts, the manner in which they are kept, the period which the accounts are to cover and the publication of the accounts, which is very important in a public body.  I also think that the accounts of the Markets trustees should be audited by an auditor or appointed by the Minister, in a similar fashion to that of a local authority.</P>
    <P>It is important that this Bill goes through.  I will ask, whoever is selected for the committee to have a brief look at that.  I possibly will not because it may be against the law because there are members of Limerick County Council on it.  As I am a member of Limerick County Council I would be seen to have a contract. As I come from Limerick west, I may be eligible to be on that committee. I would certainly like the opportunity to bring up that element of it and tease it out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 10 allows for all costs charges and expenses for the passing of this measure; in other words, the cost is borne by the trustees.  This is why I was so anxious that the Bill would not lapse that the trustees would have spent anything up to £15,000 from their limited budget to date in bringing this Bill to this level. I ask for the tolerance of the House, to put the Bill through as quickly as possible and on Committee Stage to facilitate this matter.  I have some time left and I ask the Chair to allow Senator Hourigan some time to speak on the Bill.</P>

I want, without qualification, to support totally the Bill, its aims and objectives.  It is not necessary to go into the archaic aspects of the Bill and the level of toll for the various items of produce over the years.</P>
      <P>As a person born and reared in the perimeter of Limerick city I am very familiar with the Limerick marketing scene. Quite honestly, it is rather ludicrous to observe the level of levy on the various commodities way back into the last century. As we know the Limerick Markets Trustees came into existence in 1852 and, as was stated earlier by one of my colleagues, went into receivership in 1898 and remained in that position, with one brief interlude, until 90 years later, 1988. There were, as indicated, very severe restrictions that made it impossible for Limerick Markets Trustees to operate in business fashion.  They were restricted totally from borrowing since borrowing was restricted to 5 per cent and money is not to be found at that rate these days. They were restricted in many other areas as well.  Therefore, the various proposals outlined in the Bill make it impossible for Limerick trustees committee to carry on business in a meaningful fashion in the nineties.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the changing face of Limerick.  I would like to pay tribute to all concerned, the Government for their particular input into the major changes in Limerick in conjunction with the Limerick Corporation. It behoves us all to leave behind us this archaic system of toll collection, to look forward and to realise what it is possible to do.</P>
      <P>I categorically and without qualification support this Bill.  I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence.  I also want to thank my colleague Senator Dan Neville for giving me the opportunity to speak.</P>

      <P>D'iarr an Taoiseach mar Aire na Gaeltachta ar Údarás na Gaeltachta, i mí na Samhna 1988, tuarascáil a ullmhú maidir le soláthar seirbhís teilifíse trí Ghaeilge. Bhíothas le féachaint an bhféadfaí an seirbhís a bhunú mar sheirbhís neamhspleách, agus conas ab fhearr a dhéanfaí a leithéid, maraon le áireamh costais a sholáthar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cuireadh an tuarascáil chuimsitheach seo i dteannta le tuarascáil theicniúil ó RTÉ ar fáil do Roinn na Gaeltachta i mí Meán Fómhair 1989.  Molann an tuarascáil a d'ullmhaigh Udarás na Gaeltachta go mbunófaí córas teilifíse trí Ghaeilge le mór stiúideonna i nGaoth Dobhair, i gConamara agus i gCorca Dhuibhne maraon le mionstiúideonna in áiteanna eile ar fud na Gaeltachta. <Col N="1874" /> Moladh go mbeadh an tseirbhís ar fáil in 80 faoin gcéad den Ghaeltacht are a laghad agus go mbeadh sí ar fáil tríd an gcorás cábla i mBaile Atha Cliath, i gCorcaigh, i Luimneach agus i nGaillimh. Bhíothas ag súil go mbeadh fáil ar an tseirbhaís, taréis tamaill, sa chuid eile den tír ar an gcóras MMDS agus ar an gcóras cábla eile.  Ní chosnódh sé ach £2 mhilliún chun an tseirbhís seo a bhunú, £2 mhilliún eile chun na stiúideonna a fheistiú agus £1 mhilliún thairis sin chun iad a cheangal le stiúideonna éagsúla de chuid RTÉ ar fud na tíre.  Moltar sa tuarascáil go mbeadh an tseirbhís seo ag craoladh ar feadh ceithre uair a chloig déag ina aghaidh na seachtaine agus go gceannófaí cláracha di ó thairgtheoirí príomháideacha.</P>
    <P>Áiríodh go mbeadh fostaíocht ar fáil do 28 sa stáisiún féin ach go mbeadh oiread agus 180 nó 200 post dá gcruthú i seirbhís ghinearálta na teilifíse.  Bheadh an tÚdarás ag súil gur sna ceantair Ghaeltachta is ea a chruthófaí na postanna seo; mar shampla, poist i dTeilegael sa Spidéal a bheadh i gceist i dteannta le postanna sna hionaid traenala eile a bhunaigh Údarás na Gaeltachta don ghnó seo.</P>
    <P>De réir na tuarascála bheadh costas £7½ milliún go leith ar chláracha a cheannach agus costas £2.1 mhilliún ar riarachán na gclár seo.  Suim £9.6 mhilliún a bheadh i gceist san iomlán.  Is é barúil an Údaráis agus barúil Bord na Gaeltachta maraon le barúil roinnt daoine neamhspleácha eile go bhféadfaí an tseirbhís seo a bhunú ar chostas de thuairim is £4.5 mhilliún.</P>
    <P>Tá sé curtha in iúl ag RTE go dtacáionn siad le príomhmholtaí na tuarascála.  Os rud é go bhfuil polaiteoirí d'aonghuth i dtaobh na ceiste, go bhfuil an tacaíocht chuí ar fáil ó na páirtithe polaitíochta agus ó na heagrais eagsúla atá atá bainteach leis an ngnó, ní thuigim cén fáth go bhfuil an oiread sin moille agus fadhbanna le sonrú ina thaobh.</P>
    <P>By that I must refer to Reg Hindley from Bradford University who published a book a couple of weeks ago and brought us down to earth and showed us where we are in the Gaeltacht and what is happening. I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1875" /> The statistics now confirm entirely the dominant impression left by field study that Irish is now hovering on the verge of abandonment by its native speakers in all but a couple of handful of school areas.</P>
    <P>There is an indictment of what is happening to the Irish language by a person who made an in-depth study of it.  He says that: &ldquo;Much of the romantic appeal of the language will die with the Gaeltacht&rdquo;. He continues on to say there is no doubt that going to learn Irish there among native Irish speakers is far more attractive than learning it in classroom study in some English-speaking town. The Irish language, he says:</P>
    <P>is lost in the midst of a thriving English speaking world of over 320,000,000 people.  Much of the appeal for the Irish language since 1893 has been romantic and it is the tragedy of the language that poverty and deprivation have generally made romance a luxury in the Gaeltacht struggle for survival and improvement.  Romance thrives in comfort and leisure.  It is no surprise that the culture of Irish now appears to lie in the hands of the linguistically long anglicised urban dwellers, especially in Dublin.  This thought alone provokes in me and the likes of me living in the Gaeltacht to preserve the traditional language for yet another generation at least.</P>
    <P>Sin é an tuairim atá ag Sasanach léannta. Cuirim é seo faoi bhráid Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta, an Teachta Gallagher, atá anseo inniu.  Is é a dúirt sé in iris na míosa caite de <i>Chomhar</i> ná: &ldquo;Bhí meath ag teacht ar an nGaeilge ar feadh tamaill. Ceapaim go bhfuil stop curtha leis an meath sin anois&rdquo;.  Níor chuala mé a leithéid de ráiméis ariamh.</P>
    <P>He is flying in the face of the rage of gods in making such a statement tar éis an in-depth study atá déanta ag an bhfear seo.  Má tá an tAire Stáit ag cloí leis an tuairim sin in ainneoin na fianaise go léir atá bailithe i Roinn na Gaeltachta, fianaise ar a bhunaigh Reg Hindley a leabhar, <Col N="1876" /> molaim dó éirí as a phost mar go bhfuil sé aineolach ar chúrsaí Gaeltachta.  Níl sé ag insint na fírinne i leith cúrsaí Gaeltachta, ach oiread, ná i leith ceist na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí.  Tionóladh meitheal oibre i 1987 i dtaobh craoladh teilifíse trí Ghaeilge.  Ghlac Roinn na Gaeltachta páirt sa mheitheal oibre seo. Fuair an Roinn meastachán ó RTÉ a léirigh na costaisí breise, idir chostaisí reatha agus costaisí caipitil, a bheadh ag gabháil le cláracha a chraoladh ar feadh dhá uair a chloig in aghaidh an lae, laistigh de bhliain amháin.  Is é an coastas reatha a bheadh i gceist ná £10 milliún.</P>
    <P>Maíonn RTÉ freisin go gcaillfidh siad oiread agus £5 mhilliún de theacht isteach ó fhógraíocht mátear stáisiún Gaeltachta.  Ní theastaíonn ó RTÉ 2 a bheith ag drannadh le dhá uair a chloig de chláracha Gaeilge in aghaidh an lae. Níl spéis acu ann agus cén fáth go mbeadh brú á chur orthu chun é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Dealraíonn sé domsa gur iarsma é seo den éigeantacht a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge i gcónaí, agus tá fonn ar chuid againn go gcuirfí deireadh leis an ngné seo.  Ní theastaíonn ó Údarás na Gaeltachta, ná ó mheitheal oibre na Gaeltachta, ná ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta ná ó mhórchuid de chainteoirí Gaeilge na tíre seo go mbeadh baint dá laghad acu le RTÉ 2.  Dár leo cur i gcéill agus cur amú ama atá i gceist anseo.  Níor chóir do Roinn na Gaeltachta ach oiread bheith ag pléle rud éigin a chur ar fáil ar RTÉ 2.  Bheadh sibh ag tabhairt droim láimhe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do chuile shórt a bhaineann leo dá mb'amhlaidh, mar ní bheadh aon suim agaibh ann agus theipfeadh air.  Nárbh fhearr i bhfad go mbeadh córas craolacháin faoi leith ag na stáisiúin, a fhéadfadh, mar shampla, comórtas peile na Gaeltachta, slógadh náisiúnta, an tOireachtas agus imeachtaí eile Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta a chraoladh nuair ba ghá.  Céard a tharlódh dá mbeadh príomhchomórtas amhránaíochta an Oireachtais ar siúl an oíche chéanna le cluiche sacair idir Éire agus tír éigin eile?</P>
    <P>Ní bheadh aon solúbthacht nó saoirse ag an tseirbhís dá sí brúite isteach i sceideal RTE 2.  Nuair a thosóidh <Col N="1877" /> RTÉ 2 ag cailliúint airgid, brúfar an Ghaeilge ar leataobh, agus sin mar a bheidh sí arís, go mbeidh muid caillte. Ní bhreathnófaí ar sheirbhís a bhain leis an Ghaeltacht mura mbeadh sí ag teacht as an nGaeltacht.  Ní bheadh mórán daoine ag éisteacht le Raidió na Gaeltachta dá mbeadh sé ag teacht amach as Montrose faoi láthair, mar a cheap daoine ar dtús.  Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta agus meitheal Theilifís na Gaeltachta in ann a chruthú gur féidir ceithre huaire déag an chloig in aghaidh na seachtaine a chur ar bun ar £6 mhilliún gan stró. Mura bhfuil an méid sin ar fáil leis an Ghaeilge a shábháil sa Ghaeltacht, cén mhaith a bheith ag caint?</P>
    <P>Tá a mbealach féin teilifíse ag na mionteangacha seo a leanas: an Bhreatnais, ar chostas £56 mhilliún in aghaidh na bliana; an Chatalónais ar chostas £64 mhilliún; an Bhascais, £33 mhilliún; an Fharóch, £1.6 mhilliún; teanga mhuintir Ghalicia, £35 mhilliún agus Gaedhilg na hAlban ar chostas £12 mhilliún in aghaidh na bliana. Muintir na Gaeltachta agus muintir na hÉireann, tada in aghaidh na bliana.  Tá tíortha eile in ann cláir a dhéanamh níos saoire ná RTÉ.  Dá mbeadh an tsolúbthacht fhoirne ann, ba chóir go bhféadfaí an tseirbhís a reachtáil ar thart ar £6 mhilliún sa bhliain.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote the Basque example and experience.  There has been a progressive decline in the language of the Basque region over the years with only an estimated 31 per cent of the 2.2 million Basque population speaking it in 1983 when Basque television was established. The need for an own language television service was seen as a necessity if the decline of the language was to be reversed.  The provision of the service has had a significant impact on the knowledge and use of the language and the following figures were recently published: 1983, Basque speakers 21 per cent; 1988, Basque speakers 24 per cent, up 3 per cent; people who know Basque, 1983, 14 per cent; people who know Basque, 1988, 17 per cent, up 3 per cent again, mar gheall ar go bhfuil teilifís dá gcuid féim, leo feín, sna tíortha sin.  This to me is akin to General Custer's last stand: for <Col N="1878" /> me, and the likes of me, the ultimate stand for the survival of Irish in the Gaeltacht. Is aisteacht liom í sin a rá ach caithfidh mé é a rá.</P>
    <P>I have lived and worked in Connemara for the last 40 years.  I have seen a living language grow thinner and lingering to death, which was once a noble and vibrant language, which is the only distinctive badge of nationality we can identify with.  In very recent years I have personally witnessed an alarming acceleration in the death pangs of Irish and I feel duty bound, as a Member of the Oireachtas, a Member of the Seanad and as an elected member of Údarás na Gaeltachta, to plead with my colleagues here today for a helping hand in our need and aim to keep the soul of Ireland alive.  The biggest single factor in the accelerated crisis is the influence of modern TV on the youth of the Gaeltacht.  The TV cartoon heroes of Gaeltacht children speak English.  The TV sport heroes of Gaeltacht youth speak English.  The TV music and pop heroes of Gaeltacht teenagers speak English and the TV chatshow heroes of Gaeltacht adults speak English.</P>
    <P>Can you, I or anyone blame them for turning to English?  Lack of firm Government policy, an overdose of political insincerity and lipservice, public cynicism and the intransigence of the language enthusiasts in the fifties in not accepting a bilingual policy have sadly brought us to where we are today.  The language death trap was arrested somewhat with the belated setting up of Raidio na Gaeltachta, but the imminent demise of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht has now been accelerated by the availability, almost without response, of a wide range of TV programmes in the English language that is almost completely negativing the great remedial work successfully carried out and undertaken by Raidio na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>The Irish language is ready to be coffined and waked in the Gaeltacht.  The next generation of native Irish speakers will be so diluted in language structures that I predict in 20 years' time an Irish speaking family will be as scarce in Connemara and the Aran Irelands as a settled <Col N="1879" /> red Indian will be in downtown Manhattan. I believe it; I have seen it happening in front of my eyes day after day for the last number of years.</P>
    <P>When I came to Connemara in the fifties, I was not a native Irish speaker but I became one in my own right.  My children are native Irish speakers.  My grandchildren are native Irish speakers.  I predict now that my great-grandchildren will not be native Irish speakers.  All our work will be in vain; it will be gone because of our intransigence and because of the lack of effort on our part to do something practical to keep it alive.</P>
    <P>Now we have Fianna Fáil and the PDs in Government and they can do one of two things.  I will be very blunt about this because it is so serious that you have to talk very bluntly in this affair.  They can recognise the symptoms, they can pull the emergency cord, rush the patients to an independent Irish language TV clinic and treat the Gaeltacht children with a massive injection of an all-Irish &ldquo;Bosco&rdquo;, an all-Irish &ldquo;Skippy&rdquo;, an all-Irish &ldquo;Dempsey's Den&rdquo;, an all-Irish &ldquo;Lassie&rdquo; and a feast of all-Irish cartoons.  Then and only then will the language be retrieved from the jaws of death.  Such remedial action would help to resuscitate the language and breed it back into the people who have it from their birth.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Fianna Fáil and the PDs in Coalition together can ignore the crisis.  They can order the hearse and preside over the obsequies with the usual blasphemous cúpla focal.  If this Government cannot afford £6 million to establish this vital, independent emergency cultural service and if this nation cannot provide £6 million annually to run the service, then we do not deserve an Irish language.  There is no soul left in a nation that abandons its birthright.  It would be fitting to let the language die peacefully, because die it will without the lifeline of an all-Irish independent television station, and that very urgently.</P>
    <P>I make this plea for broad political support in this House irrespective of party political persuasion.  I do so on behalf of all the Gaeltacht families who, <Col N="1880" /> like myself, have remained faithful to the Gaeilge over the past 40 years in the Gaeltacht and who, like me, have passed on that great tradition to their children and to their children's children.  I also speak especially on behalf of the families outside the Gaeltacht who have sacrificed much to raise Irish speaking families under severe adverse conditions and sometimes in hostile environments.  The political charade must stop.  We all know that Nero fiddled while Rome burned.  I now see the Irish language die as Governments pay lipservice to it &mdash; and I include successive Governments in that, not only the one at the moment.</P>
    <P>After 70 years we still have an educational system which cannot produce ordinary Irish speakers despite 12 years of Irish language tuition in our schools. We have a Department which is so rigid that it repeatedly refused to recognise fully the special delicate position of the Gaeltacht in the educational system. Now we see the sad result.  We have a Department of the Gaeltacht run by a Minister for the Gaeltacht who never set foot within his own moribund Department in Grand Canal Street, just a mere five minutes walk from this House, who never visits the Gaeltacht or shows the slightest interest in his job, who hijacked a full Cabinet Ministry and then lowered the status to a Minister of State.  At least the Coalition Government gave us our full Ministry with a full voice at the Cabinet table.  A Gaeltacht Minister who still had not met the Bord of Údarás na Gaeltachta which is his direct responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A Gaeltacht Minister who never visits the Gaeltacht or shows the slightest interest, who hijacked a full Cabinet Ministry; a Gaeltacht Minister who still has not met the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta which is his direct responsibility; a Gaeltacht Minister who leaves the two small Aran Islands without the basic structures of a proper pier and still promotes the spending of millions of pounds on a barren, desolate uninhabited Gaeltacht island beside his beloved Inishvickilaun; a Gaeltacht Minister who gives £1 million to University College, Galway, in the name of the Irish language, an institution which refuses to implement a statutory obligation towards the Irish language under a 1929 UCG Dáil Act; a Minister who promises he will establish an Irish language television station but does nothing about it and allows his Gaeltacht Department to frustrate its status by dillying and dallying while his civil servants are playing ducks and drakes with our language crisis.  They are passing the buck backwards and forwards to the Department of Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Gaeltacht, in my view, is the biggest single obstacle to the provision of an Irish independent television service.  Could you expect otherwise since they have no head, no boss, no Minister and they are left to their own devices?  They could not give an intelligent or educated answer when brought before the Oireachtas Committee for the Irish Language a few short weeks ago when asked about the present position regarding the establishment of the Irish language TV station &mdash; a non-event is what the Chairman called it. If this Seanad was allegedly brought into disrepute some weeks ago by the antics of its Members, I suggest that the Department of the Gaeltacht has been brought into greater disrepute by the antics of its Minister, who does not even recognise the responsibilities of the Ministry.  He supports a Department with its head in the sand and which is hell bent on flying in the face of the Gaeltacht population <Col N="1882" /> which they are paid to serve.  They do not deserve the name of Gaeltacht Department if they do not stand four square behind the unprecedented demand of Gaeltacht and Irish speakers generally throughout the country to establish an independent Irish television station in the Gaeltacht and not a link-up with RTE 2.</P>
    <P>I call on the Taoiseach, whenever he gets word and his Department's advisers to sit down with the promoters of Feachtas Náisiúnta Téilifíse and the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta and listen to the arguments and demands before he makes a final decision.  The Gaeltacht, as the custodian of the language, is on its last legs and in a state of <i>rigor mortis</i>, where its Minister abandoned ship to look after the affairs of Europe.  If the Taoiseach does not move in providing an Irish independent language TV service this year he will be remembered as a Taoiseach who hijacked the job of Gaeltacht affairs, promised an Irish television service, abandoned ship and put the final nails in the Gaeltacht coffin.  He will be clearly referred to in history as the Taoiseach who scuttled the Irish language.</P>
    <P>A crisis situation has arisen and crisis funding must be got if my proposals are to follow through.  There are a few ways in which to get money very quickly without any great cost to this State.  I would close down the Department of the Gaeltacht offices in Dublin.  They are irrelevant because the Taoiseach and the Ministers need not visit them.  I would close down the Department of the Gaeltacht office in Furbo and I would rehouse the staff next door in the office of Údarás na Gaeltachta &mdash; integrate the two of them; there is plenty of room there for them.  I would redeploy about 30 of the staff of Údarás na Gaeltachta and Roinn na Gaeltachta and would get jobs for some of them in this new Teilifís na Gaeltachta. I would then make the Gaeltacht office in Furbo available as a main studio and headquarters for Teilifís na Gaeilge and I would form a company between Údarás na Gaeltachta and Radio Teilifís Éireann to get on with the work.  I would also confine the company to a £6 million start-up cost without any more extras <Col N="1883" /> allowed.  Where would that come from? &mdash; £1 million direct from the Exchequer in 1991; £1 million direct from the Roinn na Gaeltachta Estimate 1991; £1 million from Údarás na Gaeltachta Estimates in 1991 &mdash; that is £3 million.  I could tell you where you would get the £1 million in Roinn na Gaeltachta.  I would see what is being wasted and what could be used far better by providing this service.  I would repeat that in 1992, and there is your £6 million without cost to the State of one penny extra.  I would confine the running and the administration costs to a ceiling of £6 million also.  A surcharge of 5 per cent on income from TV licences would bring in about £2 million.  And the national lottery?  Why not?  If you can give £1 million to University College, Galway, for doing nothing, why not give £2 million to save the language in the Gaeltacht and throughout the country? Roinn na Gaeltachta and Údarás na Gaeltachta a subvention of £1 million each every year, and there is your £6 million.</P>
    <P>Sin an chaoi a bhfuil an scéal.  Bhí orm é sin a chur trasna i mBéarla mar bhí a fhios agam nach dtabharfaí éisteacht dom.  Agus sin cuid eile de: tháinig mé anseo ag iarraidh mo phointe a chur trasna, ag iarraidh go mbeadh Gaeilge á caomhnú sa Ghaeltacht agus gan aon deis agam í a labhairt anseo, fiú amháin i gceart, mar nach bhfuil aon chóras aistriúcháin ann.  Deirtear go mbeidh sé ann sa samhradh.  Mura mbeidh sé ann sa samhradh agus mura mbeidh Teilifís na Gaeltachta ann sa samhradh, beidh lá eile ag an bPaorach, agus againn uilig.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag iarraidh, mar sin, a Chathaoirligh, go mbúnófar bealach teilifíse a fhreastalódh ar phobal na Gaeltachta agus lucht labhartha na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre ar fad, na Sé Chontae san áireamh.  Tá mé ag iarraidh go mbeidh an lárionad sa Ghaeltacht agus go mbeidh údarás neamhspleách ar a mbeadh ionadaithe ó na ceantair Ghaeltachta agus eagraíochtaí éagsúla i mbun a reachtála ón tús, go bhfreastalódh sé ar na mionphobail Ghaeltachta ón tús.  Ba chóir dó dul i gcomhar le Rialtas na Breataine faoi <Col N="1884" /> fhreastal ar na Sé Chontae.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh neart ag gach pobal Gaeltachta ón tús, mionphobail san áireamh, agus ba chóir go mbeadh Gaeilge ag gach ball foirne ón tús agus gur trí Ghaeilge a dhéanfaí na cláir agus béim ar leith ar chláir do dhaoine óga agus páistí.  Tá súil agam, agus tá mé ag iarraidh, nuair a bheadh sé seo pléite seachtain eile, agus vótáil déanta air, go bhfeicfidh daoine an tábhacht atá leis sin, agus go dtiocfaidh siad agus go vótáilfidh siad go gcuirfear seirbhís iomlán Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht ar bun ar son na tíre.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go gcuirfidh muid sinn féin san áireamh ag an bpointe seo maidir leis an phointe a rinne an tOllamh sin ó Shasana, go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag fáil bháis, nach féidir léi leanúint ar aghaidh, agus sin an fáth gur chuir mé an rún seo chun tosaigh.  Tá loitiméireacht á déanamh i leith na Gaeilge.  Is é an rud is mó ag an nóiméad seo a thabharfadh cúnamh don Ghaeilge fanacht beo ná teilifís neamhspleách Gaeltachta, agus tá mé ag iarraidh ar chuile Theachta agus ar chuile Sheanadóir anseo tacaíocht a thabhairt don inspioráid sin lena chinntiú go mbeidh mo chuid gasúr sa Ghaeltacht, agus bhur gcuid gasúr nach bhfuil sa Ghaeltacht, in ann bheith ag breathnú ar theilifís Ghaeilge agus go mbeidh deis acu dul chun cinn sa saol seo agus nach mbeidh muid ag cur tórraimh ar an Ghaeilge, mar atá ráite ag an bhfear sin ó Shasana.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá mé ag tabhairt tacaíochta don rún seo ar na fáthanna seo leanas.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, de réir thuairisc Hindley le déanaí, níl aon dabht ach go bhfuil teanga na Gaeilge ag fáil bháis, fiú sna Gaeltachtaí.  Is í an teilifís an fórsa is cumasaí i saol na leanaí sna réigiúin seo, mar aon le gach réigiún eile.  Deir Hindley, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Foighil, go bhfuil níos mó airde ag na leanaí ar na cláir theilifís ná ar chomhrá agus caint na dtuismitheoirí.  Mar sin, má tá an teanga le caomhnú agus le neartú, tá sé riachtanach go mbeidh córas maith teilifíse trí Ghaeilge ann.  Tá a fhios ag an saol i <Col N="1885" /> láthair na huaire cé chomh cumasach is atá an teilifís mar mheán cumarsáide.  Tá tacaíocht á fháil ag daltaí scoile ina gcuid oibre, ó chláracha trí Bhéarla.  Níl an tacaíocht seo le fáil acu maidir leis an Gaeilge.  Má táthar chun tréan-iarracht a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge, ní foláir bealach teilifíse Gaeilge a bhunadh ar a mbeadh cláracha fiúntacha, suimiúla a bheadh dírithe ar pháistí réamhscoile, ar pháistí bunscoile agus ar dhaltaí meánscoile. Níl a mhalairt de shlí ann chun aos óg na tíre a mhealladh i dtreo na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá glactha go hiomlán anois le Raidió na Gaeltachta agus tá tábhacht náisiúnta ag gabháil leis.  Ní mór dúinn, áfach, a chur san áireamh gur thosaigh Raidió na Gaeltachta mar stáisiún mídhleathach, ar a tugadh Raidió Chonamara.</P>
    <P>I would like to state here that Raidio na Gaeltachta began illegally and that it is of great legislative importance in Gaeltacht areas.  B'éigean dúinn Raidió na Gaeltachta a airgeadú le teann náire. We had to be shamed into setting up Raidió na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Baineann an dearcadh céanna le bunú Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  Nílimid i ndáirire i dtaobh na Gaeilge ar RTÉ 1 ná ar RTÉ 2.  Níl seirbhís oiriúnach á soláthar dúinn. Tá glactha leis go domhanda gur fórsaí tábhachtacha iad na meáin chumarsáide agus de réir an eolais atá ar fáil, tá meas domhanda ar an teilifís mar mheán cumarsáide. Caitheann aos óg na tíre an oiread céanna ama ag breathnú ar theilifís agus a chaitheann siad ar scoil: &ldquo;Eight hundred hours a year at school, one thousand hours ag breathnú ar theilifís&rdquo;. Tá sé seo an-tábhachtach.</P>
    <P>Tagraím anois do fhás tábhachtach na naíscoileanna ar fud na tíre agus go háirithe i gceantair ar nós Tamhlacht, Cluain Dolcáin, Baile Munna agus South Hill i Luimneach.  Tá sé ar intinn ag VEC Chontae Chorcaí meánscoil lán-Ghaelach a oscailt i mBaile an Chollaig.  Is ábhar dóchais dúinn an dul chun cinn seo uilig.  Bhí an Ghaeilge ag maireachtáil i bhfolúntais i scoileanna na tíre seo, go dtí seo; má táthar chun í a neartú, ní mór go gcloisfí sa Teach í.  In ionad a bheith ag brú na Gaeilge ar dhaoine, ba chóir dúinn deiseanna a thabhairt dóibh chun <Col N="1886" /> í a chloisteáil, ní amháin sa Daingean agus i gConamara, ach sa bhaile freisin.</P>
    <P>I am speaking today on this motion not being from a fíor-Ghaeltacht but because I feel strongly about the language.  As a teacher I am aware that young people are influenced by the immediacy on television and that the instant nature of television is about the only way we can hope to keep the language, to revive it, to make it relevant to the needs and to the lifestyles of young people.  My generation certainly will not save the language but hopefully the present generation and the generation that are now looking for the naíscoileanna in every part of the country particularly in urban Limerick, Cork and Dublin and pushing very hard for those schools are the people who will switch on to perhaps dhá uair a chloig ar bhealach 4, as we hope the new station will be.</P>
    <P>Tá polasaí na Gaeilge millte le cur i gcéill agus le cur amú airgid.  Ní mór dúinn an t-airgead a infheistiú i seirbhís theilifís Gaeilge.  Tá teipthe ar na polasaithe atá anois againn mar go bhfuil laghdú tar éis teacht ar líon na gcainteoirí sna Gaeltachtaí.  Tuigeann níos mó daoine Gaeilge anois ná mar a thuigeadh, agus tá an teanga i gcúl ár gcinn againn uilig, ach é a thabhairt chun tosaigh.</P>
    <P>Israel and Finland had a far more difficult task before them when they set about reviving their languages.  In Finland they had to try to get their language roots from legends.  In Israel they had a commitment to the language.  It is extraordinary that as a nation that lays such stress and emphasis on our culture we have not been able to revive our language. I see myself as guilty as anybody else.  Because of this motion I am glad that I was at least able to take out the remnants of secondary school Irish. Obviously if we were to use it more often in Seanad Éireann and be influenced by the eloquence of an Seanadóir Ó Foighil. an Seanadóir Ó Murchú as Corcaigh, an Seanadóir Ó Cuív agus Seanadóirí eile we would have greater fluency.  Perhaps we should push for putting our money where our mouths are and conducting quite a bit of the business of the Seanad as Gaeilge.  We would probably <Col N="1887" /> not have the hassle and the carry-on that is taking place, because the Gaeilge would not be long putting a stop to quite a lot of the irritations and annoyances that have happened over the last few months.  We might be far more specific in relation to our topics and we might get far more business done.</P>
    <P>Cad atá ag teastáil uainn?  Is é atá ag teastáil ná bealach teilifíse a fhreastalódh ar an dá chontae is tríocha, ar an nGalltacht agus ar an nGaeltacht araon, agus go cothrom.  Ní seirbhís Theilifís Gaeilge ná Gaeltachta amháin atá i gceist; Bealach 4 atá ag teastáil.  Ní leor breis ama a sholáthar ar RTÉ 2, fiú dhá uair a chloig sa ló.  Tá sé riachtanach go mbeadh an dá uair a chloig sin ar fáil i gcónaí go neamhspleách ar bhrú eacnamaíochta nó ar bhrú sceidil.  Meabhraimíd duinn féin gurb í an clár Gaeilge a mhaireadh ar feadh leath uair a' chloig, a ligeadh chun siúil nuair a tháinig brú airgeadais ar Century Radio.  Chaill iníon Aire a post.  I do not know whether I am allowed state his name in the Seanad.  It appears I am not. Chaill iníon a post, with a question mark as to whose iníon she was.</P>
    <P>Cé gur chóir go mbeadh an tseirbhís ag freastal ar an tír ar fad, ní mór dó a bheith lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht chun a chinntiú go mbeidh na cláracha dá riaradh in atmasféar Gaelach.  B'fhearr i bhfad go mbeadh an teilifís neamhspleách ar Raidió na Gaeltachta.  Tá a mhalairt de mheon ag teastáil le go rachadh sé i bhfeidhm ar an aos óg.  Tá an-eagsúlacht idir an raidió agus an teilifís mar mheán cumarsáide agus bheadh tuairim is 200 postanna dá gcruthú le staisiún teilifíse Gaeltachta, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil.  Bheadh moill ar Rialtas ar bith caiteachas de £9 milliún a chosnódh an teilifís a bhunú de réir Údarás na Gaeltachta. Is é mo bharúil féin ná go mb'fhéidir é a bhunú ar £5 mhilliún nó faoina bhun sin.  Muna bhfuil an Rialtas sásta an t-airgead seo a chur ar fáil, tá slite eile inar féidir tabhairt faoi.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to RTÉ, financed by licence and advertising revenue which is expected to be responsible to State guidelines on the nature and functions of <Col N="1888" /> public service broadcasting.  The statute states:</P>
    <P>In performing its function the Authority shall, in its programming, be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland and to have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I certainly would put a question mark as to whether that statute is being implemented.  Raidio na Gaeltacha, I admit has bonded together diverse Gaeltacht communities with different dialects and has supported the Government policy of preserving the status of the Gaeltacht as a community with a special and distinctive language.  The provision of Teilifís na Gaeltachta would build on developments achieved by Raidió na Gaeltachta and would be far more available and would have far greater impetus and a greater entry to the homes of Ireland than Raidió na Gaeltachta which, to my mind, serves the more indigenous native speakers rather than Teilifís na Gaeltachta which I would hope would be extended to everybody within the Thirtytwo Counties.</P>
    <P>I obviously have pleasure in seconding the motion put forward by Fine Gael in Private Members' time by the Fine Gael group but in particular by an Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil who since he came to this House has done a tremendous amount for the language and hopefully the córas aistriúcháin that he repeatedly looks for will be in use soon so that we can all be in a position to understand Teilifís na Gaeltachta when, hopefully, it will be transmitted to every home in the country.</P>

      <P>Chun na focail go léir tar éis &ldquo;Go&rdquo; a scrios agus an méid seo a leanas a chur in a áit:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;bhfáiltíonn Seanad Éireann roimh an staidéar cúramach atá á dhéanamh ag na hAirí Cumarsáide agus Gaeltachta maidir le ceist na <Col N="1889" /> teilifíse trí Ghaeilge agus go ndearbhaíonn sé lán-mhuinín as an cur chuige atá á ghlacadh acu faoin ábhar seo.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>D'éist mé go cúramach lena raibh le rá ag an mbeirt Sheanadóir a chuaigh romham. Níor mhaith liomsa tosú ag tarraingt cúrsaí staire anseo, ach tar éis an méid atá ráite, ní dóigh liomsa go bhféadfainn seasamh sa Teach seo gan cúpla rud a chur ina gceart.  Mar a dúradh an lá a tionscnaíodh Raidió na Gaeltachta an chéad uair, bhí an smaoineamh a bhí ag muintir Fhianna Fáil ag dul i bhfad siar, siar go dtí na tríochadaí maidir le Raidió Gaeltachta a bhunú.  Agus ba iad Fianna Fáil a bhunaigh an raidió sin.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liomsa, murach an Raidió, go mbeadh an ghéarchéim atá ann maidir leis an Ghaeilge anois seacht n-oiread níos measa ná mar atá.  Is nós liomsa sa Teach seo gan óráid ar bith dhéanamh gan Gaeilge a úsáid.  Cúis díoma domsa nuair a tháinig mé isteach anseo nach raibh córas aistriúcháin ann.  Tá mé, i mo bhealach ciúin, tar éis mo chion féin a dhéanamh féachaint chuige go mbeadh sé sin ann, agus tá an-áthas orm go bhfuil sé mar pholasaí ag muintir Fhianna Fáil ar fad sa Seanad féachaint chuige go gcuirfear ann é agus go gcuirfear an fhoireann chuige ar fáil.  Ach ní dóigh liomsa inniu gur ag caint, ar bhealach, le Gaeilgeoirí na tíre atá mé.</P>
    <P>Leis an gceist áirid seo agus le go n-éireoidh linn an rud atá romhainn a dhéanamh, caithfimid a chur ina luí ar phobal na tíre trí chéile an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an gceist seo.  Mar sin, tá i gceist agam labhairt ar an ábhar seo i mBéarla sa Teach seo anocht.</P>
    <P>Since I grew to adulthood, and particularly since I went to live in the Gaeltacht, and with the development of technology and the impact that I saw television having both in a negative and positive sense, I have been convinced of the need for a television service through the medium of Irish.  I see on one hand, the damage being done by the lack of such a service and, on the other hand, and much more importantly because I like to look at the positive side of things, <Col N="1890" /> I also see that in television we have at our disposal now a powerful medium because of its visual content as well as its linguistic context, in its ability to transmit and to teach in a way that no other medium can, in a way that people find attractive and acceptable.</P>
    <P>I have worked and given support to those people who for a long time have been working to promote this concept of Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  I know they appreciate the fact that Fianna Fáil very swiftly, and particularly the Taoiseach, recognised the fundamental importance of this issue, not only to the language in the Gaeltacht but to the development of the language throughout the country.  It is with pride I stand here and say that after a relatively short public agenda the Taoiseach ordered a study to be carried out by Údarás na Gaeltachta, staidéar féidireachta maidir le bunadh Teilifís na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Taoiseach has shown such personal interest in this subject and despite what an Seanadóir Ó Foighil said some time ago, my belief is that by his actions he has shown that he has taken the most fundamental decision in modern times regarding the future of the Irish language in giving his support to the starting of a process that will ensure a resolution to this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell for a few moments on the reason the Irish language is necessary because without looking at that aspect I do not think we can convince the people of the country at large that there should be expenditure on it.  I think most people in this country, and I am now speaking particularly of those people who do not have a knowledge of the language, accept that the Irish language is not just another minority language but is, in its own way, very much the essence of what makes us Irish and what binds us together.  Despite the fact that it is not used daily by the vast majority of people, it is something that we, as a nation, have that is truly ours.  I think that when they reflect on this &mdash; and this is borne out by the interest that parents throughout the country show in the Coláistí Gaeilge, Gaelscoileanna and so on &mdash; most people <Col N="1891" /> would be very sad if anything were done to damage the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I do feel however, that maybe we Gaelgoiri, bhéidir muidne ata sa nGaeltacht, we have not explained the danger, the threat, the pressure the language is under, particularly in the Gaeltacht but also the difficulties, unnecessary difficulties, for those promoting the language throughout the country because of the lack of a television service.  I think we must get across to the people of the country that if we put money into this service it will probably cause the greatest upsurge of interest in the language not only within the Gaeltacht areas but will also be the most fundamental step forward for the language throughout the country.  I do not think there is a person in this country with any sense of national pride who could look, with equanimity, at the decline of a language that has been spoken in this country from time immemorial.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell for a few minutes on some of the problems regarding the Gaeltacht.  Most people associate the need for a television service in the Gaeltacht serving the people of the Gaeltacht as well as the people in the rest of the country, with a service for those people for whom Irish is the home language. Because of patterns of shifting population, marriage and so on, we have another major problem in the Gaeltacht and that is families where you have an Irish speaker and a non-Irish speaker as parents.  It is very important if we are to maintain Irish as a common language of Gaeltacht schools that the children of either totally English speaking families or bilingual families, which we find generally have a great grá for the language, will have a knowledge of the language from their earliest youth.</P>
    <P>The question then arises, for whom are we looking for this service and where would it be based?  The service that is being sought and the service I would hope to see there would be a service for all the people of this country, north and south, east and west, Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht. However, my personal belief is <Col N="1892" /> that the television service when it is started should be based in the Gaeltacht area.  The reasons for this are many and I will try to summarise them.</P>
    <P>One reason is because I think it is in that milieu, and I think this has been proven as regards Irish programmes on Raidio na Gaeltachta as opposed to Radio Éireann, you will provide a service which is part of the real world, as we would term it, where we are not always self-consciously talking in Irish about Irish, where Irish is being used as a natural medium to discuss all controversial and other issues of the day.</P>
    <P>The second thing is that it is inevitable that to do an adquate job most or many, of the staff would come from Gaeltacht areas.  It would be a pity to recruit Gaeltacht people for such a service and to move them out of the Gaeltacht with their families.  My experience has been that where jobs are provided that have a relevance to the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, they also tend to have an effect on the language of the families of those people.  You would get a higher incidence of the use of Irish among those people because it relates to their jobs than you would from other jobs.</P>
    <P>Here we have come to the nub of the question.  The question of cost.  It is very easy in Opposition to promote week after week proposals that cost money.  On this issue I would say it is absolutely important that everybody attached to the Irish language, to Údarás, Bord na Gaeilge and everything else would state quite clearly what their priorities are for expenditure so that, if necessary, some of the funding would come from a reallocation of certain funds that maybe do not apply in the world of 1990.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think we will have to look at the question of the fee for a licence which stands at £43.3 million and accept that the justification for that fee being given to anybody, as it is to RTÉ at the moment, is because of the public service element of broadcasting, the non-commercial element of broadcasting and, therefore, it is reasonable as in the case of Raidio na Gaeltachta, as in the case of the National Symphony Orchestra, that an allocation <Col N="1893" /> out of that licence would be made to provide this very necessary national service.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor eile ar mhaith liom a rá ar an ábhar seo.  Tá an-áthas orm an deis phoiblí seo a fháil le tréaslú leis an Taoiseach, Aire na Gaeltachta, agus leis an Aire Stáit ar Roinn na Gaeltachta &mdash; agus is iontach an rud é beirt a bheith ann ag breathnú i ndiaidh an chúraim &mdash; as an saothar atá déanta.  Níl aon amhras ormsa gurb iad Fianna Fáil a chuirfidh ann teilifís Ghaeilge do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ar ball beag.</P>

      <P>I wish to second the amendment and I will be brief and to the point because we have had very many excellent contributions here this evening on this motion.  I am a good many years in the House now and I have not heard any finer contributions than I have heard here from all speakers who have spoken on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are committed to the provision of a service, not alone to the Gaeltacht but to the entire country.  In relation to this, the Taoiseach has requested Údarás na Gaeltachta to provide him with recommendations.  This is a reasonable request especially where all the various views have to be taken into consideration and looked at at first hand. These were presented to Roinn na Gaeltachta in October of last year, I understand. Since then it has been examined by the Department of Communications <Col N="1894" /> who have also asked RTE for their expert opinion.  They have been in this field very successfully down through the years and that is a very understandable way of conducting business.</P>
    <P>Various people can propose items when they are in Opposition and say what is favourable to their own localities and their own communities but all we have to do is look at the record from 1982 to 1987.  It speaks for itself.  The first All-Ireland Hurling Final was played in Croke Park and where was the leader, the Head of State representing our Parliament, on that day?  I will say no more.</P>
    <P>I want to speak on the financial aspect of this.  I know that 70 per cent of all money spent on marketing in this country is spent on the medium of television.  That is a fact.  There is the marketing survey done free of charge.  The marketing people do not have to look any further to spend money, it is all spent on television. It is the medium that creates the greatest impact and we must accept that fact.</P>
    <P>In relation to that I must agree with one of the previous speakers.  I see nothing wrong with &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; coming across in Irish, I see nothing wrong with &ldquo;Bibi&rdquo; in Irish, I see nothing wrong with &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; being presented by Seán Ban in Irish.  All we have to do is look at Raidió na Gaeltachta, look at RTÉ.  The `most successful radio programme today is not Gay Byrne's morning programme. It may be a long running programme but the longest running, most successful programme on radio today is &ldquo;Céilí House requests&rdquo;.  What a treasure it would be and a pleasure for everyone around the country to have &ldquo;Céilí House&rdquo; every night on television, a crossroads céili or a céili with the Doonaree Céili Band or the Kilfenora or the Liverpool Céili bands.  This is the Irish face of Ireland that we all want to see on television and we are not getting it.</P>

      <P>The rare time I make a contribution here I want it to be taken seriously.  I can speak from facts.  Facts speak for themselves; it is not just pie in the sky.  There is massive demand for this type of television and it would be an outstanding success if we had a few pointers to the right way.  I do not want to see a 100 per cent Irish channel coming from Donnybrook.  That would be the death knell.  A percentage of it can come from Donnybrook but I want to see it coming from Cork, Kerry, Galway, Donegal, Mayo, Tipperary or my own constituency, Meath, not to speak of the new Irish College, Coláiste Clon Lir in Cualainn, Iarmhí.  I know it would be an outstanding success; many Irish companies would spend money advertising and it would pay for itself.  Every Sunday one can see people travelling by car to hurling matches or Gaelic football matches. They are the big games.  I am not against foreign sports.  I am for all sports but I am totally opposed to RTE broadcasting for two hours or an hour and a half a match with 46 people in attendance.  It is appalling.  In Cusack Park in Mullingar there would be 3,000 at a semi-final or an under-21 match.  There should be a proper set of priorities and the majority of the people should get what they want.</P>
      <P>We are in big business and all we need are small resources to start with.  We know we have the facilities, the best in the world as was proved during the Papal visit.  RTÉ were congratulated worldwide for their coverage of that event.  They have the most sophisticated, up-to-date equipment, and they have the best backup and technology to provide a service that the people need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I enjoyed &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo;<Col N="1896" /> presented by Liam Ó Murchú.  Donncha Ó Dulaing presented the programme &ldquo;Highways and Byways&rdquo;.  Everything that was good in Irish has been taken off the television screens and radio and this was done for some unknown reason. They were the most popular television and radio shows.  I am pleased to say I am one of those who survived.  I have a successful track record in advertising with RTÉ for 20 years and I would classify myself as a fair judge of the scene.  I have a good idea of what the people want because it is down to personal choice at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa a rá i dtús báire go bhfuilim sásta cúig nóiméad a thabhairt don Seanadóir Murphy ag deireadh mo chuid cainte.  Ba mhaith liom freisin, toisc go bhfuil sé ar an gcéad deis phoiblí atá agam, mo chomhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit mar go dtuigim go bhfuil sé nuaphósta.  An seanscéal anseo arís anocht, agus ó thaobh an Rialtais de, dhaoine mar an Seanadóir Cassidy ag seasamh suas agus na hargóintí céanna á gcur inár láthair atá déanta agus seandéanta, ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil roimhré, agus ansin tá siad anois sásta vótáil <Col N="1897" /> i gcoinne an rúin atá molta aige.  Mar sin go díreach é.</P>
      <P>Tá siad anois, leis an leasú seo, sásta vótáil a dhéanamh i gcoinne sheirbhís teilifíse a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Sin mar atá, and there's no getting away from it.  Tá sé chomh simplí sin.  Níl sa leasú seo ach iarracht shiniciúil le bac a chur leis an rún seo agus an dul chun cinn atá beartaithe agus atá molta ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil.  Nílimse sásta go bhfuil aon dul ar aghaidh ann.  Cad atá sa leasú?  Go bhfuil an Taoiseach anois sásta fanacht leis na moltaí a cuireadh ina láthair sé mhí ó shin beagnach.</P>
      <P>Tá cáipéis curtha i láthair ag Feachtas Náisiúnta Theilifís an Gaeltachta, agus tá tacaíocht tugtha do na moltaí sin ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Is é Údarás na Gaeltacht an t-eagras atá ag an Rialtas chun moltaí a thabhairt dóibh ar ghnéithe áirithe de shaol agus dul chun cinn agus forbairt na Gaeltachta.  Mar sin féin, cé go bhfuil an suirbhé acu, cé go bhfuil na moltaí acu, cé go bhfuil tacaíocht ag na moltaí sin ó Údarás na Gaeltachta agus go bhfuil siad i lámha an Rialtais le sé mhí anuas, níl aon dul chun cinn déanta.  Seo é an tríú huair agamsa ag labhairt ar an ábhar seo ó toghadh mé do Sheanad Éireann trí bliana ó shin.  Bhí sé agam dhá bhliain ó shin mar ábhar ar an Athló.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí an Taoiseach tar éis a rá go poiblí go raibh sé sásta £500,000 nó £1 mhilliún a chur ar fáil chun seirbhís phíolóite theilifís Ghaeltachta a chur ar fáil.  Sin an ghealliúint a bhí tugtha, sin an tuiscint a bhí ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus sin an tuiscint a bhí agamsa, Ach cá bhfuil an £500,000 nó milliún?  Níl aon dul chun cinn ann, níl aon fheiscint ar an airgead. Mar sin féin, tá muintir na Gaeltachta fós ag brath ar gheallúintí agus gan aon dul chun cinn déanta.  Ní haon mhaitheas domsa bheith ag tosú arís ar na hargóintí atá curtha i láthair an tSeanaid anocht ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil.  Ach ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil sé mar mholadh ón Rialtas gur chóir go mbeadh dhá uair an chloig in aghaidh na hoíche tóghta ó RTE 2 chun Gaeilge a chur i láthair.  Níl ansin <Col N="1898" /> ach Gaeilge á brú siar scórnach mhuintir na tíre seo, daoine nach bhfuil sásta féachaint uirthi nó éisteacht lei.  That's the reality, agus sin an seanscéal.  Níl ann dáiríre ach iarracht shiniciúil chun cos ar bholg a chur ar RTÉ agus ar an Ghaeilge. Ní leigheas ar bith ar an scéal an moladh sin.  Nílimse sásta leis agus ní cóir go mbeadh aon duine sásta leis agus, mo náire baill Fhianna Fáil atá sásta dul ar aghaidh agus tacaíocht a thabhairt don mholadh amaideach sin.</P>
    <P>Bhuail mé an tseachtain seo caite le dream ón bhfeachtas náisiúnta agus do phléigh mé an cháipéis a bhí acu leo.  Sa cháipéis a cuireadh os ár gcomhar do bhí suirbhé déanta ar na costaisí atá ag baint le seirbhís a chur ar fáil.  Tá sé léirithe go maith ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil nuair a bhí sé ag moladh an rúin anocht.  Ar an bpointe sin, an bhfuilimid cinnte anois go bhféadfaí 14 uair in aghaidh na seachtaine a chur ar fáil ar chostas £6 mhilliún in aghaidh na bliana?  An é nach bhfuilimid sásta an méid sin airgid a chur ar fáil don Ghaeilge?  An é go gcaithfimid bheith ag éisteacht le daoine mar an Seanadóir Ó Foighil ag seasamh suas anseo agus a rá go bhfuil sé ceart go leor againn bheith ag moladh rudaí ach go gcosnaíonn siad airgead: cosnaíonn.  There are no cheap tricks in this one.  This is a quality product we are talking about here.  Caithfimid bheith sásta an t-airgead a infheistiú.</P>
    <P>Má tá cultúr na tíre agus teanga na tíre chomh tábhachtach sin dúinn, ba chóir go mbeimis níos sásta airgead a infheistiú i gcóras mar seo.  Tá forbairt na Gaeilge, if we are ever going to revive the language, ag brath ar an gcóras oideachais. Tá an córas oideachais ag dul ar aghaidh go bacach ar an rud seo.  Níl tacaíocht ann dóibh, níl acmhainní ann dóibh.  Agus níl airgead ann chun aon dul chun cinn a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a leathadh agus a fhorbairt agus chun go mbeadh borradh fúithi.</P>
    <P>Níl sé ach deich mbliana ó chuir Fianna Fáil, nuair a bhí cumhacht Rialtais acu, Páipéar Bán faoi bhráid na tíre, a raibh moltaí áirithe ann ó thaobh mhúineadh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna de.  Bhí moltaí <Col N="1899" /> ann faoi sheans a thabhairt do dhaltaí scoile tréimhse a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht. Ní dhearnadh tada riamh faoi seo. Tá seilfeanna, cibé áit a bhfuil siad, lán de shuirbhéanna agus mholtí chun tacaíocht a thabhairt don Ghaeilge, ach ní fheadar an bhfuil aon dul chun cinn déanta, ní fheadar an bhfuil aon airgead infheistithe ann.  Ní chreidim go bhfuil an Rialtas dáiríre faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge.  Níl aon torthaí feicthe agamsa ar an méid atá beartaithe ag an Rialtas.  Tá a lán cloiste agam ach níl aon rud feicthe agam den dul chun cinn atá in ainm bheith déanta acu.</P>
    <P>An mbeadh an tAire Stáit sásta dáta a lua maidir le tosú sheirbhís theilifís na Gaeltachta?  Sin an rud atá uainn, sa dóigh is go dtig linn oibriú le chéile ar an ábhar seo.  Níl mé sásta go bhfuil na geallúintí atá déanta ag an Taoiseach chomhlíonta aige nó ag an Rialtas.  Cuimhnigh go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ag brath air seo.  Ba chóir do dhaoine lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht iniúchadh a dhéanamh ar shaol na Gaeltachta agus na deacrachtaí atá ann do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá an ceart ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil nuair a deir sé go bhfuil an Ghaeilge chóir a bheith marbh ag an bpointe seo, go bhfuil leanaí ó theaghlaigh Ghaeltachta ag teacht chun na scoile in aois a ceathair dóibh agus gan focal Gaeilge acu.  Cén chaoi a mbeadh agus iad ag féachaint ar theilifís Bhéarla an t-am ar fad.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag caint le fear Gaeltachta atá pósta le bean ón bhFrainc.  Tá sé ag brath satellite dish a chur isteach chun go mbeidh seans ag a chlann seirbhís Fraincíse a bheith acu.  Fear i gceartlár na Gaeltachta agus gan aon teacht aige ar theilifís Ghaeilge Ghaeltachta.</P>

      <P>Is úsáideach an gléas é an Chathaoir chun duine a choimeád ciúin ar feadh tamaillín.  Tá mé anbhuíoch de mo chomhleacaí, an Seanadóir Joe O'Toole, as cuid dá chuid ama a thabhairt dom.  Bíonn sé i gconaí cáirdiúil agus croíúil liom.  Lá éigin cúiteoidh mé a fhlaithiúlacht liom.  Níl uaim ach a rá go bhfuilim ag tabhairt mo thacaíochta don rún.  Tá na mionrudaí ráite go maith ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil, agus an tseachtain seo caite bhí na staitisticí agus na fíricí go léir á bplé thall ag Óstán Buswells ag an bhFeachtas Náisiúnta Teilifíse.  Mar sin, níl le déanamh agam ach ach cuidiú leis an rún.</P>
      <P>Aontaím go mór nach bhfuil aon dealramh leis an moladh, má tá an moladh ann, teilifís Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil ar RTÉ 2, seachas na hargóintí a luadh anseo. Déanaimse amach nach mbíonn clár teilifíse nó clár raidió Gaeilge, nach mbíonn sé lán-Ghaelach ar shlí ó Montrose.  Ní bhíonn ambiance Gaelach ann, go mór mhór nuair is Béarla a bhíonn ar siúl ag lucht léirithe, agus mar sin de.  Mar sin, lasmuigh d'aon argóint eile, tá gá le suíomh don teilifís nua a bheadh tíriúil agus go mbeadh atmasféar ann.  Ní dóigh liom, ach chomh beag, go bhfuil aon todhchaí don saghas dátheangachais macarónach a bhí ar siúl cúpla bliain ó shin ar chlár teilifíse áirithe.  B'fhéidir go raibh an clár féin taitneamhach ach ní raibh aon tábhacht ag baint, dáiríre, leis an saghas sin ruda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aontaím chomh maith gur chóir go mbeadh an tseirbhís nua atá le bheith ann bunaithe sa Ghaeltacht, cé go gcaithfidh mé a rá go gcreidim anois le fada an lá nach bhfuil aon todhchaí ag an Ghaeltacht, nach bhfuil in ann don Ghaeltacht ach bás.  Is oth liom é sin a rá ach, pé rud atá in ann don teanga Gaeilge sa tír seo, is sa taobh sin tíre ar a dtugtar go dímhúinte go dtí seo, an Ghaeltacht.  Mar sin, caithfidh an tseirbhís nua freastal, trí chéile, ar mhuintir na hÉireann.  An rud <Col N="1901" /> is suimiúla, b'fhéidir, a bhí le tabhairt faoi deara ar an gcáipéis sin a d'fhoilsigh an Feachtas Náisiúnta Teilifíse, ná na moltaí go mbeidh comhar agus ceangal idir seirbhís na teilifíse Gaeilge sa Tuaisceart agus an taobh seo tíre.  Tá dóchas go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar bhonn síoch-ánta, cultúrtha idir pobail éagsúla na hÉireann gan aon tagairt don pholaitíocht ná don náisiúnachas.</P>
    <P>D'aontaigh mé go hiomlán leis an Seanadóir Ó Foighil maidir leis an bhfaillí agus an gcur i gcéill atá ar siúl ag an Rialtas i dtaobh chúrsaí Gaeilge go ginearálta. Is í mo thuairimse, gur dhona an lá, an chéad láriamh nár aithin an Taoiseach gur chóir go mbeadh seasamh faoi leith ag an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht sa Rialtas mar phost Rialtais.  Céim síos mhillteanach, i mo thuairimse, ab ea é sin agus tá sé ann fós.</P>
    <P>Sa deireadh thiar thall nílim róchinnte cad é an polasaí atá ag na Progressive Democrats ar an cheist seo agus ar an Ghaeilge trí chéile.  Ní raibh móran fianaise i láthair an deireadh seachtaine seo caite go raibh spéis dá laghad acu sa chultúr dúchais.  Ach sin scéal eile agus míneofar an scéal, is dócha.</P>

      <P>Is trua liom nach bhfuil an blas agam mar atá ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil agus na Seanadóirí eile.  Ach déanfaidh mé iarracht labhairt as Gaeilge ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.  And I am glad to advise Senator Murphy, through the Chair, that this matter did receive detailed consideration and discussion during Minister's Question Time at the party conference in Gaillimh last Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom breith ar an ócáid seo chun polasaí an pháirtí Dhaonlathaigh a athdhearbhú agus béim a chur ar an mbeart tábhachtach gur féidir bealach teilifíse a thógáil chun an teanga a choimeád beo, mar an teanga labhartha i dteaghlaigh Ghaeltachta agus i mórán teaghlach eile ar fud na tíre ina bhfuil tuismitheoirí ag tógáil a gcuid leanaí trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>De réir tuairisce a rinneadh le déanaí, <Col N="1902" /> cuireadh in iúl go bhfuil teaghlaigh a labhraíonn an Ghaeilge ag dul i laghad agus nach bhfuil an tinreamh i réigiúin Ghaeltachta oifigúla róshásúil ach an oiread.  Is í an mhaoin is mó atá againn ná an teanga bheo a thógamar linn síos tríd na blianta. Tá sé de dhualgas ar an nglúin seo gach dá bhfuil ar ár gcumas a dhéanamh chun breis laghdaithe a chosc agus fás a chothú in úsáid na Gaeilge inár saol laethúil.  Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil mórán clár trí Bhéarla ag teacht isteach i ngach teach sa Ghaeltacht agus tá tionchar an-láidir ag na cláir seo ar leanaí.  Nuair nach gcloiseann siad Gaeilge a dtuismitheoirí cuireann sé isteach go mór ar an spéis sa Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Maidir le seirbhís theilifís Ghaeltachta, tá géarghá lena leithéidí thar mar a bhí riamh.  Níor cheart go gcosnódh sé an oiread sin airgid anois os rud é go bhfuil na ceamaraí leictreonacha cuid mhaith níos saoire.  Tá teilifís phobail ag teacht chun cinn in áiteanna éagsúla ar fud an domhain, agus níor cheart go mbeadh an Ghaeltacht thíos leis sa mhéid seo.  Is ábhar áiféala é go bhfiul Seanadóirí áirithe ag iarraidh tairiscintí toghlach a thabhairt isteach ar an ábhar seo le haghaidh cúiseanna polaitiúla.</P>
    <P>Os rud é go bhfuil tábhacht náisiúnta ag baint leis an cheist, bheifeá ag súil go dtógfadh na páirithe go léir an seasamh céanna agus go mbeadh an Seanad aontaithe. Eilíonn an tairiscint seo bunú theilifís na Gaeltachta roimh dheireadh na bliana seo, cé go bhfuil a fhios againn nach bhfuil sé seo indéanta ón taobh teicniúil de.  Chomh maith leis sin, níor soláthraíodh aon airgead sna Meastacháin do 1990.  Éilíonn an tairiscint chomh maith cur i bhfeidhm thuarascáil scrÚdarás na Gaeltachta ar Theilifís na Gaeltachta, cé nach bhfuil an tuarascáil scrúdaithe i gceart fós ag an Roinn Cumarsáide.</P>
    <P>Tá an tairiscint mar atá sé scríofa místuama agus ní féidir leis an bPáirtí Daonlathach tacaíocht a thabhairt di. Beidh muid ag vótáil le haghaidh leasú an Rialtais, atá praiticiúil, fírinneach, mar is í an tslí is fearr chun bunú Theilifís na Gaeltachta a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1903" /> We are in favour in this party of maintaining the Irish language as a living language, an teanga bheo.  We would submit that many of the efforts that have been made over the years to keep the language a living language have neither been helpful nor effective.  Undoubtedly one of the most effective ways of maintaining a language is through the very powerful medium of television.  I think it is a matter of regret that many children whose parents would wish them to be brought up in the Irish language and tradition are so overwhelmingly exposed to the English medium that they have very little choice but to eventually submit to the English language irrespective of the great wish of their parents that they continue to speak Irish as a living language.</P>
    <P>It need not be so expensive to initiate a television service for Gaeltacht areas but we do not regard the motion as is on the Clar as being the way to do it. However, we regard the amendment as a very reasonable one and we support it.  The general argument in favour of a television service for the Gaeltacht areas is one to which we subscribe.  It is such an important matter that there is a great need to proceed with caution.  As I haltingly outlined in my contribution in Irish we do not support the Údarás na Gaeltachta report until such a time as we have had the report and the expert views of the Department of Communications.  We do not support this motion but we are happy to support the amendment put down by Senator Seán Fallon.</P>

Tá sé tábhachtach go raibh páirtí mór san Oireachtas sásta an píosa beag ama do mholtaí mar seo a úsáid chun ceist bhunúsach Theilifís na Gaeltachta a phlé.  Mar atá cloiste, agus ón méid a chuala mé ón Seanadóir Ó Cuív chomh maith ar an monitor agus ón méid a chuala mé ó dhaoine eile, tá meon an <Col N="1904" /> Oireachtais faoi thodhchaí na Gaeilge ag athrú.  Tá éadóchas ag teacht chun cinn. Tá daoine ag rá níos minice anois nach bhfuil aon todhchaí ag na ceantair Ghaeltachta, go gcaithfidh siad titim as a chéile, nach mbeidh aon fhíor Ghaeltacht ann i gceann fiche bliain.  Ní dóigh liom gur rud é seo gur chóir glacadh leis gan ar a laghad labhairt air nó uirthí.</P>
      <P>Is mór an chailliúint agus is mór an cinneadh atá á dhéanamh againn má táimid ag glacadh leis nach bhfuil aon todhchaí ann don Ghaeltacht.  Tá daoine ann a bhfuil i bhfad níos mó eolais acu ar cheisteanna Gaeilge agus cheisteanna Gaeltachta a dúirt liom &mdash; agus gabhaim mo leithscéal leis an Aire Stáit &mdash; nach bhfuil ach dhá fhíor-Ghaeltacht fágtha sa tír, is iad siúd, Conamara agus iarthar Chiarraí.

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Government for providing for a matter on the Adjournment a Minister who is appropriate to the subject being discussed. I hope this continues in the future on matters on the Adjournment and on particular Bills.  I welcome the Minister, whose brief is Finance to come and talk about a matter which is one for the Department of Finance.  I hope the Leader of the House will continue to attract the appropriate Minister to the appropriate matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The reason I have raised this issue is because for a long time we have heard from the Government that it is their intention to create an orderly market in Government stocks and an orderly stock market.  Indeed, at stock exchange dinners and on other occasions one has heard the ritual statement from various Ministers for Finance from all parties, that it is their wish to create an orderly stock market in Ireland.  It is my contention, because of recent activities in the Government stock market in the marketing of gilt edge stocks in Ireland that that aim is not being fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past three months there has been virtually a complete closure of the market in Government stocks here.  I have here an official list, which will be available to anybody who wants to see it, of the prices on the stock exchange on Tuesday, 15 May.  The most striking thing about the <Col N="1906" /> market in gilt edge stocks is that not a single one of 47 different stocks of different redemption dates is on offer to the public.  Every single one on the list is bid which means that the Government broker, and indirectly the Department of Finance and, therefore, the Government, will take in stock from the Government and from the institutions but they will offer absolutely no stock.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Government, if they do not have an absolute obligation to offer stock to the public, are creating a false impression if they boast that we have a viable, workable, vibrant, active Government stock market here because nothing could be further from the truth. One of the unfortunate results of this is that small investors &mdash; and it is the small investors who suffer here &mdash; being unable to buy Government stocks from the Government broker, are advised by their stockbroker, having asked what they should do about it, that the only comparable stocks they can buy with comparable redemption dates and comparable coupons are in the UK.</P>
    <P>I would like for a moment to outline for the Minister a typical example of what a man or woman with, say, £10,000 would do if he was looking to invest in Government stock at the moment.  He would ring up his stockbroker and he would ask him for a particular stock.  For argument's sake, let us say he looked at the 11.5 per cent development 1997-99.  His broker would tell him that that stock was not on offer but it was bid and that he could not get the stock for him.  He would then tell him that he might be able to get it from another broker or he might be able to get it from his own book if he had a seller but at the moment he might have to wait two, three or four weeks.  I spoke to a stockbroker this evening who has had to wait several months in order to invest money for someone in a particular stock. That person has got his money, a small amount, about £12,000, from the redemption of another stock.  Having received a cheque from the Government <Col N="1907" /> and having had money in Government stocks for a very long time he is now unable to reinvest it in a suitable Government stock for himself.  He asks his broker what he should do with his money and he is told, having waited as long as that, the only thing he can do is to go to the UK or to some other comparable stock exchange outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is unfortunate for two reasons. It is unfortunate because he cannot buy Government stocks in small amounts in the country in which he lives.  It is unfortunate as well because the money, as a result, is leaving the country and the Government are not offering him any comparable instruments in which to invest.  The other unfortunate area, one which is causing some concern not only to stockbrokers but to small investors as well, is that there is a general feeling abroad that whereas the small investor is being discriminated against, the larger investor, the institution, is getting a better deal from the Government and from the Department.  There is a feeling among many stockbrokers that if you are big enough and you have several millions to go in you will be looked after.</P>
    <P>I understand that in one recent tranche of Government stock of £30 million the whole lot went straight to large investors. When the tranche was issued the small investor simply was not looked after.  He came looking for some of the stock and he was told that that particular stock had bypassed the market, had gone to the institutions and to other people where it was possibly easier for the Government, administratively, to look after.</P>
    <P>While we look at this it might be a good thing to look at the whole organisation of Government stocks, not just in the present context where the Government are not making stock available, but at a situation when it was different, when the Government were not making it very easy for people to sell stocks, when they in fact were not taking back their own paper except at prohibitive prices. <Col N="1908" /> Whereas now we have a market which is only one-way where you cannot buy in, some years ago I remember very well when foreign investors, especially Germans, were coming here and hoping to put large amounts of money into this country.  When they saw the sort of yield they were getting was far more attractive than they could get in Germany, when they saw that the currency risk was very small because we were in the EMS, they decided to invest in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In order to invest in this country in a substantial way &mdash; for large banks in Germany I am talking about serious amounts of money &mdash; they would ask the Government stockbroker or another stockbroker what was the price of a certain stock offered or bid.  One of the most embarrassing things for a stockbroker was that while he could quote them guide prices which is from the official list on the Stock Exchange, when the stockbroker actually came to deal in the stock those prices did not hold.  It tended to be easier to buy than to sell in substantial amounts of money.  There was no quotation ever given in price and size.  As is normal on many international stock exchanges, you could never say, &ldquo;You can buy a million at that price, a million higher up or a million lower.&rdquo;  You had to go to the Government broker and say &ldquo;I want X amount&rdquo;.  He would than say &ldquo;you can have it at this, this and this&rdquo;, whereas you had told the foreign investor that the price was something else.</P>
    <P>On the bid side that was even more embarrassing because if he had bought stock he would then come to you several months later and say he wanted to sell stock and ask what would he get for it. You would have to explain to him that you did not know but that if he declared his hand and said exactly how much you would get a bid from the Government broker.</P>
    <P>The prices quoted on the official list on the stock exchange are to a large extent irrelevant and the people are dealing in the dark.  They simply do not know the <Col N="1909" /> sale value of their shares until they actually show them to the Government broker.  There were many cases where foreign investors found it very difficult to understand that, having maybe £5 million or £10 million worth of stock, having been quoted a price which was posted on the board in the stock exchange, they were bid three, four or five points down when they offered that stock and they took substantial losses.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give us some indication of how the Government intend to conduct an orderly market in Government stocks on the bid, but critically at the moment on the offered side.  I anticipate him saying that there is a very healthy secondary market in existence in Government stocks at the moment and he is right in that.  The problem is that it is only a matter of matching bargains.  It is only a matter of being able to buy when you can sell and when there is a seller at the other side.  It means that there is no market in Government stocks being made by the Government broker.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider a solution to this problem.  It seems to me that one of the reasons why all these stocks are bid early and why you cannot buy them is that on one level the Minister will say, &ldquo;We do not want to sell Government stocks and borrow money at rates we cannot afford and, therefore, increase the national debt.  At the moment we are in the business of decreasing the national debt.&rdquo;  That is a strong and a good argument. I am not really asking the Minister to consider releasing millions and millions of pounds in all 47 stocks on the Irish Stock Exchange.  That would be unrealistic, although if he was a good market maker he could probably make money out of doing that by issuing it at lower rates of interest than he should.  I am asking the Minister to consider holding his bid prices where they are for large amounts of stock but allowing small amounts of stock every day.  It is very frustrating and unforgiveable for the small investors to see institutions dealing <Col N="1910" /> in large amounts between themselves and yet they come looking for small amounts of stock which had been redeemed out of Government stocks already they cannot do it.  I know that not only the small stockbroker but the small investor feels he is being discriminated against.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider giving the Government broker some discretion every day by saying: `You can let out small amounts of, say, £25,000, £10,000 per time, in order to look after the small investor if you take stock in&rdquo; At the moment a very bad taste is left in the mouth of the Irish investor when a very small amount of stock would actually solve that problem.  I have received complaints from stockbrokers across the board and from investors about the present situation where they simply cannot get hold of stock and a real market is not actually being enacted by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for his constructive contribution on this rather complex issue.  First, I must dispute the implication in the motion by the Senator that there is not a proper and orderly market in Irish Government stocks.  The market has grown substantially over the past ten years.  There has been more than a five-fold increase and this is very impressive by any standards. A number of important structural features characterise the market and I would like to outline these: the primary market is supplied with bonds by the authorities to meet the funding requirements of the Exchequer, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank; a strong secondary market has developed, in which 80 per cent of total turnover in bonds is transacted; due to its relatively small size the market is still concentrated but the large uptake of bonds by non-residents is gradually lessening this concentration; brokers acting as agents, play an important role in matching orders across the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1911" /> I mentioned the large uptake of bonds by non-residents.  More than a quarter of the total of outstanding bonds is now in the hands of non-residents and is surely a demonstration that our market is well run and is, by general standards, an attractive market.</P>
    <P>The market in Government stock exists primarily as a means of funding the Exchequer's borrowing requirement. Decisions on overall strategy for the market, therefore, rest with the Minister for Finance.  The Central Bank manages the market in stocks with up to five years to maturity of which there are 22.  The Department of Finance are responsible for the issue of all stocks and they manage those stocks with more than five years to maturity of which there are 26 at present.</P>
    <P>The Department and the Central Bank act as official market makers on the primary market.  This market is the channel along which stocks pass between the authorities and investors.  The operations of the authorities on the primary market essentially involve the issue of new stocks and tranches of existing stocks and the redemption of maturing stocks.  The authorities complement the secondary market, where gilts are traded between investors, by being ready to sell to the market at officially determined prices and occasionally to buy back small amounts of stocks also at officially determined prices.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross' concern appears to relate in particular to the small investor. In the normal course of events the small investor has equal access but there have been occasions, notably in relation to the issue of variable rate stock, where a minimum notice period and a minimum contribution have been essential.  While the authorities are most anxious to accommodate the small investor, their first concern must be to fund the Exchequer as efficiently as possible and this, in turn, imposes the obligation to run an efficient market.</P>
    <P>From time to time, it may happen that <Col N="1912" /> due to strategic considerations, few or even no stocks may be available for sale to the public.  The authorities must have the right to pursue this course of action as part of the management of the national debt; for instance, where they have no immediate need to raise new money or where they consider that the cost of borrowing via Government stocks is too high.  In these circumstances, it would be inconsistent and unjustifiable to offer stocks for sale to one segment of the investing community &mdash; I refer to the smaller investor &mdash; and not to everybody, including the institutional and bigger investor.  If the terms of borrowing are considered too high by the authorities, it would not be logical to make an exception for some investors by making stock available on expensive terms from the viewpoint of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Where new stock is made available for sale to investors nevertheless, as I have already said, it is sometimes necessary to attach a minimum subscription amount to the terms of issue.  This is especially the case with the variable rate stocks. They are subscribed for, not through the Government broker as with virtually all fixed-rate stocks, but directly to the Central Bank.  To control the application flow, there must be a minimum subscription. In any event, they tend to attract only the big investor.  Experience of issues of these stocks in the past has shown that only a handful of smaller investors showed any interest in such stocks.  Recently, because of the huge institutional demand for a variable rate stocks issue, the authorities had to cease selling the stock immediately on completion of the application process.  While this precluded purchases by small investors in the primary market, it was unavoidable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The particular difficulty of the small investor was addressed by the Department of Finance in the context of a general review of the bond market undertaken in 1989.  Following on this, the buy back provisions for small <Col N="1913" /> amounts of stock were made more flexible. It would be totally unrealistic, however, to accept some of the proposals put forward on behalf of the small investor such as the introduction of special stocks.  There have been a few complaints from the stockbroking world that the small investor was not getting fair treatment on all occasions.  I should point out, however, that none of these complaints came from small investors who felt that they had been treated unfairly.</P>
    <P>I turn to the allegation in the Senator's motion that we do not conduct a proper and orderly market.  I have outlined the manner in which the market is conducted, with a particular focus on the primary market, which is the first concern of the authorities.  It is appropriate that I should also make reference to the secondary market which constitutes the greater part of the bond market activity.</P>
    <P>The secondary market is the market in bonds between stock holders.  In this market brokers match buyers and sellers with most transactions involving one broker and two investors.  These transactions, which are known as put-throughs, pass through the stock exchange on their way to the Stock Registration Section in the Central Bank for the process of registration of change of ownership.  The authorities main role in relation to the secondary market is to provide a suitable range of stocks and occasionally to support the market by repurchasing small amounts of stock.</P>
    <P>The timing and pricing at which the authorities carry out these transactions have important implications for the depth, liquidity and operation of this market.  Secondary market turnover in 1978 accounted for a mere 10 per cent of total bond turnover.  Over 80 per cent of total turnover in the bond market now takes place in the secondary market.  For this reason, this is the market in which prices are in the main determined. Because of its importance, the authorities are most anxious to see it develop and to grow in depth and liquidity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> The gilts settlement office, which commenced operation just over a year ago, provides a secure and efficient system for gilt settlement and a basis for developing a technologically advanced system later. Other recent developments have been the holding of a stock tender and the inauguration of a further market which incorporates a gilt future.  I mention these developments to illustrate how the local market is growing in size and sophistication in recent years.  While it is a domestic market, it is becoming more and more influenced by outside forces. The Irish bond market does not operate in isolation and, as we well know, prices here are determined to a considerable extent by prices on the large bond markets. Prices also reflect the relative performance of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The authorities monitor the progress of the bond market carefully.  While it is the primary source of funding for the Exchequer, it also plays a central role in Irish financial markets.  We set great importance on the development of these markets, Ireland's reputation as a centre for financial services is growing and we are well aware of the significance of an attractive and efficient bond market.  I can assure the Senator once again that this is a priority and I reject firmly his implication that we do not have a proper and orderly market.</P>
    <P>There are one or two things the Senator mentioned.  There is no evidence, from our information, of substantial purchases of UK stocks by small investors.  There is no great evidence to support that.  There are the few individual cases but, by and large, they are the exception rather than the rule.  Furthermore, of course, the fact that there is such interest in the Irish market by foreign investors indicates the soundness and the efficiency of our market here.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised a further point about the stock situation and the market. If he checks today's list he will see that the 9 per cent capital stock 1996 is open. <Col N="1915" /> The Senator, from his professional experience in this area, would know it would not make great sense to be opening several stocks at the same time.  I am satisfied we have a proper and orderly market and I reject the implication in the motion.  We can benefit enormously and substantially from a sound market here and this is what we have at present.</P>

      <P>He would not expect me to find it totally satisfactory.  It is nice to see Senator Honan here for an Adjournment debate.  I would like to thank the Minister for answering some of the specific points I raised, which is a great improvement. The Government cannot claim credit for the secondary market because they do not have any place in the secondary <Col N="1916" /> market; that is done without the intervention of the Government put-throughs. It is not something for which they can claim credit.  In view of what the Minister said, that the secondary market is working so well and the fact that all those deals on the secondary market are extremely large deals, would be consider giving discretion to the Government broker so that every day small amounts up to a certain limit which would have a negligible effect, probably no effect whatsoever because they could be linked to the amount he takes in, could be let out specifically to small investors?  I am talking about perhaps £100,000 a day in each stock or even less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that on the basis of a cross-conversation here.  I will certainly ask my officials who are advising me to take this up and see whether there is any merit or any justification for undertaking that course of action or what the implications would be. I will communicate with the Senator.</P>
