      <P>I have notice from Senator David Norris that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health in the light of the recent resignation of the Chairman of the Health Research Board, due to unexpected arbitrary budgetary constraints imposed in the Estimates to look urgently at the possibility of providing future and adequate funding so that this important body can carry out its work in the national interest.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give a specific date as to when contractors will be appointed for the building of an extension to Lisnagry National School, Richill, County Limerick, when work will commence and an approximate date for completion of same.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Pat Upton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The lack of adequate facilities for the assessment of teenage girls with conduct disorders who have been before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase funding to enable Dublin Corporation to continue its programme of upgrading its housing stock.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The unacceptable delay in the processing of investigations by the Garda Complaints Board and the need for the Minister to allocate additional staff immediately thereto.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Norris, Jackman, Upton, Costello and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Norris and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Jackman, Upton, Costello and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take the all-party motion on South Africa, and the Bulding Control Bill in the afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to make two points. First, in the other House some time ago the Government Whip provided all Members with a copy of the programme of legislation which it is intended to take in the other House during this session. We, on this side of the House, have consistently asked to be provided in written form with a similar programme of legislation for the session.  We have asked and asked.  We got some mumbled recitations from the Leader of the House.  We have got nothing on paper.  May I once more ask, even at this late stage, that we be given in documentary form, a programme of legislation for this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question raised by Senator Norris about the European Court motion, which he has raised consistently, he has given the Government sufficient time <Col N="95" /> to come back with an answer.  While we will not be pressing it today, next week we will be asking for a definite answer on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I ask the Acting Leader of the House if he would be prepared to make time available for the Minister for Education to make a statement to us on the situation in relation to facilities for teenage girls with behavioural disorders.  This is a pressing and immediate problem.  The district justice has spoken in stark terms of avoiding a tragedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, Second Stage of the Building Control Bill is being taken this afternoon. I would like to ask the acting Leader to confirm the plans for the continuation of that debate this afternoon.  Does he intend concluding Second Stage?  Does he intend adjourning Second Stage?  When does he intend coming back to it?  It is very important legislation and people should know precisely what he intends doing with the Bill this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Acting Leader of the House to consider making time available, either today or certainly at a very early opportunity, to allow the Minister for Defence to come here to update the House in relation to the <Col N="96" /> present serious situation in Lebanon where several Irish officers were injured yesterday.  I am sure we all send our good wishes to the officers for a speedy recovery.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí den Cheannaire arís inniu an bhfuil aon dul chun cinn déanta maidir le córas aistriúcháin.  Bhí cruinniú aréir ag an gComhchoiste don Ghaeilge agus tugadh le fios go bhfuil seomra á chur ar fáil. Rud maith é seo ach ba mhaith liom dá dtabharfadh an Ceannaire dáta don Teach ar a mbeidh an córas seo insealbhaithe sa Teach sa chaoi is go mbeidh sé ar mo chumas mo chuid ghnóthaí a dhéanamh ar an dóigh ar chóir iad a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Senator Upton in relation to the matter he raised about the girl who is before the court in Dún Laoghaire and who is coming before the court for the eighth time today.  I am looking for clarification.  Yesterday the Acting Leader of the House, Senator McGowan, stated that in his opinion the matter was <i>sub judice</i>.  Today, the Cathaoirleach has stated he is going to allow the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will wait to see if the Acting Leader of the House makes a response later on.  Secondly, I raised a question yesterday in relation to the Derelict Sites Bill.  I would like, again, to seek clarification from the Acting Leader of the House as to when this Bill will come before us.  As I said before, it is a matter that has been on the top of the agenda before but it has now gone way down the agenda.  It would seem there is some deliberate intention not to deal with this particular matter.  It is just impossible to understand why a matter so important in relation to the law, which is at present inadequate, has not been dealt with with the expedition we would expect.  That is where it was on the Order of Business.  As we know this city is full of cowboys&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Acting Leader of the House to clarify when this Bill will come before the House.  Finally, in relation to the sad matter that occurred in Lebanon yesterday, where the Irish soldiers were wounded and two militiamen were killed, we would like to extend our sympathy to the families of those concerned, and to point out once again the need for a foreign affairs committee in this House so that we could deal with all of those very serious matters that are in the world news at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Acting Leader of the House if he would indicate to us when the promised debate on Northern Ireland is likely to take place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom taobhú leis an Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil maidir le soláthar an chóras aistriúcháin i Seanad Éireann.  It is important that the questions he asked this morning regarding the setting of a date, a time and a place and space to be made available, should continue to be urged because of the Constitutional prominence given to the first national language.  I welcome his persistence in this matter.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that the leader of the Fine Gael group, Senator Manning, has agreed to support me in the request to have Item No. 30 taken.  This will be repeated next week.  For that reason I will not today be moving an alteration to the Order of Business, I do not want to become tedious.  It is a serious matter and I urge the Acting Leader of the House to take it on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also would like to urge that the Derelict Sites Bill be treated as a matter of urgency.  Unless it is amended in this House, it is not going to do the slightest thing to improve the situation, because it is a defective Bill.  Regarding the debate on Nelson Mandela, will there be an agreement with regard to the time?  A considerable number of people wish to get in on this debate and it is important <Col N="100" /> that we know where we are on this matter, technically.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to ask if there could be agreement on an all party basis that there could be some time made available for statements with regard to Item No. 65.  I am not really been tendentious here.  It is a very important matter.  It is a question of the return of the aboriginal head to its rightful place in Australia. This was a matter of considerable controversy recently during the Nelson Mandela episode.  I am coming under pressure from constituents in Australia.  It could be a matter of international embarrassment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few heads here which we could send over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few constituents in Australia and they are very interested in this matter.  It could become a matter of embarrassment between the Irish and Australian Governments.  It is a sensitive issue and it is important that we address it, particularly since we are so concerned about the issues of black people in South Africa.  We should be sensitive to this issue as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Acting Leader of the House what specific plans he has &mdash; and I am sure he must have specific plans in the light of the gravity of the situation &mdash; for a comprehensive debate on the health services. Given that Dáil Éireann has addressed this question, it would be an absolute absurdity if it is not addressed by the Upper House immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slightly threatened by Senator Norris's tying up with Australian constituents.  Maybe I should say something on the aboriginal head, but I am not going to.  I want to repeat a question which I asked last week and to which I did not get a satisfactory answer.  I would like an assurance from the Acting Leader of the House on this.  Ministers who come in here should, first, be the relevant Minister for the Bill in question.  We in the <Col N="101" /> Seanad, should not have to accept a Minister or a junior Minister who is not appropriate to the Bill in question coming to the House.</P>
      <P>Secondly, because of what happened yesterday, Ministers before they come here should be fully briefed on what is happening here.  I was not in the House yesterday when this happened, but apparently a Minister came here who did not even know what Stage of the Bill we were dealing with.  He did not even know which Bill was involved.  That is contempt of this House.  I ask the Acting Leader of the House to ensure that the Minister knows what Bill is before the House, what it is about and that we get the right Minister.  It is not too much to ask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Order of Business and the would-be-attempt by Senator Norris to raise the issue of the return of the aboriginal head, is it appropriate for a Senator to raise a matter in which he clearly has little knowledge of the actual circumstances concerned?  I am sure that when an official request comes from the Australian Government to this Government and to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland it will be dealt with in a very appropriate and correct manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Manning's request that we should get a written programme of legislation, this is something that we can discuss at the Whips' meeting.  Every Thursday, so far, in this session we have had a Whips' meeting and because I was speaking in the House I had to adjourn the Whips' meeting last Thursday.  I came in for some criticism because that happened.  That is unfair and I am not going to comment, but I can assure Senator Manning and all other Members in this House that our intention is to be helpful, co-operative and to submit in advance as far as it is practical our knowledge of pending legislation.  The Seanad sat two days every week in this session.  There has been no lack of co-operation and I have had not one complaint from any of the Members attending the Whips' meeting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Jackman asked would there be time available.  We only can suggest 15 minutes each on the motion on South Africa.  That is to give everybody a fair chance.  It is an all party motion and I believe 15 minutes is the usual time.  Senators Upton and Joe Costello raised the question of the Derelict Sites Bill.  Senator Costello complained and suggested there might be some background reason.  There is no background reason.  In fact, if it is agreed at the Whips' meeting, it will be the first item next week.  I have a rough agenda for the meeting and that is the first item on it.  There is no reluctance whatsoever to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Senator Liam Cosgrave mentioned the question of the tragedies in Lebanon.  We all join with him in his sentiments but I think it is not appropriate to comment any further on that matter.  We will take the Derelict Sites Bill again.  Senator Daniel Neville raised the question of the debate that will take place on Northern Ireland.  Again, there is no difficulty that I know of in having a debate on Northern Ireland.  I am prepared to discuss this at the Whips' meeting and if there is general agreement, we can bring this forward.  It had been our intention to have a debate on Northern Ireland before Christmas.  If there is a general wish for it among all the Members and all the different party representatives, then we can have a debate on Northern Ireland if it is considered that such a debate would make a useful contribution to the situation.  From my practical experience, the people in the North of Ireland are tired listening to debates among people who are far removed from the problems on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Joe O'Reilly requested a debate on the health services.  We have had quite a lot of debate on the health <Col N="103" /> services and I do not know what further debate we could have on them.  I suggest he uses his party motion in Private Members' time to bring that matter forward.</P>
    <P>Senator Shane Ross complained that we do not have the right Minister here very often.  The procedure of the House has not changed dramatically.  I have been here and have sat on the Opposition benches for years.  Any working arrangements must have the full co-operation of all of the parties in the House.  If we have a subject on the agenda for discussion and the Minister concerned is called away on some other duty &mdash; even with the best intentions and the best made plans &mdash; he has to ask a Minister or a Minister of State to stand in for him.  That has been the procedure during the years.  There is nothing new in it.  Any Whip or any Government party leader tries his best to have the appropriate Minister but the Minister in the appropriate Department is not always available.  Certainly I could not stand accused of not trying very hard to contribute to this House and to have the appropriate Minister in.  It is my intention to continue to offer the utmost co-operation to all the parties in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, perhaps I have some sympathy with the Acting Leader of the House on this, but there are a number of items raised to which he did not address himself, including the point raised by Senator Ó Foighil and the request made by Senator Cosgrave. These were at least two points to which he did not address himself.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the recent developments in South Africa and the release of Nelson Mandela.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I would make is that there is universal joy at the release of Nelson Mandela and this universal joy, this delight at the release of Mandela, is nowhere more heartfelt than in Dublin, the city of which Mandela is a Freeman.  His imprisonment could not have gone on indefinitely, nor could the totally repressive apartheid system, a system that has ostracised the black people of South Africa constitutionally, legally, socially and economically.  There are four glaring examples, four glaring manifestations of the apartheid system still in place in South Africa.</P>
      <P>The first is the voting system, where the Africans still have no vote in parliamentary elections.  The second glaring manifestation of apartheid in South Africa at the moment is the Population Registration Act, which divides the population into four categories &mdash; the Whites, the Coloureds, the Asians and the Africans &mdash; and that is the hierarchical order of the society as well.  The third glaring manifestation of apartheid in South Africa at the moment is the Land Tenure Act, where 87 per cent of the land is designated for the Whites and, coupled with this, the Group Areas Act, where black people are confined to specific areas within white areas &mdash; for example, black workers in Johannesburg commute to Soweto in the evenings.  The fourth manifestation of apartheid at the moment must be the state of emergency and the general body of repressive and arbitrary laws that exist there.  Obviously, this is an horrific society, an unpalatable and unacceptable society, a society that is alien to every value we hold dear in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that should be said as we get to the specifics of the situation now and in the future is that it is worth pointing out in the Upper House of our Parliament that President De Klerk has emerged as a significant figure among his <Col N="107" /> people, that he has emerged as something of a visionary there.  It can be argued, and is argued, that he is being pushed by international pressure, by factions, etc, and obviously there is a large element of truth in that and we are delighted with that aspect of it.  But he did have the courage &mdash; and it has been recognised by Mandela himself &mdash; to make a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the equation Nelson Mandela is becoming the unquestioned leader of his people, and is emerging as the unquestioned leader of the black people of South Africa.  Nelson Mandela has behind him one of the great forces in society, he has people power behind him.  Recently, we saw the achievements of people power.  People power undid many of the régimes in Eastern Europe.  The impact of people power, manipulated and led by Mahatma Gandhi, was extremely significant, so at the moment Mandela has a tremendous weapon in his hands.</P>
    <P>I think the challenge that has to be issued to Mr. De Klerk at the moment and the challenge that our Parliament, our Government, our society must issue to Mr. De Klerk is to go on leading his people towards a non-racial society.  We must exhort him to so do, we must encourage him to so do.  I would be less than honest if I did not say to this House that I see a certain merit in the opinion which says that we must look at the moment at ways of indicating to the white body politic in South Africa, to the white people in South Africa as led by Mr. De Klerk, that we acknowledge what they have done in releasing Mandela and in legalising the ANC.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the fact that the four essential elements of apartheid remain, that South African society remains horrific.  I am totally aware of that but, having said that, I would not go so far as the British position, that we in an arbitrary way lift sanctions.  However, I think the time has come when our Government and European countries must look to methods of at least indicating to Mr. De Klerk that we appreciate <Col N="108" /> what he is doing.  When we look at the position on his right wing, with the conservatives, with the neo-fascists, with the very large public rallies among the whites, he does need some indication of support and approval and he has to be seen to some degree to have brought home the bacon to his people.  But that consideration must never be unbalanced; it must be balanced by maintaining the stick approach and by maintaining an effective method of sanctions.  All I am saying is that we would need to send him some signals.</P>
    <P>I believe that Nelson Mandela has an immense challenge facing him at the moment as well.  The challenge facing Mr. Mandela and the challenge that we should be presenting to Mr. Mandela on behalf of our Parliament, on behalf of our Government, on behalf of our people and within a European context, is that his responsibility, just as it is Mr. De Klerk's responsibility, is to go on moving towards a non-racial society.  It also is Mr. Mandela's responsibility to so do, but it is specifically Mr. Mandela's responsibility to lead the ANC away from violence.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the ANC and the anti-apartheid movement argue that the violence aspect must be brought to the negotiating table and must be a plank on the negotiating table but, at the same time, it is imperative that international pressure should be suggesting to the ANC and to Mr. Mandela that they renounce violence and renounce the violent method as quickly as possible.  Never let us forget that the Russian Revolution, which was bred on violence and was a violent revolution, has essentially undone itself and is in a state of disruption 70 years on.  Never let us forget that the countries that were conceived in violence, conceived in civil strife and conceived at the barrel of a gun have had very dubious histories afterwards.  It is my contention that the great challenge facing Mr. Mandela and the black leadership at the moment is to give up the gun and to rely on the tremendous force that is behind the ANC and Mr. Mandela. The tremendous force that is behind <Col N="109" /> Nelson Mandela in South Africa is the 35 millions blacks who are backing him morally, politically and in every other way.  With that people power I believe that Mr. Mandela can achieve change without the use of the gun.  I believe it is right that our Parliament should be first and foremost in the free world in calling for the renunciation of violence in South Africa at the earliest possible date.  Just as we have a responsibility to go on calling on Mr. De Klerk, just as we have a responsibility to say to Mr. De Klerk and the white ruling bodies in South Africa: it is your moral political international responsibility to give up the radical society and to concede free elections, to concede democracy, to undo apartheid; it it also the responsibility of the black leadership in South Africa to give up the violent methods and to go for true democracy.  We have glaring examples on the African Continent of situations where power was received through the barrel of a gun.  I would be very concerned that we keep the right kind of pressure on to ensure that true democracy is achieved in South Africa and that, in fact, the result is a truly democratic society, a truly free society, a truly egalitarian society.</P>
    <P>That puts us in a position where we must be very even-handed in our approach.  It would not be right that we go over the top in our support of violent methods or of the ANC while they hold a violent position and while they still support the use of violence.  I do not believe it would be right if we went over the top in that direction.  It would not be right if we were to applaud the most minuscule development from Mr. De Klerk.  What I am saying to the House &mdash; and I passionately believe this &mdash; is that we must have an even-handed balanced approach, that we must today unanimously and with great enthusiasm and with great vigour welcome the release of Mr. Mandela &mdash; and that we do with great pride in Dublin where he is a Freeman, and we look forward to his visit to this city.  But, as we do that today, we also must unequivocally say to Mr. De Klerk that we welcome this development and we <Col N="110" /> must look for methods of recognising what he has done.  We must also clearly say to Mr. Mandela and to the black people, we believe in non-violence, we believe in the achievement of freedom in a non-violent method through people power.  On that basis I rest the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the release of Nelson Mandela. As a Dublin man and Irishman, but also as a member of Dublin City Council, I was very happy that Nelson Mandela was freed as we had made him a Freeman of Dublin city.  I am happy to say that the Lord Mayor has issued an invitation to him to visit Dublin whenever he can.  I also welcome the end of the banning of the ANC.  I believe that Mr. De Klerk deserves our congratulations for making these decisions and it would be foolish of us not to see the political problems he and his party will now face both from extreme right wing groups and also from the ANC themselves, who will be a very active and vocal political party within South Africa.</P>
      <P>There has been a very heated debate going on over the last week regarding the stand which the European Community should take in response to these measures.  I am happy that the majority of our partners have agreed to keep the economic sanctions against South Africa and I am disappointed that Great Britain and Portugal have decided to take an opposing view.  The reasons that sanctions were made in the first place were not to release Nelson Mandela or to lift a ban on the ANC.  The reasons that sanctions were there was because of apartheid.  This is the bottom line and one we cannot let other people forget, both in South Africa and in the rest of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly, I welcome the gestures from Mr. De Klerk, but I have to ask the starting point from which he came.  We have in South Africa a system of apartheid known nowhere else in the world.  I do not have to go into the details of white only neighbourhoods and the other methods used to divide the community there.  The Government are using banning and banishment orders to restrict <Col N="111" /> and silence opponents without having to justify their actions before the courts. Banned people may not communicate with one another in any way, be quoted in public or private, attend any political or social gathering that is a meeting of more than two people from outside the area in which they are restricted, enter any educational institution or factory without special permission.  Tens of thousands of people have been arrested and detained without trial over the years. Many have been tortured and many have died in custody.  These atrocities and many more are carried out almost exclusively against the black population. Apartheid reaches into every corner of South African society.  We have discrimination against the black population in education, jobs, housing in every walk of life.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons I believe that the English and Portuguese have missed the whole point of the sanctions, as the kernel of the problem is apartheid.  I am glad that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, will be visiting South Africa on behalf of the Community on a fact-finding mission.  I believe that we should wait until he returns from that to make a decision on what our reaction will be to the De Klerk measures.  When he is there I hope he will communicate to the Government and people of South Africa that the vast majority of people in Europe are impressed by Mr. De Klerk's actions and will try and encourage Mr. De Klerk to go even further.  I hope that he will emphasise to the South Africans that it is apartheid which is the kernel of the problem and when that is lifted South Africa will be welcomed back into the international community.</P>
    <P>I would like to believe that this will happen; and perhaps with the changes in Eastern Europe happening so fast, it will. In case it does not happen, I would like the Minister to take up certain cases of people who are in jail for political reasons and those who have been tried and convicted on the notorious basis of common purpose.  If I could take the case of the Uppington Fourteen.  On Friday, 26 May 1989, 14 South Africans were sentenced <Col N="112" /> to hang at the end of a trial which lasted three years, one of the largest groups of people sentenced to death at any one time.  I am happy now that the South African Government have stopped hanging people, but at the same time they are still imprisoned.  On the day after that there were taken to Pretoria Central Prison and they are there on death row. They joined over 60 other political activists already under sentence of death.</P>
    <P>Since the nationwide state of emergency was declared in 1986 the apartheid régime has executed 23 political activists for their illegal involvement in offences relating to opposition to apartheid.  The 14 sentenced to hang represent a strong section of the community of a township in Uppington, reportedly the most deprived African township in South Africa.  It is situated in the remote north-west of the country.  Among the 14 is a domestic servant in her late fifties, Evelena Debrun, mother of ten children, the youngest of whom is 12 years.  Evelena is illiterate and, according to her lawyer, she is busy dying on death row.  She has lost several stone and cannot take exercise because she is crippled with arthritis. Because of this her lawyer applied for bail pending the appeal court hearing this year in an attempt to get her out of jail and save her life.  The judge refused on the basis that she may flee the country. This despite her cripping arthritis, her illiteracy, her age and the fact that she has ten children.  Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister to take her case up.</P>
    <P>The other members of the Uppington Fourteen include a boxer, a schoolteacher, a male nurse working in a Namibian hospital, a labourer and a former treasurer of the town council convicted of killing a policeman on the notorious basis of common purpose.  The fourteen from the north-western town of Uppington were among a total of 26 who stood trial.  Of the 26, 25 were found guilty of murder, with the 26th being found guilty of attempted murder.  Those not receiving the death penalty were given sentences ranging from six to eight years imprisonment on community service orders.  The trial arose from the death of <Col N="113" /> a policeman in 1985 at the height of the political unrest that swept South Africa. The events occurred at the Uppington township of Pavello after security forces had broken up a meeting with tear gas. The mass meeting had been held to discuss community grievances including rent increases.  Tear gas had never been fired in Pavello before.  The meeting panicked and scattered, believing that live ammunition was being fired.  Part of the crowd then gathered outside the home of a black municipal policeman.  Only days before a pregnant woman had been shot by a municipal policeman in the township. The policeman fired on the crowd, severely wounding a child.  He then ran from the house with his gun.  Enraged, the crowd then killed him.</P>
    <P>Almost all of those sentenced to death were convicted on the basis of common purpose.  The judge deemed that by throwing stones at the house of a municipal policeman and chanting outside his house they would be considered to share in the common purpose with those directly responsible for the death.  This legal ruling was applied to the trial of the Sharpeville Six and other subsequent cases.  It has been discredited by the international league of communities as one of the many abuses of the legal system operating in South Africa, a system where the courts are used as part of the machinery for imposing apartheid rule.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of July 1989 application for leave to appeal for the 26 against a conviction and by the 14 against their death sentence was turned down by the trial court judge.  The trial was then petitioned on the chief justice for leave to appeal.  On 8 September 1989 the chief justice granted leave to appeal against conviction for 23 of the 25 trial-less and for all to appeal against sentencing. Although granted leave to appeal, the 14 remain on death row in Pretoria Central Prison.  Although the South African Government have put a stop to the death sentence, I believe that the trials of Evelena Debrun and the other people involved in this case deserve to be brought up by the Minister with the South African authorities.  I hope that all those <Col N="114" /> who have been convicted under common purpose will be released.</P>
    <P>I bring these cases up to highlight the whole situation of people who are imprisoned in South Africa.  I am happy with our stand on sanctions and I believe it is an honourable one.  I ask the Minister to emphasise to the South African authorities these cases.  When he is there I hope he will show to the South African authorities and the South African people that it is only when we get rid of apartheid that we can really bring them back into the international community.</P>
    <P>I believe there are great problems politically for Mr. De Klerk and for everybody, I hope that he will urge Mr. Mandela to drop his support for violence. I was very disappointed that he recently accepted that there were acceptable targets in South Africa.  I believe the Minister has a very difficult job on his hands, I hope he will be able to bring about a peaceful solution to the problems of South Africa.  It is a great country, it is enormously rich, I believe blacks and whites can live there peacefully and well together over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing my time with Senator Brendan Ryan, with the agreement of the House.  I share the unanimity, which is obviously present in this House today, at the welcome given to the release of Nelson Mandela.  Indeed, I note that many Members of this House, including me, signed the welcome to Nelson Mandela which was advertised in all the national newspapers following his release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the points of view which have been expressed by Senator Eoin Ryan and Senator O'Reilly.  It is probably wrong that we should at this stage of the proceedings be harping too much on the past.  We should be worried about what we can do in this country with our foreign policy to dismantle apartheid in the future.  We all know about the horrors and evils of apartheid as it exists at the moment and as it has been practised in the past.  I would just like to concentrate in the second half of my very short speech <Col N="115" /> on what the future is in the foreign affairs policy of Ireland <i>vis-á-vis</i> South Africa.</P>
    <P>I find it disingenuous and hypocritical for members of the Government party in this country and others to continually condemn some of the infringements of human rights in South Africa when we are guilty of infringements of human rights on our own door step.  Hanging has for a long time been practised as an evil part of the régime in South Africa, and this Government have been noticeably reluctant to remove hanging from the Statute Book here.  It has taken the Coalition with the Progressive Democrats to make them abolish hanging.  I have been trying to get hanging off the Statute Book for seven or eight years.  It has made me fairly sick to see the refusals of the Government to take it off the Statute Book while at the same time anytime anybody is hanged in South Africa Ministers and members of the Government are happy to stand up here and condemn it as a horrific violation of human rights. We cannot have it both ways and we should not have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I stand second to none in condemnation of apartheid, but I wonder have this Government and the last Government found apartheid too easy a whipping boy, too easy a target, because apartheid stands condemned as the most iniquitous system that exists in the international world.  There is a consensus about apartheid which is almost impossible to rival anywhere in the world.  A lot of that is to do with the tremendous work which was done by the anti-apartheid movement.  I accuse the Government of taking such a moral, high-minded attitude to apartheid not because they have any ideological or deep-rooted objections to it, but because they see an international consensus, they find that particular condemnation convenient and comfortable and they know it is safe.  I would find it more consistent if the high moral attitude which the Irish Government have adopted towards sanctions in the last few days were taken towards other countries who are perpetrating régimes which certainly rival the South <Col N="116" /> African régime and indeed are worse in what they do.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister read the report of Amnesty International on what is happening in Iraq?  If he has, why are we still trading with Iraq?  Amnesty International very recently condemned out of hand the régime in Iraq not only because of its persecution and its genocide of its own people but also it produced instances as horrific as those produced by Senator Eoin Ryan just now about minors being condemned to death and about torture. Yet in this country we are happy to continue trading with Iraq without a word being said.</P>
    <P>I cannot remember &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; any protest being issued by the Government to the régime in Iraq about their internal policies.  It seems to me totally inconsistent that we can on the one hand rightfully condemn South Africa, but on the other we pick and choose the other régimes in the world whom we condemn.  The reason Iran and Iraq, who run much worse régimes than South Africa, are not condemned so wholeheartedly, why the Irish Government are not leading a charge in the European Community to condemn them or to introduce sanctions against them is because we trade heavily with Iraq and Iran.  While we protest the appalling evils of apartheid, and so appalling are they that we introduce sanctions against them, we are silent on other régimes.  Our silence is in direct proportion to the amount of trade we do with those régimes.  It seems to me the answer, unfortunately, is quite simply money.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows if they are honest, that when we talk about sanctions against South Africa, it is pretty well meaningless in terms of this country.  While we led the European Community in the last six months introducing sanctions against South Africa &mdash; and the Minister for Foreign Affairs said this week they will continue because the régime is evil &mdash; we are not leading the European Community in initiative condemning other régimes which are worse.  While what we are doing may be right and while we must push, should push and will push, towards <Col N="117" /> an end to apartheid, with that single objective in mind, we are being totally dishonest if we do this from the comfort and security of knowing it will cost us nothing, and from the safety of being one of 11 in the international community.  We should clean our own back yard first and then our condemnations would be more convincing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, this is a moment for rejoicing.  It is also a moment that deserves some reflection on the past and a fairly hard headed look towards the future.  It needs to be said, first, that at least in Africa racism seems to be a particularly white phenomenon.  One of the extraordinary things about Africa is the extraordinary non-racism and non-vindictiveness of many of those who have taken power in the various countries that have been liberated in the last 25 years, the extraordinary non-vindictiveness of those who are now free to speak for the first time in almost 30 years on South Africa, their willingness to make it clear that they support a non-racial society and their willingness indeed, to come into conflict with other black organisations in South Africa to insist on the fact that they must have a non-racial South Africa.</P>
      <P>Many of those who have led the struggle against apartheid in South Africa are models to most white people about what it means to be non-racist in your language, your values and in your struggle for liberation.  There are the occasional sights of brave white people and they welcome the unambiguous welcome they receive from those among the black community who are struggling for liberation. The white community &mdash; all of us &mdash; have inherited a history of the extraordinary ambivalence of western European &ldquo;civilisation&rdquo; towards people whose skin colours happen to be different from our own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of talking about Africa we need to be very clear, to use clear unambiguous language which does not contain even a hint of racism.  That is why I and a number of my constituents were disturbed by the reported remarks of Senator Martin Cullen in this House last week.  I <Col N="118" /> want to read what he said onto the record and invite Senator Cullen to make it clear that the ambivalence and ambiguity is not as serious as many people suggested to me.  Last week on 14 February at column 1947 of the Official Report, Senator Cullen said:</P>
    <P>I got to know the Africans as they are in reality as opposed to our impressions of them in the hallowed halls of Parliament.  Indeed, there can be a great difference between impressions and reality.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullen owes it to Africa and to us to clarify that statement.  It is the sort of language that is often used by people to signal certain views.  I do not believe Senator Cullen meant what many people interpreted.  He owes the House a clear and unambiguous explanation.</P>
    <P>While it is now extremely fashionable to oppose apartheid, many of us &mdash; I would have been a minor participant &mdash; will remember the period 20 years ago when every meeting of the anti-apartheid movement would have at least two Special Branch men outside the door because it was seen as being dangerously subversive and dangerously threatening to our national interests.  We had a perpetual presence of those who were supposed to protect the security of the State. They have not yet got over that phenomenon because last Sunday in Cork, when I had the privilege to address a small gathering of 100 people to celebrate Nelson Mandela's release, at 3.30 p.m. when other people could find better things to do, there were two of them sitting in their car observing the celebration. May I ask the Minister to ensure that the resources of the State are better used than keeping two policemen occupied watching a celebration of the release of Nelson Mandela.  They were not protecting us; they were there to make a particular view known.  I will say no more; I was going to say too much.</P>
    <P>On the issue of sanctions it needs to be said that there is very little to exceed the crass hypocrisy of western powers and, to a certain extent, ourselves, on this issue of sanctions.  Let us remember, for <Col N="119" /> instance, that we slapped sanctions on Poland on the occasion of the suppression of Solidarity, a position I agreed with. Nobody whinged or muttered then about the suffering of the vast majority of the citizens of Poland.  We took off those sanctions, reluctantly and slowly.  Long after Lech Walesa first asked the western powers to end the sanctions against Poland, they continued them.  When the people who were leading the struggle for freedom in Poland asked for the release of sanctions the western powers declined to respond.  Why?  Because our political interests sustained it.  Let us remember that there are massive bans still on the sale of all sorts of high technology to the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>There are so many other things.  There is the extraordinary ambivalence about violence which gives lectures to a man who has spent 27 years in prison because he does not come out and say &ldquo;I renounce violence&rdquo; and does not say a word to the biggest power in the world which has consistently unleashed terrorism against the free democratic state of Nicaragua over the past eight years.  What extraordinary hypocrisy.  A lot of western hypocrisy is summed up in our attitudes to South Africa, and a lot of it is bluff. Our bluff is being called with the blossoming of freedom in Eastern Europe and in southern Africa.</P>
    <P>What should we do for the future of South Africa?  I have a very simple view on this.  We should listen to those who have suffered.  We should listen to those who have carried on the struggle with damn little support from most of the western world until it became extremely fashionable, until western public opinion dragged its governments kicking and struggling into opposition to South Africa.  It is easy to forget what was said and done.  Up to 20 years ago most of the western powers were happily arming those forces who have repressed the vast majority of South Africans.  It was western public opinion which forced governments to change from the position, to say the least of it, of ambiguity and ambivalence. It was western public opinion <Col N="120" /> which forced them to tighten up further, and it is western public opinion that will sustain the pressure.  As far as I am concerned, I am very proud to say that I take my lead from the African National Congress.  I will support opposition by this country, which is the position of those who have struggled and suffered the brunt of the repression of apartheid and free protest.  Those people have asked us for certain things and we should not give them lectures.  We should simply do what they ask.  We should listen to them, respect them and carry out their wishes.</P>
    <P>If we want to do something, not only should we sustain sanctions but we could ban the import of South African coal.  It is disgraceful to suggest that when half the world could supply us with coal, when a recently liberated Poland could desperately do with the trade, we buy coal from South Africa.  This is a specific demand of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement.  I invite the Minister to tell us that he personally will encourage Irish people at consumer level to ask their coal suppliers not to supply them with South African coal.  That is what the African National Congress have asked us to do &mdash; not just to retain the sanctions but to increase them.</P>
    <P>We should not be grateful to a minority who have finally recognised that they cannot hang on to power.  We should be grateful to a majority who are prepared to be generous, magnanimous and non-racist in their plans for the future of South Africa.  That majority is represented by the African National Congress.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan is reading something into my colleague Senator Cullen's words.  I read this statement in full this morning and it would appear to me quite unambiguous.  He has lived in Africa and knows at first hand the difficulties encountered by the people on that continent.  I do not think we can read any more or less into this aspect of his statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, too, would like to welcome the release of Nelson Mandela.  It is a great tribute to this House that we would allow such a generous amount of time and that <Col N="121" /> the Minister would allow such a generous amount of time to speak on the subject of his release and of the developments in South Africa.  I would like to join with the other comments and statements praising the courage of Nelson Mandela in withstanding the incarceration of the past 27 years.  He has shown how a person of great depth of character can survive such an ordeal.  I was struck on his release by his dignity and modesty.  There was no triumphalism about him.  Moreover, he showed little of the signs of stress or trauma that one would expect from one who spent such a long period in jail.  That to a great extent, explains why he has been such a source of inspiration to South Africans, both black and white, and to all who despise the apartheid system.</P>
    <P>Prior to, and on his release, he showed dignity and graciousness in his dealings with President De Klerk.  We have heard they share a mutual trust.  It appears that he is a natural leader.  He is the right man in the right place at the right time.  The calming influence he has exerted on a potentially explosive situation is a tribute to his undoubted charisma.  All of this he needs, because so much rests on his shoulders.  To a great extent he has been the focus, and the cry to free Nelson Mandela was synonymous with breaking down the entire system of apartheid and all its consequent and attendant evils.  We should remember that Nelson Mandela has said that no individual leader can take on the enormous task of creating unity and remaking South Africa on his own and, indeed, that any decisions will be made by the ANC leadership.  This wisdom is a measure of the man.</P>
    <P>We must also praise the courage of President De Klerk in releasing Nelson Mandela.  He must be shown generosity, praise and encouragement.  The ANC have said they will send a delegation to meet with him to discuss any issues of structuring the start of negotiations and try to negotiate a suspension of hostilities. We must at this juncture remove any lingering support that one might have towards any campaign of violence in South Africa.  We must encourage them to proceed in that direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> Our generosity of support should not include the diminution of sanctions.  I very much support the stand of the EC Foreign Ministers, apart from two, and, in particular, our Government on this whole issue.  The release of Nelson Mandela has not changed anything yet, it is merely a symbol.  The state of emergency still exists, as does detention without trial and censorship.  The homelands policy and various restrictive Acts are still in being and there are many more political prisoners still held.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the Taoiseach's remarks on the unilateral stance taken by the UK Government.  It is not new for the UK Government to take a dissenting view.  That decision was taken even before the latest meeting of the EC Foreign Ministers.  It would be wrong to credit Mrs. Thatcher with a spirit of generosity towards the régime in South Africa.  It was not a generous gesture to show solidarity with Nelson Mandela or to encourage the white South Africans to support the undoubted courage of President Klerk.  It is a case of economic greed.  Unfortunatley it is once again the British Government showing interest rather than principle.  Britain is the principal exporter to South Africa.  That country is Britain's twelfth largest customer in export terms and there are many thousands of jobs &mdash; around 70,000 &mdash; directly linked with trade with South Africa in the UK.  We should consider reduction of sanctions only on the dismantling of the apartheid system in South Africa.  I can only conclude by saying that if Mrs. Thatcher showed the same generosity towards the Irish situation as she is now showing towards the Boers of South Africa, perhaps we would be in a better situation in this island of ours today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I too, want to express my pleasure at the release of Nelson Mandela. It is a momentous event and it is a milestone in the struggle against apartheid. After 27 years, as the longest serving political prisoner in the world, Nelson Mandela is free.  He is a courageous man, a principled man, but it is not so much for the release of the man as a person that we are celebrating here today and debating this motion on South Africa.  It is for what he stood, that he was a symbol of his people, of resistance against the apartheid state in South Africa.  It is in that context that we can now see South Africa entering into the second phase. Now that the man has got this freedom, we have the second phase, namely, the freedom of a people for whom he was the symbol.</P>
      <P>At this time, when we are celebrating his release, we must remember what has contributed so largely to his release.  It is, of course, primarily the tremendous struggle that has gone on in South Africa by the black oppressed people there, for their rights as human beings to equality with their white colleagues but, secondly, the very strong line of support has been the international community.  The international community, first, in the form of the United Nations which advocated sanctions against South Africa, then, specifically the EC, which collectively decided to impose sanctions on South Africa.  Ireland played a specific role in this area and ordinary men and women also played a part, with the result that white South Africa was regarded as a leper among the world community of nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to mention, particularly, the enormous impact and role of the Anti-Apartheid Movement through thick and thin, over many long years.  As Senator Ryan mentioned, in the early days it was not a popular activity or a popular cause to be engaged in, with <Col N="125" /> plenty of attention from the Special Branch in relation to meetings, and so on.  I would like to mention also the role that was played by courageous, young trade unionists, the Dunne's Stores strikers, who took to heart the message that was passed at their trade union conference &mdash; the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union.  They stood up for the principles and the terms of that resolution.  They spent 18 months on the picket line in 1985 and 1986.  They were on the picket line standing in solidarity with the black people of South Africa.</P>
    <P>At this time we must recognise that enormous contribution from a number of very young people who took that principled cause to heart.  We must also remember &mdash; again in the context of the Dunne's Stores strikers because it arose directly out of that &mdash; that the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, decided to extend sanctions to the importation of fruit from South Africa. That was a milestone in the Irish Government taking a stand, and being seen to take a stand, against the apartheid system in South Africa.  I would like also to record the role of the trade union movement in general which has, over decades, consistently opposed the apartheid system in South Africa.  Finally, the Churches have unanimously taken a stand against that unjust and unfair system.  All of those have collectively contributed to the situation we have at present where we are entering on a new dawn of freedom in South Africa.</P>
    <P>In that context we must be very careful that the momentum is not lost.  That, to my mind, is the crux of the situation. What has happened is a ray and a beacon of freedom, but what has yet to happen is the freedom of the people.  It is absolutely essential that sanctions be tied up totally with dismantling apartheid.  Sanctions remain and should remain until that iniquitous system of apartheid is dismantled.</P>
    <P>Nelson Mandela is a Freeman of this city.  It has been an indication of the level of public opinion that we should have been the first capital city in the world to <Col N="126" /> make him a Freeman and indeed, the only one &mdash; and that the Lord Mayor of this city has invited him to come and address us and to receive the Freeman scroll of the city and to sign the book in the Mansion House.  We also, in this House, should invite Nelson Mandela to come and address us here.  The same should take place in the second House of the Oireachtas.  That would be a fine way of honouring the stature and authority of a man who has done and suffered so much for his people.  When Nelson Mandela is here &mdash; and I have every belief that he will be here certainly before this year is out &mdash; we should also point out to him that there are Irish prisoners languishing in prisons across the water and that they, too, are innocent people who are in prison for their beliefs.  We should invite him to cross the water to England and visit the Birmingham Six in jail.  That would be a very appropriate thing to ask of him.  It would be appropriate for him to use his influence to ensure that innocent Irishmen who have served 16 years in prison should be released as there is a total consensus of opinion that they are innocent men.  I have already written to Nelson Mandela in Soweto asking him on the occasion when he visits this country that he would do that.  I asked that he would visit Britain, visit the men in prison and raise his voice on their behalf for their release.</P>
    <P>In South Africa there are a number of issues immediately facing the ANC and Nelson Mandela, who is a joint leader.  I would consider the first matter to be one of internal unity within the black community. While Nelson Mandela and the ANC have achieved tremendous stature in South Africa as leaders of the black community, there are other aspects and other areas where there is a degree of dissention.  This has been particularly true because it has been brought about by the South African policy of creating homelands for certain sections of the black population.  A certain degree of strife has been occurring.  We have seen violence in the townships &mdash; certain internal violence, black against black.  Indeed, the level of deaths and maimings that <Col N="127" /> have taken place has been quite considerable. There is need for internal unity of all sections of the black community to be established before negotiations take place, as I am sure they will with President De Klerk.  In that I would like to mention particularly Chief Buthelezi who is one of the major figures, the leader of Inkatha and the Pan-African Congress. It is in those particular areas of leadership that the ANC should immediately seek reconciliation so that the black movement would be a united one in the final negotiations for freedom.</P>
    <P>In relation to sanctions these are the critical matters.  I would like to applaud the position that has been taken by the Irish Government, particularly in its role as President of the EC and, indeed, by the other States in the EC, with the exception of Britain, in relation to this matter.  What is essential is that the dismantling of apartheid should be tied to sanctions.  When progress is made in that area, that is when we will, or should, consider the relaxation of sanctions, and on no other condition.  We must remember that at present the black people have a number of pieces of legislation specifically directed to discriminate against them.  The Land Act restricts their ownership of land to 15 per cent of the area.  The Group Area Act likewise ensures that black people are confined to specific areas and that white people have the best housing, the majority of the land and quality housing.  The population Registration Act registers the population into separate categories based specifically on racial lines &mdash; white, coloured, Asians and Africans.  We have seen &mdash; and we see in our newspapers today &mdash; a move towards relaxation of the Separate Amenities Act, which provided for segregation on the grounds of colour in public places such as swimming pools and hospitals.  We saw a very welcome photograph in today's <i>Irish Times</i> of a black man and a white man in a public place playing a game of chess.  It is important that until such unfair legislation is removed sanctions be maintained.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that we should, as <Col N="128" /> Senator Ryan referred to, think of strengthening the sanctions in one or two specific areas.  I would refer specifically to the area of coal, where we have coal imports of the order of £45 million coming into this country annually from South Africa.  Two weeks ago in this House the Labour Party, in Private Members' time, debated a proposal for the closure of the Arigna collieries before any geological survey had been done to find out what the resources were.  It is an absolute scandal to think of closing down a coal mine in Ireland and at the same time continuing with the importation of coal from abroad.  We should be thinking less and less of using coal as a fuel.  It would be very much in our interests to discontinue the importation of bituminous coal from South Africa.</P>
    <P>I have one final point and that is in relation to the present relaxation of sanctions by the British Government.  I abhor the decision by the British Government to step out of line with the collective decision of the European Community on this matter and to lift the ban on investment in South Africa.  I have no doubt that that is directly related to their own material interests in terms of trade, the degree to which they trade and the extent of their trade with South Africa.  Secondly, I believe it is directly related to the fact that a considerable number of South African white people have British passports.  Approximately 1.5 million people there have British passports.  We saw what happened in relation to Hong Kong, and the problem that existed there when the Hong Kong people wished to get visas.  The British Government would be concerned about a deluge of South African citizens coming into Britain. Both the trading interest of Britain and its lack of concern for those who have British citizenship should not be allowed stand against the collective agreement of the EC countries to retain sanctions. Sanctions should be retained in all their fullness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual motion we have in front of us is: &ldquo;That Seanad <Col N="129" /> Éireann welcomes the recent developments in South Africa and the release of Nelson Mandela.&rdquo;  This is an all-party motion.</P>
      <P>It is particularly appropriate at the moment that the Irish Government's Foreign Minister will be leading a delegation to South Africa, a delegation of the EC. It is particularly important that we should happen to hold such a position in the European Community at this moment. This country has never &mdash; for many years as far as I know &mdash; had diplomatic relations with South Africa.  We took the decision many years ago that this country, which does not have a colonial past, as have all the other European Community nations, and which has experienced in its own island the effects of discrimination of one group against another, should not have diplomatic relations with South Africa.  It is appropriate that we should be going on a fact-finding mission and leading that fact-finding European Community mission to South Africa as well as playing a role in bringing about what Pope John on his visit here described as peace with justice. That is what we want to see in South Africa.</P>
      <P>I do not think we need to make any apologies in this House about our views on apartheid.  We have condemned it, and rightly condemned it, for the vicious, abominable system it is &mdash; that someone should be discriminated against on any grounds, whether these grounds be race, religion, colour or belief.  Speakers from either side have rightly condemned it. We must go a bit further than just simply condemning apartheid.  We must do more than just simply welcoming the release of this very heroic man, Nelson Mandela, or rambling on about sanctions.  I obviously agree with the Government's policy on this, but sanctions are very much a means to an end and the end is not just simply the abolition of apartheid in itself.  That should really be a beginning.  It is an abomination which should not exist.  The sooner it is got rid of the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the day we should be thinking of all the people in South Africa. We should be taking a very responsible <Col N="130" /> attitude towards blacks in South Africa, who are indeed by far the major group. But we should not forget the other groups.  If there is to be peace, prosperity and justice for all races, including not least the blacks who have been so appallingly discriminated against, it is necessary that we think of the views and have consideration, however difficult it may be, for the attitudes, prejudices and feelings of the other groups in South Africa.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland should take and are taking the lead now in trying to bring about a peaceful solution to a very dreadful situation.  We want a peaceful solution there.  We do not want it to end up in some form of bloodbath.  We do not want it to end up in economic chaos in South Africa.  We do not want it to end up in discrimination against some other group. We saw the terrible treatment of the Indian community in East Africa.  I would not like to see that happening to the two million Indian community in South Africa.  I hope it will not.  In someone of the stature of Nelson Mandela we have hope that one is going to see a peaceful development in South Africa.  I can only echo Mr. Mandela's words about President De Klerk when he referred to President De Klerk as a man of principle with whom he felt he could do business.</P>
    <P>Apartheid, we should also remember, is a peculiarly Anglo-Saxon and colonial attitude.  It is not just simply colonial at all.  You did not get apartheid in the French colonies.  You did not get apartheid in the Spanish colonies.  It is something peculiarly British, German and Dutch.  Let us, when we are condemning it, make sure that we do not in this country at any time show discrimination towards those who may happen to be of a different colour or view.  We are anxious to see democracy in South Africa.  We really do mean democracy.  It would be a sad situation if the failure of democracy which has occurred in so much of Africa were to be repeated in South Africa.  We want to see a solution out there in which there will be genuine democracy and genuine development for all the people in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello has rightly referred to <Col N="131" /> Chief Buthelezi and made the point that there are other groups in South Africa, other very major groups.  Chief Buthelezi and his group comprise more people than the entire white group.  Let us not oversimplify here.  Mr. Mandela himself must not oversimplify.  Let us not forget either that there are other groups in South Africa.  One group has not been mentioned, as far as I know, at all this morning, and that is the bushmen, who were the actual original inhabitants going back thousands of years in South Africa.  The blacks, the whites and the Indians are relatively recent to South Africa, strange though it may seem.  The bushmen have had a particularly appalling time.  Up until 1931 there was still a bounty on the head of a bushman or woman or child. If you shot one you got a bounty as if they were foxes, wild animals or pests. Let us remember that there are many groups in South Africa.  We, as Irish people would like to see discrimination against none of them.</P>
    <P>The white community are divided into Afrikaaners and the English speaking community.  The English speaking community are now making a great show of liberalism.  It is a little difficult to take that, considering that apartheid began under the English system.  Many of today's would-be liberals, including some leaders of that great party in the past, owe their inheritance to such ventures as the slave trade, and so on.  I found it very difficult to have too much sympathy for the present liberalism of communities there.  Nonetheless, they are a community. They have now, at long last, embraced some degree of liberalism.  I have great sympathy for the Afrikaaners. Their behaviour over recent years has been appalling and brutal.  It has been inexcusable, but they have been discriminated against pretty severely too. We now, perhaps, forget that the word &ldquo;concentration camp&rdquo; originated in South Africa.  It was the Afrikaaner women and children who were herded into these concentration camps in the time of parents or grandparents &mdash; it is <Col N="132" /> that close &mdash; of the present African population in South Africa.  There they died, not in tens, not in hundreds, not in thousands but in tens of thousands.  Let us not forget that they have this in their background and in their psyche. However unforgiveable their behaviour may be today, let us realise that there is a background to it.  They have had their struggles.  They have had their cruelties inflicted upon them, too.</P>
    <P>I agree that sanctions should be maintained. Our Government have taken the right attitude.  Let us not over-emphasise it, though.  I do not think the sanctions in themselves have been a crucial feature.  I certainly do not think so-called armed struggle in South Africa has been the crucial feature.  What is happening out there is the brutal force of economics, driving white South Africans, and white industry out there, led particularly by the Anglo-American corporation which is the largest corporation in South Africa, into a realisation that for the development of their industry &mdash; and it is already a rich country and potentially could be even richer &mdash; something had to be done about the discrimination against Africans. That may be a very poor reason for change but economic reasons and economic factors have extraordinarily powerful effects as, indeed, we have seen in Eastern Europe &mdash; and people power has been referred to here &mdash; the people took it into their own hands to toss out the appalling systems which existed there, and particularly the ancient régime of the Soviet Union.  They were not above interfering in Africa also.  Senator Ryan has referred much to the West, and quite rightly so.  They were not on their own there.</P>
    <P>South Africa at the moment is a rich state.  Appalling though the treatment of black Africans is, in actual fact, the <i>per capita</i> income of black Africans in South Africa is far higher than that of any other part of Africa.  Their education, discriminated against though it is and appalling though it is in relation to what is available to the whites, is still of a much higher standard than that available to blacks anywhere else in Africa.  Let us <Col N="133" /> endeavour to ensure, as Mr. Mandela will be endeavouring to do, that that is maintained and developed.  It would be very sad if, pursuing our liberal consciences, we were in some sense to allow the very people whom we are trying to help to finish up in a worse situation than existed beforehand.</P>
    <P>We, in this country, have a particular responsibility.  We are in a very good position to do something to bring about a democratic, peaceful South Africa and a prosperous South Africa where the Africans will get equal treatment, humane treatment, the opportunity to develop and the opportunity to rule their own country, which they deserve.  At the same time there should not be a situation in which the previously dominant community will either leave or a community, such as the Indian community, will be discriminated against.  South Africa is extraordinarily lucky to have someone of the stature of Nelson Mandela who was able to go through 27 years in prison, the first 18 months of it in appalling conditions and still come out and show the sort of tolerant, wise and civilised attitude which gives great hope for the future of South Africa.  Let us in this country, in so far as we can play some slight role, give whatever help we can to Mr. Mandela and to Mr. De Klerk.  We must understand from our experience in this country the terrible problems and difficulties of trying to bring together separate communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity of speaking on this motion.  The developments in recent times have marked very distinctly and very clearly a dramatic change in the minds of all reasonable people throughout the world. They bring to an end the situation where the black majority were, for so many years, severely and positively downtrodden in South Africa.  It was mentioned here earlier this morning that Nelson Mandela is a Freeman of Dublin city.  That, in fact, is perhaps a further reason why we should have an interest in this matter.  The events that took place in recent times promise an encouraging and <Col N="134" /> enlightening start.  We have the commencement of a new era, replacing the era that has concluded.  It came about through persistent campaigning under imprisoned conditions by Nelson Mandela over the past 27 years.  There are about 300 other members of the African National Congress, known briefly as ANC, still in prison.  There is no question of any meaningful discussions taking place while a number of barriers, such as the retention of these persons in prison, remains.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to reflect that in June 1964 Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment.  To all intents and purposes, the people of South Africa felt that that was the end of that chapter as the doors closed behind him entering prison for life.  It was the Government's positive intention to lock Nelson Mandela away and to crush positively his liberation movement in the years that followed.  But, fortunately, Nelson Mandela, being the man he was, fighting under very handicapped conditions as a prisoner but with a very loyal and tightlyknit support group outside, continued his fight over all those years.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay a tribute to the very useful work that the media performed in keeping this campaign alive and running through times in which perhaps it might otherwise have faded out.  The media played no small part in ensuring that the case of South Africa as enunciated by Mandela, from outside prison in the first instance and from within it subsequently, came to a successful conclusion.  In addition, I believe that the trades unions throughout the world have made their very valuable contribution in the whole area of sanctions and related matters. Countries that imposed sanctions have also contributed to this whole very worthwhile movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While other leaders emerged when Mandela was in prison &mdash; many of them are now in exile and perhaps some of them have passed on &mdash; there is no doubt that Mandela remained the supreme and absolute leader of the black movement in South Africa.  It is a great tribute to the character of Mandela, and a great <Col N="135" /> tribute also to the many persons outside who did not take advantage of his absence from the scene and perhaps cash in on the position.</P>
    <P>It is rather significant to know that the father of President De Klerk &mdash; I would like to commend the President in this House this morning for the initiative he has taken this far &mdash; played a very key role in bringing the National Party to power in 1948 and it was this party that did, in fact, introduce and put into being the whole concept of apartheid.  Mr. De Klerk himself had a very fast rise to power but in his earlier years in politics he remained very much in compliance with the party system with regard to apartheid and so on.  He was elected a Cabinet Minister in 1977, he was appointed leader in Transvaal in 1982, he was Minister for Home Affairs and National Education in 1984 and then we know that, on the resignation of President Botha following his getting a stroke, Mr. De Klerk became head of the party and President of the country.</P>
    <P>At all times since his election he tried very vigorously to bring about change. Prior to that, as I mentioned, he was an advocate of apartheid and role in with these policies with great devotion and dedication.  So, I think his conversion, as it were, is all the greater seeing that that was the sort of background from which he came.  He has gone very easy on the apartheid issue since becoming President last year.  He agreed very much and talked a lot about compromise negotiations and so on, which is what this whole matter is now about.  It was obvious that the major sanctions imposed by countries throughout the world had brought about a serious problem for South Africa and that the economy was not in a good position.</P>
    <P>The release of Mandela was, as we all know, announced on 2 February.  There was then a feeling that perhaps he might not be released; but, fortunately, on 9 June Mr. De Klerk put into effect his announcement of 2 February.  Mr. Mandela is now a man of 71 years of age, a much lighter man than he was when he <Col N="136" /> was imprisoned in 1964.  He was then a man who weighed over 200 lbs.  He is now a slight man, aged, hopefully with a good many years of active politics to give to South Africa to help to resolve the many problems there.  He is on record as saying that he spent many long and lonely wasted years in prison during his time there over the last 72 years.</P>
    <P>The legislation of the ANC, in conjunction with the release of Mr. Mandela, represents a step forward.  Perhaps these two factors more than anything else highlight what has happened in recent times in South Africa.  There are other objectives and other issues to be talked about, but these are matters of achievement.  Mr. Mandella has presented himself as a sort of mediator or, as he was described on the media, a facilitator between the black majority and the white minority in negotiations which could indeed be very long and varied.  But, provided progress is being made, I am quite satisfied that violence can be avoided in South Africa.  I believe&mdash;and Mr. De Klerk has gleaned this from his many discussions with Mr. Mandela&mdash;that violence must not play any part whatsoever in the negotiations and in the talks that will go on in the time ahead.</P>
    <P>The position in South Africa, which was the last bastion of white supremacy, was rather ridiculous.  We had five million white persons ruling approximately 35 million blacks, almost the entire population of that country.  That was a situation that could not continue and is, hopefully, nearing an end.  There are, as I say, a number of things to be got out of the way.  We have to have the release of all the political prisoners.  We must have the removal of this three and a half year old state of emergency.  These things must happen before meaningful discussions can take place.</P>
    <P>The real role of Nelson Mandela is very hard to perceive.  Perhaps his most valuable contribution will be to act as a liaison person between the blacks and the whites, or there may be a situation where he may hold an official position in a Government in South Africa.  We must not forget that the white people are not going to take too easily to a change in the <Col N="137" /> situation where they have enjoyed total control of the running of affairs and owning 87 per cent of the land of the country for so many years.  For that reason the matter has to be handled very delicately.  It will take outside forces in a supportive fashion, in a broad sense and not on one side or another, to bring about a meaningful and correct solution.</P>
    <P>It is good to know that with very few exceptions, the United Kingdom being one, the various countries are totally behind meaningful negotiations and are prepared to apply sanctions unless there is a realistic outcome to this very worthwhile initial development.  When Nelson Mandela was released from prison he refused, we understand, protection and felt he was quite safe among the people of Africa.  He has negotiated for a long time.  He is a man of great experience and I believe he will be the centrepiece of any negotiations taking place in the future.</P>
    <P>Britain has at present an investment of £10 billion in South Africa and a trading position each way of £3 billion per year. This is unique.  It is not the same as the American sanctions and the sanctions of many other countries.  The American sanctions have cost South Africa many millions of pounds each year.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the peaceful approach and attitude of Nelson Mandela. That has been stated by President De Klerk after his discussions with him &mdash;that he was satisfied Mr. Mandela was adopting a peaceful approach.  It is important that he get that vital message through to his people.  Pretoria worried from the day Nelson Mandela went into prison that he should ever come out again.  There was serious and major concern in Pretoria and among all the whites in South Africa when he was released.</P>
    <P>The whites have indicated that they are prepared to be siphoned off to an area in the country and to live separately from the blacks; but that is not the answer. The country must be governed as a single country with its millions of people.  The imbalance is there, but accommodation must and will be found.  I am very pleased with the release of Nelson Mandela and <Col N="138" /> I should like to compliment President De Klerk on the stance he took.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this motion rather vague.  It says &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann welcomes the recent developments in South Africa and the release of Nelson Mandela.&rdquo; Some of the recent developments in South Africa I would not welcome.  On television we have seen pictures of neo-Nazi parties, people waving swastikas and that kind of thing.  Anything that contributes to the breakdown of apartheid, which is one of the greatest crimes ever was perpetrated upon a people, will be welcomed.  I also welcome the release from prison of this great revolutionary leader.  However, I find that motion vague in another way in that it does not specifically mention the fact that neither the ANC nor Mr. Mandela have renounced the use of violence as a way of achieving political ends.  That is disconcerting. We have had in this House time and time again debates about other parts of the world, and our own country, where the use of violence to achieve political ends has been condemned.  This is the right thing to do, because we can see from looking at various developments in Eastern Europe and in other parts of the world that there are peaceful means to achieve political ends and that violence is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless I can receive some assurance from the movers of this motion that they in no way condone the use of violence by Mr. Mandela, the ANC or anybody else to achieve political ends, then I would have to abstain from voting on this motion.  The problem here is that there is a certain hypocrisy.  We have seen Governments, statesmen, Church leaders, community leaders welcoming the release of Nelson Mandela &mdash; and I, too, welcome his release &mdash; but in the same breath they do not ever condemn the fact that he has not renounced the use of violence.  I would condemn this and I would ask the movers of the motion to make it clear that we do not condone it. I do not want it to be interpreted that I do not welcome the release of this man, because 27 years in prison is enough for <Col N="139" /> anybody.  He is moving towards peaceful means and that has to be welcomed.  If anybody can calm the situation down, this man can do it.  He is a man of tremendous personality, intellect and tremendous resolve.  I hope he will encourage his party and his people to seek to achieve equality in all aspects of life by peaceful rather than violent means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree with Senator Lydon when he said that the motion is vague.  However, generally I think its meaning is clear and it is agreed by all parties.  When Senator Lydon was talking about violence he may not have been treating like with like.  If I recall what Nelson Mandela said on his release when he was questioned about the armed struggle, he stated that what was happening was that the State had been in an armed struggle against the people, and still is, and that he was resisting that.  If you consider also the discipline of the ANC, which they have shown since Mr. Mandela's release, you will get quite a different picture.  It is not the same as the North of Ireland, where you are afraid that they are going to blow the head off somebody every five minutes.  That is the context in which I took it and I think that is the way he meant it.  The violence of the State is still there.</P>
      <P>I have had a long term interest in apartheid. I remember putting a picket on the Iveagh Grounds in 1960 as a result of a sporting event which was going on there. In 1961 I wrote a poem which was published in the Bulletin of the Workers' Union of Ireland and was later used by the anti-apartheid movement.  I have an interest in this.  It has been well documented so I will not go over it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiative taken by Mr. De Klerk.  It was a courageous step and I wish him well in his efforts.  I would never want to support the struggle against apartheid if I thought it would turn around the other way and that the whites would become victims of the system.  I want to see a true democracy with full rights and full equality for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must welcome the stand taken by <Col N="140" /> the European Ministers, particularly our Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Taoiseach.  They have handled this very well indeed.  The sanctions must stay, because to take the pressure off at this time before coming to the negotiating table proper would be a big mistake.  In the final analysis the real thing that brought the people in power in South Africa to their senses was the effects of the worldwide sanctions and also the fact that South Africans were not welcome anywhere.  I have met many white South Africans.  I have never been to South Africa but I was a prisoner of war with some white South Africans.  I found them to be decent and generous &mdash; there was good and bad among them.  The system of apartheid had not taken hold at that time, so I could not say any more on that.  Virtually every section of the white community in South Africa were deeply infected with this colour prejudice throughout the century and not just from 1948 onwards.  We must recognise the human cost of the apartheid philosophy. People were uprooted from their homes. It was a very drastic step for any nation to take.  The theory of apartheid was produced after a succession of white Governments had failed to live with the influx of Africans into the towns, so they decided that sterner methods would have to be introduced.  The blacks were confined to the lands allocated to them and this was done also in order to prevent the whites from indulging in sexual relations with the blacks and to exclude the blacks from the skilled labout force.  Dr. Malan's party did that.  They promised the whites they would deal with the threat of homogenity and make sure that white domination would survive throughout their lifetime.  Its main philosophy was that different races live happily when they are separated.  We now know exactly what that means.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the pro-Government Bureau for the Study of Race Relations declared that acceptance of Africans as permanent residents outside the homelands would in the long term make the survival of the white state impossible.  He believed it was there to stay and that no <Col N="141" /> way would anybody get outside it.  They went on to say that the Bantu would always be there in order to engage in the white's economy, that they worked for them.  They were also of the view that the blacks had no right to live permanently in the towns and they would have no permanent contact with anybody who lived in the towns.  They believed they could receive the same rights in their Bantu homelands as the white labourers in their homeland.  I ask you.  When one considers that all the resources had dried up in the Bantu homelands certainly there was no way those people were going to have any meaningful role in their own workplaces, etc.</P>
    <P>The system brought about the massive derangement of African families.  They did not realise at that time that the future implications would be so sinister.  But the apartheid policies made sure that they were sinister and that there was not going to be such a thing as permanent urban residence for blacks.  As far as they were concerned, it did not matter whether it disrupted families or not.  Twenty million Africans were certainly not going to be given any claim to civil rights etc. and there was no way they could build any genuine state from the land they got. They got about 14 per cent of the total land area.  They could not exist on this, so they were forced to work abroad.  They had neither influence nor protection and they were separated from their families. All this has been well documented.  But it should be put on the record again in the sense that we are talking about people who were pauperised and isolated.  We are speaking now about Nelson Mandela, who tried to come to their rescue.  When we read the history we can see exactly what Mandela stood for, what he was opposed to and what his objectives now are; and we must wish him well in that. At the time they thought that an exclusive white state was something that would last forever and they had strategies to beat anything that might come about to upset that.</P>
    <P>They misrepresented the situation from time to time.  For example, in 1951 Dr. Verwoerd introduced the legislation <Col N="142" /> and followed it up in 1959 with the promotion of the Bantu self-government Act which actually removed all the rights of the South Africans.  One would have thought it would have improved their rights but he was removing what little rights remained to them, particularly where the Bantu might be given representation on the South African Parliament. The Vorster Government, in the declaration of what they called constitutional changes, made sure that the Bantu was treated as an area apart and as a possession of the South African Government.  They made sure that in those constitutional movements there was certainly no role for the Africans in the development of the white economy. Certainly it ensured that the political rights, which they should have had, to another 80 per cent of the country were not given.  There was a grand design and they were made to stick.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that Nelson Mandela, out of frustration, went the road he took before he was imprisoned? It was sad to see it.  The whole background of what happened in South Africa is well documented and I do not want to labour the point too much here.  I just want to put on record that there was a good reason for Nelson Mandela's activity.  It was great to see that after all those years the man was able to walk out of prison.  I hope he will be a great influence.  I believe he is playing it right.  He cannot opt out.  He has to deal with the ANC which is difficult, with all the divisions and so on that have grown up.  I do not mind admitting that I shed a tear when I saw him walking out of prison.  I hope everything will go right for him.</P>
    <P>I would like to say thanks to the Dunnes Stores strikers who highlighted the situation in greater depth here in Ireland and also to the many trade unions, councils etc, who through the years have been working very closely with the Anti-Apartheid Movement in all the many rallies they held.  I would like to congratulate Nelson Mandela and, as Senator Joe Costello says, when he goes to Birmingham maybe he will go to see <Col N="143" /> the Birmingham Six and see what he can do there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted at the release of Nelson Mandela.  We are lucky to live in such eventful times where there are two world leaders coming to the fore in the 1980s and 1990s.  We have Mr. Gorbachev and Nelson Mandela; one from what will no longer, I feel, be referred to as the Second World, and perhaps we are looking towards the dismantling of the Third World with support from ourselves through the EC and the United Nations.</P>
      <P>We awaited with curiosity the emergence of Nelson Mandela.  He is a curious blend of simplicity and stateliness, a natural leader who has very quickly adjusted to his new environment.  I wondered if it were possible for anybody to live up to the extraordinary image that had evolved of him over three decades of imprisonment and even many years before then.  What did we find?  We found a dignified face, peaceful attitude, no rancour, no bitterness.  That is the first important lesson for us.</P>
      <P>We must realise that international pressure, and particularly the application of sanctions, had begun to have results with Pretoria recognising that it could not effectively maintain apartheid in the face of massive opposition from both inside and outside.  Changes announced by President De Klerk will, we hope, lead in the long term to a democratic nonracial South Africa.  We welcome the news that groups that had been campaigning for an end to apartheid will no longer be banned under the new proposals announced by the South African President and that groups working for years for change are to be legalised, particularly church groups and trade unions and once again they will be in a position to continue their efforts towards achieving a peaceful solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a brief reference to the Dunnes Stores workers' action at a time when it was not popular to be seen to oppose importation of fruit and vegetables from South Africa.  Their position in the workforce was certainly <Col N="144" /> not enhanced by the stance they took.  I even noticed in a newspaper report the other day that they are still finding it hard to find employment.  There appears to be a sort of stigma on them for their efforts during those years, which was very hard, towards the dismantling of apartheid.  I applaud the stance of those young workers.  They were banner bearers for Ireland.</P>
    <P>We realise that, despite the recent changes announced by the South African Government, the fundamental features of the system still remain intact.  I will refer to the United Nations declaration on South Africa last December.  They were calling for first, the release of political prisoners and detainees unconditionally, lifting all bans and restrictions on all proscribed and restricted organisations and persons &mdash; there has been a slight relaxation there &mdash; removing all troops from the townlands, ending the state of emergency and repealing all legislation such as the Internal Security Act, which is designed to circumscribe political activity.  There was also a call to cease all political trials and political executions.  The recent changes, as I have said, have not fully realised even one of these minimum preconditions so, obviously, if there is a lifting of sanctions at this stage it will be contrary to the spirit and the letter of the United Nations declaration.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer again to the system of apartheid, the Afrikaans word for separateness, and to refer to the multiracial society of South Africa where, according to the 1987 figures, it had a population of 35 million.  This comprised 75 per cent Africans, 14 per cent whites, 9 per cent coloured of mixed race, and 2 per cent Asian.  The stated aim of apartheid is to keep these four groups apart so that they can develop separately, the real aim being to enable the country's white minority to retain control and to continue to dominate the political economic and social life of the country.  They were able to do this through the introduction and implementation of apartheid policies in five key areas.  They are separate development, prevention of black <Col N="145" /> urbanisation, forced removals, black education and crushing anti-apartheid organisations.  As I said, that last one has been lifted.</P>
    <P>Separate development involves the creation of independent black homelands within South Africa, the so-called sovereign states.  They are television words at this stage; the Transkei, the Ciskei etc.  These deprive blacks of their South African citizenship and make them foreigners in their own country.  The South African Government take little responsibility for the payment of unemployment, old age, or other welfare benefits in these areas.  It is very important that we would know what is separatist development. The homelands really are labour reserves where Africans are forced to live when they are not needed for work in white areas.  Another point which was part of the policy of apartheid is the prevention of black urbanisation.  The economy depends on black people living separately but working in the cities, in the mines and in manufacturing industries but having no rights to establish homes there, their homes being hundreds of miles away in the homelands, and the family separated, husband from wife, children from parents.</P>
    <P>Forced removals is where they were pushed out into these newly created homelands.  It reminds me of Cromwell's comment &ldquo;to hell or to Connaught.&rdquo;  This is what has happened there &mdash; 13.7 per cent of South Africa's total land area was allocated to them, like Connaught in the past was allocated to the native Irish.  The similarities are uncanny.</P>
    <P>Black education is one of the most important aspects for any developments in South Africa.  The Bantu Education Act passed in 1955 was designed to ensure that black Africans were educated only for jobs on the lowest rung of the economic and social ladder, the place assigned to them by the State.  That educational policy obviously is unjust and unfair.  In a moderate industrial economy, it is difficult for those who are illiterate to earn a living.  The 1980 census disclosed that deliberate State neglect resulted in nearly 33 per cent of adult black Africans being <Col N="146" /> illiterate compared with less than 1 per cent of whites.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a brief reference to apartheid and poverty.  A survey conducted by university researchers from South Africa was financed by the United States Carnegie Corporation.  The results of that survey in the eighties clearly highlight the extensive injustice of apartheid and give the lie to any idea that black people in South Africa receive equal treatment.  The study showed that in percentage terms more children under the age of one year die each year in South Africa than in other Third World countries, Mozambique, Cuba or Mexico; one-third of black children under 14 are underweight or stunted in growth, more than 90 per cent of the absolute poor are in the rural areas, in some towns in the Karoo region, black people pay 50 times more for water than people in Cape Town, people on the Cape flats without electricity pay three times more for fuel than those with electricity, there are at least 1.43 million blacks in the homelands who have no incomes; a quarter of black women in South Africa are separated from their husbands; whites, who constitute 15 per cent of the South African population, receive over 70 per cent of its income and 98.1 per cent of all income from property accrues to whites; only 5.5 per cent of South African doctors are in the rural areas where 50 per cent of the population live, but in the homelands the ratio of doctor to people is 1:174,000; 2.9 million children under 15 suffer from first degree malnutrition; pensions for blacks are hopelessly inadequate, racially discriminatory and badly administered and the monthly maximum payment is $57; and the government spends far more on white schooling than on black schooling. The list is appalling.  If people really understood this and if it were circulated widely there would be no call for releasing any sanctions and it would belie the idea that there was equality for blacks in South Africa.</P>
    <P>I will make one last point, a quotation from Nelson Mandela himself: two words that have been identified with him are &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; and &ldquo;compromise.&rdquo;  An <Col N="147" /> exact quotation he made which should allay whites' fears is as follows:</P>
    <P>Compromises must be made in respect to every issue, as long as that compromise is in the interest not only of one population group but for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>He also stated that the government's opening stance is that while all South Africans should have the vote irrespective of race, the constitution should provide for the protection of whites so that the black majority do not exercise absolute control over government.  When he stated that, he was referring to the government's opening stance, and, he explained the government's meaning of &ldquo;group&rdquo; is race, and &ldquo;group rights&rdquo; means they are not ready to accept the principle of one man, one vote but he says: &ldquo;we are determined to negotiate on the basis of this demand.&rdquo;  He has also stated that he will be supportive and protective of the white minority.  Nobody could raise one question regarding the integrity of the man.  There should be no cause for fear.  We in Ireland should exercise all our powers, particularly within the Presidency of the EC, to ensure that we support the South Africans in what will be for them a period of tension, a transition period.  They have their leader, he is in the process of consultation but at the end of the day there is no way we can relax our interest, our pressure or our sanctions in relation to the ultimate freedom for South Africa which Nelson Mandela has stated he is ready to die for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first, to indicate that it is my intention to share some of my time with Senator O'Toole who I hope, is in a position to hear this statement and make himself available to take up this time.  I am sure, being the man he is, that he will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised some mirth this morning when I mentioned constituents of mine in Australia.  I do not wish to raise any more mirth when I say that I feel especially qualified to speak on this debate as the <Col N="148" /> only African born Member of this House, but it gives me a particular interest in the affairs of that great Continent.  My interest in South Africa, although I was born in central Africa, stems from the fact that during the war, when my father was in charge, among other things, of war production for the allies in central Africa, there was no possibility of my parents coming back to Europe so they had to holiday in South Africa.  They found the experience so unpleasant they did not repeat it.  They were relatively unsophisticated in terms of the way we see the situation today but they found it distressing to have to witness the way people they considered as inferior were treated. The way my mother put it to me &mdash; she was very much of the <i>ancien régimé</i>&mdash; was that they simply did not know how to treat servants.  These were people from Europe, many of them from Ireland. They gave themselves a sense of superiority by mistreating people who were less advantaged in terms of education, social position and finance.  That may be a fairly primitive gauge but even at that stage it indicated that people were uncomfortable with the situation in South Africa at the time.</P>
    <P>Like most other people throughout the globe I watched the release of Nelson Mandela.  It was an extraordinary historic moment.  It was a moment that we waited for for many years.  It does, of course, raise some questions.  This was a man who had been away from the immediate political scene for 27 years.  When he went into prison I was a teenager, and now I am a middle aged man.  One of the things that occurred to me was how will this man deal with the extraordinary complex political situation which confronts him.  It certainly has changed since he went in, it has changed in some ways optimistically.  For example, there were groups of white people there to welcome him.  I was immensely heartened not just by the visual impact of this dignified figure emerging from captivity, but by the amazing imaginative leap of which he showed himself capable.  In his first interview he spoke not of injustice, not of the appalling wrongs committed by the <Col N="149" /> white people against his people, but of the need to understand the fears and concerns of the white minority.  I salute the moral stature of a man who finds himself capable of this kind of imaginative encompassing.  Like everybody else, I welcome the release of Nelson Mandela. I do not intend to repeat what other people have said.  It was a very remarkable thing.  I am glad and honoured to be part of a country that has consistently supported the anti-apartheid movement. I am proud to be a citizen of a city that has made him a freeman.  I believe that Nelson Mandela has, in fact, honoured us by accepting the position of a Freeman.</P>
    <P>I was on the march last weekend which celebrated the release of Nelson Mandela sponsored by the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement.  From that experience certain things struck me.  Listening to the people on the platform everyone reiterated the fact that sanctions must be maintained. This is a message coming not just from that meeting but also coming from South Africa, from people like Bishop Trevor Huddleston, Archbishop Tutu and Nelson Mandela himself.  If we respect the views of this man and the people he represents, we must continue sanctions. I was glad that the Taoiseach showed himself again so statesmanlike in dealing with this situation.  We have, as the Minister knows I am sure better than I do, an exceedingly important role to play at the moment because of our pivotal position in the European Community. We must respond to this.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention some concerns I have.  As we went along in the march we passed the College of Surgeons. There was a group there demonstrating, Aboriginals from Australia, one of whom claims that the medical specimen of the Aboriginal head inside that college is, in fact, that of his great-grandfather. That is important, because it is so easy for us to be tolerant and forward looking when it is 4,000 or 5,000 miles away.  I, of course, exonerate the authorities in the College of Surgeons from direct responsibility as the result of a colonial inheritance and so on.  They must, however, be sensitive.  I wonder if <Col N="150" /> any of us can imagine what it would be like if it was our great-grandfather's head that was involved?  I would like that point to be registered.  It will be brought up again.  It is not my intention to be contentious. I have spoken to a senior member of the Royal College of Surgeons this morning and I gather that this matter may well be speedily and positively resolved.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something else arising from that march.  I was part of the group that listened to the speeches.  On the fringes of the crowd there were members of Sinn Féin and they were shouting: &ldquo;Where is Gerry Adams?&rdquo;&ldquo;Sinn Féin&rdquo; and all the rest of it.  They were selling magazines &mdash;<i>An Phoblacht</i>&mdash; the front page of which carried a huge picture of Nelson Mandela and the legend &ldquo;The Armed Struggle Continues.&rdquo;  They were placing that in a context which suggested a parallel, which I completely reject, between the situation in Southern Africa and the situation in Northern Ireland.  I call upon the Government similarly to reject this attempt to carpetbag on a very important issue.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention, because it is important, to two areas of our own hypocrisy in this in terms of human rights. If we feel as we rightly do about South Africa and see it as an issue of principle, let us be aware of the fact that it is an issue of principle, on which we can be extremely comfortable.  I would like to ask the Minister to apply the principles of our stance on Mr. Mandela to the situation in Tibet, where we have somebody of the same moral stature, the Dali Lama, of Nelson Mandela, who not only did not give in easily to the armed struggle but who has consistently and absolutely turned his face against violence of any kind.  What is his reward?  His reward is to be ignored in the international fora. We have a situation where in this country we are conspiring, collaborating, with the Chinese Government in the genocide of the Tibetan people.  I call upon the Government to register this in the same way as they now are supporting the situation with regard to Nelson Mandela.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a final point and <Col N="151" /> then hand over to my colleague.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in a very impressive statement to the 46th session of the United Nation's Commission on Human Rights, among other things said this one sentence:</P>
    <P>An impressive body of international instruments has evolved over the years to protect the rights of the individual through the medium of international law.</P>
    <P>What are the Government doing to implement, to articulate this, in, for example, the case that I brought at the European Court of Human Rights.  This relates to Mandela.  It is perfectly easy to be tolerant, civilised, sophisticated and to respect human rights when they are 4,000 miles away.  I want to know what are the Government doing in the case of Tibet and in the case of my own action at the European Court of Human Rights?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to be able to contribute to the debate.  I cannot think that I have anything new to offer to the very full and comprehensive arguments which have been offered right through the debate this morning and which I am sure the Minister will take on board.  I want to be clearly associated with the remarks, also because we have on many occasions, with the Minister of State in our presence, been critical of Government policy.  This time we can say well done to the Government.  To be even handed in our approach, it is fair to say that the Irish Government have been magnificent in this particular area for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My introduction to apartheid was presented to me was by one of my now dead former professors of education, Michael Jordan, whose son went on to be a very famous film director.  He introduced to me apartheid as a form of education in the same way as the Nazi system is a form of education.  I always looked upon it like that ever since.  Everything I have learned about it has shown to me that it is a state of oppression.  One of the things that has annoyed me more than <Col N="152" /> anything else over the last few weeks &mdash; I rarely criticise any political group in this country &mdash; is the hypocrisy of the Sinn Féin head office flying the ANC flag for the last three weeks and trying to pretend that the armed struggle was the same in both countries, I have given a lot of thought to this over the years.</P>
    <P>It is important to say that the armed struggle can only be justified in the case where all democratic roots and rights to vote have been suppressed, oppressed and wiped out.  It is the only time it can ever be justified; and I am not saying that it can always be justified in those circumstances.  As a form of shorthand there is no comparison between the situation in South Africa and the situation in Northern Ireland.  They are absolutely contrasted.</P>
    <P>In the last few years I had the privilege on a number of occasions to discuss apartheid with Donald Woods, who was a white victim of apartheid.  The story of a person trying to live a dual role in South Africa has convinced me of the need for the western countries to maintain the sanctions.  I have discussed with South Africans, black and white, the question of the sanctions.  I have listened to the blasé arguments of the Thatcherite wing, who say &ldquo;It is time to lift sanctions and give De Klerk a break.&rdquo;  Also, on the other side, there are those people who will say the sanctions hurt the blacks in South Africa.  I have discussed it with the blacks and the representatives of the blacks.  I would certainly take my lead from the ANC.  They are prepared to suffer for another while under sanctions in order to make the point, to make progress and to finally eliminate from the face of the earth the curse of apartheid.</P>
    <P>In Ireland there is much hypocrisy.  I would like to dwell on some of those things but I do not have time.  Suffice it to say that I have not been to an international rugby match since the Spring-bok's tour of 1973.  I certainly feel that that organisation have let us down badly in various ways over the years.  I am resisting doing what my colleague, Senator Norris, did, I call to mind some of the hypocrisy in Irish life, not that <Col N="153" /> referred to by Senator Norris but certainly there is a form of double thinking. Too many of our people find it a useful salving of conscience to be opposed to apartheid in South Africa.  There are also things in our own country that need to be looked at.  Perhaps it is inappropriate to mention those, so I will not mention them, except to say that, if they are there, a point can be made.</P>
    <P>I also feel it has been important to put on the record of this House today the views of Members, because history will note the action and response of parliamentarians. It has been crucially important that there has been such unanimity of approach and response on this issue.  Long may it continue.  I put it clearly on the record that we should be very supportive of the Government's line on this.  It raises one further question, however.  It is the only irrelevancy which I will mention.  In the Cambodian vote on the UN we did not have the moral courage as a nation to vote against the other members of the European Community. Prime Minister Thatcher had that courage this week.  I disliked it and I disappoved of it, but I believe she has also opened up a little bit of leverage for our Government at times when we do not have a coincidental view with the rest of Europe.  I wish the Government well on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my word of joy on the release of Nelson Mandela.  It was great to see Nelson Mandela walking proudly from his years of mental torture aggravated by solitary confinement and years of hard labour. He again proved that the authoritarian state, while it can confine a person physically, cannot break a man's spirit or belief in his ideals.  Nelson Mandela is a symbol of the triumph of moral courage over jackboot state suppression.  He brings to mind the same idealism as we have seen in Ireland throughout the centuries, when our people stood firmly and suffered for their ideals and principles.  It is because of such heroism that we are here today to compliment the heroism of Nelson Mandela.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> Nelson Mandela also highlights how helpless any Government can be when it loses the support of the majority of its people.  Without question, the imposition of a trade embargo by the industrial world on South Africa was a vital factor in bringing the white rulers to their senses. Naturally, Mr. De. Klerk deserves to be congratulated on beginning the process of the undoing of apartheid.  While he should receive support for his actions from the outside world, it is nonetheless vital that the current trade restrictions should continue to be enforced until the process of dismantling his country's discriminatory economic and legal network is far more advanced.  An immediate lifting of the state of emergency and a general amnesty for political prisoners is only a first step in the process.</P>
    <P>To suggest, as Prime Minister Thatcher does, that the steps taken to date by Mr. De Klerk merits the lifting of sanctions is far off the mark.  Mr. De Klerk has only started down the road, which must soon include one man, one vote.  I believe it is only when this stage is reached that the western world can lift sanctions on South Africa.  It is disappointing that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, in his role as chairperson of the Council of Ministers, failed to keep unity within the EC on the question of sanctions on South Africa.</P>
    <P>The issue facing South Africa is not the armed struggle or sanctions.  It is the question of apartheid.  The armed struggle of the ANC is a defensive measure against this.  The organisation wants to move from confrontation with the white minority.  Nelson Mandela made it clear that the ANC are prepared to address the fears of the whites.  He is looking for a non-radical solution.  In the context of South African history, however, colour and culture have played an important part and will affect the situation for many generations to come.  The white population is an important section of South Africa.  Nelson Mandela has stated, and the ANC are keen to ensure, that there is no hint that changes will mean domination of whites by blacks.</P>
    <P>There is a body of opinion in white <Col N="155" /> South Africa that suggests partition as a solution to the problem.  This will not lead to peace and justice but to continuing conflict and bitterness between the groups.  The free world rejoices in the release of Nelson Mandela.  He has now a difficult task ahead of him.  Fresh elections under one man, one vote, must take place.  After this the blacks and whites must sit down together and draw up a constitution for a new South Africa.  We, in Ireland, deprived of such freedoms for so long, must remain in the forefront of the promotion of this and help the South African people to end the nightmare of apartheid and the indignity of economic sanctions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the release of Nelson Mandela.  We welcome the release in its own right but also as a symbol of progress at last in that South Africa is beginning to resolve what appeared to be an intractable problem. Ireland's role in this and our stand in sanctions go along with our history and tradition in international affairs.  In this matter we can be very proud of both the stand of our Government and the Taoiseach on the matter of sanctions and on the use of this method of international opinion which forces change in states that are not adhering to democratic principles.</P>
      <P>Those of us who think that violence is an unacceptable way of bringing about change have to offer the oppressed people of the world alternative methods of achieving change in their countries.  It has proven in this case that the force of international opinion, the boycotting of sports events and the imposition of sanctions have been more powerful in bringing about change in South Africa than any type of internal violence could ever have been.  It is very important that if we want oppressed peoples to adopt a nonviolent method of seeking change in political solutions the international communities must ensure that they use such methods to bring about change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in South Africa has changed fundamentally.  For the first time <Col N="156" /> the rights of the ANC to represent the coloured people of that country have been recognised.  We have to admit that the steps that have taken place are only minor ones and that, in itself, the release of Nelson Mandela is more a symbol than an actual change.  As the Minister of State said, the amount of change that is needed in that country before it can be accepted as part of the normal international community is still very great.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that the methods that have been so successful to date would be continued until real dialogue is achieved and until there are guarantees given to the people of South Africa &mdash; all the people &mdash; that real democratic principles will rule in that country again.</P>
    <P>It must be noted also from the statements of Mr. Mandela that he has quite categorically declared the right of the white minority in South Africa to their position and their rightful position in any future South Africa that will emerge. This is particularly magnanimous and important in the context of this whole problem.  The majority are willing to state that the minority in that country would be willing, in the event of normal democratic principles being applied, to afford to the minority the rights they deserve.</P>
    <P>In that spirit of unity and generosity from Mr. Mandela there is now hope that we are at last seeing a new dawn in South Africa.  I hope that the pressure will be continued to make sure, as has happened in Eastern Europe, that changes would be brought about in the short term rather than in the long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I say that from the number of Senators who were anxious to join in the debate &mdash; indeed many more could have spoken if the time had allowed &mdash; it is quite obvious that there is general unanimity in the House in relation to the motion and in relation to the feeling of joy that swept right through the country at the release of Nelson Mandela. Senator Harte confessed that he unashamedly shed a tear.  There were <Col N="157" /> many other people who would have joined him in that particular act.  Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I can say that the Government joins with the Members of the Seanad in welcoming recent developments in South Africa and especially the release of Nelson Mandela.</P>
      <P>Nelson Mandela has remained a potent symbol of freedom for all those struggling for the eradication of apartheid.  He has demonstrated by his indomitable courage throughout the years that the human spirit can never be vanquished.  Statements he has made since his release have added to his international stature, since they show that he is without rancour and is adopting a highly constructive approach to the task of creating, through dialogue, a new united, non-racial and democratic South Africa.  This is a point that was made by very many Senators, including Senator Norris, and many others who have spoken about the man.</P>
      <P>In the Government's view, the release of Nelson Mandela and the other measures announced by the South African Government constitute a major and very welcome contribution to creating a climate in South Africa in which a national dialogue can take place aimed at the early and complete abolition of the apartheid system.  However, the South African Government have yet to take all the necessary steps to create the climate for dialogue.  In particular, it must lift the state of emergency and release all political prisoners.  I, myself, have stated that at the UN, speaking on behalf of the Government.  Indeed, that has been stated by very many of the Senators who have spoken here today.  It is, of course, also important that all sides renounce violence &mdash; a point made very strongly by Senators O'Reilly, Lydon, Norris, O'Keeffe and many others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also particularly important to remember that the measures taken to date by the South African Government leave fully intact the structures of apartheid. Such pillars of the apartheid system as the Group Areas Act and the Population Registration Act remain fully in force.  There were many other points raised by Senators O'Reilly, Costello, <Col N="158" /> Brendan Ryan, Eoin Ryan, Conroy, particularly Senator Jackman and Senator Neville.  The majority in South Africa continue to live under this entirely unjust and inhuman system, which is an insult to the dignity of the human person. The majority continues to have no say in how the country is run and to suffer systematic discrimination on racial grounds in the political, economic and social spheres.  While President De Klerk has indicated that he intends to abolish apartheid, what exactly he means by this is far from clear.  There are some disturbing indications in his statements that he and his Government still cling to the discredited idea of group rights which has been the basis on which the white majority has excluded the black majority from political and economic power.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross was, I suppose, Senator Ross.  In his very strident condemnation of apartheid he also went on to say that the whole Irish population suffers from hypocrisy.  Apartheid is a constitutionalised form of systematic abuse of human rights.  If Senator Ross had been able to listen to the explanation of Senator Harte, who gave a very detailed description of the workings of this very obnoxious system, he would probably have been less strident.  He also pointed the finger at this Government and the last Government in relation to Iraq.  Could I remind the Senator &mdash; it is unfortunate he is not here &mdash; that at the UN Commission on Human Rights last year Ireland not only supported but sponsored a draft resolution condemning human rights abuses in Iraq.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris spoke about the situation in Tibet and questioned, as he saw it, the Government's lack of concern in the case of Tibet.  I would like to say to Senator Norris that, as recently as this month, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, speaking on behalf of the Twelve at the UN Commission for Human Rights, explicitly referred to our concern at the human rights situation in Tibet.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan raised the question of coal again and felt that Ireland and, indeed, the Community could introduce sanctions on coal.  I have already <Col N="159" /> said &mdash; and, indeed, many Senators have agreed &mdash; that while this is not the time to lessen pressure on South Africa, I feel, however, that to increase pressure would also send the wrong signal.  We would like to encourage the South African Government to continue down the path of reform, as suggested by many Senators.  If they fail to do so, we could certainly consider increasing pressure there.</P>
    <P>Senators Ryan, Norris and Ross failed to realise that the Irish Government are one of the few Governments in the world that have no diplomatic relations with South Africa.  Senator Eoin Ryan referred to the Uppington 14 and appealed to the Minister to take up their case.  The Minister, with the Twelve, has regularly taken up this and other cases and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about the problems of Cambodia, while agreeing with the motion and congratulating the Government on their stance.  I am a little disappointed that the Senator did not seem to have read my explanation to this House on Cambodia.  I explained clearly that we had voted for the resolution because we supported the principles set out in it including the right &mdash; and this, I think, is extremely important &mdash; of the Cambodian people to decide in free elections who should govern them.  Our Ambassador delivered an explanation of our vote to the UN in which he made clear our total rejection of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge regime.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the issue of international pressure on South Africa, and particularly economic sanctions, must be considered.  As Senators will be fully aware, it is the view of the Government &mdash; a view shared by the great majority of our Community partners &mdash; that the measures taken to date by the South African Government, while welcome, do not justify any relaxation of pressure.  As I have already stated, the measures taken to date do not even meet the traditional demands of the international Community, including the Twelve, for creating the conditions for <Col N="160" /> national dialogue.  Furthermore, they in no way touch the fundamentals of the apartheid system.</P>
    <P>I find Senator Neville's remarks somewhat strange.  He appears to blame the Minister, Deputy Collins, for the position taken by the UK on easing sanctions at the meeting of Community Foreign Ministers this week.  I would like to say to Senator Neville that Minister Collins could not force the UK to accept the path taken by the rest of the Twelve in relation to their aims to keep the sanctions.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's view very ably put by Deputy Collins, that pressure, including economic pressure, should be maintained on South Africa until action is taken to abolish the apartheid system and to replace it with a united, democratic and non-racial society.  If major steps are taken in this direction, then we could look again at the types of pressure we maintain on the South African Government.  However, to talk about relaxing sanctions and pressure at this stage is to give a totally wrong signal to the South African Government.  This point has been made forcefully by Nelson Mandela, among others.  I am sure we would all agree that the representatives of the majority in South Africa deserve the full support of the international community as they embark upon the difficult task of achieving a negotiated end to the apartheid system.  Their argument that international pressure is one of the few bargaining counters they have when dealing with the might of the South African Government is, I believe, a persuasive one.  In heeding this argument we here are paying attention to what Nelson Mandela and the other leaders are saying &mdash; a point raised by Senator Brendan Ryan.</P>
    <P>I might add that in my travels throughout the African Continent I have found that in all of the frontline states that is a point that is very strongly made to me every time I talk to representatives of government.</P>
    <P>The representatives of the majority in South Africa also need positive support to help them overcome the gap that has been created between them and the privileged white minority.  The Twelve are <Col N="161" /> committed to reinforcing the programme of positive measures which they have been implementing in favour of the majority community.  These positive measures aim to provide direct and practical assistance to the majority community in South Africa to help them overcome years of discrimination and neglect.  Such measures are increasingly important in the new situation that is now emerging in South Africa.  The problems raised by these years of neglect were covered very fully by Senator Jackman, Senator Ryan and Senator Conroy, among others.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by representatives of Italy and France, is due to travel to South Africa in the near future on behalf of the Twelve.  Their mission will be to promote national dialogue and to carry out an assessment of the current situation.  They will report back to Ministers of the Twelve on the results of their mission.  It is the Government's hope that the mission will further advance the prospects of dialogue in South Africa.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me thank Seanad Éireann for giving me this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Government in this important debate.  I join fully with Senators in welcoming recent developments in South Africa and in particular in welcoming the release of Nelson Mandela. I also look forward to the day when we can welcome back into the international community a new South Africa which is united, non-racial and democratic. There is, however, a very long way to go before that stage is reached.  While welcoming the developments that have taken place, the message that I would like to leave with you is one of vigilance. As Senator Costello has said, it is important that the momentum is not lost.  We certainly welcome the developments that have taken place.  Let us not also be under any illusion as to the need to keep up pressure on the South African Government until the total dismantlement of the abhorrent apartheid system has been achieved and, in the words of Nelson Mandela, a new united, non-racial, fully <Col N="162" /> democratic South Africa, where every citizen will have equal rights and opportunity is established.</P>

    <Title>Building Control Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a revised framework for the making and administration of building regulations.  At present, the power to make building regulations is contained in section 86 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  The purposes for which regulations may be made under that Act relate to matters of public health and safety.  However, since the enactment of the 1963 Act, the need to provide for energy conservation and for more flexible systems of building control have led to the situation where the 1963 Act is not adequate.  The Bill, therefore, expands the purposes for which regulations may be made to include not just public health and safety but also the welfare of persons in and about buildings. The regulations may also provide for the special needs of the disabled, for energy conservation, for the efficient use of resources and for the encouragement of good building practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the individual sections of the Bill in greater detail later on but first I would like to refer briefly to the background to building regulations and to the history of this Bill.  The 1963 Planning Act conferred an enabling power on the Minister for Local Government to make building regulations to replace the building by-laws which were too rigid and not capable of adjusting to changes in building methods and technology.  A draft of building regulations in accordance with the 1963 Act was completed in <Col N="163" /> 1976.  Consultation with interested parties in the building industry generated lively debate and comments were received from over 500 persons and organisations.  Apart from technical comments on the regulations themselves, concern was expressed that the system of control set out in the 1963 Planning Act would be bureaucratic and unwieldy and would create costly delays.  An amended draft was published in March 1981.  Alternative systems of building control were also being examined at that time, including a control system based on certification by the industry.  It became apparent at that stage that a new Bill was needed.</P>
    <P>The publication in July 1982 of the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry on the Stardust fire reinforced the need for new legislation.  The draft building regulations were revised to take account of certain recommendations made by the tribunal and a further updated draft was published in October 1983.</P>
    <P>The Building Control Bill was published in 1984 and it passed Second Stage in the Dáil.  In July 1986, both Houses agreed to refer it to the then Joint Committee on Legislation.  The Bill was considered at two meetings of the Joint Committee in October and November 1986.  However, before the joint committee had concluded their deliberations, the Bill lapsed with the dissolution of the Dáil in January 1987.  The Bill was restored to the Dáil Order Paper in October 1987 and it was passed, following substantial amendment, by Dáil Éireann before Christmas.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill designates as building control authorities those local authorities which are fire authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1981.  This arrangement recognises the importance of the regulations in relation to fire safety generally and should facilitate better coordination and co-operation at local level in regard to the matters, including fire safety, arising under the regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 3 contains the power to make building regulations.  Subject to the transitional arrangements in section 22 (2), the regulations will apply to all new <Col N="164" /> buildings &mdash; including State buildings other than prisons and places of detention &mdash; construction work on which begins on or after the date on which the regulations come into operation.  Provision is made, however, for exemptions.  Under this provision buildings such as power stations, temporary buildings, detached domestic garages, small outhouses and like buildings might be considered for exemption from the regulations.  The regulations will apply to existing buildings only where they are affected by material alterations or extensions, by the provision of new services, fittings or equipment, or where a material change in the use of a building occurs.  Section 3 extends the purposes for which regulations may be made to provide for the welfare of persons in or about buildings, the needs of the disabled, energy conservation, the efficient use of resources and the encouragement of good building practice.  The matters for which the regulations may prescribe standards are detailed in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 contains the power for building control authorities to dispense with or relax particular provisions of building regulations in individual cases where compliance could be unreasonable having regard to the use to which the building might be put.  A building control authority will have two months in which to deal with such an application unless the applicant agrees to a longer period, and if the authority makes no decision within that time the application will be taken as being granted.</P>
    <P>A corresponding power is provided in section 5 for the Minister to dispense with or relax a requirement of building regulations in relation to any particular class of building operation, works or material.  This power is necessary to cater for the development of new methods of construction and materials which do not strictly comply with the regulations but are otherwise acceptable.  Section 13 confers powers on the Minister to prohibit the use of materials or methods of construction which would be a danger to public health or safety or which would contravene the building regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> I would like now to talk about section 6 of the Bill, which empowers the Minister to make building control regulations. These control regulations would prescribe the procedural, administrative and control arrangements necessary to secure compliance with the buildings regulations. Section 6 contains a flexible power which will enable different systems of control to be applied to different kinds of buildings or to buildings in different areas or in relation to different provisions of building regulations.</P>
    <P>This Bill establishes building control authorities with powers of inspection, enforcement and prosecution under sections 8, 11 and 17.  Building control regulations under section 6 will be additional to these powers.  I would like to explain briefly the different main types of control procedures that can be put in place under section 6.  The first option is to provide for self-certification and this system centres around a large measure of self-regulation by the industry itself.  Under the self-certification system the designers and builders of individual projects will, on their own responsibility, provide certificates of compliance with the requirements of the building regulations.  There is a recognition within this system that the primary responsibility for designing and construction of buildings rests with the industry itself.</P>
    <P>The second option is third party certification, involving certification of the design and construction of buildings by an independent and appropriately qualified person.  Third party certification is, in effect, a form of independent self-regulation by the industry.</P>
    <P>The third main option provided for under section 6 is broadly similar to the control operated by those local authorities which currently operate building by-laws.  It would involve the submission of plans and other information to the building control authority for approval and the approval of this authority could also be required in respect of the completed building.</P>
    <P>The flexible nature of section 6 and the range of options it provides will ensure that the Minister of the day will not be <Col N="166" /> unduly confined in relation to the types of control systems that might be appropriate to the building industry at different times in the future.</P>
    <P>Building control regulations under section 6 may also provide for the issue of fire safety certificates by building control authorities in respect of fire aspects of certain buildings.  This provision is included as a direct result of the report of the Stardust Tribunal.  What would be involved is the submission of plans of certain buildings for approval in advance of commencement of construction.  The types of buildings which might be subjected to this control system would be specified in the control regulations and would be likely to be buildings which would present a high risk in the case of fire.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides a right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála where an applicant is not satisfied with the decision of a building control authority on an application under section 4 or 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 to 11 of the Bill relate to enforcement.  The provisions of sections 8 and 10 enable building control authorities to serve a notice requiring action to be taken to ensure compliance with building regulations, while section 11 confers rights of inspection.  Section 9 sets out the procedure by which a person may apply to the District Court to have an enforcement notice annulled, modified or altered, the grounds on which it may be done and the powers of the Court.</P>
    <P>The power in section 12 for a building control authority to seek an order from the High Court is additional to that contained in the sections dealing with the enforcement notice.  This power is necessary to deal with an emergency situation where a building control authority may consider that, because of the risk to health or safety arising from construction work, immediate action is necessary and it would not be prudent to go through the procedures necessary for the service of an enforcement notice under section 8. The High Court order may require that a building be removed or made safe and prohibit its use until this is done.  A <Col N="167" /> similar provision is contained in the Fire Services Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>Section 14 enables the Minister to appoint a Building Regulations Advisory Body to advise him on matters relating to building regulations and to provide such other advisory services as may be specified from time to time.  The House will note that the section is drafted in fairly broad terms.  This is deliberate as there is a wide range of issues on which the advisory body might be asked to advise.</P>
    <P>Penalties for offences are set out in section 17 of the Bill and are generally similar to those under the Fire Services Act, 1981.  Penalties will depend on whether an offence is of a summary or indictable nature which, in turn, will depend on the circumstances of each particular case.  Indictable offences will carry severe penalties &mdash; a maximum fine of £10,000 and/or two years imprisonment. Summary offences will be liable to a maximum fine of £800 and/or six months imprisonment and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a fine of not more than £150 for each day on which the offence is continued after conviction; there is a five year time limit on summary proceedings. This limit is in response to the industry's concern that they would otherwise be open to prosecution for an unlimited period in respect of even minor breaches of the regulations.</P>
    <P>In addition to monetary penalties and possible terms of imprisonment, section 17 provides for the disqualification of approved certifiers from signing and submitting certificates of compliance under section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill provides that a contravention of any of the provisions of the Bill will not of itself confer a right of action in civil proceedings.  I feel that the House may wish me to address the liability question.  Liability is determined by the Courts having regard to the law of contract and of tort as these apply in the particular circumstances of the case in question.  Nothing in this Bill, or in regulations to be made under it, will alter this.  Liability and related matters, such as <Col N="168" /> insuring against it, are really extraneous to the subject matter of the Bill.  Section 21 of the Bill intended to allay the fears of professional bodies and others who are concerned that the Bill might have the effect of extending their liability beyond that which exists at present.  I am advised that those fears are probably groundless but this provision should settle any doubt. I might add that a person's right to sue for damages on grounds of negligence will not be interfered with.</P>
    <P>Because of the existence of building by-laws in some areas, it is necessary to provide for transitional arrangements as in subsection (2) of section 22.  Section 22 is the general transition section but there is one provision, subsection (7), to which I would like to refer.  Senators are probably aware that, in areas where building by-laws are operated, small building works, particularly house extensions, may have been carried out in the past without by-laws approval.  The fact that by-laws approval cannot be obtained in retrospect under existing law has caused problems in house sales as evidence of compliance with by-laws may have to be shown to intending purchasers.  Delays in the completion of house sales have occurred, very often though no fault of the vendor, who may have bought the house at a time when evidence of by-law approval was not demanded by lending agencies.  This has caused hardship in a number of cases.  I consider that it is reasonable, therefore, to use this opportunity to provide that, where work carried out prior to 13 December 1989 did not comply with by-laws or any relevant statutory requirement, no proceedings shall be taken in respect of such noncompliance, and that approval to the carrying out of the work shall be deemed to have been granted, unless a building control authority considers the work to be a danger to public health or safety and serves a notice to this effect on the owner within six months of the date on which the building regulations come into operation. Senators will note that this &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; only operates in respect of work carried out prior to the date the Bill was passed by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> I have outlined to the House the purpose and main provisions of this Bill.  I consider that it provides a suitable framework for the introduction of a comprehensive up-to-date and flexible system of building regulations and building controls. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It has taken 20 years to bring it to this House.  A draft was prepared as far back as 1981.  I welcome the provisions for fire regulations.  We recognise the need for having some unified system throughout the country and also to have a facility to ensure that the law is enforced and that the regulations laid down in the Bill will be adhered to.</P>
      <P>There are certain aspects of this Bill which worry me, such as the area of self-certification. Anybody looking at the Bill would have to be concerned about that requirement.  One has to ask what are the implications of self-certification for the building industry.  Is it going to mean that it will add additional costs to the industry. How is it going to be worked out?  Who is going to monitor the area of self-certification? Is this going to have major implications from an insurance point of view, not alone for companies who will be involved in this area but also for the house purchaser?  Is it going to be more difficult in the absence of building controls and by-laws to get insurance to purchase a house.  These are areas I would like the Minister to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill raises a number of serious questions.  To my mind, the question of self-certification is the biggest issue raised in this Bill.  I am concerned with the lack of consultation between the Minister's Department and the construction industry. Adequate discussion has not taken place and the views of the building and construction industry have not been adequately catered for in this Bill.  It is inappropriate that we proceed to enact this legislation until such time as the Minister completes negotiations with all sections of the industry &mdash; the engineers, architects and everybody involved in this &mdash; so as to ensure that at the end of the <Col N="170" /> day we get proper legislation that can be implemented.</P>
    <P>We also have to ask when it is envisaged that this legislation will be operable. This Bill was first introduced nine years ago; it was introduced in the Dáil in 1984 and it has only now come to the Seanad. I understand there were certain difficulties, but it would appear to have been a very long and difficult passage for this legislation.  I hope that when the Minister is replying he will deal with the question of self-certification at length and explain to the House what is envisaged.  I will be putting down amendments on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will take them on board.  I believe there is a lot to be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This legislation will place very heavy responsibility on everybody involved in the building industry.  We must recognise we have many excellent people involved in the building industry, contractors who have carried out excellent work over the years, but we also have undesirable people.  That small minority of builders worry me.  Under this legislation we are removing the by-law responsibility in three major areas such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  We realise the need for uniformity of the building regulations which will apply equally throughout the country and which when fully operational will guarantee to the public that from a health, fire and construction point of view we will get a better standard throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The present situation is unsatisfactory. There are difficulties in some areas.  We all know that where building contractors move in on sites to build private housing very often it is not until they are gone that the difficulties are realised.  While every rural Deputy will be aware of the attitude of the officials of the Department of the Environment in carrying out their duty for grant purposes, by and large they will not be able to examine the foundations, whether the septic tank is put in properly and whether the proper soakage is provided.  These matters cause major problems afterwards.  It is an indication that in certain areas where there is not control major difficulties can arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> With regard to different sections of the Bill, the Minister should examine some of the amendments that I and other Members of the House will be putting down.  This Bill can be improved if there is an open-minded approach adopted by the Minister and the Members of the Seanad.  I have no doubt that the Senators will do all in their power to ensure that when this legislation leaves here it will have the effect it was intended to have.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that over the last number of years procedures have changed in the building industry.  We are all aware of the different types, styles and plans of housing being provided, not only in the cities but indeed throughout the country.  We recognise that building procedures have changed and that the attitude of planning authorities has also changed.  Very often we see restrictions being imposed under the planning laws and we must question whether the Planning Acts ever intended those restrictions to be imposed.  Under this Bill we should clearly specify precisely what is intended in it; otherwise it could be open to interpretation and perhaps the intention of the legislation would not materialise on the ground.  A very undesirable situation could occur and we would not have uniformity, which, by and large, we intend to have under the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of worries have been expressed by people in the building industry with regard to the change in the implementation of regulations laid down under the by-laws in a number of our cities.  Those fears are well founded, because building in cities is very complicated and creates major problems.  It is not until a disaster happens that we realise that some function which should have been carried out was not.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the area of self-certification, it is a very serious matter and one to which this House will have to give very serious consideration.  I find it extremely difficult to see how it can work. It is the one aspect of the Bill on which I appeal to the Minister to accept amendments on Committee Stage.  The biggest difficulty confronting the construction <Col N="172" /> industry, as far as the adoption of statute building regulations are concerned, is this question of certification &mdash; the question of who certifies, the position of architects within the building industry.  Indeed, as I understand it, there is no statutory regulation for the registration of architects.  I would like the Minister to specify how the certification will be decided.  I understand that, by and large, anybody can call himself an architect.  It is one of the terms of the Bill that an architect's or engineer's certificate is provided.  I would like some clarification on that.</P>
    <P>The role of architects, engineers and builders is rather vague.  It should be more clearly specified.  A range of problems can arise.  The building industry will look at this Bill with great apprehension. It will have serious and far-reaching implications for the industry.  All of us know the difficult time the building industry has gone through.  The Government policy with regard to the major cutbacks in funding for local authority housing has created major problems for the industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the Minister or his Department have worked out the additional costs that may be involved for the industry as a result of the introduction of this Bill, the costs that may arise as a result of the changing of standards, the costs that may arise as a result of the difficulty with regard to certification, whether that be by way of getting the certificate, by way of the difficulties created for people who have to issue a certificate, the legal implications down the road for them, the additional cost for the householder in trying to secure insurance.  These are issues we must tease out on Committee Stage.  By and large, I welcome the Bill, but I will be putting down a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill, It has been hanging around for a very long time, since 1983 or 1984, when it was first introduced by Deputy Fergus O'Brien.  I think it would serve a purpose if I quoted from the Stardust Tribunal report, which stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> The presence of the wall linings with their low surface spread of flame rating played a major part in the disaster.  In addition, the unsatisfactory nature of Exit 2 was a contributing factor in the deaths and injuries.  Had the express requirements of the Draft Building Regulations in relation to both these matters been enforced and observed, the consequences of the disaster might have been significantly diminished.  It is entirely unacceptable that the Regulations dealing with matters of this nature should continue to be of no legal effect.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I congratulate the Minister and I thank him for bringing forward what is an extremely important and significant Bill.</P>
    <P>It is always necessary to have a look back and to see what was in operation by way of demonstrating the importance of the Bill before us.  The building by-laws are operated at present by seven local authorities and, where they apply, applications for approval to construct a building must be submitted to the local authority and must be approved before the work commences.  The difficulty here is, and experience has shown, that most staff time is spent examining plans and that perhaps not enough inspection of foundations and drains is carried out at the time of construction.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a new statutory basis in that the regulations will set out the manner in which the buildings are to be constructed.  It can also provide a system of administration of the regulations pertaining to buildings.  One could also say, if we look at the 1963 Planning Development Act, that this Act could, in fact, suffice here.  But on examination we find that there are serious defects in that Act. The first one is that the regulations are not able to address such matters as the special needs of the disabled, or indeed energy conservation, which has major implications for our economy, given the size of the massive fuel import bill we have at the moment.  Secondly, any regulations made could only be administered under an expensive local authority system <Col N="174" /> which would give rise to serious delays in getting construction under way.</P>
    <P>The importance of this Bill is that it paves the way for making building regulations and will give them national application.  At the moment regulations are confined to seven local authorities and generally tied to the urban areas.  At present outside of these major built-up areas there is no nationally enforceable standard.  We have what is known as the blue book, or the proposed building regulations. While one could say that these have been adhered to by and large, they were never legally enforceable.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for two types of regulations related to buildings.  The first one will lay down technical requirements and the second will relate to building control regulations, which will lay down procedures for ensuring conformity with the technical requirements of the building regulations.  I welcome the fact that the Minister amended the Bill in Committee to ensure that the regulations can be drafted into simple functional requirements. I mean by that that in setting out the technical requirements of the building regulations one should provide a reasonable level of flexibility.  Therefore they should not be in the form of the proposed building regulations we have on hands at the moment, which lay down very detailed technical requirements, but should be in a functional format.  The example I throw out for the Minister is that the building should be so constructed as to prevent the seepage of moisture from the outside to the inside.  This is a very simple, broad, general format with massive flexibility.  This type of functional requirement should be supported by an approved technical document which would set out the ways in which the requirement could be met.</P>
    <P>A criticism has been levelled at the Minister that he is taking away responsibility from local authorities for ensuring that buildings are properly constructed. Obviously, this claim has to be refuted, as the Bill is simply an enabling measure and it gives a wide range of powers and options in relation to the making and <Col N="175" /> administration of the building regulations. All the options are covered and there is no political ideology or otherwise affecting that Bill.  Far from diluting the protection available to the public or, indeed, lessening the involvement of the local authority, the Bill provides a framework whereby the existing situation can be improved on.  There is general agreement that the type of comprehensive building regulations provided for in the Bill ought to be made.  The area of contention obviously is the mechanism to be put in place to ensure the observance of these regulations.  In many ways it is hard to understand all the confusion and misconceptions which surround this Bill, particularly, section 6, which addresses the question of building control regulation.</P>
    <P>It is only proper to bring to mind that this Bill will establish a building control authority in every local authority area as opposed to the limited operation of by-laws at present.  Secondly, this authority will have substantial powers for inspection enforcement and, indeed, if that fails criminal prosecution can ensure.  Anything the Minister is trying to do under section 6 is additional to the powers that are already in existence.</P>
    <P>The question also arises which system provided for in the building control regulations should the Minister opt for?  In the report of the Stardust Tribunal, there is a very pertinent statement in paragraph 9.91.  It says:</P>
    <P>It is sufficient to say that, in the opinion of the Tribunal, its adoption in the area of fire safety [that is self-regulation] is clearly undesirable, although its merits in other areas of building control are clear.</P>
    <P>It is important for us to remember that when we talk about self-regulation we are now hearing that this tribunal came down heavily against the regulation with regard to fire safety but is quite specific in its support for self-regulation as it pertains to buildings themselves.  One of the attractions of the self-regulation concept is that it recognises that the primary <Col N="176" /> responsibility for a good standard of construction rests with the practitioners in the building industry.  It is important also to have a look at the building control regulation and see what we are trying to achieve.  In setting out the procedures to be followed we are trying to ensure that proper building standards are complied with and we must ensure that the primary responsibility remains where it should be, that is with the designers, the constructors and, indeed, the owners.</P>
    <P>That point, which is important, was raised by Senator Naughten, but I would go further and say that there should be absolutely no question of a local authority being given a role which would in any way be perceived as reducing the responsibility of those people.  This would be the perception, unfortunately, of an approval system.  If the local authority pass the plans, the designer then has the comfort of knowing that he does not have to shoulder all of the blame for the design itself that has been passed by the local authority.  The other objection to an approval system is that it creates delays, and we have much evidence of that.  In fact there is a very substantial backlog of work in the by-laws areas which cannot get started on because of the inability of the staff to handle the workload generated by what is now generally acknowledged as a booming economy.</P>
    <P>A system of self-regulation would do much to bring this responsibility home to industry.  A system whereby you submit plans to local authorities for approval tends to be expensive, and any costs that would be arrived at would, of necessity, have to be passed on to the public in one way or another.  It also tends to keep people at their desks rather than out front.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things that strike me about the Bill.  For instance, an inspectorate should be retained in a policing capacity to ensure that at the taking-in-charge stage proper standards are maintained.  That would also eliminate one of the factors that Senator Naughten raised, the rogue builder.  The Minister might look at that area with a view to <Col N="177" /> making improvements.  It is very important that the local authority are notified when buildings are to commence, so that the inspectorate would be in a position to carry out inspections at the various stages.  It is also obviously desirable to inspect foundations and sanitary connections are most important.</P>
    <P>I refer back to the ERU report which indicated that 44 per cent of planning approvals were not being complied with within the construction industry.  This is a further indication that the control mechanisms the Minister is now putting in place are badly needed.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House.  I hope the Minister can see his way to taking into account some of the recommendations I have made in relation to inspectorate and local authorities.  I again congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.  It is timely, desirable and will be effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, on behalf of the Labour Party, to welcome this Bill in principle.  What is being sought is the extension of a regulatory system for building construction control nationwide. That is a desirable principle.  As has been mentioned by Senator Naughten and Senator O'Keeffe the regulations, in terms of by-laws and local authority control, are succeeding in a limited way particularly in Dublin and its environs.</P>
      <P>I welcome Senator O'Keeffe's last remarks in respect of his proposals for an inspectorate and a notification system in the context of the construction, renovation or alternation of buildings, I also welcome his remarks on the findings of the environmental research unit which were published recently.  I hope that on Committee Stage we can get support for our amendments and that the Minister will be prepared to take them on board to tighten this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said we welcome this Bill in principle and I mentioned a particular principle.  I also welcome the extension in the area for the disabled and the imposition of very severe penalties.  The Bill, in practical terms, is very much the traditional perception of the curate's egg.  The tenor <Col N="178" /> of the Bill is to do the right thing but, in practice, it is not doing the right thing.  It is wide open; there are so many loopholes that &mdash; like the Derelict Sites Bill which had good intentions and principles &mdash; is not likely to affect anything in practice unless it is substantially amended.</P>
    <P>I want, particularly, to refer to the provisions in section 6.  The building regulations require that certain standards are maintained or established in relation to building structure, drainage, ventilation, fire prevention, etc.  The other major sections are sections 8 to 11 where the procedures or mechanisms for enforcing those regulations are dealt with.  That, of course, is where we find the Bill severely lacking.</P>
    <P>At present we have by-laws in Dublin city and we gave powers of inspection to the local authorities.  The power to inspect is being extended nationwide but the duty to do so is not.  While we are giving with one hand on a national basis, we are taking away with the other on the east coast, in Dublin in particular.  We require that the power be extended nationally and that the statutory duty and obligation on the relevant authority be also extended nationally.  We do not have that in this Bill.  That is particularly serious when the proposed method for regulation is the so called method of self-certification. Self-certification is one of those old hoary chestnuts that all of us would like to have &mdash; certification of taxes, certification of procedures of whatever description that concerns one individually etc., but everybody knows that unless there is an independent process for inspection, self-certification is wide open to abuse.  We know that the building and construction industry is full of cowboys.</P>
    <P>We hear every day about the mal-structures that have been built.  We already heard from Senator O'Keeffe, in relation to the Stardust disaster, about the quality of materials used in the construction of the building, the lack of standards, etc. One of the major reasons for this Bill is to ensure that does not happen again.</P>
    <P>We have seen the delay in getting this <Col N="179" /> Bill before the House which was introduced as a result of the Stardust Inquiry. They presented their report made in 1982 and the Bill went to the Dáil in 1984. Here we are in 1990, a new decade, and we still have not got it.  That indicates the extent to which the lobbying of the building industry is involved in this area.</P>
    <P>The extension of self-certification is not universal either.  It is not extended to all buildings.  It extends to institutions, to non-domestic buildings but, interestingly enough, one specific area of this category is exempted, namely, prisons and places of detention.  Why should there not be at least the appearance of some requirement to have a certificate supplied in relation to the construction, renovation or alteration of a prison or place of detention? Are we saying there is less concern for the lives, safety and health of the inmates of these institutions, who are also citizens of this State?  Surely there is no ground for exempting a particular non-domestic structure from whatever regulations are introduced, however weak they are?  We will be introducing an amendment in relation to that on Committee Stage.  There are whole areas exempted from the process of self-certification&mdash;domestic housing, extensions to domestic housing, alterations and temporary dwellings; even in that area there is no requirement.  It would seem that this legislation has more to do with the house building lobby &mdash; which want to eliminate controls and mechanisms on the planning process, the by-law process, and the local authorities inspections that were in existence hitherto and that still exist particularly in the Dublin area &mdash; than it has with standards of safety, health or regulation.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting with the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, the Irish Home Builders' Association expressed the annoyance of Members with the delays in the planning process.  In response, the Minister promised to have the new building control Bill passed by the Oireachtas by Christmas &mdash; this, of course, was last year.  This would exempt members from <Col N="180" /> inspection and by-law charges.  The purpose of the Bill is to exempt builders from inspection because while the powers are there, there is no statutory obligation. Instead home builders will be allowed to self certification in conformity with the new regulations.  That is a recipe for the cowboys to get loose again.  We all know that unless there is a mechanism built into the system, some people will abuse it.  There are good builders and there are bad builders.  There are good people in every industry and in every walk of life and there are bad people.  The Stardust disaster and the Raglan Road disaster are good examples of what we have to worry about here.  There are people in the building industry who are not going to impose that self-discipline to ensure their standards are of the highest order.  That is why we have a duty as legislators to ensure that the procedures and provisions are inserted in the legislation so that there is no scope for abuse.  Once there is scope for abuse that will be exploited.  That is where we are at the present time in relation to this legislation.  We are seen to accept the principle as a welcome development in terms of national regulation but we must ensure that we build in the practical protections.</P>
    <P>I will quote you one of the recommendations from the task force that was set up after the Raglan Road disaster in 1987.  The task force recommended that the Building Control Bill, which was before the Dáil at that time, &ldquo;should be enacted as soon as possible so that building regulations and an effective building control system could be put on a statutory basis.&rdquo;  That is the recommendation of the Government's inquiry which was established to ensure that another disaster of the magnitude that occurred in Raglan Road would not occur.  Where is the reference to the statutory duty or responsibility of the control authority in this Bill?  I should hope that the Minister, when we deal with it on Committee Stage, would be prepared to take on board amendments in relation to that as well.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to quote from the <Col N="181" /> same inquiry recommendations in relation to a certification system.  &ldquo;It is recognised that implementation of building regulations is of little value unless they can be effectively enforced.&rdquo; Only authority with teeth can effectively enforce regulations.  That again is what we are talking about.  Further, the effectiveness of the system is dependent on a high level of technical competence and professional responsibility among those certifying.  It would need a high degree of policing to support certifiers in carrying out their duties diligently.</P>
    <P>The British Government under Margaret Thatcher considered this matter.  They looked into the question of self-certification.  The Attorney General dismissed it as being legal nonsense.  It was dropped in Britain because it simply is not a practical method of a certification and enforcement.  If any form of monitoring is to be effective, as referred to in the report of the task force on multistorey buildings &mdash; the Raglan Road report &mdash; then there is need for technical competence and the resources.  Who and what are going to have the resources?  What resources are going to be made available to check up on self-certification that is an abuse of the system?  The local authorities at the present time are not able to carry out their statutory duties at the moment because they are so totally underfunded, both in terms of the embargo of staff that has been imposed since 1987 and in relation to the total lack of funding.  The Fianna Fáil Government are largely responsible for this lack of funding after their abolition of the rates in 1977, despite their promise to produce an alternative method of funding.  It has systematically allowed the Exchequer funding that had been granted over the years to diminish proportionately so that the local authorities are devoid of adequate resources to have any sort of effective enforcement mechanism or authority at the present time.</P>
    <P>What is the sense in saying that we have an enforcement mechanism if the resources and the staffing are not made available?  Can we get some commitment in relation to this Bill and, likewise, in <Col N="182" /> relation to the Derelict Sites Bill, where again you have a whole area of monitoring that needs to be done?  The resources should be provided to the statutory authority to enable them to do it. Could we ask that the Government lift the embargo on recruitment in the public sector?</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that we will on Committee Stage be introducing what we would regard as very substantial and essential amendments to this legislation. We are satisfied only with the principle of the legislation.  We are not satisfied with the provisions that have been written into the Bill to provide for the regulations themselves and the mechanisms for enforcement of those regulations.</P>

I am afraid he is in the hot seat today, but I cannot comment favourably on the quality of this legislation.  As I think was hinted by my immediate predecessor in contributions to this debate, there is now appearing a pattern in environmental legislation that I can only describe as a facade job.  There is a lot of cosmetic legislation going on.  It is highly dangerous. There is legislation which purports to do one thing in the title of the Bill and quite clearly and demonstrably does the opposite.  This is, perhaps, one of the most significant examples to date.  The Front Bench on the Government side can smile as much as they like and nod knowingly, but they are out of touch with reality as perceived on the ground by the plain people of Ireland for whom they at <Col N="183" /> one time vaunted themselves as being their principal spokespersons.</P>

      <P>I stand corrected, Chairperson, for my discourtesy to you.  I should have addressed the Chair.  I am sure that the learned gentleman on the other side also feels similarly chastened. It is important that we observe the courtesies, even when we are dealing with a situation that is clearly scandalous, as this is.  I am not talking just about the plain people.  The plain people may not have yet woken up to what is afoot.  Every single major professional body in this country has woken up to it.  There are detailed analyses in existence of this Bill and its gross defects.  Basically, what we are talking about here is deregulation. Does anybody think that the deregulation of the building industry is actually a good thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to really cut out effective by-laws approvals.  We are going to cut out the whole system of checks and balances by which the building industry is monitored.  I know that from the point of view of the Government party there is a special reference for the building industry. They have always &mdash; in my opinion mistakenly &mdash; regarded it as the single principal engine of economic recovery.  I have always felt that that was a shortsighted and dangerous view from a financial point, but they are entitled to that view.  What they are not entitled to <Col N="184" /> do is to place in jeopardy the single largest investment of each family or individual in this country.  This is what is happening, because the purchase of a home, which will now no longer be subject to effective proper and professional standards and controls, is the single largest investment for most individuals.  It is being rendered vulnerable by this Bill.  I see the Minister, who is a decent man, shaking his head.  May I just read on to the record some of the headlines from a variety of newspapers of all potential persuasions that have emerged in the last while.  For example, <i>The Evening Herald</i> of 12 December 1989 set a headline as follows: Building safety is threatened by Bill&rdquo;, <i>The Sunday Independent:</i>&ldquo;Gas disaster: Government ignores key reports&rdquo;; <i>The Irish Times:</i>&ldquo;Refusal to amend Bill criticised&rdquo;; <i>The Sunday Tribune:</i>&ldquo;Home owners face `horrendous consequences' from new Bill&rdquo;; <i>The Irish Independent:</i>&ldquo;Self-policed builders' standards `worthless&rdquo;'; <i>The Star</i>, more colourfully perhaps but equally accurately &mdash; these are all around about the early weeks of December 1989: &ldquo;Cowbody Builders to Clean Up&rdquo;; <i>The Sunday Business Post:</i>&ldquo;Building bill could lead to fresh disaster&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I can make this available for the Official Report.  Will that be satisfactory? <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, 12 December 1989 set a headline: &ldquo;Critics say Bill will loosen building codes&rdquo;.  I could go on.  There are more.  In other words the universal feeling among (a) the professional bodies concerned and (b) of responsible journalists engaged in analysing and criticising this particular area of the environment and environmental legislation, is one of unanimous opposition to what is happening.  I wonder will the Minister be able to give us an undertaking that he will accept amendments seeking to put teeth back into this legislation. I understood that Fianna Fáil &mdash; and I say this as an Independent who is <Col N="185" /> not particularly committed to any party at all and I am certainly not committed to attacking Fianna Fáil &mdash; was the party of the small person.  It is very important that they should maintain that role.  It appears from the legislation here that they are the party of exploitative cowboy capitalism.  I have to say that, because what is being opened up is a road towards exploitation.  I would just make the point that the Minister in his speech has indicated where the proper areas of concern are.  He says the purpose of the Bill is to provide a revised framework for the making and administration of building regulations.  At present the power to make building regulations is contained in section 86 of the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1963. The purposes for which regulations may be made under the Act relate to matters of public health and safety.  Could the Minister explain precisely what he is doing about public health and safety in this legislation?  I cannot see it.  The situation after the passage of this Bill will be significantly worse.  I really must be fair to the Minister because he is such a decent man and he comes from a very good part of the country that I know well. It behoves me to be fair to him.  The situation at the moment is not uniform. About seven local authorities, including the principal cities &mdash; the one I am most in contact with is Dublin &mdash; are all empowered and required to monitor the building regulations.  By-laws and so on are in existence at the moment.  This is not uniform around the country.  Unfortunately, what the Minister has decided to do is to equalise everybody downward, if we can contemplate such a thing.  In other words, because the standards of policing are not uniform, what the Minister is actually doing is putting everybody on the worst possible footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister subsequently refers to the welfare &mdash; not just public health and safety &mdash; of persons in or about buildings. I would like to ask the Minister some questions.  First, to what extent were the findings of two very significant reports taken into consideration?  I speak, of course, first of all the Cremer and Warner <Col N="186" /> report which was completed in the aftermath of the Raglan House disaster.  I remember the debate that took place in this House at that time.  I remember a number of us pointing out the dangers and looking to properly policed regulations. I remember also the report of the Government Task Force that came in sometime after the Cramer and Warner report.  The conclusions of these two reports have been quite clearly ignored by the Minister in this Bill.  I would like to quote, for example, first of all from the Cramer and Warner report on the Raglan House explosion which took place on New Year's Day 1987 and which recommended &mdash; and I am quoting directly from the report:</P>
    <P>That local authorities should be provided with the resources to monitor any self-certification system that new legislation may introduce.</P>
    <P>thereby providing a deterrent against inferior building practices.  Why is this being ignored?  Why is nothing being done here?  The Government Task Force on Multistorey Buildings which was set up in the immediate aftermath of the same explosion, came to a similar conclusion. The effectiveness of any self-certification system would need a high degree of policing.  May I ask the Minister why we do not have some reasonable system of policing?  There must, in fact, be standards.  There are no such standards. Certainly, there are no standards that are clear to me.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that basically what he is doing is deregulating all existing building controls in the major urban areas.  The only replacement will be a nationwide system of self-regulation by the building industry.  Far be it from me to be cynical.  I know the Minister accepts that I am a humble, naive person wishing to believe the best of everybody, including the persons in this House and even in the building industry.  I have had many connections with the building industry but would any person visiting this island from Mars really swallow the notion that the building industry is the <Col N="187" /> best policeman of its own practices?  I doubt it.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has really had any engagement with the building industry would wonder.  Has the Minister looked around the city of Dublin at the number of estates that were left unfinished?  Was the Minister watching the <i>Today Tonight</i> programme about the collapse of the Gallagher empire?  There have been a number of serious major scandals involving the building industry, and yet the Minister is suggesting that the appropriate people to police building regulations are the building industry themselves. &ldquo;I will be judge, I will be jury, said cunning old Furey.  I will try the whole case, and condemn you to death&rdquo;.  What are we condemning?  It may not be death.  It could be death.  It was in the case of Raglan House.  It could be simply defective roofing, defective insulation, defective wiring or defective sewerage.  Why is this being allowed?</P>
    <P>I have to point out to the Minister &mdash; and I am sure he is aware of it &mdash; that the system of building controls that the Minister is proposing does not exist anywhere else in the European Community. It is simply unheard of.  All European Community countries, with the exception of France and Belgium, operate local authority control.  Could the Minister explain why is Ireland so different?  What is there unique about Ireland?  Is it the unique honesty of the building industry? Is the Minister paying a special tribute, an unusual accolade, to members of the building industry?  We do not need this. In so doing why does he so consistently ignore the advice he is receiving from civil servants, the professional bodies and from the staff in the local authorities who have consistently advised against this?  In France and Belgium the responsibility rests with the designer and builder, who must give an insurance-backed guarantee against defects.  The Thatcher Government toyed with the idea of scrapping their building control system in favour of self-certification.</P>
    <P>I was not here for all of the contribution of my distinguished colleague, Senator <Col N="188" /> Costello, but I gather that he, in fact, has already placed on the record the fact that they were given legal advice which made it clear that, in the words of the British Attorney General, such a system would be a legal nonsense.  I said in this House, last week or the week before, that the phrase &ldquo;The Irish Secret Service&rdquo; was a contradiction in terms, as was &ldquo;British intelligence&rdquo;.  Obviously, the Minister has a higher estimation of British intelligence than I do, because he is prepared to accept something that even the British regard as a legal nonsense, as being acceptable for the Irish people.  In other words, are we basically being confronted with the usual Irish solution to an Irish problem?</P>
    <P>The Minister's basic intentions, and they were perfectly clear, is first to introduce &mdash; at least that is what he says he is trying to do &mdash; building regulations applying to all buildings.  Secondly, to have housing &mdash; and that is houses, house extensions and alterations &mdash; exempt from building control regulations. Thirdly, his intentions are to have non-domestic construction subject to a system of building control based on self-certification Finally, he intends to ensure that local authorities have little involvement in building control apart from registration of certificates.</P>
    <P>Again, there is much there that is really indefensible.  I honestly cannot understand how the Minister can seek to defend this kind of thing in respect of houses and house extensions.  They are the very thing that throughout our cities are a commonplace of the building industry.  These are now to be largely unprotected.  I may appear to be attacking the building industry and regarding it in a certain sceptical light.  I have to say that I am sure 85 to 90 per cent of the building industry is perfectly reputable and perfectly decent. The building industry themselves will tell you that there is a 10 per cent core of what <i>The Star</i> colourfully calls &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo;. Who is going to police them?  I very much doubt if the 90 per cent of the building industry that is reasonably responsible is going to be too thrilled with the notion that they are all now, thanks <Col N="189" /> to the Minister, going to be tarred with the same brush &mdash; and, believe you me, they are.</P>
    <P>It is also very important to look at the mass of defects that the Bill contains.  The last thing I mentioned was that there is little involvement of local authorities except for this business of the registration of certificates.  The Bill does not even impose a statutory duty on the local authorities to check that the contents of the certificates are correct.  They are not even checking the certificates.  I beg your pardon, Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for your guidance. I will try to keep to broad principles. I think that is a principle really.  It is a principle of policing a regulation.  It really does seem to me to be quite idiotic that we are down to a situation where they say, &ldquo;Oh, well, we will keep a register of certificates&rdquo; and they do not even validate the certificates.  What precisely is the point of that, except some curious appetite somewhere for paperwork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Building control legislation ought to provide protection for the health and safety of the public, including the persons who are building.  On this I agree with the Minister.  Private housing is a sector of the construction industry that affects the widest spectrum of the population &mdash; virtually everybody.  Again, I have to return to this.  The Minister really appears <Col N="190" /> in a perverse way to suggest that we are a unique population.  I would like to know in what way are we unique?  He is introducing a system here that is unique in Europe, as I have demonstrated incontrovertibly. There is, of course, one way in which we are unique and that is because we have such an extraordinarily high demand for private accommodation and for owned residential occupation. This is a characteristic of the Irish people &mdash; the desire to have their own little house in the suburbs or even these things that people like Frank McDonald and myself have campaigned against, the bungalow bliss.  It is bad enough to have bungalow bliss spreading like architectural acne all over the face of the island, but are the unfortunate people who live in these places not even to be protected from their own bad taste?  Are they now not to be protected from the inefficient professional practice of the building trade as well?  We have something that is not only aesthetically disgusting but positively dangerous.</P>
    <P>This home ownership area is also the sector where inadequate design and poor construction are most prevalent.  The Minister, I am sure, knows this.  If problems occur they are likely to be extremely expensive for the individuals concerned. In my opening remarks I instanced a few of them.  The drainage going wrong or the roofing going wrong are constant fears of houseowners.  They fear that they are going to have some structural problem with regard to roofs.  I know this.  I have to accept that the Government were amenable in this.  They graciously accepted amendments I put down on the budget previous to this immediate one to provide some kind of assistance in financing the rehabilitation of buildings in the inner city.  I am very glad.  I welcome that, because I believe in giving praise where praise is due.  The Minister for Finance accepted my argument that this grant system should be frontloaded in the first year in order to allow people to do necessary work on the roofs, because roofs are the most vulnerable point.  They are the most dangerous element in terms of defects and so on.  They are the most <Col N="191" /> expensive.  Here we have a situation where there is really no policing.  I believe that there is an essential element here of consumer protection.</P>
    <P>I wonder more and more when I hear the Taoiseach, for whom I have immense respect &mdash; unbelievable respect, grotesque respect, bizarre respect &mdash; speaking about a Green Presidency.  Who is green in this Presidency?  Is it the country that is green?  Is there an assumption that the inhabitants are green and that they are so green that they are going to accept this Bill, for example?  I hope that is not a sinister and unworthy interpretation of the Green Presidency.  The Minister said in the Dáil in regard to housing in reply to Deputy Gilmore of a certain party &mdash; unrepresented in this august Chamber &mdash; that there are already controls in place on most houses by way of the structural guarantee scheme.  He said that there are certain controls in place in so far as the payments of house grants are concerned and that Department inspectors carry out inspections before grants are paid.  He feels, therefore, there are sufficient safeguards in place in that area.  I wonder is the Minister happy with that?</P>
    <P>There has been an opportunity for reflection.  Is that all that is necessary? Inspections for grants?  Are we expected to take seriously, that that is all the public needs to protect itself?  The guarantee scheme, as the Minister knows, only covers the structure and does not apply to other important areas, some of which I have mentioned, such as drainage, ventilation and so on.  The guarantee is only valid for six years and inspections by the Department inspectors are very limited and carried out only as long as there are grants.  The whole question of grants is a political question.  The Government could withdraw grants tomorrow if they felt like it &mdash; in other words, it is at the arbitrary discretion of the Government to remove the flimsy protection that exists for the consumer.  Where in its Green Presidency is the respect for the rights of the consumer?</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Minister one of the proposed amendments <Col N="192" /> to the Bill, an amendment that has the full support of all the Opposition parties, the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, the Institute of Engineers of Ireland, the ITGWU and the engineers, building surveyors and inspectors working in building control.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>Building control authorities should carry out such checks of certificates and documents lodged and work in progress and completed buildings, as they consider necessary to satisfactorily monitor the effectiveness of the control system in their area.</P>
    <P>For one element, and one element alone, in that amendment I apologise.  I would like humbly to apologise to the Minister for the split infinitive.  It should of course read: &ldquo;to monitor satisfactorily the effectiveness of the control system in their area&rdquo;.  But for nothing else am I prepared to apologise, for nothing else that occurs in this amendment.  It is vital that this amendment, which puts a statutory duty on the building control authority, be added to the Bill.  The Minister objected to this amendment in the Dáil but gave a commitment to reconsider it prior to Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to press this.  The Minister may of course be aware that I am relying fairly heavily on a document from one of the principal unions involved.  I make no apology for that, because I think it is very important that the information that comes from a professional and technical section of society that is particularly engaged in this area should be listened to.  May I point out to the Minister as well on this, that not one but a number of the newspaper reports make the point that it is up to Seanad Éireann to amend this legislation.  I believe that we would like, and we would welcome, and we request an undertaking from the Minister that this Bill will not be gazumped through the House today, that there will be an opportunity for considering amendments. Thank you very much, Minister. I know the Minister is a reasonable man. I hope this will be possible and that those of us who wish to put down amendments will be facilitated in this manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> The Minister stated in the Dáil that it was not necessary to impose a statutory duty on the building control authorities in relation to the monitoring of building control.  He also stated that there was an implied duty in the Bill on building control authorities and that &ldquo;as responsible bodies, they will act accordingly&rdquo;.  I honestly find again considerable difficulty here because legislation deals with reality; legislation deals with imposing requirements.  It does not really deal with implied duties.  I would like the Minister to take some advice from his colleagues. I see that he has three gladiators with him so he is more than equipped to deal with a simple individual like myself.</P>
    <P>What is the point of a phrase like &ldquo;implied duty&rdquo; in legislation?  Is it actually the function of legislation to deal with &ldquo;implied duties&rdquo;.  Would the Minister not agree that it is the function of legislation to place those obligations, those duties, in a legal context which is beyond the very dubious and grey area of implication?  If there is an implied duty in legislation then there is an implied right of an individual, presumably, to apply to the court for satisfaction if a building is proved to be defective.  I assume that is the intention, but do implications stand up in court?  Is it not highly likely that, if there was a court case on the basis of this kind of wording or intention, a judge would say: &ldquo;Well, I am sorry.  I am not dealing in implications.  It is the responsibility of legislators to spell out clearly and unambiguously, and without relying upon implication, precisely what the intention of the Bill may be&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The experience we have had with the Multistorey Buildings Act has shown that that business of implied duty and being able to rely on the goodwill of the building industry and so on, is not the case and that, unless there is a statutory duty imposed, there can be no guarantee that hard-pressed authorities will carry out adequate and effective monitoring. Here again we have a clear conflict between what the Minister is talking about.  The Minister is too generous.  He is too decent and he is too good hearted. He is relying on goodwill.  He is relying <Col N="194" /> on the integrity of the building industry.  I do not want to damn the building industry completely, but I do not think it is the function of legislation simply to rely on goodwill and good intentions.  It is to lay down standards which must not be breached, and the Minister has signally failed to do this.</P>
    <P>Can I point out the historical context &mdash; again I have to apologise if this has been previously adverted to; I am not aware of the full debate?  It must be rather galling to the Minister if he has heard all these points before.  I am just not aware. I really do not want to repeat anything that has been said.  The Minister probably knows anyway whether he has been told it this afternoon or not.  But for well over 100 years, for 111 years in fact, county councils up and down the country have had the same powers as Dublin city and county to enact building by-laws, but only seven did.  I indicated earlier that there was an uneven spread of building practice, and one of the reasons is that the local authorities did not bother to enact by-laws.  How then can the Minister rely on this nebulous area of good practice? We are not in an area where we can deal with pious aspirations.  We have got to deal with the hard facts.</P>
    <P>A lot of this material surfaced and became critical &mdash; I mean critical in the sense of being vitally important &mdash; in the aftermath of the Raglan House explosion.  The report which I have already mentioned &mdash; the report of the Government's own task force &mdash; dealt with the concept of building control and made the points that building regulations are of no value unless they can be demonstrated to be capable of proper policing. The Minister envisaged in the legislation certain situations where buildings could be exempted from all controls. This is something beyond the imaginings even of the Government task force report and of the Cramer and Warner report.  The task force report says with regard to the certification system that &ldquo;the effectiveness of the system is dependent on a high level of technical competence and professional responsibility among those certifying and would <Col N="195" /> need a high degree of policing to support certifers in carrying out their duties diligently.&rdquo; There is no sense of wishful thinking or implied responsibilities or pious aspirations about the intention of the building industry.  They are talking about policing.  When you mention policing you are talking about potential defaulters.  So, at least the authors of the Government's own report are not as starry-eyed as the Minister.  In fact, the recommendation of the task force was quite unambiguous.  I will read it into the record, because it says:</P>
    <P>The Task Force recommends that the Building Control Bill should be enacted so that building regulations and an effective buildings control system can be put on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister sustain the argument that what he is doing is placing building control on a statutory basis in the face of the assertion I have made here this afternoon that what he is actually doing, what he is embarking on, is the massive deregulation of the building industry?</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Minister in his Bill is allowing for certification, about which I have expressed already some considerable doubts, without legal provision for insurance.  I am advised that this is not in the public interest.  It is essential that the public is protected with the requirement in the legislation that the certifiers have adequate insurance cover. There is no such provision in the Bill.  It is analogous to what we all witnessed last night in the &ldquo;Today Tonight Special&rdquo;&mdash; vulnerable members of the public and their savings being exposed by a situation which purports to protect them but does not protect them.  In other words, what we are dealing with is a facade and a sham.  We have these monopoly money certificates being waved around with nothing to back them.  Where is the money at the end of the day?  Where is the actual cover for the individual in financial terms?  It is not clear to me that it exists in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I would like to address.  There will be regulations <Col N="196" /> coming in &mdash; I think &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; is the right word &mdash; that are not contained in the Bill.  I am sure the Minister will understand what I am talking about.  It is rather like the Restaurant Bill.  There was the whole system of regulations that was to be introduced by the Minister subsequently and the only power the Oireachtas had was either to accept or reject the regulations.  We did not have any power to tinker with them.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am a very simple person.  I believe that this is the same situation here, that we will have the possibility of the introduction of a whole rake of regulations and we will have wonderful privilege either of accepting or rejecting. We will not be able to amend or tinker with the regulations.  That worries me.  I could be wrong on this, but perhaps the Minister would be able to give me a definitive answer on this.</P>
    <P>I will end on this because there are more people queueing up.  I am sure the Minister wishes to have a very full debate on this Bill.  If I am correct in reading the gestures of my distinguished University colleague here, we are going to have a contribution from another Senator who has had a very remarkable record in defending the interests of the public in these and allied areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by saying that the Minister has a problem in this Bill of what I would call facade legislation, that purports to do one thing and not only does not do it but creates a dangerous situation.  There is problem with public perception and there is absolutely no doubt that the people of Ireland have perceived a fraud here.  I refer the Minister to the headlines.  It is a fraud that has implications for the safety and for the financial well-being of all the citizens of the State.  It does not give me any great joy to read in the newspapers comments like this from the <i>Evening Herald</i> of Tuesday, 12 December 1989:</P>
    <P>Cowboy contractors will be free to erect dangerously unsafe buildings unchecked if the Building Control Bill is passed by the Dáil tomorrow. Serious loss of life from collapsing <Col N="197" /> office blocks or flats could follow soon after, according to professional organisations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This was drawn to my attention previously and I believe I did mention it. These professional bodies are most concerned at the self-certification aspect of the Bill.  I think the Minister has quite a lot in hand in attempting to satisfy not only this House but the public that what he is doing is not dangerous and inimical to the public interest, and he certainly has failed to do it in his introductory speech.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister.  He was put into bat on a very sticky wicket. Governments frequently put in a decent and honourable person to bat on a sticky wicket so that the honourableness of the person in the hot seat may rub off in some kind of osmotic sense on the shabby legislation he is compelled by Governmental responsibility to introduce.  The Minister has my deepest sympathy.  It is disgraceful legislation.  I hope that he will take the opportunity of amending it in the interests of his own honour, of the Government's reputation and of the well-being of the citizens of the country.</P>

      <P>I do hold the Minister in high regard.  I want to say only a few brief things.  First, I do not believe everything I read in the newspapers.  That is no reflection on the newspapers, but newspapers and headlines are there to sell newspapers and I think it might be described as a slightly exaggerated headline. However, having said that, there <Col N="198" /> are certain reservations which I have about this Bill.</P>
      <P>The whole area of by-laws in my experience on Dublin City Council for 15 years has been rather an unsatisfactory one, to say the least of it, in a number of areas.  Quite frankly, as things are at the present in the by-laws section it is not really possible for there to be any effective enforcement.  The total penalty is something like a shilling, which is 5p, something of that order.  If, as a public representative, you run up against by-law infringements there is really very little that can be done about it.  One relies on the hope that the developer will run into difficulties selling the building or whatever.  That seems in recent years to have been the most effective way of, so to speak, enforcing the by-laws.</P>

    <P>This legislation is long overdue, and I regret that it has taken so long to get it here.  Having got it here, I think it is important, as previous speakers have said, that we do get it right.  The whole area of by-laws and what is contained in this Bill is, on the note on which Senator Norris finished, for the protection of the public and for their safety.  We have had some very unfortunate incidents which have been mentioned by other speakers and which I will not go back over.  It is for that reason I think that we need in this House to look very carefully at this legislation and to ensure that it is going to be an improvement on what has happened up to date rather than being a step backwards.  From some figures released in the last couple of days with regard to the lack of respect for building by-laws and building permissions, one can say the same thing applies here in the whole area of building by-laws.  I do not think we would want to be relying too much on the goodwill that is out there.  We want to be in a strong position to ensure that this legislation is effective and that we will be in a position to implement it. Indeed, the whole area of the by-laws in Dublin Corporation has been, as everybody sadly knows, shrouded with a certain number of question marks.  I will not say any more than that.  We hope that the problems they are experiencing are <Col N="199" /> being dealt with by the appropriate authorities so that the whole situation will be cleaned up.</P>
    <P>I think the main point which I, like other speakers, am worried about is the question of self-certification and whether that is going to be satisfactory, whether it is reasonable to expect those people who are involved in building, design and in all stages to give undertakings that the buildings which they have constructed are reasonable.  I do not think that it is in any shape or form any slur on the architectural profession or the engineering profession or, indeed, on any builders or developers.  But I think we all know that there are gangsters in every profession and in every walk of life. Those are the people &mdash; it is not for the vast number of people who are law-abiding and who would do the right thing &mdash; we are here to legislate for those who, unfortunately, need to be brought to heel, so to speak.  So, I would like to have more reassurance &mdash; and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in his reply &mdash; that the whole area of self-certification is going to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>With regard also to the penalties, they sound very large &mdash; £10,000 &mdash; but when you look at £150 per day, that is not very much for somebody who has probably put up a very large building.  I always feel that the only real deterrent in these instances is the threat of a jail sentence. I know it is in the Bill &mdash; six months and two years.  But, of course, they are never enforced.  Who here can remember anybody being sent to jail for the most flagrant and blatant contraventions of planning laws?  This is one of the subjects in which I am most interested, yet I cannot think at this moment of anybody who ever went to jail in that connection. So, what we are back to is what the courts are going to implement.  We are talking about the fines, and I wonder are those really adequate?  My concern is for the home buyers, for the people working in office blocks, the people out in the street and the people in public buildings to feel assured that they are going to be protected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> There is one detail I would mention here and I wonder to what extent it can be remedied under this legislation.  To my certain knowledge, as somebody who has been interested in conservation and preservation of buildings, there has been a great difficulty for the owners or people who wish to conserve old buildings but they want to adapt them for a new use. Take perhaps, for example, Mercer's Hospital, not so far from here, which is being adapted for a new and I think probably quite satisfactory purpose. They find themselves in the hands of the by-law people, and particularly the fire authorities, who are totally unsympathetic to the problems of old buildings.  I believe that is something which must be looked at.</P>
    <P>A very particular example is the house next to the Royal Dublin Hotel in O'Connell Street.  This was a building in respect of which, interestingly enough, permission to be demolished was given and permission was then given to put up a new extension to the hotel.  But the proprietors very wisely decided that they had a valuable asset &mdash; it is the last remaining house in O'Connell Street &mdash; and they decided to keep it.  There is a magnificent Palladian doorway in it &mdash; a centre door and two windows down at either side. When they came back into the corporation looking for permission &mdash; to our great joy &mdash; to retain the building, the fire officer said that the door would have to be enlarged so that people could rush out onto the street.  I fully respect the fire officers and their concern for fire safety &mdash; that is their job &mdash; but they must have some regard for old buildings.  That is an area of this legislation which I hope will be considered.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that, by and large, it is a good Bill and I welcome it. However, I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</P>

      <P>I want to thank all the Senators who spoke this afternoon on the Bill.  I listened with great interest to the many comments they had to make.  I want to say at the outset that <Col N="201" /> when the Bill comes before the House on Committee Stage we will have a better opportunity then to tease it out in detail and have an exchange of views on how we see the position.  I have been criticised for possibly not bringing more Bills before the House, but remember we have four Bills now before Parliament: we have the Planning Compensation Bill, the Water Pollution Bill, the Derelict Sites Bill and the Building Control Bill. We are also in the course of the preparation of other Bills which will be coming before the House also.  There was never so much work going on both in the Custom House and in O'Connell Bridge House.  I want to put that on record with regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my opening contribution, the Bill is an enabling one, which is intended to provide a suitable and flexible framework for introducing a system of building regulations and building controls.  It includes a wide range of powers and presents a number of options to the Minister.  Having listened to the contributions to the debate here today, I think there is general agreement that the building regulations provided for in the Bill ought to be made and that they should be made as early as we possibly can.  This also seems to be the general view of all the parties involved in the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had wide-ranging submissions, as I stated in my opening remarks, with over 500 persons and organisations included. It is hard to please everyone in legislation, as you all know, but I want to make it clear that under the Planning Acts now you have to comply with the planning regulations of the local authority concerned and it is then a matter for that local authority if the person or company or whoever is the developer does not comply.  Even if you are putting on an extension to your house you have to show the existing house and you have to show the extension you are building on or wherever the modifications are.  As I know, in my own area in the midlands, there is then an inspection by the planning officer or his assistant and they will decide on the type of development and <Col N="202" /> rule accordingly.  On the positive side, conditions will be attached to your planning permission from the planning authority telling you what you have to do and comply with.</P>
    <P>Say, for instance, you were going to purchase a secondhand house in any part of the country.  As far as I know, no financial institution will give you a loan unless the house is in a satisfactory condition. If it is a local authority house they have their engineers and architects and if it is a financial institution, such as building societies or banks, they have the personnel to examine the house.  If I was advising a constituent or anybody else, I would say that he or she should get a certificate from a competent architect or consulting engineer in the construction industry.  We have an excellent number of architects and engineers around who are very competent.  He can get a certificate stating the condition of the building and when that person makes up his mind whether he wishes to pursue the matter, and if there are defects in the building, he can ask to have them rectified.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten raised the question of self-certification.  This is only one of the options in section 6 for building control and it has not yet been decided which option will be taken.  However, in relation to the question raised by Senator Naughten I suggest that there should be no cost implications for the industry in a self-certification system.  The person who designs a building is responsible for that design and the person who builds it is responsible for his work.  It is not too much to ask these people to certify that they have complied with the building regulations.  With regard to monitoring, the Bill gives building control authorities powers to inspect works and buildings and to take appropriate enforcement action.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten asked about insurance implications.  I do not see how there can be a problem since the responsibilities of the various people involved will not change in any basic way.  The change there will be a set of statutory building <Col N="203" /> regulations which will apply across the country.  This will make it easier to be sure that they are operating to clear standards. The Senator asked how this will operate throughout the country.  With regard to housing estates, I agree with some speakers that they have been left in a deplorable and shabby state.  The local authority will have to take action and they have the necessary powers to do that.</P>
    <P>The question of cost to the industry was raised.  One of the criticisms of the provisions of the 1963 Planning Act was that they were too rigid, they would cause delays in getting construction projects under way and they would add to costs. The wide options and flexible nature of the Bill are designed to allow for more flexible systems while at the same time giving adequate protection.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe made a very favourable contribution to the Bill.  He made a number of constructive suggestions in regard to the building regulations and the building control systems.  I assure him that they will be taken into account.  The Bill which we are now debating was the product of the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition in 1984 and the basic principles were developed by them, not by this side of the House.  Since 1984 there has been an enormous amount of debate on this subject.  Many views have been put forward by all concerned.  I hope we will have this Bill through the House shortly.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello wondered why the Bill exempts prisons and places of detention. This is necessary on grounds of security.  There is no intention that prisons would be substandard but there are many aspects of the regulations which would not be suitable to apply to prisons. For example, we could not have the standard fire escape provisions applying to prisons.  Senators can be assured that prisons will be built to a very high standard and all the necessary precautions will be taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris does not seem to have read the Bill too well.  He speaks of deregulation but the Bill provides for the introduction of building regulations on a <Col N="204" /> national basis whereas at the moment there is no control of building standards in most of the country.  The present approval system in the by-law area relates to examining plans.  The inspection function is the same now as it will be when this Bill is passed.  The local authorities have discretionary power of inspection at the moment and they will have similar power under sections 8, 11 and 17 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Norris referred to rogue builders.  The great majority of builders are reputable and do excellent work.  The Bill will provide the power to the building control authorities to go after the small number of rogue builders.  New homes are covered by the National Housebuilding Guarantee Scheme and they will continue to be inspected under that scheme.  I would need to be convinced that duplication of this work is desirable.</P>
    <P>How have the people of Roscommon, Offaly and Wexford managed up to now without any by-laws?  According to Senator Norris the whole country should have fallen down.  I am glad that that is not the situation as I know it.  With regard to the counties I have mentioned it could be said in regard to the building and development work that has taken place in those counties and in many more counties outside the capital, that our local authorities have performed very responsibility with the elected members of the local authorities.  That is great credit to them.</P>
    <P>Apart from this Bill we have the guarantee scheme for new housing.  The financial institutions now demand that and before they give out the loan they do a final inspection of the house.  As far as I know in many housing schemes now that are being privately erected the local authority where that building is taking place have to be bonded or given financial guarantees with regard to the completion of these estates.  I have no time for any developer who would come in to any part of this country, do shabby work, disobey regulations, especially under the Planning Act, and leave estates in a shabby way so that the local authority has to pick <Col N="205" /> up the tab and subsequently ask the DOE to do that.  I would not allow that.  I wish to put on the record that all the local authorities should keep a very close watch where private development takes place and see that all the regulations are being complied with as set down in the planning permission.  On Committee Stage I will go into it in more detail.  I will be as co-operative as I possibly can. We will discuss the various matters that has been raised, but I have no doubt that it is the wish of all Members in this House that we enact the best Bill possible.  I thank all the Members for their contributions and their co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the Seanad and to say that I do not propose engaging in what has become the national pastime, O'Hanlon-bashing. I understand some of the difficulties and constraints under which he operates, but this is a very particular problem which I sought to raise at a time when it was immediately critical and featuring in the newspapers.  It was brought to my attention by the fact that the Provost of the university I have the honour to represent in the Seanad felt constrained to resign as a result of the cutbacks in funding to the Health Research Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Research Board was established by the Minister for Health under Statutory Instrument 279/86 and commenced operations on 1 January 1987. This new health research board evolved <Col N="206" /> from a merger of the former Medico-Social Research Board, which was established in 1965, and the Medical Research Council of Ireland (MRC), which was established in 1937.  At the inaugural meeting of the HRB on 7 January 1987 the then Minister for Health, the then Deputy Barry Desmond, pledged that the level of funding for the new board would not be diminished and that, in view of the wide responsibilities being assigned to the board, additional funding would be sought to support its activities.  That is the premise on which I am basing my argument.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the chairman of this new board was, in fact, Professor Watts.  He had a difficult job.  He had the job of uniting two previously separate strands.  In his difficult job he was given an undertaking, that undertaking, admittedly, having been given by a member of a previous Government.  I do, however believe that the present Minister for Health is at least morally bound to continue the commitments that were given.  Indeed, in the letter &mdash; sections of which I propose to read into the record &mdash; from Professor Watts where he tendered his resignation from this board he indicated that he felt the discussions conducted with officials of the Minister's Department had taken place in what he described as a &ldquo;creative atmosphere&rdquo;.  He clearly felt that some degree of indication was given to him that there would be additional funding for this very important venture.  In this he was disappointed.</P>
    <P>Basically, I have to ask the Minister today the usual question in adjournment debates of this kind.  Is it not possible, even at this stage, to find money for this very important purpose?  I accept that the Minister is in the situation that he has got to prioritise, and prioritise in quite a drastic situation, and that his Department bears the brunt of quite a lot of the cuts.  But I hope to be able to demonstrate that this is an area where some indication of movement by the Government would be welcomed by the academic community, by the medical community and <Col N="207" /> by the general community, who are well served by the programme of the board.</P>
    <P>I want to place on the record the facts of the situation.  In 1987 the budget allocation was £2.3 million.  In 1988 this was maintained at £2.3 million, but in 1989, despite the undertaking that the research board had felt they had received, it was savagely slashed by £1 million to £1.3 million.  In 1990, it was retained at £1.3 million.  Not only does this reflect a continuance of the £1 million cut, but it actually represents a worsening of the situation when one takes into account the effects of inflation.  You have a 43 per cent cut in the budget, almost 50 per cent gone, and you then have this compounded by the erosion effect of inflation and the fact that the £1 million cut is continued.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that no other research agency or institution sustained a parallel cut at that period of this magnitude on what was already regarded as a minimal base budget.  I would also like to point out that there is an inconsistency in the fact that the grant was higher in 1987 and 1988, when the economy was arguably in a worse situation, and now that the economy is improving we do not have any amelioration of the board's position.  The board's corporate plan for 1989-91, which was submitted in March 1989, sought an allocation of £2.5 million for 1990.  An absolute minimal level of support for a viable medical and research programme is estimated by the people responsible as being £2 million.</P>
    <P>I would like to make an additional point about the £1.3 million, because it may appear as if it is a figure in which there is a margin of appreciation, some degree of room for manoeuvre.  There is not, because, as the Minister well knows, that £1.3 million is already committed for ongoing research.  This is a very important point, because it means that as a result of budgetary constraints no new research commitments can be undertaken. That has a number of serious implications.  Firstly, the cutting off of the possibility of the engagement of young <Col N="208" /> graduates in research and, secondly, of course, the benefits that will be derived by the wider community from this research work.</P>
    <P>I would like to point also to the fact that the programme of research within the area of health services generally was intended by the board to have been a principal element in their research programme for 1990 with a view to increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the health service generally.  In anticipation of a viable funding level in 1990, initial applications were invited from health boards, hospitals, colleges etc.  By the closing date of 17 November last 91 applications had been received.  They are now all closed off.</P>
    <P>That last paragraph I have just read on to the record is a substantial part of my argument.  The health services research area was to be a major point &mdash; in other words, the efficiency and accuracy of delivery of health services was to be a major element.  It is capable of being argued that an element of this money was to be used to make the health services more efficient and therefore more cost effective.  I have to ask the Minister if it is not in fact a major and principal responsibility on him, particularly in the current situation of economic difficulties, to ensure that the health services are efficient and if he is not concerned that research schemes that would, in fact, have this impact, that would help the health services to be efficient have now been abandoned.  It is clear that as a result of this cut back there will be virtually no funds available for new projects throughout 1990 or for research fellowships.  As a result up to 100 of our brightest young graduates will be forced to emigrate, thereby creating a brain drain.  We are also clearly going to abandon any pretence that we have a viable medical and health research programme in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to be aware of the comparative European situation.  For example, figures can be adduced which demonstrate very convincingly that <Col N="209" /> Ireland is at the lowest level in the European Community in terms of Government funding for research and development for the protection or improvement of human health.  I have a list in front of me.  We have France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Greece, all ahead of Ireland, proportionately, in terms of the amount of spending.  They are maintaining or increasing their levels whereas we are going down from a figure of several million pounds to just £1 million, until we are in the situation where the officials of the Health Research Board feel we are heading towards either a situation of relegation or closure for the board.  I find this a matter for every considerable concern.</P>
    <P>Could I point out the fact that a number of projects involved are ones with which the general public would find no difficulty at all in having a great degree of sympathy. For example, one of the research programmes is in terms of sudden infant death syndrome, another was about bone marrow transplantation, another was about respiratory illnesses.  If, through the application of health research findings in the health services, one cot death could be avoided, that steps could be taken to prevent the recurrence of a spina bifida birth, that the life of a teenager could be prolonged through new knowledge becoming available on bone marrow transplantation, or that improved treatment methods became available for the elderly suffering from respiratory illnesses in the present smoggy conditions, then surely the Minister would agree with me that this very meagre allocation for research should be increased.  In terms of budgetary allocation we are really talking in pennies, because I understand this is about one two thousandth six hundredth of the general Health Estimate.  So it really is very small.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that there is an important and sustainable argument for making proper funding available for this Medical Research Bureau.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point to the Minister's own attitude in the matter.  We are <Col N="210" /> in the unusual sitution that we have a Minister who is professionally qualified in this area.  Therefore, one has to listen to his views with some respect, particularly when they are placed on the record.  The Minister, I understand, is actually on record as saying &mdash; and he will be able to correct me if I am misquoting him &mdash; that he acknowledges that an active and expanding medical research programme is absolutely essential.  I am quoting from recollection of the Minister's words, but the phrase I am perfectly certain of is an &ldquo;active and expanding medical research programme.&rdquo; Can the Minister, stand over those words with an easy conscience in the light of these cutbacks?</P>
    <P>I would like to anticipate some of the Minister's argument, because I imagine that he may suggest that under the health services generally there is, in allied areas, a certain amount of research going on. The Minister knows, as well as I do and as well as some of my colleagues who have assured me on this point, that a lot of the material that is categorised as research is nothing more than information gathering and analysis under the auspices of sections of the health services. That really does not qualify under any international definition of medical research.</P>
    <P>The kind of things, as the Minister I am sure will agree, that do qualify are the kind of things that the medical research board were involved in.  There was bio medical research on subjects like heart disease, stroke, mental illness, diabetes, asthma, muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and the nature and cause of depression.  These are examples of ongoing research that will continue if the Minister is able to find the money.  We have programmes concerning the genetic epidemiology of schizophrenia and psychiatric disorders.  Time is short, but the Minister is aware that certainly until recently it was widely felt that schizophrenia had a higher incidence in this country, particularly on the western seaboard, than most other European countries. There is mental handicap, child <Col N="211" /> health and a major epidemiological study to ascertain if vitamin supplements can reduce the risk of neural tube defects, that lead to spina bifida, in mothers with a previously affected baby: epidemiology being the scientific study of the distribution of disease.  If we can prevent one incidence of spina bifida as a result of this, surely the Minister, as a doctor and as a caring person would agree that this would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of travellers health status.  A study of the birth and mortality rate of travellers and the health of travelling children, including how travellers utilise the available health services, is the kind of research that is vitally important.  There is the programme of laboratory research, in which I would have a particular interest because, of course, a major element of this is being carried on in laboratories situated in my own university in Trinity College, where they are focusing principally on the development of anti-cancer and anti-leprosy drugs and on virology studies.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I am sure, will remember with affection as I do a former distinguished colleague of mine, Dr. Barry with whom I often had the privilege of having lunch, a most delightful and charming man.  He was one of the leaders in discovering drugs which are now effective against leprosy.  With what great pride we, as Irish academics, realised that we were to the forefront of medical research.  Is the Minister actually happy to stand over a situation where we are saying basically that we are not capable of supporting a decent level of research? Perhaps I have been a little bit rarified in what I have said in the last few remarks; I think I can see the Acting Chairman getting ready to indicate that my time is coming to a close, so I would like to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was getting ready to indicate that the Chair would prefer if the Senator did not name people outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>My reference was inadvertent but I was mentioning him in a <Col N="212" /> way.  He is no longer alive but he is a very significant part of our medical research history.  I am sure it is possible to mention people like Alfred Nobel.  I will not quite put Dr. Barry in that category but he was a very distinguished doctor who reflected credit on the country.  However, if it is inappropriate to mention him I will withdraw my reference to him.</P>
      <P>I would like to indicate again a couple of the projects which have been cancelled as a result of this cutback.  I am quoting now from the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 10 December 1989 where it says &ldquo;among the projects cancelled were ways and means of delivering an effective health service to an urban population (Tallaght), prevention of osteo-arthritis of the hip, home-care of patients with Alzheimers Disease and the development of better communication skills among mentally handicapped children.&rdquo;  Could there be better areas for research either on a scientific or on a humane basis?  I am sure the Minister will have no difficulty in agreeing with me, particularly in a situation like Tallaght, where we have a population in a potentially beautiful area of the city that has many social problems, many problems of deprivation, a high level of unemployment, difficulties in its transport and difficulties with the absence of an effective and proper town centre. Here we have a project which was intended to assist the Minister in delivering an efficient health service to this deprived area.  I am sure, as a caring and compassionate man, the Minister will agree that this was an important project as was the prevention of osteo-arthritis and home care of patients with Alzheimer's Disease.  Of course, conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease are diseases with which many of us were, until recently, unfamiliar.  It is a very tragic situation, one that has been highlighted recently in the media and one with which people are increasingly finding themselves in sympathy.  Is it appropriate that all these programmes will be cancelled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the cancellation of another project here &mdash; the Third World Collaborative Research Project, which was an investigation into the pathogenesis of <Col N="212" /> the dengue virus which was underway as part of the European Community tropical medicine programme.  This is a virus which has a wide geographical distribution in tropical and sub-tropical areas and is responsible for very high morbidity and mortality among children. I draw this particularly to the Minister's attention because of the fact that we are in the position at the moment of holding the presidency of the European Community. I wonder if the Minister feels it appropriate to celebrate this elevation of our country and its people within the political system of Europe by cancelling our programme which is part of the European programme on tropical medicine?</P>
    <P>Finally, in my little list there was a programme on drug misuse in Dublin, where they were seeking to establish a drug reporting system for Dublin and London which could possibly be used as a model for other European cities.  The Minister, I know, is deeply concerned about the problem of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome for example.  The construction of this kind of model might well have been of use in dealing with that situation.</P>
    <P>In summary, I have to say that it is a matter of very considerable regret to me that I have to raise this matter.  I believe the Minister will have difficulty in sustaining an argument for the reduction in funds that I have outlined.  I appeal to him to do what he can to discover funds, whether it means applying to the lottery or whatever source is available, to allow us to take our place as Europeans in the community of those committed to research.  To hearten him, can I just tell him what I overheard this morning in one of the by-ways of the corridors of power? It was a remark made at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, where somebody alleged that the way things happen with regard to lottery funding is that it is on the basis that if a Minister decides that something is a priority, he than just applies to the lottery, and there is then a Government decision.  Perhaps there is an avenue for the Minister who might make a direct approach, armed, as I hope I have armed <Col N="212" /> him, with the kind of material I have placed today on the record.  Perhaps such an application, which I believe the Minister will find in his heart to support, would at this late stage be positively received although, to my great regret, it will not be possible to reverse the decision of the Provost of Trinity College to resign from this board.  My final point is that a man of international distinction and reputation holding one of the highest university appointments of this land, does not lightly resign from a body to which he has so clearly committed himself and his reputation.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity of coming into the Seanad this evening to speak about the recent events and the Health Research Board.  I am glad because it provides me with an opportunity to set the record straight on a number of matters which Senator Norris referred to and which have surrounded the 1990 allocation to the board.  Indeed, it has caused some controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senators consider all aspects of the background, they would realise that the Government have taken a reasonable stance in this instance.  As Senators will be aware, the Health Research Board was established in August 1986.  It arose from the amalgamation of two then existing bodies, the Medical Research Council and the Medical Social Research Board. Both of these bodies were distinguished by their traditions and achievements in the area of medical and health services research.  When the new health research board took office in January 1987, their remit included the development of programmes in medical research and also in epidemiological research.  The 1987 allocation, as Senator Norris pointed out, was £2.3 million.  In 1989 this was reduced to £1.3 million as a consequence of the extremely severe financial difficulties facing the Government.  While this presented a major difficulty to the board it was in large measure overcome by my Department taking over responsibility for some of the board's activities which were peripheral to the core functions of <Col N="212" /> the board in the area of information systems and extramural research.</P>
    <P>This relieved the board of responsibility for activities costing £600,000.  It is a matter of great disappointment to me that members of the Health Research Board would have gone public &mdash; and, indeed, that Senator Norris who did some research into this subject &mdash; did not state the reality of the situation which is that, in effect, the board were not reduced by £1 million, but by £400,000.  We took on board £600,000 worth of their activities. The board's 1990 allocation as contained in the Book of Estimates is £1.3 million, the same as in 1989.  In consequence of this allocation, the Chairman of the Board, Professor Watts, resigned from his position on 23 November last.  While I understand the disappointment of the board at the level of allocation which it was possible to provide from Exchequer Funds in 1990, I regret very much that Professor Watts felt it necessary to respond to this situation by resigning from the board.  I am, of course, very much aware of the major contribution which he has made to the work of the board.  I would like to record my appreciation of his effort and his commitment as chairman.  Unfortunately, the board's difficulties have led to the use of emotive terms by commentators, some of whom have presented a most unbalanced picture of the position.  I will refer to one of them: the fact that while the allocation on paper in the Book of Estimates was reduced by £1 million, the fact that we took up £600,000 worth of the expenditure meant that it was in real terms only a reduction of £400,000.  I have to say that I do not feel that the use of phrases such as &ldquo;opted out&rdquo; of medical research and &ldquo;perform at the level of a Third World country&rdquo; which have been used in the context of this situation, accord with the facts.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the term &ldquo;severely slashed&rdquo; was used by Senator Norris here referring to the £1 million reduction, when in real terms the reduction was less than half that.  I would at this stage like to stress that in the context of the health services <Col N="212" /> the Government accord due importance to the role played by research of all kinds. I wish to emphasise that the situation which has arisen by the Government's inability to increase Exchequer provision over the 1989 level in no way represents a downgrading of the status accorded to me or by the Government to this most important area.  Indeed, in this context I would remind Senators of the importance attached to the role of information and evaluation in the health services and the importance attached to them by the commission on funding, for example.  Health service and medical research are clearly an important element of such evaluation.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, when it becomes clear that the level of funding which would be provided last year would be considerably less than in the previous year, I agreed to take over a number of the functions being carried out by the Health Research Board in order to alleviate the full impact of this reduction. These included the assumption of responsibility by my Department for the hospital in-patient inquiry scheme, as well as the national psychiatric in-patient scheme and the Kilkenny health project.</P>
    <P>The effect of these transfers was to relieve the Health Research Board of these responsibilities, leaving them free to concentrate on the funding of purely clinical and health services research.  I fully appreciate the importance of the contribution which can be made to health care by appropriate research and the need to foster research talent in this area. I would greatly desire to strengthen this area and to expand it in scope and in line with priority needs.</P>
    <P>However, it must be realised that such aspirations have to be placed in the context of the financial reality in which we find ourselves.  When Senator Norris says that the Minister is morally bound to provide more funding for the Health Research Board that, unfortunately, is competing with priorities as other people would see them, such as the front line services where people believe that more money should be made available.  Certainly, we would like to make more money available if the financial situation <Col N="212" /> of the country was different.  Of course, there is no need to remind the Senators that we still have a difficult financial situation in this State.  Indeed, faced with the severe financial constraint the Government have sought to reconcile the many and conflicting demands of health needs with the scarce resources available to meet them.</P>
    <P>This has resulted in the necessity of establishing priorities.  Within this context it is a fact of life that urgent service provision must come first.  I will point out to Senators that we are already spending the huge sum of £1.5 billion in the current year providing health services for our people.  From this some £760 million are directed towards providing services in general hospitals.  There can be no doubt that this represents a very substantial investment.  This also represents a very substantial investment in research which is carried out as an integral part of the ongoing delivery of these hospital services. Research forms an integral part of the hospital service, especially in the teaching hospitals associated with medical schools.  It also forms part of the responsibilities of every consultant.  In addition, the non-consultant hospital doctor grade is primarily a training grade. The encouragement of research activity forms part of the training process for the various specialities, especially at senior registrar level.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly reasonable to say that the Government are making a substantial commitment to medical research through their investment in hospital services.  The Government have sought at every opportunity to protect the level of services which can be afforded.  This, in turn, is reflected in the training and research opportunities available to medical staff. Of course, I should also say that there is direct funding from the State to other research projects which are not funded directly by the Health Research Board. Indeed, the Health Research Board are not responsible for all the funding either from the State or from the private sector to a number of research projects that are in place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> When we compare what we are spending with other European countries, it is important to recognise that in other European countries they include very often in their costs the cost of laboratory services and the salaries of those working in them.  In this country, these are in the general costs of the health services and are not directly included in the activities of the Health Research Board.  I consider that, having regard to all the circumstances, the provision of £1.3 million for the Health Research Board for its activities in 1990 is reasonable.  This allocation will enable the board to continue its existing level of activities following the rationalisation last year of the non-research functions to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>The board will, in addition, be in a position to start new activities later this year and to replace projects which are drawing to a close.  Indeed, they are presently scrutinising a number of projects to start.  I would agree with Senator Norris about the value of the project in Tallaght, but the position about that project and, indeed, the other projects that the Senator mentioned is, that they have not been cancelled but they have not been developed and assessed.  There were declarations of intent to carry out research. They are presently being researched.  I am glad to say that the diverse projects which the Senator referred to are continuing with European Community funding.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am aware that the board are carefully reviewing aspects of some of the activities which they fund at present with a view to securing even better returns from the expenditure involved with the likelihood of freeing up resources to devote to more new and important activities.  I know that the board are also considering using some of their accumulated assets to develop new activity in the current year.  I am also satisfied that in accordance with the corporate plan presented to me by the board last year, they will be in a position to generate significant non-Exchequer income to support a high quality research programme.  I am quite satisfied that <Col N="212" /> opportunities exist for the board to organise or undertake commissioned research, from which it will be possible to derive an additional source of income. Indeed, the board are already doing so. I am also confident that the prestige of the board will be a factor which can attract private sector investment and high quality research projects whose quality and importance are supported by involvement.</P>
    <P>The scope for joint funding of research by the board in other private or voluntary research interests is immense, given the right degree of organisation.  The board will also be aware that the Government, through my colleague the Minister of State for Science and Technology, Deputy Michael Smith, apart from domestic sources of funds, are pursuing changes in the approach of the European Community to the funding of medical research, so the direct cost of research projects can be met from Community funds.  In addition, I have had discussions with the Minister of State for Science and Technology as to ways and means whereby the interests and activities of the Health Research Board might be supported, and how we might benefit from an association with the science and technology development programme.  I hope that we will be able to report progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Senators that the Government are committed to supporting the future development of health research and place a high value on it.  The level of direct Exchequer support which can be provided to the board on foot of this commitment must be determined in the light of the availability of resources and the pressure of other necessary activities.  I will be giving more detailed <Col N="212" /> comments to the board on its plan shortly.  As Senators may be aware, Professor Maurice Fitzgerald has been elected by the board as its new chairman. It will be his task to carry forward the board's plans and activities.  I wish him every success in his new responsibilities. I am sure that under his leadership the board will develop and progress towards the objectives shared by his predecessor, Professor Watts.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator Norris that the Government are committed to funding the Health Research Board to enable them to carry out their functions adequately given the present difficult fiscal situation.  I repeat my regret that Professor Watts felt it necessary to resign from the board.  However, the continuing financial difficulties which we are facing and the level of demand for public expenditure on health is such that the Government are unable to contemplate an increase in the board's allocation in the current year, 1990.  There are so many demands that the Senator will be aware of on the Exchequer that there simply has to be a system of priority allocation. It is the role of the Government to carry out this process of according priorities. Difficult though it may be, the Government are resolute in carrying out their responsibilities in this area.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his courteous reply and say that I extracted one small comfort when he spoke of the current year.  I hope that he will use his ingenuity to secure further funding for supporting the institution.</P>
