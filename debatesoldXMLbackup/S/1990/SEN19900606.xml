      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to urgently provide permanent accommodation and proper facilities for the pupils of St. Aidan's Christian Brothers Secondary School, Whitehall, Dublin 9, to replace the present totally inadequate prefabricated structure which has been in existence for over 20 years.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to the construction of a community school at Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Tom Hussey of the following matter.</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to consider Tuam, County Galway, as a location for a Government Department as part of decentralisation scheme.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>

      <Col N="714" /> Go n-éilíonn an tSeanad ar an Aire Cumarsáide a chinntiú go mbeidh foinnsí airgeadais Stáit ar fáil le seirbhís Ghaeilge/Gaeltachta a chur ar fáil láithreach.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Costello, Neville and Hussey as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Costello's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Neville and Hussey may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Ó Foighil is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds that it involves legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is item No. 1, the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, 1989.  This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil; we are on Report Stage.  The item following that will be item No. 2, the Turf Development Bill, 1988 and it is proposed to complete Second Stage of that Bill at 5.30 p.m.  The Minister will reply at approximately 5.15 p.m.  From 5.30 p.m. until 8.30 p.m. we will have a three hour debate on the Independent motion, item No. 10 on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased we are having a full three hour debate in Private Members' time.  This should be the normal practice rather than the exception.  On the Order of Business, may I ask the Leader of the House what steps he has taken to clarify the constitutional issues which were mentioned here in the House on Friday, 25 May last arising out of the High Court settlement. He said then he would try to get clarification on those issues and I wonder if he has anything to report to us today on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, on the Order of Business would the Leader of the House consider at this point, given that we have a fairly light work-load, making time available for a full debate on Northern Ireland <Col N="715" /> within the next two weeks in the light of recent developments there and in view of the fact that we have not had a debate on Northern Ireland for quite some time. Thirdly, I would like to support a call made by Senator Upton on a number of occasions that we should have an opportunity to discuss the current crisis in agriculture caused by what is commonly known as Mad Cow Disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just put to the Leader of the House one or two matters on which unfortunately I got no response. There is the Intermediate Education (Amendment) Bill, No. 6 on the Order Paper, and I requested that that matter be put to the Minister for Education.  Is the Minister prepared to clear away the discrimination against girls in secondary schools by way of amendment of that Bill?  I would like to know the position on that.</P>
      <P>Also, I ask the Leader of the House to indicate to us the programme of new legislation which it is intended to initiate in this House between now and the summer.  After the difficulties we have had recently one of the best exercises of rehabilitation we could undertake at this point would be the initiation and debate of legislation in this House.  It is important that we get a commitment from the Leader of the House that certain legislation will be initiated in this House between now and the end of the term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House what progress he has made in amalgamating those motions on the Order Paper which are suitable to be so dealt with and, in particular, is he prepared to make time available, as Senator Manning has said, for a debate on Mad Cow Disease?  Indeed, he might widen that out into the question of farmers' incomes which I think could be easily incorporated in such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom rud a tharla anseo le déanaí a lua nuair a bhí díospóireacht againn faoi sheirbhís teilifíse don Ghaeltacht. <Col N="716" /> Chuir sé isteach go mór orm go raibh mé ábalta píosa a léamh sa nuachtán Domhnaigh faoi cad a bhí i gceist ag an Rialtas faoi sheirbhís Teilifís Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta agus é a chur isteach i Network 2, agus cé go raibh sé ar an nuachtán seachtain ó shin, ní raibh éinne ón Rialtas in ann faic á rá linn anseo faoi.</P>
      <P>I would like to be assured that if there is a debate in this House on a serious issue the Government will treat the House seriously and tell us what is going on, instead of having it leaked to a political correspondent who was able to tell us that the Government had in mind to impose two hours of Irish on Network 2 at some stage in the future.  I do not think it shows any respect for this House if a Government Minister comes in here, debates a matter in a lively way and vigorous way, but does not tell us things that clearly have been announced at the time and which are subsequently leaked &mdash; as it turned out in one of the Sunday papers recently &mdash; about an Irish language television service.  May I ask the Leader of the House to give us some idea on tomorrow's business and in particular the nature of the debate.  Is there to be a time limit on the debate on the Middle East, or will there be a time limit on speeches? That information would be helpful for Members who are preparing their notes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, with the Irish Presidency of the EC Council coming to an end, may I ask the Leader of the House &mdash; there is a degree of urgency about this &mdash; whether he would consider allocating time in the next couple of weeks to enable Members on all sides of the House to express their support, and their continuing support, for the Government campaign to ensure that full economic sanctions are sustained against South Africa until such time as there is an irreversible change in the system of apartheid.  Lest there be any ambivalence about it from any circles in this House, I think we should have a debate in which Members on all sides of the House can express their views, which are close to being unanimous.  To avoid any ambiguity, we should give our support from all sides both to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in <Col N="717" /> this very high principled struggle of theirs to maintain a position of principle.  I ask the Leader of the House to give us the opportunity to record our views in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take up where Senator Ryan ended and support his statement in relation to economic sanctions and the role being played by our representatives in this area, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach. Now that Nelson Mandela has left South Africa and is beginning his tour of Europe, I would like to ask the Leader of the House, what arrangements he has for the Seanad in relation to his visit here and how he is going to accommodate the Seanad and the Senators in relation to that visit.  We have had requests on a number of occasions that both Houses be addressed but I would like a statement from the Leader as to how he is going to accommodate this House in relation to that matter.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Manning in his request for a debate on Northern Ireland. It is a request I have been making for many months, as indeed have a number of other Senators.  In the light of the developments that have taken place in recent times, as Senator Manning has mentioned, it is extremely important that we have a debate.  We have not had a debate in this House on Northern Ireland since the beginning of this present Seanad.  In relation to the Supplementary Order Paper, is any progress being made in the context of compositing the Motions?</P>

      <P>The question has been put already and I think it may be covered in the reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get some commitment from the Leader of the House in relation to the initiation of Private Members' legislation in this House and whether he is going to make some provision for that in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Leader of the House that he undertook <Col N="718" /> to get further information for me on the progress of the Nationality Bill and the Misuse of Drugs Act.  The Misuse of Drugs Act requires amendment and in the absence of this amendment certain persons living with the AIDs virus are debarred from access to a particular drug, DDI.  I understand that the Leader of the House may not have this information to hand but perhaps he may be able to get it for me.</P>
      <P>I would like the guidance of the House, particularly the Leader, as to whether time might be made available either for a debate or for a statement from the Minister for the Marine with regard to requests from the Irish Shipping workers who are currently picketing the Oireachtas.  It is a very serious issue.  It would not be appropriate for me to make a speech on this matter, and I am sure I would not be allowed, but they have been given certain undertakings.  I know there are difficulties, but perhaps the Minister could make a statement either in this House or in the Dáil or perhaps we could have a debate in a non-confrontational manner because I think this House should be made relevant to people who have good humouredly, but quite firmly, picketed both Houses over a number of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first join with my colleague, Senator Norris, in asking the Leader of the House to convey the spirit and content of what he has suggested. I have a particular interest in the Irish Shipping employees.  My brother, who lives in Marseilles, had been a source of sustenance to one of the ships that was berthed there for many, many months when they were far away from home.  It is very sad to see young children outside the Houses of the Oireachtas with their families, families who have had commitments from the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My main reason for standing, a Chathaoirligh, is that I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he <Col N="719" /> would give consideration to the proposal, and this would be with the agreement of all sides of the House, that a telegram be sent to the Irish football team in Italy as they start on their odyssey.  For those who may suggest this is a trivial or irrelevant matter, the Irish football team hold a unique place in the affection of the Irish nation and for those again who would suggest that it should not have any place in this House I would remind the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the three hour debate is something I am considering and I will come back to Senator Manning and other Senators on that matter.  Regarding the constitutional issue which he raised, I have been in touch with the Attorney General on two occasions in the past fortnight.  I am sure the Senator will realise that the problem is not an easy one, it is a complex legal matter.  I am assured by the Attorney General that he is investigating it and I would like to think I may be in a position to have some statement regarding the matter next week or the week after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of whether we should have a debate on Northern Ireland, a matter raised by a number of Senators, it is not a proposal in the short term but it is something I will consider and I will <Col N="720" /> have discussions with the leaders of the other parties.</P>
    <P>On the question of Mad Cow Disease, my own view a fortnight ago was that we should have had a debate on that.  I certainly have no objection to it.  I mentioned to Senator Upton a fortnight ago that his motion might be more appropriate for a debate at this level.  It is something we will consider for next week, if we can manage it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the programme for the balance of this term.  I have nothing to add to what I gave here two weeks ago, which brought us fairly up to date.  He specifically referred to item No. 6.  I will talk about that matter to the Minister for Education and will contact him on it.</P>
    <P>On the question from Senator Upton regarding composite motions on the Order Paper &mdash; it was also raised by Senator Costello &mdash; I can assure both Senators that that matter is being examined and worked upon.  Senator Ryan referred to item No. 102 &mdash; the debate tomorrow.  We thought we might conclude at about 2 p.m. but if it is felt that it should go on longer and if there are enough speakers, then certainly there would be no objections.  It is a flexible motion and one that I will talk to the Whips about in the morning or this afternoon.</P>
    <P>On the question of economic sanctions and apartheid generally, it is not something I have been thinking about as a debate in the near future but it is something I will consider and report back on.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the Misuse of Drugs Act.  I have not made any investigation on that but I will do so and come back to the Senator on it.  He also referred to a marine problem which I regard as not being appropriate to the Order of Business and Senator Mooney referred to it also.  However, I will convey the sentiments of the Senators to the Minister. I have no other comments to make on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration,&rdquo; the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as a report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of those amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, 1989, which was initiated in the Seanad and passed by it on 10 May 1989 has since been passed by Dáil Eireann with some amendments.  I would now like to explain these amendments to this House.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to delete the exemption from the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; of a crossbow with a draw weight of less than 1.4kg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was being drafted it was decided that toy crossbows, that is those <Col N="722" /> with a draw weight of less than 1.4kg., should be excluded from the controls which were being introduced for crossbows generally and this is why the exemption was included in the Bill.  However, the Minister has been advised that the reference to a specific draw weight in the legislation could require the Garda to prove in every case that a crossbow had a draw weight in excess of 1.4 kg. in order to secure a conviction against a person for having a crossbow without a firearm certificate.  This would impose an unnecessary additional burden on the Garda and for that reason he is satisfied that the exemption should be removed.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 extends the definition of &ldquo;stun gun&rdquo; in the Bill to include similar weapons which might be developed and which might operate otherwise than by inflicting an electric shock.  This matter was raised in the other House where concern was expressed that the definition of stun gun which was included in the Bill when it was passed by this House might not be adequate in view of the possibility that new weapons could be developed which could stun a person by some other means.</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to ensure that any stun gun or similar type weapon will be brought within the definition of firearm in the Bill and will thus be subject to all the controls which operate in respect of firearms under the Firearms Acts.  Senators will note that the new wording would cover any device which could be used to cause shock or disablement to a person by means of electricity or any other kind of energy emission.  The Minister is advised that the words &ldquo;energy emission&rdquo; are wide enough to encompass any possible way in which a person could be stunned and is satisfied that the amendment is fully adequate to deal with any future technological developments which could produce a stun device capable of being used against a person.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 5 are connected. The primary purpose of these amendments is to ensure that a defective firearm will be caught by the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; and thus be subject to the <Col N="723" /> controls which are imposed by the Firearms Acts.  It is not clear whether a firearm which is not immediately capable of discharging a bullet or shot comes within the scope of the existing definition and these amendments are being introduced to put the matter beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 provides for the insertion into the definition of firearm in the Bill of a new paragraph which provides that notwithstanding that a firearm cannot immediately discharge a bullet, etc. it will nonetheless be treated as a fully operational weapon for the purposes of our firearms legislation if it can be restored to working order by the addition of a necessary component part or parts.  The provision itself is quite clear and does not, I believe, require any further elaboration.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 is consequential on amendment No. 3.  It provides that a Garda superintendent may grant an authorisation to a person to keep a firearm as a souvenir or curio without the need for a certificate where the firearm has been rendered incapable of discharging.  The type of case to which this provision would apply would be one where a person had inherited a gun which had been used by a relative say, in the War of Independence. It could also be availed of by museums.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 is purely technical. It is required because the Bill is being amended to deal with defective firearms.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that the Bill inserts a new provision in the Firearms Act, 1925, to enable this country to become party to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer and Acquisition of Firearms.  That Convention does not classify crossbows or stun guns as firearms and for that reason they are specifically excluded from the provisions of the new subsection 3A which will be inserted into the 1925 Act.  This is done in paragraph (c) of the new subsection.  However, unless the Bill is amended in the way proposed in amendment No. 4 a defective crossbow or defective stun gun could be subject to the provisions of the new subsection 3A and, of course, this would be <Col N="724" /> illogical as a fully working crossbow or stun gun would not be so subject.  The amendment will remove that anomaly.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 6 is to broaden the scope of section 9 of the Bill which deals with the possession of knives and other dangerous articles to make it an offence for a person to carry any knife or similar article in a public place unless with good reason or lawful authority. Under the Bill as it was passed by this House it would have been an offence to do so only in a number of places of public entertainment or resort.</P>
    <P>This amendment has been introduced only after very careful thought on the Minister's part.  As he explained in his Second Stage speech in the other House, he was anxious to confine the offence to those places where, in the normal course of events, a person would have no legitimate reason to have a knife or similar article for two reasons.  First, experience would show that it is in such places that the greatest danger of abuse of offensive weapons arises.  Secondly, to make it an offence to carry any knife or bladed or sharply pointed article in a public place unless with good reason or excuse could, in theory, place any responsible citizen who might have reason to carry such an article in the position of having to explain himself.</P>
    <P>However, a number of recent events involving the use of knives has convinced the Minister that the public interest would be best served by broadening the scope of the provision to include all public places.  There have been recently a number of very serous stabbing incidents on our streets &mdash; one in which a British visitor was fatally injured.  He is satisfied that prevention of such incidents is more important than the avoidance of what is a faint possibility of an incursion on right of responsible persons to go about their lawful business.</P>
    <P>Because of the fundamental change which substituting public place in the provision will make, it is necessary in my view to recast its subsidiary elements somewhat.  Accordingly, it is proposed in the amendment to remove the exception for pocket-knives.  In the context of it <Col N="725" /> being an offence to carry a knife etc. in any public place, there is no longer any valid reason to single out any particular item for exception.</P>
    <P>Again, because of the substitution of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in the provision, the use of the term &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; might be pejorative.  It is proposed to replace it by the term &ldquo;good reason&rdquo;.  Also, it is appropriate that it should be made clear that the provision is not aimed at the legitimate use of a knife or some other tool or article for work or recreational purposes.  This is done in the proposed new subsection (3).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 is merely a consequential amendment.  Acceptance of amendment No. 6 will mean that the only place which will be referred to in section 9 on the possession of knives etc. will be &ldquo;any public place&rdquo;.  The reference in section 16 which deals with searches without warrant needs, accordingly, to be altered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House and to welcome the fact that we are dealing with the Report Stage of this Bill.  I would like to highlight the fact that this Bill was introduced in this House a year and a half ago.  Granted that there was an election in the meantime, it reflects the need for reform of our whole legislative procedure that it takes a year and a half for such an important Bill to come to a conclusion in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I want to emphasise that we must seriously look at our whole legislative procedure to ensure that such Bills are expedited through the Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party were very much in support of this Bill when it was going through this House and the Dáil.  I welcome the acceptance by the Minister in Dáil Éireann of the suggestions and amendments introduced by our spokesman, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, in the Dáil.  I welcome the extension of the definition of stun gun to weapons other than those which inflict electric shock.  This will ensure that any type of stun gun or similar <Col N="726" /> weapon will be brought within the definition of firearms in the Bill.  This extends the scope of the Bill to include any device which could be used to cause shock or disablement to a person by means of electricity or any other kind of energy emission. It also ensures that the Bill in future years will be effective when other means of restricting one's movements or whatever are developed.  This amendment will ensure that the Bill is effective in the light of any future developments in that area.</P>
    <P>The proposal to include defective weaponry in the Bill is also welcomed.  It is disappointing that imitation and replica guns are not included in the Bill.  I understand the difficulties with this, but some means should have been found to include imitation and replica guns.  These are often used in robberies and other criminal activities.  We recognise the problem of drawing a distinction between imitation and replica guns and toy guns &mdash; sometimes these toy guns are very realistic &mdash; but it should not be beyond the means of the parliamentary draftsman to include replica and imitation guns.  We can recall an incident in Northern Ireland where, tragically, some criminals who were using replica guns were shot when the police mistook the weapons for real weapons.</P>
    <P>We also welcome the amendment which makes it an offence for a person to carry any knife or similar article in a public place unless with good reason or lawful authority.  This strengthens the scope of the Bill.  It is frightening to dwell on the range of knives available for purchase today.  I do not know if anything can be done about it, but some approach should be made to limit the availability of such weapons and such articles for general sale.  I do not know what limitations are there at the moment but there seems to be a fairly free approach to the purchase of such weapons.</P>
    <P>We must condemn the serious increase in crimes committed with the weaponry mentioned in the Bill.  This increase is in line with the general increase in crime.  I want to emphasise the absolute necessity to curb the increase in crime, to tackle the developing crime problem throughout the country and to ensure that we <Col N="727" /> have a State where our people, first of all, can live in comfort and not feel threatened and where our visitors who are increasingly coming under threat, can come here in comfort without the threat of violence hanging over them.  If we were to coin a phrase to highlight all this activity it would be that crime cripples communities.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the Bill.  I am disappointed it took a year and a half to reach this Stage.  I thank the Minister for being here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to join with Senator Neville in welcoming the Minister.  Despite the fact that it has taken so much time to get this Bill concluded, there were certain amendments made in the other House which were necessary and prudent.  Like my colleague, Senator Neville, I think the amendments made are practical and very necessary.  They have been carefully thought out.  This legislation is overdue. To have the Bill rushed through without careful consideration would have been improper.</P>
      <P>The first amendment concerning the total exclusion of all crossbows irrespective of draw-weight power is indeed proper.  As the Minister pointed out, this had created a practical and impossible difficulty for the Garda to deal with.  The definition in relation to stun guns, this type of weaponry that inflicts injury by electric shock or otherwise, is most welcome and prudent.</P>
      <P>Very proper also is the amendment in relation to the authorisation of the Garda Superintendent to give authority either to individuals, or possibly to people in a museum, to hold old weapons going back to the Civil War or before that, weapons that are basically incapable of functioning. This is very important also.  It is a sensible provision, because the superintendent in any given area will know the person he is dealing with and will make sure before giving authorisation to hold such a weapon that the greatest consideration will be given and the strictest guidelines adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> In relation to the possession of knives and other articles, it is important that this particular section has been broadened and that the onus is on the individual carrying a knife or any sharp weapon to prove his innocence.  It is important because there has been an upsurge of attacks of this sort, and recently we had a foreign visitor fatally wounded as a result of a knife attack.  In regard to any person who takes a sharp implement such as a penknive or otherwise on the street, the onus is on that person to prove there is a genuine reason for such a weapon. As the Minister pointed out, I am sure it will be very easy to explain, as in the Minister's own case &mdash; he is a pipe smoker and he has to cut his tobacco.  That is a very valid reason and justifiable.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, these amendments will be agreed unanimously.  I am glad this legislation which has taken so long to come back here, is at the conclusive stage.  I thank the Minister for coming here.  The observations, which have been made in relation to the amendments have been very proper and correct.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to comment on a point made by Senator Neville in relation to imitation guns and toy guns, etc.  Here we are in a very difficult area from a practical point of view in so far as asking: where we draw the line?  Do you insist that toy shops that cater primarily for children do not stock these toys?  I accept that some toy shops stock guns that look very real.  Indeed, my own children have them.  The line must be drawn somewhere and exceptions must be made.  Any hardened criminal or any person who intends to commit a serious crime, such as a bank robbery, will not, except in extreme circumstances, use weapons that are purely imitation.  They will go for the real thing.</P>
    <P>All in all, I welcome the amendments and I trust that this House will endorse the support for this Bill and have its implementation expedited.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendments to this legislation because I was in this House when this legislation was going through in May 1989.  At the time <Col N="729" /> Senators considered this Bill to be very important.  If we read down through the sections of the Bill we will see how important it is.  I am a firm believer &mdash; and I think the former Leas-Chathaoirleach would be in agreement with me &mdash; in long debate on certain legislation.  We had this on this Bill.  But even when it went back to the Dáil it was seen that it still needed to be amended.  I welcome the common sense of the Minister in accepting Deputy O'Keeffe's amendments.  I warmly welcome that attitude.</P>
      <P>I welcome in particular amendment No. 5.  There was, perhaps, a wrong slant put on the section to which this amendment pertains.  There are families who have old guns which are not museum pieces but they would not part with them. I am happy that this amendment protects some of us who have pieces that belonged to former members of our families who are now long gone and that it is in order that we hold them without any worries that we might use them.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the amendments on the crossbows and stun guns.  There was long debate on those in this House.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we are dealing with the prevention of crime and I welcome the Minister to this House with these amendments. We have a much better Bill leaving this House today after the amendments made in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the amendments and to express satisfaction at the fact that the Minister has accepted a number of amendments which improve the legislation.  It is in the interests of society and in our own interest that we ensure that the people whose job it is to enforce the law are given clear legislation. The series of amendments that the Minister has brought into the House this afternoon will improve and clarify the situation something which is clearly in the interest of the ordinary person in the street.  There is no doubt that bank robbers or people with malintent who use toy weapons or imitation weapons, use them for an unlawful purpose and they should be dealt with as severely as if they had the real thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> I hope the improved Bill, which is about to be passed, will be enforced to the fullest degree.  I know that this is slightly outside the scope of this Stage.  I support the amendments, they improve the Bill and I hope the police will find that they have stronger legislation with which to uphold the law and provide the protection to which our society is entitled.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the legislation and I hope it will stem the use of dangerous weapons.  It is a sad craze in recent times that so many people are seriously injured and have their lives put at risk by particular young people for very trivial reasons.  You read about it in the newspapers on a daily basis.  I hope that this Bill will warn young people that we will not tolerate that behaviour.  I hope it will stem the incidence of tourists being attacked and thus improve our image.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>At the outset I wish to acknowledge the courtesy extended to me by Senators Neville, O'Donovan, Honan, McDonald and Byrne and thank them for their interest in the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to the replica equipment mentioned by senators, the Minister is aware of the concern in this area and has explained the difficulty in totally banning these.  However, I can assure the House that he will continue to monitor the situation. Senator O'Donovan is right in saying that toys are a problem.  I would like to indicate to Senator McDonald that the same penalty applies whether a person uses a real or an imitation weapon to commit an offence.  The use of an imitation weapon will not be a defence for them; the same penalty will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to thank all Senators who contributed to this debate today and in former times.  Perhaps some of the Senators who contributed previously are no longer with us in this House.  This is important legislation.  That view has been expressed by the Members <Col N="731" /> who have spoken today.  The amendments which have been made to it during its passage through both Houses will increase its effectiveness, as Members have said.  The manner in which this measure has been received and debated reflects well on our legislative system and on the democratic process.  Concern was expressed about the length of time it has taken to conclude the Bill.  Senator Honan made the point that it is better to give plenty of time to debate the Bill to ensure that the Bill which is put into law will be effective.  It is well worth discussing to get it right first time.  This has happened in this case.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, I do not have to remind Senators of the problems which have given rise to the need for this legislation &mdash; the increase in the use of arms and violence in the perpetration of crime and the senseless use of knives and similar weapons on our streets.  Only very recently we have seen the wanton stabbing to dealth of two young men who were visitors to our country.  The Minister is determined that this type of mindless thuggery should be stopped.  The measures in this Bill, which place very strict controls on the carrying of knives, etc., will help us to achieve this in a significant and effective way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to assure Senators that it is his intention that the provisions of the Bill which will outlaw stun guns and oblige the owner of a crossbow to obtain a firearm's certificate, should come into operation as quickly as possible.  This will require a separate commence order which will be made as soon as arrangements are in place for the issuing for the appropriate firearms' certificates.  Persons who have either stun guns or crossbows have been notified of the new requirements and given sufficient time to comply with them.  Mar a deirimid sa Gaeilge, más maith is mithid.</P>
    <P>With regard to the categories of weapons which will be prohibited under section 12, the Minister will at an early stage be making appropriate regulations to ensure that dangerous items such as flick knives cannot be imported or sold <Col N="732" /> in the State.  A full list of the weapons which will be prohibited under the section is being drawn up in consultation with the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude as I began by thanking the House for its co-operation in ensuring that this final Stage of this important legislation is completed.  On behalf of the Minister I want to thank again everybody who contributed and who took such a keen interest on this very welcome Bill and in the amendments that were added to it to give it the effectiveness that all the Members of this House and of the Dáil sought to have included in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome this Bill and I am delighted to be able to make a contribution on it here today.  We all know that Bord na Móna has a yearly turnover of over £120 million and employs close to 4,000 people.  While in 1988 it had an operating profit of £15 million, it had increased payments of £17.7 million.  The board's difficulty is that it is saddled with huge long-term borrowing of £174 million and does not have share capital.  Until this issue is solved Bord na Móna can never attain its true potential.  This is the underlying problem the board has to face.  The future of this debt must be addressed.  It has to be either converted into share capital or written off by the Government.  Unless this is done the board will stumble on from year to year unable to address its future developments in a commercial way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board faces difficult years ahead, as it is in urgent need of major funds to capitalise on the development of new products which have passed the research <Col N="733" /> and development stage and are now on the commercial market.  The first of these is the Puraflow septic tank effluent treatment system using peat fibres and the second is the Biofar odour removal system, again using peat fibre.  Already the latter has been installed by 15 major companies in Ireland.  It has other products still in the research and development stage but it is unable to develop the potential of these because of the lack of finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Science and Technology announced the boards new peat research centre at Newbridge and that £2 million would be given over a three-year period to further the board's research. This, in itself, shows the depth of the Department of Industry and Commerce's confidence in the future of the peat industry. The board's scientists have had a major breakthrough in producing a wide variety of activated carbon grades made from peat.  They are at present looking for a partner to bring these products onto the market place.  However, it seems that even if they do succeed they may be forced to take minor shareholding in the new company because of lack of funds.</P>
    <P>As peat is one of our natural resources, it does not take much imagination to see that the board's products are 100 per cent Irish.  This compares with a 20 per cent Irish input into the electronics industry and other multinational companies' products manufactured in Ireland.  Apart from the board's debts, the other issue that must be addressed is the future of the board's cutaway peatlands.  These can be a major source of income if the board is allowed to obtain full market for these lands as they become available over the next 40 years.  Bord na Móna have acquired 220,000 acres of peatlands for peat extraction, 200,000 of these being the raised bog type, all situated in the midlands.  Of these only 2,000 to 3,000 acres are still virgin bog; the rest are at various stages of cutting.  The remaining 22,000 acres is made up as follows: 20,000 acres of blanket peatland in Mayo, which is used for ESB generating stations, and 2,000 acres of peatland.</P>
    <P>To date the board have sold off, or <Col N="734" /> leased, their cutaway bogs.  Because of consecutive Governments' insistence 7,500 acres had to be leased over 60 years to the Forestry Department for the sum of £16 annually.  Bord na Móna, in other words, is acting as banker for forestry. Grasslands of 1,200 acres have been sold for £1 million, or £850 per acre.  The conversion costs of an acre of cutaway peatland to grassland is between £350 and £450 per acre, leaving an average net profit of £430 for the board.  The Minister for Energy has amended the new Bord na Móna Bill so that the board will not be forced to sell or lease all their cutaway bogs for forestry.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the Turf Development Bill is good because it will give a new lease of life to Bord na Móna.  We all know that morale in the company has been at a very low ebb and there have been very many redundancies.  There was no great sign of expansion and workers were very unsure of the future.  Many of the employees wondered if there was any future for Bord na Móna and whether they should get out now.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a breath of fresh air, a midland breeze perfumed by the heathers, as the song says.  The Bill can only be helpful for the future of Bord na Móna.  I do not mean that as a criticism of the old Bord na Móna or their predecessors in the forties, the Turf Development Board.  I would like to pay tribute to the pioneers of Bord na Móna who cut the first drains in our bogs and worked hard to make a success of a farsighted enterprise.  I had members on both my mother's and father's side of the family who started in Bord na Móna in Coolnagun in 1946 and it is for that very reason I am extremely familiar with the day-to-day running of that type of industry. They filled our fuel needs when we had no other fuels and they brought prosperity to the midlands.  They were the people who changed the term &ldquo;bogman&rdquo; from meaning Yeti or the Abominable Snowman to a term of endearment which we now associate with the haunting music of the Marino Waltz.</P>

Senator McDonald has a habit of interrupting a good speech.  Many of the early Bord na Móna workers have retired, were made redundant or have gone to their eternal reward.  I want to pay tribute to them for their toil and effort.  They built the railways, mechanised turf production and their engineering expertise designed and produced the type of machine best suited to out terrain.  They branched out into the production of turf briquettes and machine won turf, peat moss, horticulture and agriculture and they even undertook pilot schemes despite the restrictions which were placed on them under the old Act.  It gives me great pleasure coming from north Westmeath, to highly commend the great contribution that Bord na Móna made, particularly in the Coolnagun area, to the social and economic welfare of the people of north Westmeath.  We in north Westmeath from the villages of Coole, Castletown, Finea, Multyfarnham, Rathowen, Street, Boherquill, Ballinacargy, Ballinglach, Ballinafid, Fore, Collinstown, Crooked Wood, Delvin, the town of Castlepollard and the town of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thank you.  Those parts of north Westmeath are experiencing high emigration because Bord na Móna <Col N="736" /> have closed down their bog in Coolnagun. I am making a plea today to the Minister.  The commitment given by the people since 1946 has been 100 per cent. Bord na Móna employed up to 50 per cent of the people in those little towns or villages in north Westmeath.  If you take the village of Tyrellspass, where they employed 80 per cent of the workforce, you can see how devastated we are in Westmeath since the closure of the bog in that part of the country.  We have 3,000 to 4,000 acres of virgin bog untouched in Melcana and I do not know why, with all their research and expertise, something cannot be done to create jobs in that part of Westmeath.  I remember as a very young boy seeing 50 or 60 lorries, tractors and trailers passing my door from 5.30 a.m. and queuing in Coolnagun for the sod turf that was produced there.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna were a tremendous employer but we must remember the dedicated workforce who often worked two shifts for 14 or 16 hours a day and continued to keep that bog and that part of the country going down through the years.  I want to pay tribute to those people who have gone before us, who went out in all kinds of weather and often stood to their waist in water cutting the drains in those early days.  In north Westmeath we have very high emigration and the board have an obligation to the people of the area.  They cannot just close a bog down and walk away, especially when there is so much land there ideally suited for peat moss production.  There are almost 4,000 acres and I would ask the Minister to come down and inspect this fantastic resource.  In one parish in the Castletown-Finea end there was 22 per cent emigration in two and a half years.  It gives me no pleasure to stand up here today to make a plea on behalf of the people of that parish, in which I myself live.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I look forward to making another contribution on Committee Stage and on behalf of the people of north Westmeath I sincerely hope there is something in it to create jobs in that part of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on this Bill.  During the course of this debate many tributes have been paid to Bord na Móna but a certain amount of criticism has also been levelled at the company.  I believe that much of this criticism is justified but I also believe that the board should be given credit where credit is due.  For that reason I would like to be associated with the tributes paid to Bord na Móna for the contribution the company has made to the economic and social development of the country, especially in <Col N="738" /> the midlands region, since it was set up in 1946.</P>
      <P>Those of us who come from the midlands region have seen this contribution at first hand.  When Bord na Móna were set up, their functions were restricted essentially to the extraction and sale of turf.  In the early days, this was very labour intensive work which provided mainly seasonal employment but it provided employment for great numbers of workers because much of the work in those days had to be done by hand and on a piece-work basis.  It was not unusual to see whole families employed in the bogs saving the turf.  All this changed as machinery was developed to do this work.</P>
      <P>Over the years since their establishment, the board embarked on a number of development programmes but in the main these programmes were aimed at expanding the main revenue generating activities of the board, namely, the production and sale of mill peat, sod peat, peat briquettes and moss peat.  During the seventies, as a result of the various fuel crises and the rapidly escalating costs of imported energy, there was a major expansion in mill peat production for electricity generation and for industrial and commercial use.  Bord na Móna were now a major industry directly employing over 6,000 people throughout the year as well as generating a considerable amount of spin-off employment in areas such as engineering, construction and allied industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consequent effect of this employment on the economy in the catchment areas of the boards enterprises was substantial. Many of these areas did not have the potential for attracting other types of industry or providing alternative employment. In these areas the farms were mainly small and the land for the most part was marginal but, because of the cashflow generated by Bord na Móna pay packets, population levels in these areas were maintained.  The off-farm income provided by Bord na Móna kept the people in these rural areas.  The small towns and villages prospered.  Schools <Col N="739" /> remained viable.  Emigration was the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna underpinned the social and economic structure of these communities so it is fitting, therefore, that tributes should be paid to the board for the way in which they fulfilled their social obligations and for the enormous contribution which they made to the economy of the regions in which their operations were based.  That contribution has continued over the past 40 years. Unfortunately, however, from the seventies onwards there was a serious and steady deterioration in the financial situation of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister said in his speech that because the issue of the board's financial position is being comprehensively reviewed at present it was not his intention to comment on the matter during the course of this debate. In view of that statement by the Minister I will not dwell on the matter in any great detail but there are a few comments which should be made because it is sometimes implied that all the board's financial difficulties were the result of incompetence, inefficiency or bad management on the part of the board and that no-one else was in any way responsible for the difficult financial situation in which the board now find themselves.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that the largescale development operations which the board became involved in required considerable expenditure.  These development operations were undertaken at the request of successive Governments and in response to the public demand for greater use of indigenous energy resources.</P>
    <P>During the development stage of a bog there is little or no financial return and between land acquisition, drainage and other development work many years can elapse between the time a Bord na Móna scheme is initiated and the stage at which the bog begins to yield revenue.  The board had to meet expenditure on their development programmes and related capital charges mainly from borrowing. <Col N="740" /> High interest rates added to the difficulties as did the Government price controls to which the board's products were subject.  In addition, the difficulties were exacerbated by a succession of some very bad years from a weather point of view. The point I am endeavouring to make is that it should be accepted that the present financial situation in which Bord na Móna now find themselves was brought about by a combination of factors some of which the board had very little control over.  Of course, I accept their marketing strategies also left a lot to be desired.  I do hope, however, that the review to which the Minister referred will result in steps being taken to ensure that these financial difficulties can be dealt with in such a way that they will not inhibit the board's capacity to exploit the new opportunities which this Bill will open up.  These opportunities will be many and varied.  The board will be permitted to promote, form, take part in or acquire companies either within the State or abroad and to enter into joint ventures.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables the board to undertake engineering and building works and other activities not strictly related to peat and also to engage in the provision of consultancy, advisory and training services. The Bill will ensure also that the board will have a major role to play in the development of cutaway bogs.  New opportunities will be opened up at home and abroad for the board as a result of this legislation and this is to be welcomed. The board will be judged in the future on the degree of success achieved in exploiting these new business opportunities.</P>
    <P>In order to enable the board to speed up the decision-making process within the company and also to enable a more thorough examination of specific areas of their activities to be undertaken, the Bill provides for the establishment of sub-boards and the delegation to these sub-boards of certain functions of the main board.  This provision is also to be welcomed and is in line with the procedures which operate in most successful businesses.</P>
    <P>During the course of his speech, the Minister referred to the initiatives which <Col N="741" /> have been taken in recent times by Bord na Móna to reduce costs.  These measures included the introduction of a voluntary redundancy scheme and the phasing in of a contract or piece work system as an alternative to the direct labour system which was the norm in Bord na Móna in the past.  Some of these changes and developments were not what many of the workers would have wished but I believe it is a tribute to the dedication and the realism of the workers that these changes were accepted as being necessary to ensure the future of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>During earlier contributions a number of Senators, particularly Senators Hussey and Finneran, referred to the briquette factory which was proposed for Ballyforan some years ago and to the group of bogs in that area of south Roscommon and east Galway.  I would also like to refer to the situation that developed there.  There is approximately 10,000 acres of bogland in that area and up to the early eighties most of that bogland was in the ownership of hundreds of small farmers in the south Roscommon and Galway area.  These bogs were acquired by Bord na Móna, and indeed in most cases the owners of the bogs sold them to Bord na Móna at very nominal prices on the understanding that the bog was required for the development of a briquette factory at Ballyforan.  We were all told that between the bog and the factory there would be between 400 and 500 workers employed there for the next 40 years.  A clear commitment was given to the development of the Derryfada group of bogs as they are known and to the establishment of that briquette factory.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran went into great detail in relation to what transpired subsequently but, in any event, having spent between £5 million and £5.5 million on the development of these bogs a decision was taken not to proceed with the setting up of the briquette factory.  It is very understandable that there was great disappointment in that area at the decision. I have a letter which I received from the then Minister for Energy in 1988 assuring <Col N="742" /> me that the board would review the Ballyforan briquette factory position each time the question of increasing capacity arose and he also stated in the letter that the board were carrying out research and development work in peat fibre extraction and activated carbon manufacture from peat and if a commercial venture arose from this work they would consider the suitability of Ballyforan.</P>
    <P>I join with Senators Hussey and Finneran in appealing to the Minister to request Bord na Móna to bring forward proposals as a matter of urgency for the development of these bogs so that at least some of the employment which was promised to that area will materialise.  I hope that the opportunity provided by this legislation to Bord na Móna to diversify and develop new products and to seek new markets will ensure that the pattern of diminishing employment which we have seen in recent times will be reversed and that once again Bord na Móna will provide an increasing number of jobs in rural Ireland.  In the belief and in the hope that this will happen, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to make brief comments on this Bill.  I am pleased the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport is in the House representing the Minister for Energy mainly because the two areas I have an interest in and would like to comment on are the tourism aspect of the decision that will be taken allowing Bord na Móna to set up separate companies and take equity in other companies.  The Minister of State in replying to Second Stage might expand a litle on that aspect of the legislation which will allow Bord na Móna to dispose of cutaway bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the speech the Minister for Energy made to the House he referred to the future use of cutaway bogs &mdash; these are bogs which have been substantially cleared of turf &mdash; and quite correctly stated that it is of great importance to Bord na Móna because some 2,500 acres of cutaway bog will become available for the board's operations each year over the <Col N="743" /> next decade.  It is not just of importance to Bord na Móna; it is of national importance. Obviously any proposals that will increase our tourist potential must be welcomed and although the Minister does not go any further in his speech, he indicates his thinking about cutaway bogs by saying he recently established an independent expert committee to examine in depth the potential use or uses of cutaway bog and to recommend measures to ensure that the land is put to the best possible use.  The particular terms of reference require that the committee examine the competing demands of forestry and agriculture/horticulture and amenity uses of the cutaway bogs.  It is in that context I would be interested in the Minister's thoughts on the matter both in the context of his reply for Energy and wearing his other hat as Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport.</P>
    <P>I come from a part of the country which has not, sad to say, had a tradition of Bord na Móna employment although we are surrounded by it in several counties. My colleague, Senator Mullooly, referred in great detail to the tradition that Bord na Móna built up in my neighbouring County of Roscommon and Longford has also had a high Bord na Móna input from an industrial employment point of view.  It does, however, give me an opportunity to ask the rhetorical question: what benefits will accrue from this legislation to those areas of the country where Bord na Móna have traditionally provided employment?</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board have a tradition of creating employment in County Leitrim and North Roscommon but, sad to say, as we speak in this House decisions are being taken in Fitzwilliam Square which will impact very severely on the economy of that whole region. Having said that, no proposals of any substance have emerged from the Electricity Supply Board in relation to jobs and the legacy they should leave when they close down their coal-burning station at Lough Allen.  It is the parallel question I ask; once given the powers in <Col N="744" /> this Bill, will Bord na Móna decide to pull out of areas of the country where they have traditionally given employment and become involved in non-energy operations?  The Electricity Supply Board are involved in consultancy operations and with computer companies yet, according to their annual report, they have not been seen to have provided employment in those areas where they traditionally provided it.  Perhaps it is a little premature to ask why because it is only over the next decade that the ESB and Bord an Móna will be rationalising their activities but rationalisation, sadly, inevitably means closure and loss of jobs.</P>

      <P>We have very clean air in County Leitrim and we would like to keep it that way.  I approach the proposals in this legislation with a certain degree of caution.  It is all very well to put in place legislation which, in theory, sounds good and reads good.  For example, the Bill will allow Bord na Móna to engage in joint ventures in relation to business as extended and defined in the Bill both in the State and abroad.  Yet, the experience of the ESB to date has shown that while they are engaging in joint ventures, the one non-energy activity that they are involved in which is fish farming on the west coast and Poulnaphouca&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Leas-Cathaoirleach's comments.  I hope the Minister will understand that the only experience this House has of legislation of this sort is that which was implemented allowing the ESB to do precisely what it is proposed to allow Bord na Móna to do.  I am suggesting that while perhaps the legislation in theory may be welcome, the reality is different; in other words, actions speak louder than words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that when Bord na Móna are <Col N="745" /> given these powers they involve themselves in the local communities.  The closure of some bogs and the subsequent loss of jobs will make the situation more acute, as has been pointed out by several of my colleagues on all sides of the House, particularly in the midlands and the lower midlands area where Bord na Móna have traditionally provided employment.  The experience to date of other semi-State bodies does not inspire a great deal of confidence in Bord na Móna once they are given this power creating the type of long-term viable alternative industries that will be needed to stabilise the communities, particularly rural communities where there has not been a tradition of industrial development or where perhaps infrastructure is poor.  It is in that context and spirit that I refer to the obligation on semi-State bodies such as Bord na Móna and the ESB to provide alternative long-term employment.</P>
    <P>Overall, this is unique legislation.  It is allowing yet another semi-State body to involve itself in the marketplace with the minimum of restriction.  One can only welcome this initiative from the Government and hope that Bord na Móna, as they have in the past with the exception of recent years when they experienced some financial trading difficulties, will rise to the occasion and that the provisions in the Bill will enable them to provide the type of employment this country needs to keep its sons and daughters at home.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille agus roimh an Aire Stáit anseo. Bhí caint an lá faoi dheireadh faoi ainm an Bhille seo, ar cheart &ldquo;Turf Development&rdquo; nó &ldquo;Peat Development&rdquo; a thabhairt air.  Maidir liomsa níl fadhb ar bith ann, Bille Forbartha na Móna atá ann domsa agus níl ach an t-aon fhocal amháin sa Ghaeilge ar an bhfocal sin.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil an-tábhacht leis an mBille agus leis an díospóireacht seo, go mór mhór do na ceantair lár tíre.  Ó cuireadh Bord na Móna ar bun tá go leor fostaíochta cruthaithe aige, agus tá go leor den phobal i lár na tíre ag brath <Col N="746" /> ar an bhfostaíocht sin chun iad féin a choinneáil beo.</P>
      <P>Is dóigh faoi cheann fiche bliain go mbeidh deireadh ag teacht le ré na bportach, mar atá eolas againn orthu, i lár na tíre agus beidh orainn féachaint chuige nach gcuirfidh sé sin deireadh leis na daoine atá sna ceantair sin.</P>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill, in particular the opportunity to discuss the implications of the Bill and the changes that are taking place due to the limited nature of our bogs.  The first aspect we have to look at is the effect on people. We have to look on the communities whose economies over the last 30 or 40 years have revolved around the midland bogs particularly, and who now look to us to provide in the future alternatives that will allow those communities to continue to flourish and develop.</P>
      <P>Secondly, although we are told all the time that energy prices are stable and are likely to remain so, we must keep in mind, that it is only over 20 years ago when we also thought that was so.  Therefore, the idea of maintaining as long as possible an indigenous alternative energy resource in active use is very important from a national point of view.  The role that Bord na Móna play in providing us with indigenous energy should not be underestimated.  It should be maintained as the core business of the board in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>When we come to examine Bord na Móna it is important to look at the whole question of the vibrancy of State companies. Every time I travel through the midlands, particularly through the bog areas, it gives me a sense of pride to see those cooling towers and buildings.  They are a tribute to the vision and the belief the people who founded Bord na Móna had in the possibility of using indigenous resources and of creating employment in areas which had not, up to that, had industrial development.  It also belies the belief that people in rural areas can neither handle technology nor industry because in a very hostile environment Bord na Móna created an industry that gave employment and also an innovation that stood as a model.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> However, we have to question what went wrong with some of our flagship State companies in the past 20 or 30 years, what went wrong that the spirit of enterprise and development they exhibited in their early years might not have been exhibited in such form later on.  To remain viable in the modern world one has to go forward.  One of the dangers I see is that after a while when something is successful a certain complacency builds up and the old ways become permanent even though the world around is changing. Therefore, it is very important when we are discussing this Bill to consider, in a totally new way, what forms and structures most suit the requirements of the 1990s and of the next century.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill to widen the remit of Bord na Móna.  I have always believed that company articles of association and, similarly, the powers of a company or a State board like Bord na Móna should in their essence be as wide as possible to allow flexibility in approach. I have always believed it is unsuitable for a board of any company to be hamstrung by very limited terms of reference.</P>
    <P>There is mention in the Bill regarding the setting up of sub-boards.  I will go further and say that totally new structures should be considered in the case of Bord na Móna, that in the changed world with improved education and communications perhaps certain parts of that company, certain geographic areas within the remit of Bord na Móna, should be given more autonomy in the running of their own part of the business.  I have seen from my own experience an infinite number of possibilities; for example, the idea that you would have separate production units in the different areas in the different bogs with common marketing facilities is something worth considering.  We should never accept because something is there it always has to remain as it is.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the financial difficulties of Bord na Móna.  I accept that they are great.  When we look at State companies we have to clear our minds as to how this arose; particularly we have to compare like with like.  If <Col N="748" /> Bord na Móna were an ordinary private company investing in the type of development they did they would have been eligible for considerable grants from the grant-aiding authorities but because they were a State board obviously this was not so.  Furthermore, due to circumstances at the time, in lieu of the grants that would have been given to private enterprise the share capital was not provided.  Instead, most of their cash requirement and capital requirement was funded out of borrowing and this put them at an unfair disadvantage.  When the financial performance of the board at present or in the past is being considered, the fact that Bord na Móna's capital development was either funded from own resources or from borrowing primarily has to be taken into account and also the continuing employment they have given.</P>
    <P>On that issue of organisational administration, I have always felt it is a great pity that the headquarters of Bord na Móna, something that is based in rural Ireland, are situated in this city.  If ever there was a case for decentralisation it is there in this case.  I see no good reason why the headquarters of an organisation would not be basically situated in the main area of activity of that organisation.</P>
    <P>The bogs and the cutaway bogs, if we use our imagination will become an asset we could develop to maintain the employment and development of those areas now dependent on turf production.  I am not convinced that all this development should take place necessarily under the aegis of one centralised State board.  Our experience has been that, when a board like this get too many components it is very hard to maintain centralised and efficient control.  Therefore, irrespective of what form the various agencies, boards, companies or whatever take, it should be remembered that the development of cutaway bogs is done by people and agencies who specialise in the various uses to which cutaway bogs could be put. The other contributors to this debate have dealt with the possible uses that could be made of cutaway bogs in some detail.  I do not intend to cover this aspect here except to say that our aim must <Col N="749" /> be at all times to maintain the energy, development and the communities that have been based on the work of Bord na Móna and which, as the bogs become exhausted, will have to be based on new developments in these areas.</P>
    <P>On an issue that is not central to this Bill but is related to the whole question of bog development, the bog development grants of a few years ago which enable people in rural areas to build roads and access to small bogs should be reinstated. In many parts of the country there is a considerable extent of bog, which is not the type of commercial bog that would be of interest to Bord na Móna.  Nevertheless these bogs have provided fuel and income to small farmers over a long period and will, if used wisely, continue to do so in the future.  The opening up for limited use of these bogs should be encouraged.  I have no doubt that this can be done in a way that is also in keeping with the best environmental uses that could be made of them.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the environment, particularly to the possible conflict between development in the case of Clifden and the preservation of peatland for conservation reasons.  This is a live issue for the people of Connemara.  I would like to put it on the record of the House that the ordinary people of that area are as concerned as anybody to preserve the environment, to use it to its best effect and also to use it as a tourist resort.  However, there will always be a conflict between legitimate development and conservation.  We are striving to strike the right balance.  There is common consensus in Connemara for banning the use of the so-called sausage machine in small bogs because of the environmental damage it causes and because of the damage it does to bogs in rural areas. The question remains as to whether we will go so far along the road of the protection of the environment that we will stop all development and in this way we will probably damage the most unique part of our environment in that part of the country, that is, we will damage the livelihoods of people and at the end of the day we will find we will have preservation <Col N="750" /> orders to preserve the people of that part of the country from extinction.  These are the real problems I face every day on the ground when dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>On certain issues the people are unanimous in favour of the environment.  On other issues they are in favour of limited development where they see that the advantages of development outweigh any minimal damage that might be caused to the environment in these areas.  When we talk about protection of the environment, alternative uses in tourism and so on, it is incumbent on the people, who promote these ideas to ensure that the developments they talk about so blithely are actually carried out and that the alternative employment that will have to be provided is provided and does not just remain a matter of rhetoric and a good arguing point for a debating chamber.  When we are discussing these issues we are discussing the livelihood of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>To cut with a sleán the bog they own or have access to is for many people a very important part of their life.  This is not only so for older people but many young people with good jobs would feel very aggrieved if their right to cut a turf bank in their own area, which is worth quite a bit of money to them, was denied to them.  The possible environmental damage caused by such work is so minimal as to be negligible and the traditional rights of people who have been carrying out this practice and which does not cause any appreciable damage to the environmental, will have to be protected.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé ag an tús, ba mhaith liom fáilte mhór a chur roimh an mBille seo, ní amháin faoin méid atá ann ach faoin deis a thugann sé anois tabhairt faoi athnuachan iomlán a dhéanamh ar Bhord na Móna agus ar na ceantair sin atá ag brath ar an mbord sin le 40 nó 50 de bhlianta.

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment Senator Ó Cuív on what I regard as a comprehensive and thoughtful contribution. I agree with most of what he said particularly in regard to Bord na Móna, the lack of capital investment in terms of equity from the State as distinct from borrowing from the banks which has turned the whole operation into a sort of millstone around Bord na Móna's neck and made it very difficult for them to make progress in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>In relation to the decentralisation of the headquarters, it is most appropriate for the headquarters of a rural-based organisation like Bord na Móna to be located in the country, particularly in the midlands where most of their activities take place.  It certainly is an anomalous situation that such a headquarters be based in Dublin.</P>
      <P>In relation to bog development grants, coming from a small rural area in County Sligo, I spent many a day on the bog.  I appreciate what could be done in relation to roads and access to small bogs to enable the ordinary small farmer to have ready access to an indigenous fuel supply.</P>
      <P>The environment certainly has had a low priority in all of this debate and there is no provision made in relation to that in the Bill.  It is becoming increasingly a major issue in relation to the destruction of our natural habitat in all areas of the countryside.  I give a very guarded response to this Bill.  It is like the old curate's egg, it looks good in some parts and looks bad in other parts.  I fear there may very well be hidden in the Bill provision for the break-up of Bord na Móna and, indeed, provision for what I would describe as creeping privatisation in that sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill, as stated in the explanatory memorandum is to update and amend the Turf Development Acts 1946 to 1983, to allow the board to promote, form, take part in or acquire companies &mdash; which sounds very acceptable &mdash; to delegate some of the functions of the board to sub-boards, which, on the surface, looks very desirable, and to engage in activities not strictly related to peat.  It is very desirable that there is <Col N="752" /> diversification in the operations of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>When I look back on the establishment of Bord na Móna in 1946 and look at the context in which so much semi-State industry was established in the first half of this century, I see the type of rationale, thinking and principles that were brought to bear on it &mdash; Bord na Móna were very much a central part of that thinking &mdash; that the State would get involved in the development of indigenous industry and that it would seek to provide necessary capital because there was very little private capital around.  This was a very desirable approach to industrial development and to the use of natural resources.  We were quite right in the early days of this State to have that approach.  It was a combined approach; economic development on the one hand and social concern on the other.  There were major problems of unemployment throughout the country, major problems of emigration and Bord na Móna, like so many other semi-State industries, were established for that dual purpose, to provide employment but also to ensure that the worst aspects of the poverty in the country would be alleviated and some steps taken to prevent emigration.  Those were very desirable objectives of the founding fathers of the State even though it was not until 1946 that the board were established under the Act.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have been a success for very many years.  Despite the criticism that has come in recent times from the private sector about all the lame ducks in the public sector, it was imaginative.  I listened to Brendan O'Regan talking about the development of Shannon and the amount of imagination and vision that went into that by Irish business people, initiatives that had not been developed elsewhere.  The same thing took place in many ways in the early days in Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna were to the fore in the development and manufacture of machinery and equipment that was sold worldwide.  Bord na Móna were concerned with research and development, which is very much lacking in the private sector at present.  We have the worst <Col N="753" /> research and development record of any country in the EC in the private sector. Bord na Móna were to the fore in that area and were to the fore in their products. It was not simply turf that was produced: Bord na Móna produced briquettes, milled peat, peat moss, peat fibre, all the horticultural products that have been sold internationally as well as at home.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious developments which took place was in the seventies when we had the oil crisis and, in a panic situation, a decision was taken at that time to try to get Bord na Móna to expand their activity, their production, and in the process vast borrowings resulted.  From that point, Bord na Móna became a large debtor to the private banking institutions. The result is that we have huge annual losses and interest of £20 million per annum due to the banks.  We have this major problem where not having State equity the board went into the area of private borrowing and, thereby, incurred the type of debts that have taken place since.  That was fuelled by some very bad harvests because of bad weather, with the result that there were a lot of redundancies and the workforce has been halved throughout the eighties.  While productivity and efficiency have improved, nevertheless the workforce has declined either through voluntary redundancy or simply being shed over the years.</P>
    <P>The Government thought that by having a massive development of peat as an alternative source of energy, progress would be made in that area.  However, the end result was counter-productive. Now with prices falling the State have moved into a different arena of energy. The ESB, for example, are now concentrating entirely in Moneypoint with indigenous resources of coal in Arigna and peat in the midlands being put at risk.  The State shifts from one priority to another without sufficient concern for the implications of what they are doing.  In the eighties, four peat works were closed down in Donegal, Galway, Westmeath and Offaly and Arigna is about to close in July.  I have no doubt that Ferbane will <Col N="754" /> be threatened next from what I regard as shortsighted energy policies.</P>
    <P>This Bill certainly looks like a desirable development Bill on the surface. However, I have a number of questions in relation to what the actual implications of some of the sections are and whether the implications are compatible with the principles and objectives of the Principal Act of 1946.  For example, section 2 enables the board to participate in companies and provides for consultations with other Ministers before such participation. What is covered here is the promotion, formation and taking part in or acquisition of other companies.  Does that mean, effectively, that Bord na Móna will degenerate into a series of segmented fragments and become a number of companies as distinct from a coherent unit?  Is it a means to weaken the semi-State body by reducing it to a conglomeration of sub-companies thereby giving rise to privatisation on the one hand, and to redundancies on the other?  The task force of 1987 recommended that Bord na Móna should be broken up and new companies formed. Is this the purpose behind the section? Will the Bill streamline the activities of Bord na Móna through delegation of authority and functions, or will it simply establish a conglomeration of fragmented elements that will spell the death-knell of Bord na Móna?  I would like the Minister to address that point.  In other words, is there a hidden agenda behind that section?</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a continuation of section 2 in that it makes provision for the establishment of sub-boards.  What is the purpose of these sub-boards?  Will they be new bureaucratic layers of authority or will they have a function in streamlining the operations of the board?  What exactly are their functions?  Is the work being allocated to the sub-boards not capable of being done within Bord na Móna itself?  Is the structure necessary?  What is the role of the Minister in this structure?  I fear that both are tied up in terms of new companies and boards and that there will be a hiving-off of the functions and the <Col N="755" /> role of Bord na Móna into fragmented sectors leading to privatisation.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 4.  That the board may engage outside the State in marketing of turf and turf products, production of turf and its products, fostering the production, acquisition of bogs and other lands and so on, are very desirable developments.  That is the type of diversification that can give dynamism to an organisation and to a company.  The fact that they are not restricted in terms of their production, marketing, or in any fashion, is a desirable component of the new Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is the continuation of section 4 and is welcome in that it makes provision for manufacture of plants, erecting buildings, entering into contracts, operating shops and showrooms, consultancy service, engaging in same, advisory service and the training of personnel.  All that is an adjunct to the diversification about which we are talking and a very welcome provision.  I note, however, that there is no reference to investment.  What investment capital will be provided? Whence will it be forthcoming?  As Senator Ó Cuív stated, one of the major problems has been the entire aspect of the capital development, where the investment capital came from and the fact that in recent times it was seen as having been borrowed from private banking institutions, rather than an independent State equity in the development. We will perhaps end up with a profit-making company but they could have more debts than profits.  If Bord na Móna are going into new ventures they need all this research and development; the last thing they need is another millstone of a major debt around their neck.</P>
    <P>I have some concern in relation to section 9.  I note that in recent legislation in relation to CIE and the ESB there were no restrictions in regard to pay and conditions for their staff.  Therefore, why, in relation to remuneration of the officers and servants of Bord na Móna, should there be a need for ministerial and Government interference?</P>
    <P>My major criticism is in relation to the <Col N="756" /> question of financing the company.  How will Bord na Móna make progress if they are under-financed and there is no provision for new structures, developments and ventures on which they are to embark?  The existing debt still remains. Will the Government convert the outstanding debts into Government equity rather than continuing with their lending policy?  Will there be an injection of new State equity into the company?</P>
    <P>The environment is not covered in the Bill; there is no provision for protection of the environment.  Great sections of our country are now being taken over either in terms of cutaway bogs or afforestation. This is happening on a large scale at present, not to talk of the developments that are taking place in Clifden in relation to conservation.  These matters are not being addressed at present and future legislation dealing with rural development should address aspects of conservation.</P>
    <P>Finally, legislation that deals with a company of this nature deals with the livelihood, employment and conditions of the people, and is central to it.  Will this Bill improve employment prospects or will it increase redundancies?  Those questions are central to the issue.  Is the Bill in accordance with the principles of the 1946 legislation which took on board economic and social factors?  What is the Minister's vision of the development of Bord na Móna?  I believe that there is a hidden agenda in this legislation which may cause the destruction of Bord na Móna as a company and as a unit in their own right and may lead to privatisation, fragmentation and redundancies.  I ask the Minister to address those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill to the House.  I would like to pay tribute to the great men who set up Bord na Móna over 40 years ago.  They were men of vision and at the time the valuable employment that was provided here was much needed and appreciated.  The staff who worked in Bord na Móna down through the years worked under very difficult conditions until Bord na Móna modernised their <Col N="757" /> equipment.  Those men should be complimented also because the conditions under which they worked were very severe.  I am well aware of this because even though some people may think to the contrary, Bord na Móna did not develop only in some areas.  In my own county we have a very modern briquette factory in Littleton which is much appreciated by the people who work there.  They have an excellent staff and their employment is appreciated by the people in the area.  I am somewhat disappointed with their lack of activities in other areas, particularly in connection with the sale, promotion and presentation of briquettes.  For example, picture an old age pensioner on a wet evening trying to handle a bale of briquettes.  That person might have to take it up to the end of the town or bring it even farther afield.  It is a very awkward article to handle.  In this modern age Bord na Móna should wake up and provide a more modern way of presenting the simple bale of briquettes, if only to make it more convenient for old people.</P>
      <P>Up to recently there was a monopoly in the sale of briquettes and turf.  Until very recently turf and briquettes were not distributed.  Is it any wonder that people turned away from using turf and briquettes?  That is sad when we are trying to create jobs and make the people already employed in these areas secure. I am pleased that that barrier is broken. The presentation of briquettes leaves a lot to be desired and I hope the Minister will look into that.</P>
      <P>We hear a great deal about smog. Thank God we do not have it down the country but it is a problem in Dublin and Bord na Móna fell down badly over the last year or two in not promoting the advantages of using briquettes.  They failed miserably.  They should make a greater effort in the coming winter to encourage people to use briquettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will help to develop and create new opportunities for our younger workforce in the nineties and in the years ahead to develop new products.  I have faith in the Minister, he made some welcome changes in the Bill and I wish it <Col N="758" /> every success.  However, I again harp back to the antiquated system of the promotion, sale and distribution of briquettes.  I would appeal to the Minister to get the people concerned off their backsides and to sell a more attractive product which is easier, particularly for old people, to handle.  It is difficult for a very fit person, never mind an old age pensioner, to handle the binding on a bale of briquettes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A restructuring of the State enterprise sector has been a fundamental part of every programme for economic development in Europe in the last decade.  The radically different approaches taken in such countries as the Soviet Union, Britain and France, illustrate the importance of this sector to economic development.  In our own case, our State-sponsored companies continue to be of major economic importance and it is immensely encouraging to see the emergence of major success stories in this area.</P>
      <P>The Turf Development Bill is part of the restructuring and energising of the State sector which has been both a major point of policy and a major success of this Government and their predecessors.  The debate over what is commonly called &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; has obscured a much more important debate on the role of companies which remain in the State sector and of how to structure them so that they are economically successful. Commercial State companies should operate commercially and the Bill addresses this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna is a statutory corporation and, as a matter of law, this means that they may do only what is expressly authorised under their statutory provisions.  When Bord na Móna sought to restructure and reform themselves as a commercial organisation the Government faced the fact that many of the changes needed to carry out their development proposals were not legally permitted under their founding legislation and subsequent amendments.  In particular, the company had no power to engage in any activity not strictly related <Col N="759" /> to turf &mdash; even when this was related to its core business &mdash; such as engage in joint ventures, set up subsidiary bodies or companies, develop cutaway bogs commercially, engage in building or engineering works not directly related to bog development or carry out consultancy work.  I would like to deal briefly with each of these areas.</P>
    <P>As legislation stands, it prohibits the company from engaging in any activity not in the strictest terms related to turf or bogs.  When, for example, customers demand that the company, like their competitors in the horticultural industry, supply a range of garden products with its moss peat, it is technically illegal for them to do so.  Another example is that the company have developed the production of activated carbon to a point near to commercialisation but if at any stage they wish, as part of their product range, to use the same equipment to produce activated carbon from products other than peat, it would be technically illegal for them to do so.  Section 3 of this Bill corrects this and allows the company to compete commercially.</P>
    <P>The company have developed a number of products and businesses in the environmental control area where joint ventures with other companies were unlikely to be essential to full commercial development.  It is also likely that progress in moss peat markets in such countries as the Netherlands and Italy will depend, at least to some extent, on joint ventures, and this necessary power is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The structure of the company has been monolithic and out of keeping both with modern technology and contemporary business organisations.  I was surprised to hear Senator Costello talking about one of the things he was worried about.  He obviously has not been very attentive to what is happening in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union when one of the reasons they are having problems at the moment is because they have huge State and semi-State organisations which are devoid of any kind of modern business practice and where one side does not know whether it <Col N="760" /> is making or losing money.  Generally the whole structure there is old and needs to be broken down.  I am glad the Bill allows for the break-up of Bord na Móna and that they can specialise in certain areas. They need to restructure into autonomous divisions and business units making each product area responsible and answerable for profitability.  In some areas limited liability statute will be appropriate.  The necessary powers for restructuring are contained in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Byrne's remarks in relation to briquettes.  Bord na Móna have not been great at developing the briquette market, in Dublin especially. One reason for this is because they are awkward to carry.  There is a huge market in Dublin for briquettes, especially with the problem of smog and the willingness of the consumer to use smokeless fuel. This is an area that Bord na Móna should develop.</P>
    <P>Over the coming years substantial areas of cutaway bogs will become available as older production bogs become worked out.  By the year 2000, approximately 20,000 acres of cutaway bog will have become available for commercial and amenity development as forestry, grassland and lay country.  Section 8 (a) of the Bill gives statutory power for these areas to be developed.  Recently the Minister for Energy set up a committee to advise him on the use of cutaway bogs in the context of the provision of this Bill and this initiative is to be warmly welcomed.</P>
    <P>In section 8 of the Bill the company is given the power to engage in engineering and building works, not necessarily directly related to bog development.  The Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> states that the development of a strong indigenous component of the mechanical engineering industry is essential to the development of the manufacturing sector generally because of the industrial support services.  The document goes on to refer to a number of State companies, including Bord na Móna, as having particular expertise and specialist <Col N="761" /> knowledge in this sector.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> also sets a target for achieving a threefold expansion in turnover in consultancy work by State bodies over five years.  The company have frequently been asked to quote for overseas bog development projects on a consultancy basis but currently they have no authorisation whatsoever to do so.  The Bill will enable a company to participate in this activity both in the developing and in the developed world.</P>
    <P>There are two sectional requirements for State companies to be commercially successful.  The first is for each to have the necessary structures and powers and the second is for the State, as shareholders, to provide the same capital investment as the private sector.  The Bill provides the first of these requirements. In regard to the provision of adequate capital investment, I am sure the Government will show the same dynamism which they have shown in bringing this excellent Bill before the House.  The Bill, in the context of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> is providing Bord na Móna with the necessary legislative authorisation to enable them to expand their existing activities and diversify into other profitable employment-creating activities.  The Bill is part of the Government's implementation of their commitment in paragraph 8 of the programme which states that State-sponsored bodies will be actively encouraged to develop and diversify their economic employment-creating activities and where new legislation is required to achieve this it will be brought forward.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill forward so promptly after taking up office and in steering it successfully through the Dáil. I would also like to congratulate his two predecessors, Minister Ray Burke and Minister Michael Smith, on their involvement with the Bill.  Great credit is due to all three and I thoroughly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí as ucht a gcuid tuairimí <Col N="762" /> suimiúla i dtaobh an Bhille seo agus i dtaobh Bord na Móna go ginearálta.  Is léir ón méid a dúradh gur mór an meas atá agaibh ar an méid atá déanta ag an mBord agus a lucht oibre ó bunaíodh an comhlucht breis agus daichead bliain ó shin.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators for their extensive and interesting comments on this Bill and on what has been said about Bord na Móna in general.  There is obviously a widespread appreciation of the valuable contribution which the board and staff of Bord na Móna have made to the Irish economy since their foundation.</P>
      <P>It is also fair to say that everyone understands and accepts the need for change to ensure the future of the company. Change is an essential feature of everyone's lives these days and the energy market has proved to be particularly vulnerable to change.</P>
      <P>During the debate, some Senators wondered how many years of peat production lie ahead of Bord na Móna.  No one knows the exact answer to this any more than to the question of how much longer world oil reserves will last.  A long life for peat production is expected but this will depend particularly on world energy prices and Bord na Móna's production costs.  World energy prices may be outside our control but it seems reasonable to suppose that they will rise over the next few decades.</P>
      <P>In any event, there is clearly scope for every organisation to influence their own cost levels.  To that extent, the future of peat production lies partly within Bord na Móna's own control.  There is certainly no question of making plans for the rundown of the peat industry.</P>
      <P>I indicated in my opening address that I am considering the various economic issues facing Bord na Móna at present with a view to an early decision on the matter.  The constructive comments which Senators have made in the course of this debate will be given careful consideration when arriving at these important decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is an enabling Bill.  It is mainly intended to <Col N="763" /> extend Bord na Móna's powers so that they can operate outside the State and also to extend their functions to enable them to take a broader view of the commercial opportunities provided by peat and by the expertise which has been built up in the company over the years.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed at the wide-ranging powers being given to Bord na Móna on the one hand and, on the other hand, at the restrictions being imposed due to the need to get the approval of the Ministers for Energy and for Finance.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Senators that it is not the Government's intention that Bord na Móna obliterate any private sector activity in areas such as manufacturing plant or erecting buildings. Neither is it the intention to obstruct viable initiatives by Bord na Móna by requiring every action to have prior ministerial approval.</P>
    <P>The types of powers, functions and controls which are proposed in this Bill already apply to other semi-State companies such as Bord Gáis and the ESB and there has been no difficulty in their practical application.</P>
    <P>A number of issues were raised in the course of this debate which can be dealt with in greater detail on Committee Stage.  It would, however, be useful to respond briefly to a few of the main points mentioned.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole suggested that there is a conflict between sections 4 and 5 of the Bill.  This is not the case.  Section 4 is designed to allow Bord na Móna to expand their operations outside the State.  This is essential if the company are to make full use of the opportunities which are open to them.  The expansion of the horticulture business is especially dependent on Bord na Móna having access to foreign markets not just as a supplier of low-grade raw material but as a supplier of high value-added products for specific markets.</P>
    <P>It is common for semi-State bodies to be required to get approval from Ministers for specific activities.  Ministers and <Col N="764" /> Government act on behalf of the shareholder in these cases and it is perfectly reasonable for shareholders to have a significant influence in a company's affairs.</P>
    <P>Section 5 on the other hand, permits the board to engage in ancillary activities. It does not conflict with section 4 because the ancillary activities must be those which &ldquo;arise out of&rdquo; or can be conducted &ldquo;in conjunction with&rdquo; any function of the board.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to section 10, concerning pay and remuneration for the staff of Bord na Móna.  This section is included in order to ensure that Bord na Móna, in common with other semi-State bodies, adheres to existing Government pay policy and any directives which may be issued from time to time.  It gives statutory power to the Minister to intervene when normal consultation procedures fail.</P>
    <P>This type of residual pay control provision first appeared in the Gas Act, 1976 which established Bord Gáis Éireann and since then successive Governments have extended the provision to other semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred at length to the question of cutaway bogs.  I mentioned when opening this debate that the independent expert committee which I have established will be reporting to me before the end of the year.  That committee have wide-ranging terms of reference which encompass the concerns and views expressed by the Senators and I will ensure that these will be brought to the attention of the committee.</P>
    <P>A few Senators expressed concern at the introduction of sub-boards, suggesting that this is simply being introduced to facilitate the privatisation of Bord na Móna.  This is not the intention. It is simply a necessary modification to the arrangements provided in the 1946 Act so that decisions within Bord na Móna can be made in a less cumbersome manner.</P>
    <P>Senators have repeatedly mentioned the importance of Bord na Móna to the midlands and mid-west, in particular, and <Col N="765" /> the need to ensure that the board continue to provide viable and sustainable employment in these regions.  This Bill is designed to assist the board to achieve that aim and to manage their activities in a profitable and economic manner.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Primary Education: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>concerned that Irish primary education now has the largest classes in the European Community;</P>
      <P>noting the fact that Irish primary education has the lowest per pupil funding and the lowest level of ancillary support in the European Community;</P>
      <P>recognising that approximately 2,000 Irish primary schools have no access to remedial teachers; requests that the Minister</P>
      <P>(i)  indicate her strategy to reduce Irish primary school classes and the Irish pupil teacher ratio to the European average,</P>
      <P>(ii)  outline the procedure she proposes to put in place in order to facilitate those primary teachers who wish to transfer or exchange from one European Community country to another,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>demands the filling of vacant posts for caretakers and clerk typists in primary schools thereby avoiding the impending chaos arising from the inevitable collapse of the Social Employment Scheme for caretakers and clerk typists, <Col N="766" /> being aware that the overlarge classes and poor funding are resulting in serious crises, not least in the area of discipline and literacy,</P>
    <P>further demands a significant increase in the capitation grant for primary schools and the appointment of further remedial teachers and teachers in schools serving disadvantaged pupils, in order to give all our pupils a reasonable chance,</P>
    <P>calls for the establishment of panels of trained, qualified supply teachers,</P>
    <P>and urges the Minister to introduce an early retirement scheme for teachers.</P>
    <P>I am pleased we have a full debate on primary education today and I look forward to the contributions.  Whereas the Government amendment to the motion is one I cannot accept in its entirety as it is written inasmuch as it purports to delete totally the motion, I would be quite happy, willing and able to accept it as an amendment to the main motion should the Minister so indicate.  In that way, we could all vote for each other and show a concerted approach and unanimity on primary education.  It is an offer which the Minister might consider during the course of the debate.  I do not have difficulty with many of the statements in the amendment though I do have with some. However, I am prepared to live with them if the Minister is also prepared to accept my motion.</P>
    <P>The motion, as I have phrased it, simply sets out to state a position, to achieve a certain result and to get a certain response from the Minister.  It also allows the Minister to outline her plans for primary education.  The major problem in primary schools at the moment is the problem of class size.  I have often referred to the Irish primary school education system as the Albania of European educational systems.  In recent times, I have taken the trouble to have a look at the position in Eastern Europe. It is a well known fact, that Irish primary education has the lowest pupil funding and the lowest level of ancillary support <Col N="767" /> in the European Community and it also has the largest classes in the European Community.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion recently about Eastern Europe and I have taken the opportunity over the past week or so to compare the class sizes in Eastern Europe with the position in Ireland.  The sad reality &mdash; which is to nobody's credit &mdash; is that primary schools in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia and the USSR all have a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio and smaller class sizes than Irish primary schools.  But the real embarrassment and the apology which I owe to Albania for misrepresenting them all these years is the fact that even Albania has a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio and smaller class sizes than the Irish primary schools service and classes in Albania tend on average to be about two-thirds the size of their Irish counterparts.  That is something that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Without putting words in the Minister's mouth, I know she agrees with me that class size is a priority.  What I would ask of the Minister this evening is not that she would say she will solve this problem once and for all but to indicate how she intends setting in train the solution to this problem and to indicate to us the early steps she intends taking.</P>
    <P>Emigration is something that has concerned all of us for some time now.  There are 2,000 fully qualified primary teachers teaching in US or UK schools, or maybe just working in lounge bars or selling burgers in burger joints or whatever it is they happen to be doing because we as a nation have refused to employ them in our primary schools.  The Minister, as current President of the European Council of Education Ministers, will be well aware that there is a European shortage of teachers and that many countries are trying to secure teachers for their schools. There is a great problem in the UK at the moment which was created by the closing down of colleges of education and training colleges in the last decade.  They are now reaping the reward for that sad and <Col N="768" /> terrible decision.  It is a mistake that was partially made here as well but we drew back from the brink at some stage.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Members of the House are aware of the fact but teachers are now being offered sign-on money and &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money by some of the local education authorities in the UK in order to get them to sign a contract to teach in UK schools.  There is a wide recognition that the quality of primary education here is probably among the highest in Europe and the quality of Irish primary teachers is among the highest in Europe.  They are now being offered &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money and other sweeteners in the line of accommodation, support and so on in order to give a commitment to teach in other countries.  We have, as the Minister will be well aware, the largest classes in Europe, east or west.  We have also a spare capacity of teachers in Europe, the only country in Europe that can boost this kind of spare capacity of this quality of teacher.</P>
    <P>We have a problem and we have the solution.  The solution is a very simple one.  It is that we should invite these teachers home, invite them back to do the job which they were trained and qualified to do in the first place and also to recognise that a situation where many Third World countries have a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio than ourselves is outrageous.  It is something that must be addressed as a matter of urgency. I put it to the Minister that it is inexplicable and irresponsible that pupils in Irish schools should suffer when there is a resolution to the problem, simply a welcome home to our emigrant teachers who are seeking work and who can be accommodated.  The return of those teachers would significantly improve the primary education service.  It would certainly realise the huge investment of the Irish taxpayer and it would reduce the number of pupils in Europe's most overcrowded classrooms.  It would certainly give our Irish pupils the same chance and opportunity as their European counterparts.</P>
    <P>I wish to put a point to the Minister in terms of the cost and the economies we <Col N="769" /> are talking about here.  The training, education and preparation of these 2,000 plus unemployed teachers was at a cost to the Irish taxpayer of more than £60 million.  That is £60 million of an investment which we have not realised.  It is time we realised that investment by inviting those teachers back.  I would certainly say to the Minister that after a decade of belt-tightening Irish primary education now deserves a chance and now deserves to share in the benefits of an improving and an improved economy.  It has been demanded by all the interests in education, it has been paid for in advance by the taxpayer, it is needed by the children of Ireland and without a doubt it will be welcomed by the parents and the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister on a number of occasions has referred to the importance of the infant classes in schools.  With these 2,000 teachers out there, there is an ideal opportunity now to make a significant impact on the reduction of class sizes by looking in the first place at the infant classes.  A strategy may be agreed so that we could perhaps halve the size of classes at infant level.  Parents know the difficulty pupils experience of assimilating into the large classes when they start school at an early stage and the difficulty of maintaining a relationship with a teacher in classes of 35, 40 or whatever the number happens to be.  This is an area in which we could make a start.</P>
    <P>Just for the record I also looked at the class sizes in the European Community and I found that the average class size or pupil-teacher ratio, whichever figure we want to look at, is approximately ten better in the European countries.  That is how far behind we are.  Were we at this stage to implement in Ireland the same staffing regime and the same staffing schedules as are applicable in the North of Ireland at the moment we would require more than 4,000 teachers immediately into the system.  That is how far behind we are at this stage.  With all the talk of 1992 it is fair to ask that education &mdash; in this case primary education &mdash; should also be prepared to have the same standards as are available in <Col N="770" /> other European countries.  The level of support, spending, staffing etc. should be available to us.</P>
    <P>The Minister will certainly be aware that we are running into a serious problem as regards caretakers and clerk typists in primary schools.  I want to look first at the numbers in the classrooms and the difficulty of dealing with problems within the school in the overcrowded conditions we are dealing with, apart from that basic question of ancillary support in schools.  The question of caretakers and clerk typists for schools at all levels is something which has now created a serious problem.  The fact is that there are schools which are at the moment being run down for the want of maintenance and support and for the want of clerk typists and caretakers.  We have principals doing the work of caretakers and clerk typists in schools all around the country.  A school principal recently said to me he would be quite happy to go into a school that was well heated, well lit with a full compliment of staff in the morning and he could handle everything else after that but unfortunately he spends half the morning opening doors and windows, checking that the toilets are working and that the yard is clean and so on, work that he or indeed any principal, is not paid to do.</P>
    <P>We could provide a nationwide service of caretakers and/or clerk typists at a very low cost to the State.  The position is that were we, for instance, to appoint a caretaker per 500 pupils in the State that would require approximately 1,000 caretakers nationwide.  At present there are approximately 250 to 300 caretakers in schools.  It would mean the employment of 700 more caretakers.  It is a very simple sum indeed; 700 by £170 by 52 weeks in the year comes out at just over £6 million. That would be the cost and I want to put that cost in the context of the money that is available at present for maintenance and building of schools.  That is approximately one-third of the amount of money that is being spent each year by the Department in the maintenance and building of primary schools.  I maintain that a large proportion of that money <Col N="771" /> could be saved were we to have a properly structured system of caretakers employed in the schools.</P>
    <P>Much of the work that is being paid for by the Department is because of problems that have arisen through neglect and lack of maintenance by schools that did not have either the money or the staff to deal with them.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to see that the embargo on the clerk typist and caretaker scheme be lifted and also to free the social employment scheme.  In 1986 when the scheme was set up, the commitment given by the Government and continued by the present Government was that the scheme for full-time jobs as caretakers or clerk typists would not be replaced by the social employment scheme.  Unfortunately that has not been the case.  The position is that up to 200 jobs have been lost as caretakers or clerk typists and the Government have attempted to replace those by social employment schemes. That is not on and the unions who organise those works have made it clear to the Government it is not on.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to realise there will be chaos in the schools in September with the social employment scheme being blocked because the Government have not kept their promise of not replacing full-time jobs as caretakers and clerk typists with the social employment scheme. That is the reality and I hope the Minister will have something very positive to say on that tonight when she responds to the debate.  I ask for three things on that basis; the lifting of the embargo on the clerk typists and caretakers, the expansion of the social employment scheme and the proper development of a full-time permanent caretaker and clerk typist scheme.  All these proposals could be phased in over X period of years but we need to have a strategy and we need to have a plan.</P>
    <P>The question of stress is something that is now becoming a real problem in schools and in classrooms for staff and for school authorities.  It is manifesting itself in many ways but it is a huge problem. Teachers are close to the top of the league <Col N="772" /> of stress-related illnesses.  The number of primary teachers who applied for disability pension to the Minister's Department this year was double the previous highest number.  That is a reflection of the worsening class size, the very low level of ancillary support services, the discipline crisis, the overcrowded classes. All these combined to create unprecedented pressure and stress on teachers.</P>
    <P>In many European countries teachers over the age of 50 are required to work fewer hours per week.  It is something we could look at.  One of the problems in teaching in Ireland at present is that there is not an outlet very often for teachers because the service has not been developed.  We need to address matters such as policy areas, curricular development and areas like that where teachers might also be involved apart from classroom teaching.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that teaching and education is the only major area in the public service that does not have a welfare service for those working in that area.  The Minister knows, being a teacher herself, and she will be aware from meeting teachers and from listening to people, that never was there a greater need for support, counselling and welfare services for teachers who run into professional, social, domestic or emotional pressures.  The job of teaching, particularly at first level, is one that is very isolating.  Teachers in the morning go into their classroom, they teach for the day. They do not get the normal cues and responses and supports of people who are working as a group.  They are never quite sure how well they are doing the job no matter how hard they try.  They very often need counselling and support and I put it to the Minister that the need for a welfare service is something which is urgently needed for teachers at all levels. This is something which has recently been conceded by the Government to the Garda.  Six new welfare officers have been appointed to the force.  It is something towards which the Minister on previous occasions has shown sympathy and she might consider responding in a positive way on that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> I will say two things on the subject of stress; the need to establish a welfare officer service and also the need more than anything else for an early retirement scheme for teachers.  Teaching is a young person's job.  It is not through accident and it is not just for natural reasons that people tend to have their families when they are in their twenties and thirties.  If anybody wants to lock themselves up on a wet Saturday afternoon with 30 or 40 kids and try to inform, amuse and educate them over the period of the afternoon they will get some idea of what it is like to teach day after day after day.</P>
    <P>People think that teachers have some great trick that other people do not have and that they do not come under the same stress and strain as other adults would in dealing with groups of children.  Yes, they have skills to approach it differently.  Yes, they have the talent to make it work and to guide but at the end of the day the pressures and stress are the same on teachers as they are on other people.  It is not possible to continue to give to that job for 45 years as is very often the case at the moment.  It cannot be done and the effects of burn-out of people who have given their all to the job is something of which we are all aware.  We need to give teachers the option of leaving the service should they wish to do so.  Various attempts have been made to do that over a period of years.  Career breaks have been very very useful but we also need to look at the early retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>Recently my colleague, Senator Jackman, raised the question of retirement for post-primary teachers at 55 years of age.  That is something that is available to primary teachers at the moment.  I would see this as a sort of peace time debate really, where we could talk about what we think should happen in education and indicate how it might be achieved.  It may be over a period of years but let us decide first what we want and then see how it could be done.  I would like to hear the Minister say tonight that she is in favour of retirement at 50 years for teachers and then let us see how we can make it work.  At least it means we <Col N="774" /> can all take on the Department of Finance and the Government and the people who hold the purse strings in a united campaign.</P>
    <P>On the question of the substitute teacher service in primary education, I want to make a point here which has not been made before.  Every day approximately 800 substitutes are employed in Irish schools.  These are to cover for people who are absent on illness, maternity leave, jury service and so on. In the last two years there has been chaos when the report indicated that one third of these people are not teachers.  When schools need substitute teachers they simply employ somebody to babysit for a period and they still have to be paid.  It is a scandal that these substitutes are untrained but the problem lies in the current irregular and undependable payment procedure plus the low wages and the appalling conditions of service.</P>
    <P>The Minister and her Department have recently conceded and negotiated improvements in the conditions and wages of substitute teachers.  This means that the system of payment has been changed, the actual daily rates have been improved significantly and the conditions of service are about to be improved in terms of increments and superannuation credit.  Therefore, next year paying substitutes in Irish primary schools will cost the State approximately £8.5 million.  An average of 800 of these teachers are needed per day.  I would put it to the Minister that if she were to say to 800 of those teachers who are in Brent or wherever they happen to be: &ldquo;Come home and we will employ you next year as supply teachers in Irish primary schools&rdquo; the cost would be 800 times approximately £12,000, an extra £2.5 million to provide a service everybody agrees is in a critical condition.  It would mean that a teacher appointed as a resource teacher to a school would work in that school as a resource or a remedial teacher or whatever until such time as one of the local schools in the network needed a substitute teacher, and they would fill in for the absent teacher there.  It is a clean system, it works in other places but it is <Col N="775" /> now available to the Minister at a very cheap cost.  Those 800 real jobs could be created at a cost of less than £5,000 extra for each job per year than she is paying now.  That is value for money.  If the IDA could do that they would be streaming into the country.</P>
    <P>There are 3,500 primary schools in Ireland.  Approximately 2,000 of those do not have any access to remediation or to remedial teachers.  The majority of those schools are rural schools, small schools or minority religion schools.  The Minister last year lifted the embargo on the remedial teachers with a small but nevertheless welcome increase in the number of remedial teachers when she cleared the appointment of approximately 35 remedial teachers and did, in most cases, try to assign them on a shared basis to small rural schools around the country. That is the model for the future.  We need to be able to say to our teachers, parents and the community whether in a small or large school that their access to remediation should be determined not simply by the size of the school but by need.  In moving into the whole area of remediation we will need to look, right through the next decade, to the response to the needs of the pupil.  The system obviously has to focus on the needs of the child.  The children with special needs are really going to be the ones who need a response over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the things I have outlined are not going to come cheaply. Quality product wherever we get it is going to cost.  Improving the primary education system will not come cheap. The Minister and I, and everybody else, will have to say this loudly and clearly; education deserves an investment; it is an investment that will be well rewarded and reaped but it is an investment that has to be made.  Having said that we then have to make the case to Government and demand that the resources be pushed in this direction.  It is not going to be cheap, it has to be done.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of funding.  The Minister lives in a community the same as everybody else where <Col N="776" /> the local primary school is forever looking for more money.  Whether it is the sale of work or the sponsored race or whatever it is, she is always buying tickets and has to make a contribution the same as everybody else in order to give to the local school the necessary equipment and grants it requires at a particular time. Recently I carried out a survey of about 10 per cent of Irish schools and found that nine out of every ten are involved in voluntary fund raising activities.  It is not just for the frills that they are fund raising but for the basics.  Schools are not able to operate, are not able to provide basic maintenance service, without fund raising and calling on the local community. This kind of fund raising is no more than a local education tax.  Somebody recently in my own union referred to it as a roll tax and that is basically what it is beginning to be.</P>
    <P>It is well understood that post-primary schools are not overfunded.  The Minister has worked in one herself and she knows that.  Could she explain why post-primary schools receive a capitation grant of £150 per pupil &mdash; there is a certain salary increment involved in that so let us call it approximately £110 per pupil per year &mdash; and the primary schools receive a grant of £28.50 per pupil per year.  What happens between sixth class and first year that people are expected to run a primary school on £28.50 per pupil per year when the reality is that secondary schools cannot operate on £110 per pupil per year?  The vocational schools would be far better funded than that again.  The grant per pupil per year in primary schools is £28.50; the grant per pupil per year in post-primary schools is £150.</P>
    <P>Post-primary schools would have other needs in terms of the variety of subjects which would certainly make the case for a greater level of grants but there is no possible justification for the discrepancy between £28.50 and £110.  The reality is that if the per pupil capitation grant to primary schools were to be trebled there would still not be enough to meet the needs of the schools.  We should put it clearly on the record tonight and simply demand an increase in the capitation <Col N="777" /> grant, and then deal with those people who say it is not worth it.</P>
    <P>In terms of Irish primary education in general it is fair to say that it is the worst funded in Europe.  I must have a little joke at the Minister's expense at this point and refer to her amendment.  Major spending in education per pupil etc. through her education budget and the provision for net Government expenditure on primary education for 1990 represent 7.9 per cent of the total provision compared with 6.7 per cent in 1988.  I accept that point to be absolutely clear but I want to remind her what she used to tell us some years ago.  I see her smiling which will not appear on the record but it will now.  She knows the answer to that argument as well as I know it.  She knows it has nothing to do with percentages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It had to do with per pupil spending and that is what it is when we are running a system.  It is not how much we are putting in as a proportion of the total, it is how much you have to deliver a service.  However, I know Governments have to respond in the way the Minister did, but it is as well to remind ourselves of the way it used to be when she was sitting on the other side of the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sad reality is that we cannot run a primary education service or, indeed, any kind of an education service while we have the lowest per pupil funding in Europe.  The Minister may feel that I am besieging her with the European comparisons but I am not doing that with any sense of menace or anything else.  I am doing it because I think it is important that, as she is the President of the European Council of Ministers at present, we would be aware of these things and also because I hope she will bring to Cabinet the needs of primary education and also bring that point back to them.  The reality is that our education service is the worst funded system in Europe.  We spent less per pupil than any other country in the <Col N="778" /> EC.  Within the State we are appallingly under-equipped and under-resourced at primary level, with the largest classes in Europe, with a code of discipline which is unproven and untried &mdash; and that is the kindest thing I can say about it &mdash; with discipline problems which nobody seems able to solve at this point, with the least possible legal protection, the highest quality and most productive primary teachers in Europe working for the lowest salary and the longest incremental scale in Europe providing a quality education against all odds.  That should be recognised and put on the record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is such a cosy relationship between Senator O'Toole and the Minister that I hate to interject my slightly more contentious remarks but maybe this cosy relationship needs to be undermined a little.</P>
      <P>I was going to begin with an entirely favourable commentary on the quality of primary education because I am in the position, like many other people, of having two children currently in the national school system and a third about to start.  They all go the local national school and I have absolutely no complaints about the quality of the people who work in that system.  They do an extraordinary job.  Senator O'Toole said that any of us who doubt it ought to try to take 38 six year olds on a wet Saturday afternoon and keep them quiet, not to say interested and enthusiastic, to appreciate it.  I want to endorse what Senator O'Toole said about the stressful nature of teaching and the idiocy of not recognising that, because people will retire out of such a stressful job, either in a formal procedure of early retirement or on medical grounds, the cost will end up in cash terms being almost the same to the Minister.  It will be the human cost and pain of those who are forced to bring themselves to a position of such physical and mental decline that they will be able to persuade the doctor that they need to retire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To underline something Senator O'Toole said, I want to say that, while the quality of the personnel is undoubtedly <Col N="779" /> excellent, the quality of the resources that are available to those personnel are nothing short of disgraceful.  My own children, going to an ordinary national school, are required to provide their own toilet paper because the school cannot afford it.  If they have the misfortune not to bring the toilet paper with them to school a small personal crisis can well develop because they are required to produce it themselves.  It is not the school's fault; it is the fault of Governments, particularly the present one, which has chosen to reduce funding, not to increase funding, and to under-fund primary education.</P>
    <P>Underlying the assault on primary education is a presumption on the goodwill of primary school teachers which is pushing them towards the limits of their tolerance.  They will do one of two things: they will either get out or they will rebel. Neither of these things will do the education of our children any good; neither do I think either of them will do the quality of primary school education any good.</P>
    <P>There are a number of extraordinary things.  I contend that if we could get somebody to go into the so-called local contribution, we would find it is unconstitutional. There is a constitutional guarantee of free primary school education and to insist on a local contribution, as the Department do, is, in my view, a flagrant breach of that constitutional guarantee.  But when you spread it around among hundreds of parents it seems so small that nobody will go through the rigours of a High Court and Supreme Court action to demonstrate that it is unconstitutional; but it is a less than worthy operation by a Government Department to attempt to circumvent the Constitution in this way.  There is a guarantee there.  It is not qualified; it is not diluted.  There is a guarantee to free primary education and I cannot reconcile that guarantee with the operations of the Department of Education on the local contribution.</P>
    <P>It is an indication of the way Government support for primary education has deteriorated that my own experience is <Col N="780" /> that perfectly good schools in terms of what they used to be are now desperately trying to prove that they are schools that are predominantly serving disadvantaged children because they realise that that is the only way they will be able to get back to a decent level of funding, even to the level they had a number of years ago. You have the ridiculous inverse situation where schools are competing with each other to prove that they are socially disadvantaged, or that the majority of their pupils are socially disadvantaged, in order to get back to a level of funding which should be the right of all schools and where, on top of what Senator O'Toole would describe as reasonable funding in primary schools, we should be putting additional funds over and above that into those schools where there is an excessive level or proportion of children from a socially disadvantaged background.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely meaningless and utterly pointless to produce a few bob here and a few bob there as a gesture towards the socially disadvantaged when the whole system is so appallingly under-funded as to be close to a national disaster.  It is meaningless to talk about particular provision for the socially disadvantaged in an education system which is itself so inherently and so extraordinarily disadvantaged. The real beginning has to be, as Senator O'Toole quite rightly said, in one thing and one thing only, hard cash.</P>
    <P>Our education system has a lot wrong with it, but one of the things that is wrong with it is that it contributes to one of the most extraordinarly unequal class based societies in western Europe.  May I refer briefly to the Economic and Social Research Institute's paper on <i>Social Mobility in the Republic of Ireland, a Comparative Perspective</i>.  Without wanting to launch into a long list of statistics &mdash; I am aware that the Minister will probably have one, two, three, four, 15 or 20 to give back to us in a few moments &mdash; we might as well get a few of the statistics on the other side on the record.  On page 6 of that report it states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> Despite socially substantial increases in participation rates, educational inequalities are of such a scale as to induce scepticism that there has been a significant reduction in association between education level and class origins.</P>
    <P>Just to emphasise the difference in class origins, let me quote from page 4 of the same report.  The model which they use in this shows:</P>
    <P>...that the chances of men born into the higher professional and managerial class staying in that class rather than falling to the semi-skilled and unskilled manual class are over 240 times greater than the chances of men born in the semi-skilled and unskilled manual class rising to the higher professional and managerial class.</P>
    <P>That is Ireland, with those sort of statistical and social barriers built up against social disadvantage.  It is not inevitable that that should be.  It is neither inevitable in this country, nor is it the case in Europe.  They go on to say:</P>
    <P>Thus, on a scale of &ldquo;openness&rdquo;, allowing for structural differences, Swedish society lies at one extreme in Europe and Dublin lies at the other with France and England occupying intermediate positions.</P>
    <P>We have created a society of social inequality, of structural class rigidity unparalleled anywhere in western Europe.  The Minister may ask what has this to do with the present debate.  It has to do with the fact that the country I just referred to, Sweden, with the most open and the most equal society also by some extraordinary coincidence happens to have one of the most magnificent education systems in western Europe.  With the number of pupils significantly smaller as a proportion of population, they spend twice as much as a proportion of their hugely greater gross domestic product on primary education than we do &mdash; for a much smaller number of pupils.  Because they do that all through their system they manage to guarantee a comprehensive, <Col N="782" /> well-funded state system of education. Over 99 per cent of children in Sweden go to state schools.  Their system provides proper social mobility which is manifested in the statistics which demonstrate that it is the most socially mobile society in Europe with the best possibility of children from relatively disadvanaged backgrounds moving up to positions of relatively high levels of income and professional standing within one generation.</P>
    <P>That is the achievement of a good education system; ours fails.  That might sound like a litle bit of well-intentioned social engineering.  But, of course, the consequence of our class inequality is to exclude large numbers of talented and able people from their proper level of participation in the workforce and to cement the participation of perhaps relatively well off but relatively incompetent people who, because of their class advantage, rise into positions that are well beyond the levels of their ability.</P>
    <P>The other thing that needs to be said about Swedish society is that it is remarkably successful in enterprise, in wealth creation and in developing the sort of society that we aspire to.  It is important therefore to remember that increased educational expenditure is not something to be hoped for after we have economic growth.  Increased educational expenditure, particularly and primarily at this stage at primary level, is a necessary prerequisite for economic development.  Let us not forget that two of the countries that have gone down the road that the Minister would have us go down, which is the road of underfunding, poorly resourced education &mdash; Britain and the United States &mdash; are now running into serious educational crises because their own industrial workforces are liable to be unfit and unskilled to do the jobs that will be necessary in another ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>There is no way we can develop the sort of skills, creativity, imagination and approach to enterprise that, I am sure, the Minister, the Government and various Governments would tell us they desire, if we land our children in the early years into enormous classes where even the best teacher is driven into a situation <Col N="783" /> where in a four or five hour day the most they can give to any child is perhaps five minutes individual attention.  In a system that has to be rigidly structured, rigidly ordered and rigidly disciplined simply to keep order in such an enormous class, how can you allow or encourage the development of the qualities of imagination and creativity, the sort of skills that this country needs?  There is no excuse and no policy basis for postponing necessary funding of primary education until there is some great panacea around the corner.</P>
    <P>What we need now are the fundamental resources, the transfer of resources out of other areas where Governments reward their friends, into areas where there are no friends; there are only children.  The children are the most fundamental resources.  There are tax breaks and grant breaks and all sorts of other breaks for people to be enterprising. The real basis for enterprise is the equality of the people, of their ideas, of their imagination and of their creativity. We destroy all of that in an under-funded, understaffed, overstressed, overstrained primary education system. While it might simply sound like a nice social aspiration, the reality is that, if we are going to develop the sort of knowledge based, information based industrial skills that we will need to develop, expand and extend our economy, there can be no such development, there can be no such expansion and no such forward looking taking place in this country in the sort of primary education system we have, which is so hopelessly under-funded. If we are going to change, then we have to change it.  There is no simple solution.  The only solution is dramatically increased resources resulting in proper provision of equipment, support services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes&mdash; that almost 20 per cent of the overall provision for net Government Expenditure on Supply Services for 1990 is devoted to Education</P>
      <P>That provision for net Government expenditure on Primary Education for 1990 represents 7.9 per cent of the total provision as compared with 6.7 per cent for 1988</P>
      <P>and commends the Government</P>
      <P>for increasing the level of State expenditure on Primary Education</P>
      <P>For the initiatives taken by it</P>
      <P>In establishing the Primary Curriculum Review Body</P>

      <P>as a basis for formulating a comprehensive and coherent strategic plan for the development of Primary Education, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>for the provisions in the Programme for National Recovery drawn up in consultation with the Social Partners enabling priority areas in Primary Education to be tackled in the short term and for the <Col N="785" /> developments that have taken place under the Programme, particularly in relation to schools serving disadvantaged areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The motion and the amendment refer specifically to primary education and they provide the Seanad with its first opportunity for a detailed discussion of this very important topic.  I believe there will be a great degree of unanimity in relation to the very many issues of relevance to primary education which will be referred to during this debate.  I also welcome the fact that the debate is taking place in a relatively calm atmosphere.  There is no major controversy in relation to primary education at present.</P>
    <P>I am delighted, too, that the Minister is present.  I would like to compliment her on the excellent job she is doing as Minister for Education and I look forward to hearing her contribution later on in the debate.  I am also pleased that I have the opportunity to refer to a number of developments which I regard as particularly welcome and of considerable significance as far as the future of primary education is concerned.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the present Minister was appointed Minister for Education in 1987 two review bodies were established, one to examine the primary school curriculum and the other to look at the structures and organisation of the primary school system.  The reports of these two bodies, together with the OECD report, which is also due to be finalised this year, will provide the background against which a comprehensive and coherent strategic plan for the development of primary education will be formulated as we approach the 21st century.  The primary curriculum review body have just issued their report.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to comment in any great detail in this debate on what is a very comprehensive and, indeed, a very excellent document.  I am sure it will be the subject of much discussion over the weeks and months ahead.  I would, however, like to quote the first two sentences of the foreword to the report:</P>
    <P>Primary education provides the <Col N="786" /> foundation for all subsequent advancement in the education system.  The most formative years in a young person's development are spent at primary school.</P>
    <P>I believe that this is the perspective from which any examination of the primary education system, or any debate on primary education, must be approached.</P>
    <P>The report proceeds to consider the aims and objectives of the 1971 curriculum and the effectiveness of its implementation in relation to these aims and objectives.  It then goes on to examine the principles on which the curriculum is based and it looks in detail at the various subject areas.  The specific recommendations of the review body in relation to each of the matters examined are set out very clearly at the end of each chapter and I know that they will provoke a wide-ranging discussion on the part of all the interests involved in primary education.</P>
    <P>Chapter 10 of the report is entitled &ldquo;Implementing and Resourcing the Recommendations of the Review Body&rdquo;. This chapter highlights a major difficulty which has always obtained in relation to primary education but which has been identified and tackled by the present Minister with a greater resolve and with a greater degree of success than was the case with any of her predecessors.  This problem is the inadequate resourcing of primary education.  The review body acknowledges that further additional resources will be required for the implementation of its recommendations and it goes on to state, on page 95, that particular attention should be given to reducing class sizes, initially in infant classes; making a remedial education service available to all schools; improved support ancillary services in schools; a review of the role of the school principal with particular reference to the duties and responsibilities of teaching principals.</P>
    <P>I believe that this report will be widely welcomed and I commend the Minister on the establishment of the primary curriculum review body, which brought in this report.  I am confident, now that they <Col N="787" /> have issued their report, the Minister will be giving urgent attention and consideration to the implementation of their proposals and recommendations.  I know the Minister is committed to securing the maximum allocation of resources for the whole education service and, indeed, also for primary education, and I believe that this report will strengthen the Minister's hand in that regard.</P>
    <P>I might point out that in the current year the budget allocation for education services is £1,334.229 million, or approximately 20 per cent of net Exchequer expenditure on non-capital services.  This compares with a total of 16.2 per cent in 1986, which was the year before this Minister took up office.  The provision for net Government expenditure on primary education for 1990 represents 7.9 per cent of the total provision as compared with 6.7 per cent in 1988.  These figures underline the commitment of the Minister and of the Government to increasing the level of educational provision to the greatest possible degree.  Indeed, this commitment is specifically referred to in the <i>Programme for Government 1989-1993</i>.</P>
    <P>In relation to primary education, this document specifically commits the Government to a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio in the context of demographic decline and to a continuing review of the pupil-teacher ratio in consultation with the central review committee with regard to the feasibility of a further reduction under a new <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  It also commits the Government to consider, in consultation with the central review committee, ways to recognise and assist pupils in disadvantaged areas by providing extra teacher allocations, including additional remedial teachers and the establishment of pilot projects for a school psychological service for primary schools.</P>
    <P>The document also states that efforts will be made to improve the level of funding for capitation grants to primary schools as resources become available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> Already the Minister and the Government have begun to deliver on these commitments and they have begun to deliver on them in a very significant way.  The special fund for disadvantaged schools has been trebled this year to £1.5 million. In the school year 1989-90, 95 ex quota additional posts were granted to schools serving disadvantaged pupils and 30 new posts for remedial teachers were established. The creation of these 125 additional full-time permanent posts was worked out under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.</P>
    <P>The allocation of extra teachers to schools serving disadvantaged pupils is, I believe, very important and I welcome the fact that the Minister has recently announced that a similar number of posts will be allocated to such schools again this year.  However, the allocation of extra teachers is only one element of the Government's programme in the area of disadvantage.  The special fund also enables the schools in question to purchase books, teaching aids and teaching equipment and also to facilitate home/ school/community liaison initiatives. These elements of the programme are also very important.  The appointment of the 30 additional remedial teachers to which I have referred increased the number of remedial posts in primary schools to 887.</P>
    <P>I know it would be the Minister's wish, if resources permitted, that all children who have learning difficulties would have access to remedial education.  I believe that one way in which we could possibly make progress towards the achievement of such a situation would be, as suggested by Senator O'Toole, through the establishment of panels of trained qualified supply teachers which the motion calls for.  The establishment of such panels would eliminate the present unsatisfactory situation which obtains in relation to the provision of substitute cover for teacher absences.  The teachers on such panels could be given in-service training in the area of remedial education and they could be deployed as remedial teachers when they would not be required to provide cover for teacher absences. <Col N="789" /> This is a proposal which should be given serious consideration because I feel that its implementation would deal with two pressing needs which exist at the present time.</P>
    <P>The introduction of an early retirement scheme for teachers has also been referred to and I would agree that this is something which would be very desirable. Furthermore, I hold the view that the financial implications of introducing such a scheme would not be as great as some people in the Department seem to fear or to believe that it would.  If the option of early retirement were introduced I believe only a small percentage of teachers would avail of it.  But it is an option that should be there for that small minority of long-serving teachers who are no longer able to cope with the stress and strain of working day after day in the classroom.  I feel that the introduction of such an early retirement scheme would benefit this category of teachers.  But, not alone would it benefit those teachers, it would also benefit their pupils, it would benefit their colleagues and it would offer a means of introducing more new blood into the profession at a time when, because of the declining enrolments in schools, the normal rate of replacement of the teaching forces is slowing down. Again, I know that the introduction of such a scheme is something that the Minister is sympathetic to.  I would appeal to her to continue her examination of ways and means of introducing such a scheme because it would greatly benefit the education system.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that the Programme for Government confirms that efforts will be made to improve the level of funding for capitation grants to primary schools as resources become available.  This is indeed also a very welcome commitment.  Like everybody who has worked in a school, I, too, look forward to the day when the capitation grants to primary schools will be sufficient to ensure that an adequate standard of heating, cleaning and maintenance and equipment can be achieved.  I hope that the improving economic situation will ensure that that day is not far off.</P>

      <Col N="790" /> I had hoped to deal with some of the other issues referred to in the motion and referred to by Senator O'Toole, especially the position in relation to the employment of caretakers and clerk typists, but time does not permit.  However, before I conclude I would also like to compliment the Minister on the fact that over 240 building projects will have been undertaken in the primary sector in the years 1987 to 1990.  I welcome the commitment she has given that within the next three years she intends to have all major building problems resolved at primary level.  I would also like to say how pleased I was that earlier this year substitute teachers received a substantial pay increase and that the Minister has confirmed that arrangements are being made for the direct payment of substitute teachers by the Department for the coming school year.  I thank the Minister for having agreed to introduce this new arrangement.</P>
    <P>We can face the future with a great deal of optimism as far as primary education is concerned.  The success of the Government's economic policies and the priority which now obtains in relation to primary education and the commitment which the present Minister has to the primary sector will see the level of provision being brought into line with the levels to which Senator O'Toole referred and which I accept from him obtain in other European countries.</P>

      <P>In supporting the motion which encompasses the current problems inherent in primary education, I suggest to the Minister that in any startegy she might devise to reduce the size of primary school classes and the pupil-teacher ratio, her first priority would be <Col N="791" /> to increase employment for unemployed graduates qualified since the early eighties.  Education systems will have a very bleak future if the Minister refuses to take into employment those graduates with integrity and vocational commitment, people who cannot at this stage, as Senator O'Toole said, be found in any European country.</P>
      <P>Of course, one will question the cost. I argue that there is very considerable financial waste when our richest resource &mdash; the talent of our young teachers &mdash; is being squandered in a wanton fashion. Perhaps the Minister thinks that the current problems will be masked by the recommendations of the primary curriculum review body, but these recommendations will be no more than hollow aspirations that cannot be put into effect unless the pupil/teacher ratio is reduced and there is a fresh, intake of teachers into the system.  What is happening is that recruiting officers and inspectors from local education authorities, in Britain particularly, are recruiting in our teacher training colleges.  They remark and laud the high standard and calibre of our teachers.  The Minister could also review the primary school sector and advance proposals for the streamlining of rules and regulations in primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1971 when the new primary school curriculum was introduced, it was followed by the introduction of 8,000 new Batchelor of Education graduates right through the seventies.  Therefore, any success it enjoyed must be attributed in part to the fact that the new teachers brought a fresh vitality to the system.  The recommendations of the review body will be moribund without a fresh intake.  At such a cost to the Exchequer the investment will not be realised unless we provide venture capital to keep at home the professionalism of our young graduates to the benefit of future generations.  By the year 2000 with the projected fall in population, university places will be freed up significantly but our young students will not be able to avail of these places if the foundation in the system is frayed. Looking ahead, social life will be far more <Col N="792" /> complex.  What we really need now is a new brand of education with a new suite of intervention programmes as schools are required to go deeper into the community, with emphasis on parenting skills and home school links.</P>
    <P>The children of today are the parents of tomorrow.  At the moment they are experiencing a sense of alienation and isolation within an over-stretched primary system and this sense of isolation will be continued into their adulthood. With a reduced pupil/teacher ratio these problems would not exist and the demands for remedial education would not be as great.  I will refer very briefly to Dan Murphy's minority report within the primary review which refers to the increasing problem of illiteracy in the Dublin area.  It is an introductory document but if the research was extended to Cork, Limerick and Galway it would reveal similar findings.  This is something to which the Minister will have to respond.</P>
    <P>After 25 years of free post-primary education, why have we growing illiteracy problems?  The fact is that for a number of our young people the sum total of their education for life is what they manage to glean within the primary system.  These young people lack certain basic skills.  They have not mastered the three Rs and in reality what we are looking at is State money being thrown at them whether they are in dole queues, social welfare recipients or are participating intervention programmes through FÁS schemes.  They are unfulfilled and, dare I say it, some may be involved in crime.</P>
    <P>The annual cost of keeping a young prisoner in Mountjoy is £34,000.  That would be the equivalent of employing two teachers at primary level.  Which is the better investment, £34,000 to keep a young prisoner in Mountjoy or employing two teachers at primary level?  What kind of entrenched conservative, materialistic society are we creating?  We need teachers at primary level.  The teacher can never be substituted by computers, overhead projectors and so on.  I asked a number of primary teachers what they <Col N="793" /> wanted, and they said what we really want are teachers.  They are people on the ground and that is what they are looking for.  The Minister should forget the home liaison money, and spend it on an extra teacher or on pupils.  That is straight talking.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment enables priority areas in primary education to be tackled in the short-term and developments in schools serving disadvantaged areas.  There was no initiative there for the Limerick area.  We got eight concessionary teachers but no remedial teachers.  There were 30 nationally but none in the Limerick-Kerry area.  There was nothing for us.</P>

      <P>There is no real systematic appointment of remedial teachers. It is sporadic and Senator O'Toole referred to that a short while ago.  This brings me to the question of measuring educational disadvantage to give an equal chance to all schools.  There is an agreed report from the working party on educationally disadvantaged schools.  Perhaps it will recommend that we fill in a form with X points gleaned from medical cards, etc.  to reach a certain criteria. How will the Minister assess educationally disadvantaged schools?  Will it be based on the number of medical cardholders?</P>
      <P>Brief reference was made to the need to increase the extremely low capitation grant of £28.50.  Senator O'Toole referred to the post-primary figure which is between £110 and £150.  We know post-primary students need specialist rooms and so on but the grant of £28.50 is unbelievable. It is a Dickensian figure really.  Without school walks, sponsored walks, sponsorship, etc.  to supplement the school budget the situation would be dire.  In middle class areas the money is there but in poorer areas it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the 200 jobs lost in relation to social employment <Col N="794" /> schemes.  Unions will not want short-term contracts instead of permanent posts and I hope the Minister will lift the embargo on recruitment.  We have a supply of trained and qualified teachers and what they need is to be based in a school and deployed to cover all absences.  There is nothing as bad as a principal ringing around and finding out that she cannot get anybody to come in and substitute for a teacher on a particular day.  That is the reality in many areas.  If no substitutes are required the teacher becomes a resource teacher in the base school but there is a certain amount of streamlining there to facilitate immediate substitution.  The area of teacher mobility is a very difficult one.</P>
    <P>There is a cultural context to teaching. In order to teach in the EC it is essential to have the first language of the country in question.  When teachers came from Northern Ireland and Britain in the sixties and seventies they had to go to specialist schools.  We can learn Italian, French and German, though even if we had German it would not give us entry to German schools because you need to be a civil servant and in order to be a civil servant in Germany you need to be born in that country.  So, it is not as easy as one might think.  The Minister should consider developing a language policy &mdash; not just for students but also for teachers. Irish teachers are very welcome in Britain because of the quality of their teaching expertise.  There are comprehensive orientation courses available for their benefit.  This is very much needed in a multicultural environment.  We cannot equal that.  Women are definitely welcome in boys national schools but apparently there is no welcome for male teachers in convents whether it is all-girl national schools or mixed schools.  That is the situation in Limerick.  We need male role models for both boys and girls but apparently in Limerick there is little welcome for that.  I hope the Minister looks into that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In relation to job <Col N="795" /> sharing there should be a full debate on this not just for young teachers but for people over 50 so that they can relax a little and teach fewer hours.  I do not believe that any Minister, particularly a Minister for Education, should adopt a stop and start approach when he or she takes over as Minister.  Education is evolutionary and whatever scheme is started by a previous Minister should be continued. A five year plan is essential, regardless of who is in power.</P>
      <P>As regards early retirement for teachers, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, said it would cost £30 million but he gave that figure as if all of us wanted to leave teaching.  Not everybody will take early retirement but they want the option.  In 1979 5.8 per cent of primary school teachers were on disability. Today the figure is 20.3 per cent or one in every five.  That is something we cannot ignore.</P>
      <P>We could have a model system for Europe but it is being dismantled by default, by calculated neglect and a failure of moral courage.  We will not be disarmed by the mock assurances of the Minister.  We should have a sound, firm, vibrant and innovative primary education system which will steer our young people into the nineties and into the 21st century as first-class Europeans with the highest educational standards.</P>

      <P>The amendment commends initiatives and expenditure with which we in the Progressive Democrats feel we have been identified.  We have <Col N="796" /> consistently identified education as a priority in policy-making and in the agreed Programme for Government we identified specific areas of concern within the education system and secured commitments on several of those areas.</P>
      <P>Naturally, I echo the sentiments of concern about the size of primary school classes.  There is no doubt that the large numbers which teachers have to cope with mitigate against the high standards of teaching which our children deserve and contribute to the problems of stress, illiteracy and so on.  This having been said, there is a commitment by the Government to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio at both primary and post-primary level in the context of demographic decline.  I ask the Minister to elaborate more on this and to indicate how we have improved the situation It was agreed with the Central Review Committee that the Government would implement a reduction of one point at primary level starting in September 1990.  Naturally we would like to see this position improved and look forward to the continuing review of the pupil-teacher ratio in consultation with the Central Review Committee with regard to the feasibility of a further reduction under the new <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  There is nothing unusual in this.  Everybody wants to see that.  It is a question of the allocation of resources.</P>
      <P>The amendment to the motion notes the percentage of expenditure on supply services for 1990 devoted to education and that the provision for net Government expenditure on primary education for 1990 shows an increase from 6.7 per cent in 1988 to 7.9 per cent in 1990.  The level of funding for capitation grants, as noted in the agreed Programme for Government, has seen an increase of 5.7 per cent per pupil.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the commitment in the agreed Programme for Government to improve the level of funding for capitation grants will be realised as resources become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been set out in the agreed <Col N="797" /> Programme for Government that in consultation with the Central Review Committee, ways to recognise and assist the needs of pupils in disadvantaged areas would be identified and extra teacher allocations, including additional remedial teachers, would be made and that pilot projects for the establishment of schools should be set up.  We have heard some of the progress in relation to this area but it is one which is in great need of development. We all agree that the diagnosis and identification of early learning difficulties should take place from the very early years of primary education.  It should then be addressed rather than taking the problems through to second level with consequent difficulties.  It further underpins the necessity for the provision of remedial teachers along with the need to reduce class size.</P>
    <P>The Government are commended in the amendment to the motion for their initiative in establishing the primary curriculum review body and the primary education review body.  I know the report of the review board is something we will all want to debate very thoroughly.  Our whole problem is one of the allocation of resources.  Education is one of the big three with regard to Government spending and 80 per cent of the spending goes directly on salaries.  We do not have much room to manoeuvre.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a licence fee, not an education fee.  The primary capitation fee of £20 million does not give the schools much room to manoeuvre and, without over-simplifying the situation, it is true to say that in the development of the curriculum there is a divergence in emphasis between teachers and parents. Teachers are favouring a greater development in the scientific and mathematical fields and there is the whole consequent emphasis on computer studies and so on.  We can find favour with that emphasis.  Parents want a greater emphasis on languages, perhaps with a <Col N="798" /> consequent downgrading of the Irish language, something I would not like to see. The fall in numbers in primary schools threatens the range of the curriculum particularly in smaller schools.  It is important to sustain as broad a curriculum as possible.  Teacher numbers cannot be allowed to decline in proportion to the fall in pupil numbers.  A result of this would be that teachers would have to cope with multi-grade classes with all the inherent difficulties in planning and developing suitable curricula and maintaining high standards at all levels.</P>
      <P>I support the idea of more emphasis on audio visual learning and understand the reluctance of teachers to become involved in areas in which they have had little or no training, such as teaching foreign languages.  I also take on board the challenge that teachers have when faced with smaller classes in giving more individual attention where the needs of slower learners can be attended to and where there is a developmental role for the teacher in exploring a deeper understanding and thereby enhancing the educational experience of the pupil.  The cliché, of course, is that our children are our nation's future but we must build on very strong foundations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer briefly to part of the motion which calls for the establishment of panels of trained, qualified supply teachers. This is something I support.  The motion then goes on to urge the Minister to introduce an early retirement scheme for teachers.  Senator Jackman referred to the fact that not all teachers want to retire.  There is the problem of mobility &mdash; and I experienced this myself having been a teacher.  There is enormous difficulty within any career structure where there is a lack of mobility because there is a consequent lack of initiative.  I am not saying that early retirement is the answer but it is one area which should be addressed.  Teachers are under stress. There is no doubt about that, even though I sometimes wish that the school holidays were a lot shorter.  That is speaking as a parent and not as an ex-teacher. There are many cases where it would be <Col N="799" /> feasible for teachers to take early retirement. Consequently, there would be more mobility and more room to manouevre with regard to the employment of teachers.  I have great sympathy for those well qualified young people who have to go abroad to find employment.  There is no argument about this.  I know that this sympathy exists on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>There are sections of the motion that we all support.  On reflection, I commend the Government for the strides we have made in primary education and I look forward to a great deal more being done in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for kindly acceding to the request that I, with other public representatives in Dublin South-Central, made to her to approve an extra teacher in Scoil Iosagáin in Aughavannagh Road.  It is much appreciated by the people in that area.</P>
      <P>Primary school education is the only type of education which is experienced by every member of the population.  It is also the form of education which provides the basis, the foundation stone, for those who go on to second and third level education.  For these reasons it is imperative that the very best facilities and resources are devoted to make it as good as it possibly can be.  Primary school teachers are top class.  I cannot find fault with the people who teach my children. They are from the top drawer and their commitment to the education process is beyond what would be par for the course. There is no doubt about that; and I am sure they are typical of the rest of the teaching profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to resources, we seem to be falling down in this area.  There are also problems in relation to discipline.  I understand teachers have tremendous difficulties with discipline in primary schools because we have not properly formulated an adequate code of discipline. There are also legal difficulties, anomalies and uncertainties in relation to how discipline can be imposed.  While I acknowledge and am grateful for the amount of progress which has been made, <Col N="800" /> further progress is required and I sincerely hope it will be made.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole made it clear that we have the largest class sizes in Europe, and that is entirely unacceptable.  Speaking as someone who is not primarily an educationalist, I see class sizes as a fundamental factor in determining the success or failure of the primary education system.  If the class is too large that could have a knock-on effect on discipline and literacy problems will be exacerbated. I appreciate that the class size will inevitably fall because of demographic changes but there is a great need for further investment to provide resources for more teachers in order to reduce the class size to levels which would be compatible with the highest standards of education at primary level.</P>
    <P>Great problems are experienced by pupils in disadvantaged areas.  It is estimated that something like 25 per cent of all pupils come from disadvantaged areas and that adds up to one million of the population being poor.  There are of the order of 170 schools which would be designated as being in disadvantaged areas. That is unacceptable and is by no means adequate to meet the problems and difficulties experienced by pupils in disadvantaged areas.  If we are to aspire to treating the children of the nation equally, or have any broad ideas in terms of social justice and fairness and giving people something that approximates to a fair chance in life, it is imperative that a greater effort be made to rectify the imbalances that exist in disadvantaged areas.  Even if disadvantaged schools were given the best resources there would still be children suffering from the disadvantage of an inadequate income in the home and so on.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear Senator Mullooly say that the number of teachers who would seek early retirement is relatively small.  If that is the case, it simplifies the difficulties that an early retirement scheme would present for the Minister.  I am sure the Minister being the very astute politician she is, will be only too ready to seize the opportunity that presents, and I hope she will be able to come up with an <Col N="801" /> attractive early retirement scheme which would solve the problem for those small numbers of teachers who are unable to cope with the burdens of teaching as they get older.</P>
    <P>The whole system of substitute teachers on panels has been in an appalling mess over the past number of years.  It is very unsatisfactory and entirely unjust that teachers should not have holiday rights.  Something of the order of 3,000 teachers are unemployed.  That is awful. It is dreadful for young people who have gone through the whole education process, with all the investment and effort involved in getting them to the stage where they were fully qualified teachers, that the best we can do with them is allow them to drift to Britain or the United States selling ice cream and hamburgers for the summer or throughout the year. That is an appalling commentary on the way we run our business.</P>
    <P>The initiatives which have been taken in relation to the curriculum review are to be welcomed but they only go so far.  The curriculum review will only be as good as the amount of money and resources that will be put into making the curriculum review work.  If class sizes are not reduced, then the curriculum review will be another contribution to the enormous amount of waste paper we have accumulated.  I recall a dreadful rhyme of a very dear friend of mine who spoke in terms of a spot of writing she had done which was rejected by the editor and she said: &ldquo;if you can write do, but if you cannot review&rdquo;&mdash; in this case it is, &ldquo;if you can fund do, if you cannot review&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I did not realise I had touched an exposed nerve.  To give another example of the problems of the disadvantaged in relation to teaching, I read in a newspaper article sometime around Christmas that there was a school in Dorset Street where they were wondering if they had enough money to keep the heating system going and one may contrast that with a school on the southside <Col N="802" /> where they were having agonies about whether they should have French or German added to the curriculum in primary school.  I am all in favour of these type of agonies for all schools, but it is appalling that there should be that level of contrast, where on the northside in an inner city school they have to struggle to make it through another day.  The best of luck to them on the southside.  My objection is that the people in the inner city on the northside do not have their standards raised to the same level as the people on the southside.</P>

      <P>The level of capitation grants at £28 per pupil is totally inadequate. A lot of the funds are simply being raised through draws, raffles, quizzes and so on.  That is not an acceptable way to do business if we are serious about meeting our commitments.  In those areas which are privileged, the parents can come up with the money, either directly through contributions to the school or through this type of fundraising but in disadvantaged areas the parents simply have not got the money to come up with the extras which are very important in terms of making the whole system effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey published sometime last year showed that half of the schools did not have a television, half of them did not have a video recorder, one-third of them did not have a telephone.  I would have thought that in this day and age a telephone is a very basic necessity for any type of organisation even if it is for nothing other than security or emergency services so that if something goes wrong in the school the teachers would have the capacity to either call the Garda, the ambulance services and so on.  Twenty per cent of the schools did not have a <Col N="803" /> photocopier and other schools did not have facilities for speech, drama and so on.</P>
    <P>Another survey compares schools from the North of Ireland with their southern equivalents.  I will just quote a few figures from it picking two schools in the diocese of Derry, one in County Donegal and one in County Derry.  I have taken a school which has a pupil size of 250.  The school north of the Border gets £13,000 a year more from public funding.  The difference per pupil of State funding is £49.94 coming into the school in the North of Ireland compared with its equivalent in the south.  With regard to the equivalent in relation to staffing the school in the North has two teachers more than the corresponding school in the South.</P>
    <P>In relation to audio-visual grant aids and so on, the school in the South gets nothing while the school in the North gets £573.  The school in the South gets £900 in the free books grant and the school in the North gets £4,092.  The same goes for various other ancillary support measures. The school in County Donegal had one cleaner.  The corresponding figures for the school in County Derry were one caretaker, one clerk typist, two cleaners, four lunch supervisers and one classroom assistant.  Those figures are from the INTO North-South Study.  It is a whole series of categories of schools from those with 50 to 60 pupils up to schools with 700 pupils.  The whole range is covered. I have simply picked at random schools in the 250 pupil range.  Those are the kind of differentials.  They are very clear-cut and seem to be unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the necessity for support staff in schools such as caretakers and clerk typists.  They are absolutely vital.  Sometimes the whole emphasis in schools goes on the excellent work teachers do but they cannot fully reach their potential unless that type of resource staff is provided.  Caretakers provide a vital function.  If that function is not filled by the caretaker then, inevitably, it will have to be filled by the teacher <Col N="804" /> and if it is not filled by the teacher problems will arise.  The same applies to clerk typists who, again, fill a vital function in the efficient and effective running of schools.  Their role has been somewhat underestimated in the whole business of education and that is not to take from the excellent work teachers do.</P>

I must take exception with Senator O'Toole for trying to take a piece of the cake from the vocational sector in order to add to the primary sector.  The TUI are at pains at all times to try to amalgamate.  It is important that we defend one another and we would not say &ldquo;That is mine&rdquo; when in it is not.</P>

      <P>Before it escapes my mind, may I say how appalled I am at Senator Jackman's reference to the number of jails.  She referred to disadvantage and the reason why the jails are so full of people.  May I remind the Senator that some of the greatest brains went through the jail system.  It is not true to say that all the jails are full of disadvantaged people.</P>
      <P>There are all different categories of people in jails and it is important to put that on the record.  By employing two extra teachers instead of spending £34,000 to keep a person in jail for one year, you will not with one stroke of a pen solve all the problems.  Irrespective of what categories or what type of education system you have, there will always be a need for the incarceration of different types of people and I am sure the Senator would be the first to acknowledge that point.  That was just for the information of Senator O'Toole.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important that we have a limited cake to go around.  The Minister has done a marvellous job in what she has secured for education, in the manner in which she has disbursed the sums and, most importantly, in how she has ensured that the moneys are spent in the best possible way for the betterment of all the children of the country.  She has done an excellent job for Irish education during a period which everybody acknowledges was a very different one in relation to financial cutbacks.  I confidently look forward to an innovative and dynamic era of education in the next few years under the Minister's guidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned here on a number of occasions but it is important that we repeat it, the Government will spend this year £1,334.229 million on education which represents an increase of 5 per cent over 1989.  Of that almost £500 million will be spent on primary education.  By any standards this is a major commitment by the Government <Col N="806" /> and it underpins their recognition of the important role education plays in the social, economic, cultural and industrial development of the country.  This allocation for education has been provided in a period of financial constraint.  With the improving economic situation I have no doubt that there will be continued improvement in the financial allocations for primary education and I am sure, knowing the Minister, for other sections of education in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The commitment is there as evidenced by the improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio which will come into effect from the start of the next school year.  It represents the beginning of a gradual and phased improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools under the terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The Minister has also, for the second year running, increased the capitation grants for primary schools.  It must be acknowledged that there will never be sufficient money.  People will always advocate that they should get more.  Whatever sector of the country you are dealing with, that is the cry.  I recognise how important education is to the country and the need for increased allocations at every opportunity. The primary school allocation has been increased by 5 per cent on top of the 10.4 per cent in 1989 and this must be of great assistance to the school managers.</P>
    <P>As a remedial teacher at second level, I greatly welcome the initiatives taken by the Minister in relation to redressing the disadvantage in education.  It is an area in which I am very keenly interested.  I was one of the first in 1973 who came into the scheme at second level and at that time we were in a no-man's land because we were a new group of teachers who came in to try to establish a type of mechanism by which the more disadvantaged people in the education system would be helped.  Initially, I have to put on record, the remedial teacher was looked upon as a sort of a &ldquo;lob-off&rdquo; in the sense that any pupil who was causing any sort of problem was sent to the remedial teacher and all of the problems and difficulties were passed on to him or her.  I am glad <Col N="807" /> to say that over the years that attitude has greatly changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister attended a number of seminars on remedial teaching that I also attended and she recognised the fact that the function of the remedial teacher has greatly changed over the years so that now the remedial teacher is, to all intents and purposes, a resource teacher.  That is extremely important.  In my view, all teachers should be remedial teachers.  It is extremely important that every teacher is able to cope with the problems of pupils, whether they relate to problems in the home, to disadvantage in relation to the ability of the teacher or to psychological problems.  It should not be left to the remedial teacher to solve all the problems.</P>
    <P>A special fund was set up during the past three years and £500,000 was given to it.  The Government are committed to ensuring that all our children are given an equal chance in education.  The extra assistance to primary schools which serve the disadvantaged is evidence of this. This year the Minister is trebling the amount of money in this special fund, which will enable the schools to buy extra equipment and material.  This will facilitate the home school and community initiatives.  The fact that parents are the primary educators of our children makes it extremely important that we try to develop as close a co-operation as possible between the school, the parents and the community.  Many of the difficulties in relation to disadvantage and difficulties with children would be solved if there was a combined effort on behalf of parents, teachers and the community in general. The influence of the home on a child's attitude towards school and social behaviour in general is crucial.  Any initiative taken to improve communication and the overall situation is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that a further 95 teaching posts are being allocated in addition to the 95 authorised in the 1988-89 year.  I am delighted as well, being a remedial teacher, that 30 remedial teachers are being appointed in addition to the 857 already working in our <Col N="808" /> primary schools.  I readily acknowledge that there is need for more and the Minister will be the first to acknowledge that point.  At least she is taking the initiative and she is using every opportunity to improve the situation.  She is to be complimented for that in a time of extreme financial cutbacks.</P>
    <P>I am a firm believer that all teachers should be remedial teachers but, having said that, I believe a resource teacher can do an amazing amount of good.  There is always a difficulty in describing remedial teachers because some people refer to teachers as ordinary teachers and then you are the remedial teacher, which has a connotation that you are extraordinary or that there is something peculiar about you.  The remedial teacher as a resource teacher can be of absolutely marvellous benefit to a school where the &ldquo;ordinary teacher&rdquo; would not have the time or the opportunity to take individual students aside and give them the extra attention they need.  I readily accept the fact &mdash; I have said it on umpteen occasions &mdash; that it would be extremely difficult for a person who is not a teacher to take 35 or 40 people on a wet Saturday afternoon and try to do something with them.  Irrespective of what sort of resources one has, or what sort of benefits accrue to teachers, it is a profession and people have to qualify for that profession.  The greatest resources in the world could be given to individuals and they would not be able to cope with 35 or 40 students or 20 or 25 students.  It has to be acknowledged that the teacher is a professional and not everyone is cut out to be a teacher.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record my acknowledgement of the tremendous work that all teachers, primary, post-primary and third level, have been doing over recent years.  I do not think the answer to solving a problem is that you have to provide all the facilities needed.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman mentioned in passing our teachers going to England and said they were welcomed with open arms. That is because the standard and calibre of our teachers is so high.  There is no one disputing the quality of teachers.  The fact <Col N="809" /> that over the years so many of our students, past pupils of all our schools, &mdash; primary, post-primary and third level &mdash; have been a tremendous success and have gained world renown is evidence of the contribution our teachers and our educational system have made.</P>
    <P>Over the years there has been a very strong lobby for the provision of a psychological service in primary schools. Notwithstanding the financial constraints already referred to, the Minister has grasped this nettle and put in place two pilot projects, one urban and one rural, which will involved in the region of 30,000 pupils.  This is a very important development and it goes very closely in hand with the whole area of remedial education and the psychological service.  The Minister is to be highly commended for the initiative in this area.</P>
    <P>There are numerous other areas in which the Government and the Minister have shown their commitment to education in general.  I will refer in passing to the traveller families, sex equality, art, music, sport, book grant and curricular review to name just a few of them. Senator Mullooly said &mdash; this has to be acknowledged in a time of severe financial constraints &mdash; that 240 building projects will have been tackled in the three years 1987-90.  The Minister has given a commitment that all the major building programmes will be tackled in the primary education sector in the next couple of years.</P>

      <P>As we move into the nineties and the next millenium all sections of our education system face many challenges and the Minister and the Government are acutely aware of that. The Minister is conscious of the fact that the curricula and training programmes must be continuously reviewed, revised and developed to ensure that all our children receive the necessary preparation for the opportunities that lie ahead in the nineties and in the next <Col N="810" /> millenium.  The Minister has initiated many very significant measures since she came into the Department of Education. I know that she is committed to continuing those measures and to developing our education system to be one of the finest in Europe.  I sincerely wish her well in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to thank the proposers of the motion and my own party for the amendment and to say that I think this is a very welcome debate. This House has gone through its own difficulties in recent times, difficulties which were duly noted and of which everybody spoke.  The tenor and the content of the debate on education here this evening &mdash; a very important debate and, if I may say so, the only debate, apart from the Estimates and budget held in the other House, of consequence on education the two Houses in this current year &mdash; stands to the credit of the Seanad and the Members.  I hope it will assist in the general review of the operations of the Seanad.  I would like to wish all Senators a long and fruitful term of office.</P>
      <P>There were many speakers and I would like to list them: Senator Joe O'Toole, who proposed the motion, Senator Brendan Ryan, Senator Brian Mullooly, Senator Mary Jackman, Senator Helen Keogh, Senator Pat Upton, Senator Tony McKenna, who has just concluded, myself and whoever the rest of the evening will bring.  I propose quickly to go through the points raised by the various Senators because it is important that I address the issues raised.  Can I assure Senator Jackman that she will not receive false assurances from me?  I have never in my life said a false word, nor do I intend to.  If the Senator looks for falsity I suggest that she looks to one of the female predecessors in my office.</P>

      <P>The Senator said &ldquo;false assurances&rdquo;.  I do not take it lightly <Col N="811" /> when the world &ldquo;false&rdquo; is thrown at me. Senator Jackman said &ldquo;false&rdquo;.  I wrote it down as it was said.  It is coincidental that this time last year exactly, I stood in the Seanad Chamber for two very interesting debates.  It was during the general election and the debate was on the universities. When that was over there was a debate on the need for psychological services in primary schools, which was brought up by an Independent Senator. I will not say his name because I would be accused of all sorts of falsity again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was Senator Joe O'Toole.  That debate was held this time last year.  Both items were equally important for those who were going into third level, and who would have a greater chance, and those who were in the really disadvantaged arena.  That stands to the credit of the Seanad.  I never come into the Seanad on a major debate without having regard to the fact that I was once a Senator, that I very much enjoyed my time here, and that Senators play a very important role in the legislative work of this country; I just wish that fact could get more recognition.  I say that in no effort to try to disarm anybody; I say it because I believe it.</P>
      <P>Now, we will deal with the various contributions to the debate.  The first was Deputy Joe O'Toole, the main mover of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, Senator Joe O'Toole, he spoke about Albania, East Germany, Poland and Hungary and the PTR in schools.  He said we should have standardisation with Europe.  Could I <Col N="812" /> gently say there are other things in European schools to which we might not aspire and to which some might wish to have parity, but with which I would not agree. Our pupil/teacher ratio is not as favourable as I would wish and I will develop that point.</P>
      <P>On the question of unemployment, Senator O'Toole spoke about the large number of unemployed primary teachers, the mistakes made in the UK on the closure of the teacher training colleges and that we were just about pulling back from that.  I recognise that quite clearly and it is something to which I have given attention.  I hope Tom Murphy's review body will come up with a submission on that.  We have very good teacher training colleges and if in the future, more teacher's are needed, we will have the capacity to train them.  That is a well recognised demographic feature.  My experience has been that closure is not the financial, economic or social answer to the teacher training colleges.  They can be geared to other purposes and their infrastructure kept intact until they are again required for what is their primary function.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked if the Government would lift the embargo on the caretaker issue.  That is addressed in my speech but the Senator will know that there are talks going on on that at present.  There were three interesting points in that, lifting the embargo, expanding the SES and the full development of the caretaker service on a phased basis.  That submission in the Senator's speech was certainly worthy of noting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator talked about stress in people over 50.  I have to confess I am well over 50 and from time to time I feel it, too.  When I hear the whole debate on teachers I have to agree it is a very stressful job.  There is no question about that.  I always say &mdash; and I am putting on my ex-teacher's hat here &mdash; that no matter how hard, how long or how many hours I work as a politician &mdash; and we all work long hours as politicians &mdash; there is nothing to equal the draining process you feel from having had a full day in class and coming home in the evening and knowing that you were literally on your <Col N="813" /> toes all that time and giving all of yourself for all of the period.  I hope the Seanad will not take me wrong when I say, that politicians, and again I include all of us, cannot have voluntary retirement, we have involuntary retirement and that contributes, too, to our feelings of stress.</P>
    <P>The Senator spoke about the hard work of teachers and what they do.  He mentioned the lack of a welfare service and pointed to the fact that the Department of Justice had appointed six welfare officers for the Garda.  Something has been put to me by his union, the INTO, and also by the other two major unions, the ASTI and the TUI.  At the time the proposal was put to me I could not entertain it but I think now it has a measure of necessity and it is certainly something I would look for.  He said it was no accident that it was young people who have children. Biological matters come into it but one needs to be in the whole of one's health and mind and nerves to cope with young people.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned the 800 substitute teachers that are needed within the system on a daily basis and put forward a figure of approximately £2.5 million which would be needed to set them up so to speak as a cadre of resource supply remedial teachers.  This was put forward by Senators Mullooly and McKenna also.  I will be coming back to that.  It is attractive as a proposition but I do not know how it would work out.  While a principal would be delighted to have the services of such a teacher, it could happen that a call would come that morning for that teacher to go somewhere and the whole timetable of the school would be disrupted.  There would have to be defined areas of what they would be doing so that the normal class routine would not be disrupted.</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned the need for remedial teaching and Senator Mullooly had made that point also.  He mentioned the difference between the capitation grant for the primary school and the secondary/vocational school.  It is £110 because the £40 is taken from it.  He asks what happens between the ages of 12 and 13 that a child becomes that much more <Col N="814" /> expensive.  The fact that when they go into second level, there is need for special equipment, special classes, language laboratories, science laboratories, all sorts of things.  Some of the cost of equipping these facilities comes out of that capitation and that is a matter that would have to be taken into account.  That is exactly what happens.</P>
    <P>The Senator also spoke about the quality of education and certainly that is something which came from all of the speakers except one and I want to refer to that.  We have a recognised quality type of education.  I was once working in a classroom and I know that what matters at the end of the day is the relationship between a child and a teacher.  I hope it never comes that the Community, bureaucrats, political people or management denigrate in any way the role of a teacher.  We are lucky in this country, and I said it before this time last year, that we have not gone down that road. That is the road the UK have gone.  The quality English papers write of seminars, discussion groups and so on but constantly the teacher is being devalued and denigrated in society.  An additional stress has been put on the primary teachers with regard to formal assessment of pupils, the phasing in of various schemes and the marking assessment.  Apart from all that, there is the additional problem of the way teachers are regarded.  That has not happened here because of our historic regard for education and for teachers and it cannot be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>I am saying this and I will be accused of all sort of things, of being all blow and not talk, etc.  Yet, if I do not take the opportunity of saying it I will be accused also.  I am saying quite clearly to the teacher representatives who are here today that when I say that I mean it.  The teachers in this country are people of quality and long may that remain the case.  That is what gives the essence of quality to our education system.  Of course we need more of them, we want more of them and that is what we are about in this debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan seconded the <Col N="815" /> motion.  He talked about the rules of national schools and said they must be changed because of the element in them of local contribution, and that is in my speech.  He spoke about the need for capitation grants and an increase in such grants.  He spoke about throwing a few bob here and a few bob there.  With respect it is more than that.  He then gave us a socio-economic lecture on the various ESRI reports and spoke admiringly of Sweden, of the wonderful system of education it has and of the highest in ABCD and E categories.  It also has unfortunately, in social terms, very sad statistics to relate.  If we are going to use statistics, then they should not be selective statistics.  Nobody would wish to point out the sad statistics which come from that country but they are enormous.  That is the other side of that equation.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan had a serious complaint about his school which I would leave squarely at the door of management in that school.  It is something I will ask my Department to take up in the morning. It is reprehensible that an issue like that would be treated in such an insensitive way.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Mullooly spoke next and I thank him for being first to speak to the amendment.  He discussed it in a very relevant and in a very informed way, particularly with regard to the curriculum review and the role of teaching principals. He spoke about the need for a continuing review of the PTR and he was very positive on the need to have a clear look at the early retirement issue and said there would not be a very great uptake.  I do not know about that.  Our experience in 1987-88 was the opposite.  That remains to be seen.  He mentioned the caretaker and clerk typist problem.  He was quite willing to say out what needed to be done in the system and to express it very forcibly, as he has always been on all occasions.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman was emphatic on the need to have professional unemployed graduates employed.  The resource is there and her point was why not use <Col N="816" /> them.  She mentioned the link with the community, the need for reduction of PTR and she pointed up Dan Murphy's minority report in Moya Quinlan's curriculum review and the need to address it.  On the day it was launched I spoke about it.  She mentioned the need for investment in primary level, that teachers should be the most important resource within the classroom, and that teachers would never be replaced by computers. That goes without saying.  The Senator asked a question on the criterion for disadvantaged. We have reached an agreed formula on that but it is not yet implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not come to my desk yet.  My desk is clear and it is not on it.  There are new criteria coming out and we will see that goes along with the questions the Senator asked.  She asked if it would be on a medical card, on single parent status, or on various things.  They embody a varying number of criteria and they have been agreed among the various educational interests.  She mentioned the need for teacher mobility.</P>
      <P>The Senator pointed out the discrimination against male teachers as against women and I am afraid I am on the side of the women in this.  While I take her point I know what you mean about the role and the lack of principalships. This time last year the INTO addressed in a document the need for teachers to go forward for principalships, for managements and management boards and interview boards in a positive way.  She said we disarmed by mock assurances.  No, I do not seek to disarm and she is right, the word was &ldquo;mock&rdquo;. Will she take my apology, please?</P>

      <P>The next speaker was Senator Helen Keogh and I welcome her. She was having a little bit of difficulty reconciling her coalition role but she got over it very well.  She is a teacher and was <Col N="817" /> well able to identify the priorities.  I very much welcome her contribution and I welcome her as spokesperson on education. As regards the need for the continuing review, she quite rightly pointed up what had been the provisions in the Programme for Government and asked how they were proceeding.</P>
      <P>As regards the curriculum she said she would place a different emphasis on some matters.  She said that teacher numbers should not decline as the pupil numbers decline.  I can assure her that that will not happen.  As regards substitute teachers a thread that ran through all the submissions in the debate was a recognition that some measure of progress had been made, but not enough.  I will come back to that later.  She spoke about the role of Government in education and said investment in education remained the most important issue.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Upton for what he said at the beginning of his speech.  He spoke about discipline and of illiteracy in the disadvantaged schools.  He also mentioned early retirement and substitute teachers, both of which are common threads as I said.  He welcomed the curriculum review and had the nice doggerel: If you can fund do, if you cannot review. We have reviewed and we hope to fund: That does not rhyme but that is the way we will go about it.  He pointed out the divisions between the north side and the south side.  With respect, it is very difficult to take the class system out of society.  Where they have tried to do that &mdash; in the socialist countries &mdash; it has not worked.  The schools have the same teachers, they have the same pupil-teacher ratio, the same funding, and after that intervention is necessary for disadvantaged schools.  I cannot know if we are going to just make everybody the same eventually.  We would love to do that but, as I said, in countries where they tried it, it did not work out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator said that 20 per cent of the schools did not have much equipment, but I would remind him that 80 per cent have.  He said that one third had no telephones, the answer is that two thirds have and we seek to progress as we go <Col N="818" /> on.  He then mentioned a survey on the North of Ireland pointing up the differences particularly between two schools in the one area &mdash; one in the North and one in the South.  We aspire to do more but I would like to say that the UK and the North of Ireland have the might of the Queen of England behind them and all that that means. We are a separate country with our own needs.  We have asserted ourselves and are now trying to do that in every way possible.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Tony McKenna for formally seconding the amendment.  He welcomed the work being done for the Gaelscoileanna, particularly the school in Nenagh and sternly pointed out that the cake was still a relatively small cake and that he did not want other people taking his slice.  He spoke of the phased improvement of PTR and of the need for remedial teaching and resource teaching, and the remedial teacher to be seen as a resource teacher.  That is a fair point.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman raised the issue of the home-school liaison link and we envisage that that person will be a teacher.  She seemed to think it would be somebody indefinable.  What I envisage is that that person will be a teacher which, in effect, counters what she said.  She also said she did not see the need for a home liaison person to be another type of person, and neither do I.  I see the home liaison person as a teacher.  I am sorry for diverging from what Senator McKenna said. Senator McKenna was very keen on the home-school liaison links and that is what led me to make clear that point.  Again, the Senator was very strong, as befits someone in the profession, on the professional role of teachers.</P>
    <P>Senators raised various points.  Some I have already addressed and some I will address now.  I will try to be as brief as possible.  At the same time I feel the occasion is important enough to warrant response to each Senator who spoke, and that I should be here for the three hours.</P>
    <P>I want to express my thanks for the opportunity to address the Seanad.  The motion was very well intentioned, but we do not have a bottomless pit of money.  I <Col N="819" /> have laid out what is being spent &mdash; an increase from 6.7 per cent to 7.9 per cent of the 20 per cent of GNP.  We have economic stabilisation within the country, but we still have a long way to go.  We agreed a <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> because everybody has agreed and that would include some of the major Opposition parties &mdash; that the country needed to address itself in a very rigorous way to what was the situation in 1987. The Central Review Committee and the various partners worked harmoniously towards that end &mdash; maybe not always harmoniously but they certainly worked towards it.</P>
    <P>Then we had the Programme for Government to which Senator Keogh and others referred and various points were raised &mdash; the PTR of primary and post-primary schools will be reduced &mdash; the Government will implement a reduction next September &mdash; the disadvantaged areas and the capitation grants.  In the last 12 months we have made fair progress in those areas.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge what Senator O'Toole said about what we are spending on education compared with the European Community countries.  The most recent UNESCO book indicates that only the Netherlands spend a higher percentage than us and we have the lowest <i>per capita</i>. I freely acknowledge that.  We have the second highest &mdash; higher than Germany and higher than what would be regarded by many as the strong economic countries &mdash; spending on education in Europe and the lowest <i>per capita</i>.  That is a matter of population.  We are increasing our spending. Even though the numbers of children in primary schools has gone down by 14,000 in the last three years, the proportion of income spent has gone up. That is a fair signpost to what we intend to do.  We are committed now to spending only what we have and to reduce borrowing to nil.  We still have a huge debt to clear.</P>
    <P>I freely admit I did not always talk like this and when I was in Opposition I, too, put forward the view that there was a bottomless pit of money.  I now know <Col N="820" /> different.  I have learned my lesson well. I recognised when I came into office that we had to reconstruct the basic goals and set out what we were going to do.  We set up the curriculum review body on which Tom Murphy reported and hopefully this will be ready in the autumn.  There is also the OECD report with which we cooperated. All these three reports &mdash; the one now issued and the two in the autumn &mdash; will mean we will have on hands a coherent authoritative list of facts, of knowledge, all put together by experts in the field.  We will then set about a planned strategy for implementing that on a phased basis and in order of priority.</P>
    <P>I have established a separate primary education policy unit in my Department and this will have responsibility for implementing and overseeing that strategic plan.  It is a very important development. There is no point in having those reviews, having them come to fruition and then sitting back, reading them and having endless debates about them.  When the three are together we are going to put them together, order our priorities on a phased basis.  Our planning unit will take control of it and we will start there. Whether I will be about when we are at that stage in the autumn is another matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to the pupil-teacher ratio, as I said we have already made the reductions, beginning this September. That will mean 500 teaching posts.  At the moment we are looking and talking about the other phased reductions which have been announced and will be discussed in the context of the next <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Those talks are ongoing.  I certainly feel this is one area that will be looked at quite rigorously at the beginning of the talks on that programme. Each improvement involves cost and we know that but there is a need for further improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio &mdash; I have said it in print and I am saying it in person now.</P>
    <P>There are two separate schemes for the disadvantaged.  There are various ways to address that matter, funding, the special grant and the extra teachers.  We were able last year to put in 95 extra teachers <Col N="821" /> for what were deemed disadvantaged schools and they supplemented what was already there.  They were not ones authorised the year before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said 95 more for next year.  I am waiting for her to confirm that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am just clearing it up.  It was just a matter of misinterpretation. I am glad the schools have got them, and indeed they have all said how much of a difference it has made to the running of the schools.  Then there is the grant for the schools deemed to be disadvantaged.  There is a trebling of the fund this year and it is being worked out in a series of measures between the various educational interests and my Department.  Just two things I want to say about that.</P>
      <P>We are hoping to have innovative measures this September out of the trebling of that fund and in addition to what we did already but particularly in selected schools in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and a few other areas in order to establish school/home liaison people who will be teachers.  They will have a special role in liaising between home and school.  The second thing we are going to do with the trebling of the money is that the money already given in special grants to disadvantaged schools which was heretofore given to diocesan authorities will now be supplemented by the extra money and will be paid directly to the schools.</P>
      <P>It is something that many people have put to me.  I felt it was something I wanted to tackle.  It will be paid directly to the school board to disburse.  I am not saying that it did not always happen that way &mdash; and I am sure it did &mdash; and the diocesan authorities are very hard-pressed to cope with all they have to do.  The fact remains that it will now be going directly to the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the remedial teachers, we made a start on this.  We broke the embargo on this last year and I hope we can continue at an increased rate in the forthcoming year.  The part-time teaching scheme which we have for handicapped <Col N="822" /> and disadvantaged children, and indeed for the children of travelling people, is certainly something my Department have always been very keen to do.  It has been their priority to help children with special needs who are in one way or another disabled and also, the travellers' children. More can and should be done.  This also applies to special education.  The integration &mdash; which the primary review body are keen on &mdash; of these schools is something I favour.  In Europe last week, in the formal education debate I was able to encourage and push through this idea.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants to assist with school book purchase is gone up to nearly 40 per cent in two years which, in any language, is a good increase.  The capitation grants for primary schools again are up 16 per cent in two years.  I freely admit this is not enough in capitation grants in primary schools and it is something that, as resources permit, we will certainly address.</P>
    <P>Again, the scheme we have coming in next September for particular grants for schools will address the needs of disadvantaged schools.  The £1 million we got for the library grant scheme was greatly welcomed, as was increasing the <i>per capita</i> payment.  As regards parents, I have been able to give £25,000 to the primary tier in clear recognition of their development work and the input they have into all areas of education.  Concerning discipline and school behaviour, it now appears that a degree of agreement has been reached but it remains to be finalised and I hope it will be so.</P>
    <P>In regard to the psychological service, I am glad it has been so welcomed.  The people have been cleared and are now about to be appointed.  That is a three year scheme and the evaluation process will be monitored.  I look forward very much to that.  It is a particular interest I had.  The matter was raised a year ago here by Senator Joe O'Toole and I am glad we have been able to reach an agreement on it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the school building programme, there has been great progress made on that.  I will be in touch with the Senators about Lispole national school. <Col N="823" /> The caretakers and the clerk typists is a very important issue and talks are in progress on that at the moment.  The whole scheme is in jeopardy.  The SES schemes, particularly in the rural schools, are of great advantage but there is a large hiccup in the scheme at present.  Talks are in progress and I am hopeful of an early resolution on that matter.  The matter will go to Government and, therefore, I cannot be any more explicit but I am hopeful of an early resolution on it.</P>
    <P>We were able to raise the level of pay substantially in the case of the substitute teachers and it was well deserved.  I cannot explain this clearly enough and the extent to which I think it should go but you need the challenges and the &ldquo;tensions&rdquo; from what would be seen as vested interests.  I always feel that here the vested interests have regard really for the ultimate needs of children as expressed through the need for teachers.  There is need for that.  We need to be constantly challenged within the Establishment or the Government of the day.  That tension which exists is a common feature and should remain a feature of educational debate.  Otherwise, the <i>status quo</i> would obtain the whole time and there would never be developments and that would not be a correct way either.  You need that thrust to spark and enthuse from time to time.</P>
    <P>As I said, the level of pay for the trained substitutes was unsatisfactory. From next September payment will be from central administration rather than from local.  It was quite disgraceful.  I used to get personal letters from teachers around the country, from young girls mostly, and they would say they worked for six weeks in such a school and three months later they had received no payment. We would have dealt with the matter if we had received the request but in many cases we would not have received the request for that payment.  It was time for that to end.  There is no doubt about that.  A claim for improvements in other <Col N="824" /> conditions of service of substitutes is currently under negotiation with my Department. Again, I am hopeful that improvements will ensue.  A sum of £8 million was the cost of substitute teachers pay in 1990.  Senator O'Toole mentioned a figure of £2.5 million in that context.  I am going to look at the question of defined limits of what teachers would do and how there would not be a disruption of the normal timetable.</P>
    <P>Much debate in recent times has focused on the question of early retirement for teachers.  National teachers who have 35 years' service may retire, which is not the case for second level teachers. The question of any improvement in the provision of national teachers must, therefore, be approached in the context of the provision in the public service generally, and how that would be approached or looked at I do not know. From what I have said in response to the Senators' submissions, the House will know that much has been achieved over the last number of years against a background of very difficult budgetary and financial circumstances.  I must stress that those achievements have been made possible only by the very active co-operation of everybody involved in education, but there is no reason for complacency.</P>
    <P>I do not stand here and say everything in the garden is rosy.  Everything in the education garden will never be rosy because there is always a constant need for improvements.  We seek to make improvements always and what I have put forward here is, if you like, an account of the last 12 months and what we have managed to do in the primary sector.  Other education sectors can be talked about on another occasion.  What I sought to put forward here is what we have been able to do.  I do not do it in any sense of beating my breast and saying &ldquo;What a good girl am I, am I&rdquo;.  No, because I know too well from my time in education, from the three years I spent in the Department that daily there are huge difficulties, challenges and opportunities, and if one had an enormous amount of money and inexhaustible <Col N="825" /> resources one could transform everything. But, even if you did that, there would still be ever fresh challenges facing us in education.  There would be curricular challenges and syllabi challenges and still there would be a demand for the lowering of the pupil/teacher ratio.  It is correct that that debate, that quest and that demand go on all the time.  We, in Government, have to be realistic.  I very often have to separate on the one hand, the part of me which spent years in a classroom, on VEC committees and on boards of management of regional colleges, and as a parent rearing two children &mdash; although Gemma said I should not always be saying I am a mother.  I do not see anything wrong with saying I am a mother, because I am&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is your own problem.  You have put me off my trend &mdash; my years of watching our two sons going through primary schools, and on the other, the fact that I am very pleased and honoured to be a member of a Government which in three years has done a huge amount, and is currently doing so for the country, bringing about economic and social change while at the same time ridding ourselves gradually of the shackle of debt which lies upon us.  I put it very clearly to the House that you seek, I seek and we all seek to gradually improve the social conditions of everybody in the country, but we seek to do that against the background of a huge existing debt; we seek to do it in the need for taxation changes; we seek to do it by bringing about another <i>Programme for National Recovery;</i> we seek to do it in a way which will get growth in the economy; and we seek to do it to give employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a huge jigsaw, and into that education fits.  I take my job and my portfolio very seriously.  I will continue to do everything I can to improve the situation of the primary schools, the primary teachers and the pupils in our care, recognising quite clearly that it is the <Col N="826" /> foundation on which is built all the other tiers of education, and to improve it &mdash; and improve it continuously along the way &mdash; will mean that more and more the quality of our education, which is already high can be improved, and built upon.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. I have enjoyed this debate very much and I hope that the outcome of it, the submissions and the points that have been raised, will find an outcome in the coming years.  Go raibh míle maith agaibh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is injury time.  I want to say, first what a pleasure it is to have the Minister here and how able she is <Col N="827" /> in fielding these sort of debates.  She is superb at this kind of marketing, and this is not necessarily confrontational debate. I agree with Senator O'Toole.  Objectively, you could really put both the motion and the amendment together.  I speak as a teacher, from that experience as a teacher at third level and also as a member of a teaching union.  It is important and interesting that so many people spoke.  We have the General Secretary of the INTO, the General Seretary of the ASTI here in the House.  It is very important that we hear what they have to say. This is the value, or one of the values, of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I recognise that there is a tension obviously within Government and in a way any sharp criticism made here is not a personal criticism of the Minister; it is intended to arm her for the battles that take place within Cabinet for money.  I would like to place on the record the appreciation I feel that the Minister has written to me on 25 May indicating that a matter on which we had a debate here, which was taken principally in the name of Senator Costello, about the Central Model Schools in Marlborough Street came to a successful fruition.  The Minister has indicated in writing to me that that school will now, in fact, go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obviously going to the locals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we recognise the significance of the primary area.  The areas of concern are quite detailed and have been to some extent dealt with by the Minister.  However, she anticipated the flaws in one of her own arguments in the printed speech where she said:</P>
      <P>Spending on education by the European Community countries as a percentage of Gross National Product as shown in the most recent UNESCO Statistical yearbook (1987) indicates that only the Netherlands stands a higher percentage of GNP on education than Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> It is not a question of percentages.  It is a question of what you can deliver to the individuals on the ground.  The Minister made that point herself in her preparatory remarks.  That is something that needs to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of voluntary contributions, I do not believe they are voluntary.  I believe they are a tax that operates in a most invidious way because they injure those least able to pay.  A classic example was given here today by Senator Ryan.  It is an area where people are most sensitive, where a child could be embarrassed by being asked to bring lavatory paper into the school.  That is quite appalling.  It is something a child will remember forever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appalling on management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  I am glad the Minister is able to say she will look into this.  I would like to say also that this kind of businesss of people having to look for extra money for books, to raise contributions in this way, discriminates against those who find it most difficult to raise the money in individual contributions. This is completely invidious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  The question of class size has also been indicated as a matter of considerable importance.  As we move towards 1992, the question of the transfer of teachers throughout Europe is also one of quite crucial importance. With regard to the social employment scheme, the Minister, I am sure, is aware of the fact that she would have very serious problems with trade unions if she duplicates.  Like all those who have been involved in social employment schemes, I am aware of this, and this must be taken into account in her discussions.  With regard to the question of moneys and so on, since education is one of the most fundamental things we have &mdash; primary education in particular is a building block without which it is impossible to proceed <Col N="829" /> to second and, finally, third level education &mdash; is it not possible to seek some dimension of European funding?</P>
      <P>Finally, on the question of early retirement, this is something I feel passionate about because I would very much like to have it, particularly at the moment because I am up to my hocks in marking examination papers.  The Minister is a former teacher herself and may retire again from politics to that.  Either profession would be graced and ornamented by her.  It is certainly stressful and I think early retirement is something that should be looked at, and not just within the context of the State sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak in this debate.  I would like to thank the Minister for coming here today and for her very informative speech.  Before I get to the points I am going to make, in relation to the moneys to be collected, as the parent of four primary school children I would like to say that this provides no problem in our community.  We run one social event a year, we collect all the money and that is the end of that problem.  We have a very positive bank balance in our little school.</P>
      <P>We all have to admit that everybody in the country gets primary education.  It is very important and, of all branches of education, it should take precedence.  It is very important that when limited resources are being spent the primary sector gets its fair share.  At times it concerns me that the bigger organisations could, through better lobbying, etc. get more than their fair share and maybe get some of the money that should go to the primary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the pupil/teacher ratio, to a large extent this problem will solve itself due to demographic factors. However, two cases have to be made &mdash; first, the particular problems relating to Gaeltacht schools where there are students with two mother tongues, some with English as the mother tongue, some with Irish, and where one is trying to reach a situation where Irish is the standard language of the school.  I would also make a special plea as regards <Col N="830" /> pupil/teacher ratio numbers for small schools.  It is very difficult for teachers to teach three and four classes at one time. Three classes of 41 students I imagine would be more difficult to teach than one class of 38 or 40 students.</P>
    <P>Regarding the curriculum, we have to insist and ensure that every child leaves school armed with the basics in numeracy and literacy.</P>
    <P>On the question of Irish, as somebody who runs Irish courses, I am appalled despite all the emphasis on Irish, at the lack of knowledge of the language and lack of ability in conversation of many students leaving primary school and going into secondary school.  I would see a very good case here for the use of technology such as videos, etc.  in schools to improve that part of teaching.  There is great talk about computers and more and more they have become a standard tool.  The actual skill of typing will have to be brought into the curriculum.  Everybody will have to be taught that basic skill which is going to become more and more an everyday skill.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a remedial teacher covering every school &mdash; that there would not be a one-to-one ratio but one covering every school in the country.  On the question of the Gaelscoileanna sílim go bhfuil an-tábhacht ag baint leis seo, go gcaithfear féachaint chuige nach é an painéal céanna atá ag na Gaelscoileanna agus atá ag na scoileanna deoise, mar bíon fadhbanna teanga ag cuid de na múinteoirí ar na painéil deoise maidir le dul ag múineadh i scoil lán-Ghaeilge.  Dhá phointe a ba mhaith liom a lua ná ceist na bhfoirgneamh; agus an pobal atá ag iarraidh seomra breise a thógáil ar a gcostas féin, ba cheart go mbeadh cead acu é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Dhá phointe deiridh: ceist chúrsaí árachais maidir le rudaí a bheadh ar bun taobh amuigh den scoil agus, chuige sin, na costaisí a bhaineann leis sin ó thaobh na scoileanna de.  Ansin, ag deireadh an lae, is cuid den phobal an scoil agus ba cheart go n-aitheofaí difríochtaí ó phobal go pobal maidir le scoileanna, is é sin go mbeadh an rud atá faoi chaibidil i láthair na huaire, ethos, community ethos, <Col N="831" /> dúchas a ceantair féin, ag baint le gach scoil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to contribute to this debate as a parent.  It is interesting to note that, of the ten speakers to date, nine have been trained teachers.  I understand that the latter speaker is, in fact, the first non-teacher to speak.  I am the second and I am speaking as a parent. My family are at primary school level. My youngest is starting in primary school within the next few weeks.  It is a three teacher school.  It is a country school.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate and I wish to pay tribute to the primary teaching sector for the work they have done educationally over the generations for the Irish people, equipping them with life's skills, in engendering in the various generations a sense of values in our society and giving a good sound religious education, regardless of denomination, down the years.  It is unfortunate that when children go into second level this aspect of their education is often put on the sidelines because of the points system.</P>
      <P>Having experienced a small school which went through the traumatic situation of almost losing a teacher, reducing from three to two, I am in no doubt of the seriousness of the present pupil/teacher ratio.  I would again like to highlight the fact that we are ten pupils in excess of the European average and have the worst pupil/teacher ratio in Europe.  This situation ties our teachers' hands behind their backs when trying to bring the level of education to the required level in a European context.  Every effort should be made to tackle the pupil/teacher ratio to bring our educational services to that level.  The one thing that offsets the difficulties is the level of qualification and commitment of our primary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want also to highlight a difficulty that is more peculiar to the country, in my area, than in a city area.  I refer, to course, to remedial teachers.  In my own council area there are three groups of schools of three each who are looking for a remedial teacher.  I noticed from the Minister's <Col N="832" /> speech that she is introducing a further 30 remedial teachers this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is inadequate and I would ask the Minister to review that area in the light of the country position.  I understand and accept that the cities because of size, rightly have remedial teachers but I think that the country should have the same service.</P>
      <P>I would also like to refer to the investment in education and the fact that a grant of something like £28.50 is paid per pupil to the primary sector.  In my own small school, because it is so small, the parents are asked as far as possible to pay £7.50 per pupil, regardless of income.  I think this is a tax on education.  Some families do find it difficult, but in a small school area they are almost obliged socially to do this.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to something Senator Norris referred to and this is the whole area of European funding for education.  I understand that under the Treaty of Rome this cannot take place. That should be changed.  We have an artifical situation where training is the responsibility of the Department of Labour and can be funded from Europe and education is the responsibility of the Department of Education and cannot be funded.  Accountants, because it is training, can be funded by Europe but our secondary schools cannot be equipped through European funding.  We should have the same services throughout Europe and be funded by Europe.  I regret I cannot develop that point further because the time is limited.</P>

      <P>I would like to start by thanking the Minister, as Senator Norris did, for her contribution and for her decision to allow the reconstruction of Marlborough Street Model School to go ahead.  It was raised in an Adjournment debate before Christmas and I am glad the Minister has agreed to make the money available.  I hope she will do likewise in respect of the Adjournment <Col N="833" /> debate that is about to take place immediately after this discussion.</P>

      <P>You are a martyr indeed. As long as you have got the moneybags we will be happy.  I welcome this motion from the Independent Senators.  It is very comprehensive and timely.  The Leaving Certificate examination started today and it is timely that we have a discussion on education at this time.</P>
      <P>The contents of the motion need no further elaboration.  They are a very severe indictment of the quality of our education system at present.  In any context we have the largest classes in the European Community, the lowest per pupil funding, the lowest level of ancillary services, where 200 Irish primary schools have no access to remedial teachers, where the capitation grant is at the ludicrous level of £28.50; the absence of any order in relation to supply teachers, no panel system in existence and, of course, the whole area of early retirement in the teaching sector which has not been addressed at all adequately.</P>
      <P>This is equally a problem in the post-primary sector where you have an increase of 14 per cent in pupil numbers since 1981 but a decrease in staff to 4 per cent and where you have got the highest pupil-teacher ratio in Europe.  Ireland has a 20 : 1 ratio, Greece, a 19 : 1 ratio, France a 17 : 1 ratio, Portugal a 14 : 1 ratio, the UK has a ratio of 13 : 1, Luxembourg has a ratio of 11 : 1 and Italy has a 10 : 1 ratio.  We are absolutely the worst in the EC.  Despite what the Minister has said, we have suffered disproportionately in relation to the cutbacks that have taken place in education. We have been sacrificed more than any other sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have lost funding right across the board; capital funding for new schools, for renovation, for reconstruction. We have lost personnel; the <Col N="834" /> remedial service, the career guidance service. We have lost out at virtually all levels in education due to the cutbacks. While the Minister has indicated that there have been some improvements, we have not been given the priority which is required for education.  The Minster is responsible for education.  If we are to cherish the children of this country properly we must make them the priority and that has not been happening over the past three years.  We need more resources, more personnel and we need a Government who will regard education as the number one priority.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to thank everybody who contributed to the debate, which has been particularly lively and has covered many areas of primary education.  I do not have the time to respond to the debate but I want to make a number of points.  All I asked in proposing this motion was that we would take the commitment in the proclamation of the Republic and that we would attempt to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  We have failed to do that. That is all I seek, no more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the cake, I would like to put it clearly on the record for Senator McKenna that if he had been here last month he would have heard the Minister for Finance telling us that the cake was growing between 4 per cent and 6 per cent annually, so it is not the same size of cake.  I am not looking for anybody else's share; I am simply looking for the amount that will allow us to cherish all the children of the nation equally. Ceapaim gur cúis mhór náire domsa a bheith ag éisteacht leis an Seanadóir Ó Cuív ag rá go bhfuil sé an-sásta leis an scoil ag a bhaile féin agus gur maith an rud é go mbeadh tuismitheoirí na háite in ann seomra nua a chur ar fáil agus a thógáil ar a gcostas féin.  That is the problem with this country; if it is all right in our corner we can forget about all the rest.  The reality is go bhfuil daoine timpeall na tíre nach bhfuil an t-airgead acu chun seomraí scoile a thógáil iad féin. They just do not have the money.  This type of local taxation as an attempt to <Col N="835" /> build the education system does not work.  The only fair system of taxation &mdash; and I think the Minister would agree &mdash; is central collection and local distribution.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for her commitment to look into the question of Lispole school as quickly as possible.  We will not let her forget that one.  My colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, will also want to hear something on that.</P>
    <P>This is a further matter I want to raise in my speech: the way the amendment was put forward.  The Minister gave us the total amount of revenue in education in 1990 and then she went into the detail of telling us how much primary education funding has increased from 1988 to 1990. It begs the question immediately: why did the Minister not give the total revenue for education in 1980 and show the change from 1980 to 1990?  I will tell the Minister very clearly the reason.  If she had done so she would have seen that not only is primary education underfunded but that the increase in revenue in education between 1988 and 1990 is 20 per cent whereas the comparable increase which is given there for primary education is much lower than that, 25 per cent as opposed to 18 per cent.  I always wonder about the way the amendments are phrased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>And motions, indeed. Each to his or her last.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of welfare officers, I wish the Minister had given a commitment at least to say that she would positively respond to the proposal and agree that they should be established.  I am sorry the Minister did not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the public service and early retirement, it is not a fair comparison by any standards.  There are pressures in every job and I am making the case here for teaching; there is a different kind of pressure, as the Minister herself, said on teachers.  It is not fair to compare it with the change in the public service, one of the reasons being that various levels of promotion within the <Col N="836" /> public service take into consideration the different types of stress and the different control people have, even if it is only that at 11 a.m. someone in the public service may go off and have a cup of coffee which every worker, including teachers, would welcome.  Unfortunately, teachers cannot do that.  It is different, but I will not get into it.</P>
    <P>I want to make one very firm point for the record.  I want to demolish this myth that the changes in demographic trends are going to solve all our difficulties. First, let me say that all the projections on which the Department are planning for the next ten years have already been screwed up by the last few reports of the ESRI, but I do not have the time to go into that.  I want to put one simple fact on the line: taking the worst possible scenario in terms of demographic trends, the lowest possible birth rate, the worst possible projection drop in fertility rate and the worst possible projection on emigration, and the Minister's intention, which I welcomed, to hold the same number of teachers in the system &mdash; taking the same number of teachers in the system in 1998 and taking the Minister's own figure that there will be 460,000 primary school pupils, on the worst possible scenario at that time that alone will only take us from the point we are now half way to the European average class size.  It does not resolve the problem; we need teachers in the classrooms.  I want to put that clearly on the record.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister inform us of the setting up of a policy unit in the Department and I look forward to hearing more about it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the next programme, the negotiations will take place and it is a very simple position.  An improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio is a <i>sine qua non</i> for any agreement on any movement on a national programme and the sooner people realise that the better. Unless there is a fair shake for primary education there certainly will not be from the teachers' point of view any commitment to it.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister, I want to <Col N="837" /> say two things.  Within the past year she came in here and gave me two commitments: (1) the setting up of the pilot programme on the schools psychological service and it has been delivered; and (2) the direct payment of substitute teachers, and that has also been delivered.  I want to put that on the record because I will balance my criticism with a reflection on that.  The Minister tonight has said only two things I can grasp from that long speech.  They are, that she will directly fund to schools the money that previously went to diocesan authorities.  I welcome that, as does the INTO.  We have been shouting about it for years.  It is a welcome and positive development in terms of public accountability.  I also welcome the proposal by the Minister to extend the home-school liaison service but I fail to understand why the Minister could not have addressed the minor matter of the question raised by Senator Jackman on the measuring instrument for determining when a school is disadvantaged. There are people on both sides of this House and in the other House who have tracks beaten to their door month after month by people asking how they can get their school designated as disadvantaged for the purpose of staffing and grants.  The Minister knows that her Department, the INTO and management have agreed on a simple system to do just that.  I know the Minister has probably at this stage also agreed to it, but why cannot she just say she has agreed to it and implement it?  It does not cost anything.  It just gives a measurement of disadvantage and it is then up to the Government to say how many jobs they are prepared to make available and the schools with greatest need will be catered for first.  The Minister will not have to worry about the relative differences between South Hill in Limerick and the Barracks in Athlone or wherever it happens to be.  It will be done scientifically without political interference. The local Fianna Fáil Deputy can still be written to, in order to explain to the schools when they get their teacher&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point was raised by Senators Jackman and McKenna about the cost of keeping a prisoner in jail.  I came across a case in the seventies where a school had a child they could not deal with.  It was in the Clontarf area of the city.  At that stage they plagued the Department for a psychological assessment of the child to be made but they could not get it.  They went to the health board and said the child was going to get into trouble.  They made every attempt to have such an assessment made right through the primary level.  At post-primary level they did the same thing. Eventually that child got into serious trouble and was found guilty of the murder of a teacher.  Within the past year he has committed suicide in Mountjoy.  I want to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman's case is correct.  Do we pay £34,000 to keep a prisoner in Mountjoy for a year or invest more in preventive medicine early on?  I do not want to be facile about it, I just want to give one example.  When that child was five or six years of age, the teachers went to the Department &mdash; the records are there, I looked at them recently &mdash; and said they could do something with the child with a bit of help.  The help was not forthcoming.  There was no back-up or support.  I am not saying that back-up and support will solve everything but we could solve a lot of problems by investing in the proper resources.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate.  These type of debates are important.  They make us argue the issues and we can get certain commitments, very little, mind you but nevertheless at least they go on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the Minister's commitment to hold the number of teachers in the system, to improve the pupil-teacher ratio and to work on a code of discipline which teachers are screaming for.  This is <Col N="839" /> one of the reasons they are applying in such numbers for disability but if there was a system whereby people suffering from a disability could be responded to, then they would not be seeking early retirement as a way out of an impossible situation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the commitments given by the Minister and the time she spent dealing with the debate.  I am sorry she was not able to support the motion.  I have <Col N="840" /> no objection to her making the points she made in the amendment.  I could have accepted them if they had been put as an addendum to the main motion but, unfortunately, I have to oppose them on the basis that they wipe out my motion. I thank all those who contributed to the debate, particularly Senator Costello, President of the ASTI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I particularly welcome the fact that the relevant Minister turned up for a debate of this nature rather than sending along a Minister of State who does not have quite the same level of responsibility.  The matter I raise tonight is the need for the Minister for Education <Col N="841" /> to urgently provide permanent accommodation and proper facilites for the pupils of St. Aidan's Christian Brothers Secondary School, Whitehall, Dublin 9, to replace the present totally inadequate prefabricated structure which has been in existence for over 20 years.</P>
      <P>This year St. Aidan's CBS in Whitehall is celebrating its 25th anniversary.  The school was founded in 1964 when a request was made to the Brothers to set up a school in the area.  They replied with alacrity and in September 1964 the school was opened to serve the Whitehall, Larkhill, Beaumont, Santry and Ballymun areas in what was then the primary school, Bun Scoil Linbh Íosa.  In 1966 they went ahead and purchased over nine acres of land to set up a permanent structure.  In 1967 the late Donogh O'Malley introduced free education. This was not just the year of free education, it was also the era of the great prefab, this fibreglass, wood and chipboard structure which had a planned, built-in obsolescence after ten years.</P>
      <P>One of the great tragedies of that time was that so many temporary structures were established when permanent structures could have been established for almost the same amount of money.  In 1967 it cost £218,180 to construct the prefabricated structure in St. Aidan's when the estimate for the permanent structure was £280,000.  It was intended to be a temporary structure because planning permission was got for only seven years and was never renewed.  All this was forgotten about as the years went by and, of course, the structure began to deteriorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1977 onwards there were constant running repairs that cost in the region of £70,000.  At the beginning of the eighties the school management were looking at the situation to see what would be the future for their school.  In 1983 they commissioned an architect's report which was a damning criticism of the structure as it was at the time.  The roof was &ldquo;in a very sorry state&rdquo; to quote the report and there had been poor quality work done on the original structure.  The felt lining was not of sufficient quality and <Col N="842" /> there was water ponding on the roof.  It was unsafe to work on the roof and instead of the impermeable marine plywood that was specified, there was a lot of chipboard panelling.  There was a lot of wet rot seeping through.  The solution was to reroof the school at that time, which was the beginning of the eighties, at an enormous cost.  There were structural problems as a result of the wood absorbing the water that was getting through from the roof.  The report was confirmed by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards in the same year. The minimum cost to shore it up would have been £0.5 million that would have been uneconomical in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>It was at that point that very serious attention was given to getting the permanent structure that had been promised initially.  In 1984 the management were promised a school to accommodate 450 pupils and this number was increased to 550 in 1986.  At this time planning permission was sought for the construction of the new school.  In 1986-87 a new heating furnace was installed and grant aided by the Department of Education on condition that the furnace be incorporated into the new school building.  Obviously the intention was that the new structure would be in place very shortly.  In February 1987 we had an election and Deputy O'Rourke became Minister for Education. Since then virtually everybody in the political arena has been beating a path to the Minister's door in relation to this school.</P>
    <P>There is agreement on all sides &mdash; from Deputy Bertie Ahern, Minister for Labour, who is a past pupil, to the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey &mdash; that the Minister should seriously do something about this.  While they were beating a path to the Minister's door she was beating around the bush.  Meetings took place both public and private.  There was a Private Members Bill, questions were raised in the Dáil, there was an Adjournment debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There were statements made that the matter was under review and that it was being looked at in the context of the capital programme, in the context of available accommodation and in the context of rationalisation.  All along, there was an indication that the matter would be set right eventually.  It was a long-fingering exercise by the Minister. In 1989 a meeting was held with the Minister and she promised a reply within two months but nothing happened.</P>
      <P>In May of this year there was what I would regard as a disgraceful happening when a parliamentary question was due to be answered in the Dáil on 22 May. Brother Heneghan the Provincial was called into the Minister's Department to meet with her officials.  The following day the question came up and as an indication of the Minister's concern it was stated that she was meeting constantly with management.  I thought that was very sharp practice indeed.  Today there was to have been a meeting between management and representatives of the school and the Minister or her officials.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister responded very well to an Adjournment debate that was held on the Model School <Col N="845" /> in Marlborough Street and I hope her response this evening will be in the same vein because this school is extremely deserving of her immediate attention.</P>
      <P>There are 700 pupils in the school and the prefabs are in an atrocious condition. They are very unhealthy.  They are very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter.  There is water coming through the roof.  Shower and changing rooms are used for construction study classes. Cloakrooms are used as computer rooms and dressing rooms are used for woodwork. This is totally inadequate in the present circumstances.  The 1989 Act dealing with health and safety, which no doubt the Minister will be circulating to schools in the near future, will pose major problems for this and other schools in relation to electrical wiring, the use of materials that are not fire-resistant and so on.</P>
      <P>In relation to Saint Aidan's, there are at present 1,200 new houses being constructed in the vicinity so it is not a question of a drop in population in this area. Indeed, there have been suggestions that there is excess capacity of schools in that particular area.  There is no excess capacity in the voluntary secondary sector; it is the only voluntary secondary boys school in the area.  As the Minister knows from the constitutional requirements in relation to education, there is choice.  We are very strong on the denominational character of schools and parents have the right to choose the school of their preference.  In that context, the parents have been extremely involved in regard to the school.  They have already collected in the region of £150,000 for the school and they are entitled to their choice of a voluntary secondary school.  If Saint Aidan's is not given a permanent structure, then that choice will not be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school management have met the Minister's officials and there have been suggestions which I would regard as unworthy that the Brothers were not committed to the school, that they had no intention of staying there and that <Col N="846" /> their commitment was not on any permanent basis.  That is not good enough because there has been a categorical response from the Christian Brothers that they are committed and that should be accepted in the vein it has been given.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that talks have been going on at a higher level than the level I have been talking about in relation to the management, the parents and the teachers.  I would like to know what has been going on.  Are there two tiers of negotiations?  What actually has been going on in relation to this school? Is this all a smokescreen that negotiations have been going on at a higher level in relation to the CBS, Saint Aidan's in Whitehall and is there another level where parents, staff and management are consulted?</P>
    <P>I know the staff of this school.  I have worked with them in my capacity as a teacher in the ASTI.  I have met the management who have produced an excellent briefing document on the whole situation. The school has a wonderful academic and employment reputation at third level for those youngsters who have gone through it.  That will be acknowledged far and wide on the north side of Dublin.  They are a community of staff, management and parental involvement which is exemplary in the Irish context and which has made Irish education respected worldwide.  That is why the IDA and the Government can go abroad and state, without fear or favour, that Irish students can hold their own against any others anywhere, and why Ireland is marketed abroad as the country with bright, educated youngsters and the young workforce of Europe.  This is all being done by teachers, management and parents in extremely difficult circumstances.  It has been done without the resources, the plant, the structure and, nowadays, without the necessary personnel as well.</P>
    <P>Saint Aidan's have done the work in more difficult circumstances than most teachers and most management have operated.  It is time we got an absolutely clear statement to take us out of the state of Limbo we are in, to tell us straight where the Department of Education <Col N="847" /> stand in relation to Saint Aidan's post-primary school.  The decision has to be made.  We cannot go on as we have been going on for over three years now.  We need confirmation of what is happening with the school.  What is the future of the school?  We have got the school, we have got the staff, we have got the commitment from the management and the parents.  We have got the school's excellent record.  I have no doubt it will continue to have an excellent record in the future.</P>
    <P>There is an incontrovertible case for the proper construction of the school that was promised long ago in Saint Aidan's. It is up to the Minister.  She has to make the decision in this matter and I suggest she has been somewhat tardy in coming to a decision.  I believe the statistics are there to justify the establishment of a permanent structure.  The decision should be taken once and for all.  I am asking the Minister to give us a positive decision here tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senator Joe Costello for raising this matter on the Adjournment and immediately to strongly refute two untruths which were told here in this House tonight, about me and about my office.  I will refute those first and then I will go on to deal with the debate.  One was when the Senator highlighted the date of 21 May and said that the answer to a Dáil question was the only reason a particular management were brought into my office.  That is a complete untruth and while I have the attention of the House I will refute it. There is a campaign among some particular people and I do not know the reason.  I understand from colleagues that the tenor of public debates has been extraordinarily defamatory to me.  That really does not cost me a thought because I am who I am and I have not reached the age I have without being truthful in all respects in public life.  I cannot allow what the Senator has said to go unchallenged. He said that because there was a Dáil question, that was the only reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> He called it sharp practice and said it was the only reason management was called in.  May I read a fact, please?  The situation was discussed with Brother Heneghan, Provincial, in February 1989 and particularly the question of accommodating Saint Aidan's in the reorganised Ballymun Comprehensive complex.  He undertook to consider all aspects of the matter very closely and to report back to the Department as soon as possible.  I quote: &ldquo;The Christian Brothers Provincialite has now informed the Department that it cannot support&rdquo;&mdash; bear in mind the date was February 1989 &mdash;&ldquo;the proposal to relocate Saint Aidan's in the Ballymun Comprehensive Schools&rdquo; and then it went on to give various reasons.  Following on that in recent months, there has been an upsurge in the provision of new housing in the area surrounding Saint Aidan's and at present 1,000 new houses are under construction as planned, all points which the Senator raised.</P>
    <P>The matter had gone on too long and on this I am in agreement with the Senator.  I wanted clarity on various aspects of the matter, not least on the future commitment not just of the Christian Brothers and their very fine record in that school but throughout the whole country in the voluntary sector.  We are engaged in major talks because of the unfortunate and unhappy experience of religious orders where their numbers are decreasing rapidly.  Therefore, it behoves the Department of Education and the Government in general to look very critically at money they put into privately owned sites.</P>
    <P>Let me be very clear on it and very explicit about it.  When you put money into a community, comprehensive or vocational school, the whole site and building is in complete public ownership and reverts back to the Government should there be no further need for it as an educational unit, or it can be reverted to some other useful purpose.  In the Carysfort episode last summer, quite frankly, I found it very difficult on behalf of my Department, to get the money back which the nuns in Carysfort owed me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> That is a side issue.  They have agreed to pay it.  The matter has not been completely resolved yet but it did go back to the brink.  I want to clear up the point. Therefore, within the last two years when the numbers have declined everywhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no money going back to the Department of Education in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it behoves us in the voluntary sector to look very critically at where we were putting our money. Therefore, school by school, each case is being scrutinised in that way.  That is no secret.  Of course, nobody will thank me when I am gone if there does not seem to be proper accountability for what we have done.  It arises out of two things, the demographic change and because more and more teaching orders find that their mission is completed in teaching and they have other fields they wish to conquer. Many Orders are coming to us saying &ldquo;we will not be in this particular town in five or in ten years time.  We wish to let you know that will be our plan.&rdquo;  On that basis, any voluntary sector application for funding of a major nature &mdash; as distinct from £200,000, £300,000 or £400,000 &mdash; is being looked at in that context.  My dates and my facts are quite clear and I will not have my reputation impugned by the Senator or by anybody else or accused of sharp practice when I am attending to my brief.</P>

      <P>At my request the Department asked if Brother Heneghan, who is, I understand, the superior of a certain number of schools, would put in writing to me the intention of the Order. That has now been received in my Department and I insist that I looked for that.  Why should I not?  I am looking for it everywhere I go now.  I was quite insistent that I would get reassurance on that point.  That request has now arrived in my Department.</P>
      <P>The Senator said I was tardy.  This issue does not rest with me.  It rests with the Department of Finance because there is a commitment between the Departments of Education and Finance on a stay on major development of schools in urban areas where the numbers are seen to be decreasing.  Armed with the commitment given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by Brother Heneghan I will make my submission to the Department of Finance.  I quote from the 1988 agreed report between the <Col N="851" /> Departments of Education and Finance which states:</P>
      <P>Where there are no defined catchment areas consideration of an application from any school for new accommodation shall have regard to the accommodation situation, actual and projected, within reasonable access of the particular school or area. In this context and in the light of the school transport provision, a distance of three miles is not considered unreasonable.</P>
      <P>On foot of that, the Ballymun situation, which is one mile from St. Aidan's, was looked at.  I am of the opinion, as are many people, that this school has too fine a tradition for it to be lost to the area.  At the same time, I cannot give the commitment the Senator requested tonight. Within the last week I received renewal of the commitment in writing from Brother Heneghan which I would need for a further case to be made.  I will consider that commitment, I will consider all the facts and then I will consider what to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third untruth the Senator said was that my office confirmed that the meeting with Brother Cashell and others was <i>sine die,</i> deferred.  Those words &ldquo;<i>sine die,</i> deferred&rdquo; were never used by anybody in my office.  I stand over that.  I was summoned here for a three hour debate. I have been in this House since 5.20 p.m., it is now 9.20 p.m. and I never left it.  I do not take any credit for that, I am paid <Col N="852" /> for it.  The point is that I was summoned to a debate in the House which takes priority over any other arrangements one may have made for a meeting.  Of course that was fully explained, I presume, to Brother Cashell and his interested group. May I say that, it is an untruth to say that the words &ldquo;<i>sine die</i>&rdquo; were used by my office when deferring that meeting.  That is not so.  When I have considered the letter from Brother Heneghan and then looked at all the demographic and other factors, I will be reporting to the relevant authorities and will arrange to meet the interested parties.</P>
