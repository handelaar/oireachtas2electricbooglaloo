      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we commence the business of the morning, I would like to make it known to Members of the House that the Clerk of the Seanad, Mr. Kieran Coughlan, is with us for the last time today.  He is going forward to become Clerk of Dáil Éireann.  I am sure many Members of the House would like to express their good wishes to him and to acknowledge the services he has rendered with special professionalism over his years here.  I would like to say a special thanks to him for all the qualities he has displayed in his office towards individual Members and towards the House itself and to compliment him on his integrity, his sense of fair play and understanding and his desire, above all else, to maintain the highest standards and to protect the highest values that this House seeks to ensure will be upheld at all times.  I wish him well in his new post and I have no doubt Dáil Éireann will be enormously enhanced by his presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the House agrees, it would be approriate that Leaders of the House and also former Cathaoirligh or Leas-Chathaoirligh, may like to pay their tribute.  If there are other Members who wish to pay tribute, if that is the wish of the House, I will not constrain anybody, but naturally we would like to do it in a way that <Col N="2034" /> would not take too long while, at the same time, paying the proper respect to Mr. Coughlan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>As you have said, this is the last day Kieran Coughlan will be with us in the Seanad.  It is a very sad day for us.  Kieran has been with us for about three and a half years as Clerk and previously he was Clerk Assistant.  I, and all the Members of the Seanad, would say that he has been an extremely courteous, helpful person, excellent in every way, competent in his role, an outstanding civil servant, totally expert in procedural matters and rules governing this House.  His nice way and charm is something that pleased each and every one of us.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of his role is that of Seanad Returning Officer.  We all recall his command of the system, his expertise at the various Seanad counts, his careful handling of the delicate situation at Seanad counts.  His qualities were greatly praised and admired by all.  Kieran will be missed here.  Our loss is the gain of the Lower House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my Fine Gael colleagues, I would like to join with you and the Leader of the House in congratulating Mr. Kieran Coughlan on his translation &mdash; I will not say elevation &mdash; to the Clerkship of the other House and to wish him every success there.  I know that based on his performance here and on his personality he is certain to make a great success of that job too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to thank him for all his help to all Members in all parties over the years, for his great courtesy, for his even greater tact which, I am sure, at times was tested, for his fairness and, above all, as the Cathaoirleach said, for his integrity.  His ability to help new Members around the procedures and practices is by this stage almost legendary. He was always positive in his help to Members, old and new, and never intrusive.  He had the ability to reprimand us if we were not properly obeying the procedures without it appearing to be a reprimand.  He also had a genuine concern for the welfare of all Members of <Col N="2035" /> this House.  One of his greatest qualities was his great feeling for this House, for its traditions, for the distinctive role it has to play in Irish politics, for the dignity of the House and its standing with the public and, most of all, for the potential of this House which, in many respects, is still untapped.  He is, as the Leader said, a fine public servant.</P>
    <P>The other House's gain is very much our loss but he will leave here knowing the high esteem in which he is held by all groups in this House and the total respect of all Members which he brings with him to the other House.  On behalf of my own group and, I am sure, of all Members here, I wish him well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the University Senators I would like to be associated with what has been said.  We, too, have experienced his kindness and his co-operation.  It gives me an additional personal pleasure to note that he is a UCC graduate and a former student of my own.</P>
      <P>Apart from his obvious skills and the courtesy he has shown to all of us, he has shown remarkable tact and he aquitted himself not alone with courage but with considerable aplomb in a very difficult and unprecedented situation.  I know these are skills that he will bring to the other House.  On behalf of the University Senators we wish him every good luck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to join in congratulating Kieran on his appointment as Clerk of the Dáil.  Certainly as far as I am concerned, and as far as the Labour Members are concerned, he could not have been more courteous, more kind or more helpful to us.  He has been very helpful to the new Members of our group, particularly Senator Costello and myself, in terms of the advice and guidance he has given us when we sought to use the procedures of the House.  He greatly enhanced the reputation of the House.  He has always endeavoured to protect that reputation and, indeed, to avail of every opportunity which existed for the development of the role of the <Col N="2036" /> Seanad.  He has been an expert on procedure and he has been exceptionally kind and courteous in the manner in which he conducted the count during the election to the Seanad.  One of Kieran's more endearing features is that he always made things look easy and he never went in for ceremonials or for making a big deal of what in many cases were quite complex matters that he was handling.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that he is going to the Dáil.  Perhaps he is setting an example for many of us to the extent that many of us seem to have an ambition to follow him there, if one is to believe the stories one hears.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no, never.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Progressive Decocrats would like to concur with all the sentiments expressed and wish Kieran every success in his move from this House to the Dáil.  It is true to say that integrity is Kieran's personal hallmark.  I had the good fortune when I arrived in the Dáil in 1987 of having my first contact with Kieran.  It is also true to say that he has always taken the time and the trouble to show new Members around, make sure that we knew where we were going and what the whole business was about.  As I started in 1987, when Kieran moved to the Seanad, I, too, hope that I will be following him back to the Dáil in the not-too-distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to those of my colleagues in paying tribute to Kieran Coughlan.  He is a most distinguished senior civil servant.  For me, this is a very personal loss.  Unlike some of my colleagues, I do not intend to follow Kieran to the Dáil but I hope that that will not separate us as friends.  As Cathaoirleach, as Leas-Chathaoirleach and as Cathaoirleach again, I needed Kieran's advice and I always took it.  He made a very hard job look easy.  I served with another Clerk of the Seanad and it is a very tough job but Kieran Coughlan had an easy way with him and he made it look easy.  Like Senator Murphy &mdash; and we do not have too much in common &mdash;<Col N="2037" /> I think what stood to Kieran was that he was a Corkman and his lovely Munster ease made him good with people.  I wish Kieran well and I publicly thank him for being a good friend and an extraordinarily good adviser to me and to this House.  As Senator Manning said, he had a commitment to this House which I hope will be followed by his successor, whoever that may be.  He saw the Seanad at times as being as important as the Dáil and not too many see it in that light.</P>
      <P>Again, I thank Kieran and I wish him health and long years of service in Dáil Éireann.  I am delighted for himself and his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the previous speakers in wishing Kieran every good luck on his transfer to the Dáil.  I would join with the other Members of the House in thanking him for his courtesy and kindness to Members.  In particular, I want to record my thanks to him for his advice to me when it was needed.  I join with the other Members in wishing Kieran well and, like some of the other Members, I hope to be joining him in the Dáil at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have nobody left here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to express my sincere regards to Kieran Coughlan on his elevation to his position in the Dáil.  I can only reiterate what the other Senators have said.  His qualities have been exemplified here quite clearly over the period that he has served both as Clerk Assistant and as Clerk.  His integrity is beyond reproach.  He has demonstrated that on a number of occasions.  His absolute kindness and courtesy to individual Members when they sought advice or an opinion was memorable.  He had a high level of tolerance. As far as procedural matters were concerned, he knew the facts and at all times he carried out his duties with the total impartiality that the office requires. I would like to wish Kieran, his wife and family well.  I wish Kieran, in his position as Clerk of the Dáil, many, many happy <Col N="2038" /> years of health, happiness and good fortune and progress in that role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with all the kind remarks about Kieran Coughlan.  I have known him over the years &mdash; we have all known him as a very good friend rather than an official &mdash; and I wish him well in his new job.  I know the good friendship that existed between us here will continue to exist between himself and ourselves in his new position.  We had a very good team in the Clerk and Clerk Assistant and whoever follows the Clerk will have a very difficult act to follow.  I wish him every success in his new position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the much deserved compliments to a very gentle Corkman. Coming from somebody from Tipperary that is the highest compliment I can pay him.  Since my entry to Dáil Éireann in 1973, I watched his progress through the House.  What he has now achieved is richly deserved.  I wish him every success in his new position and perhaps I may meet him again in the other House in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Coughlan has asked me to say that he is acutely embarrassed by all the good wishes and that he would like to convey, through me, his personal thanks to all of you and his delight at having worked with you and for you.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Murphy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to extend higher education grants to the small minority of students who, while not meeting formal academic requirements, are admitted <Col N="2039" /> to third level institutions on the grounds of mature years.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to review the case of a prisoner in Arbour Hill (name supplied) with a view to exercising his ministerial prerogative of commuting the sentence in the light of its comparative severity taking into account the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to outline the criteria used in the distribution of national lottery funds.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Murphy, Norris and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Murphy's and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Norris and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take all Stages of item No. 3, Fóir Teoranta (Dissolution) Bill, 1990 between now and 1 p.m. if that is possible.  It is proposed to have a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and we wish to conclude the debate on Statements regarding European Economic and Monetary Union between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.  I indicated yesterday &mdash; and it may yet happen &mdash; that we would take what was then motion 80, now motion 79 on today's Order Paper.  We may not be able to take it next week, but if we do not we will certainly take it on Tuesday, 18 December.  There is a lot of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I have clarification from the Leader of the House about item No. 3.  It will conclude, if possible, today <Col N="2040" /> but there is no question of it being guillotined at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to raise a question which I raised yesterday, the matter of the Companies Bill, which I know will be discussed later today by the Whips.  I want to draw to the attention of the Leader of the House the rumours which are circulating to the effect that the Minister for Industry and Commerce wants this Bill through as quickly as possible and in a matter of hours &mdash; these are the rumours &mdash; and that there may be pressure on the Government side to that effect.  Will he convey to the Minister, with respect, that this House has not been abolished yet.  There are three members of his party here as witnesses to the non-abolition of the House.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill which we take extremely seriously.  We are prepared to co-operate, we are prepared to sit long hours and we are prepared to sit extra days, but we are not prepared, in any circumstances, to have the Companies Bill, which in effect is a new Bill, rushed through this House, no matter how important the Minister thinks it is.  I want to emphasise the seriousness with which my group takes this matter and put it very clearly on the record that there will be no agreement to any curtailment of time or to any attempt to rush this Bill through.  I know it is not the wish of the Leader of the House that this should happen, but there are other pressures and I want him to know that he has the backing of the entire House in standing up to any other pressures which may come to have this Bill rushed through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to associate myself with what Senator Manning has said.  It would be quite a disgrace.  However, I am a little bit more optimistic than Senator Manning.  I am quite sure that Fianna Fáil would never give into that sort of pressure from the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned that <Col N="2041" /> there would be a full debate on the Companies Bill and I am hoping the Leader of the House can reassure us on that matter today.  I would also like to ask the Leader what is the proposal in terms of sitting times between now and the Christmas recess?  When will that happen and what is proposed for next week?  Finally, would it be possible at some stage to have a debate on the fluctuations in the price of fuel and the impact of those fluctuations on the economy at large?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House, in the light of the horrific and, I would consider, absolutely frightening Amnesty International report on on-going abuse of civil liberties and the atrocities in Iran in recent times, if he proposes to use his important office to do something about this in the form of a statement and if he proposes to convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the anxiety of this House on this very serious matter.  It is a horrific report and worthy of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Manning and Senator Ryan have said.  I think the Leader of the House should remember that the Companies Bill is a Seanad Bill basically; it may be a Dáil Bill now but it was introduced in the Seanad first.  It was amended many, many times in this House and, in fact, the bones of the Bill were actually changed in this House.  It would be a great pity if the Government were to agree to the measure going through here in a rushed way, in view of the considerable work done on it in this House in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I would like to ask the Leader of the House why he is so reluctant to allow a debate on Northern Ireland.  Not least it seems a debate on Northern Ireland would give the Progressive Democrats a chance to explain the fact that they can vote for one thing in this House and then vote against it in the other House.  I am talking about Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  The Progressive Democrats could clarify their position to this House, why they have <Col N="2042" /> reversed their position on Articles 2 and 3 and done a U-turn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to give them the opportunity to contradict what I am saying in a full-scale debate, perhaps a day-long debate in this House on Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Senator, you are being grossly provocative.  You must put a question to the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am never provocative.  I hope the Government as well would be happy to give us a full day to discuss the Brooke talks and their possible breaddown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>One is reluctant to test the Leader's patience following his performance yesterday, but nevertheless I appeal to him to make time available to us to discuss the situation on agriculture for two reasons.  One is that the House should be given the opportunity of rejecting the intimidation of the European Community by the United States in the GATT talks and the inference that the Community has not made concessions when, in fact, it has made significant concessions before it ever got to the talks. The second reason I would like to have a debate on agriculture is that last Sunday on the front page of <i>The Sunday Times</i> we had very damaging information about illegal substances being used in beef cattle.  We are having another programme on that matter on the BBC tonight and inevitably, there will be very damaging results for the Irish beef industry. The use of these substances is putting those who conduct their business within the law at a competitive disadvantage.  It is also funding illegal, subversive organisations in the North and for that reason this House should discuss the matter,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the call by Senator Dardis to have a full-scale debate on the issues he points out, <Col N="2043" /> particularly with the international blackmailing of the Community in relation to the GATT talks at the moment.  What is being demanded would have horrific implications but no outcome or an unsuccessful outcome also has implications that are far from clear to most people.  If this House is to mean anything, and if it is to appear relevant to the people at large, we must be able to react quickly to the issues of the day and be able to respond and use it as a forum to discuss, debate and respond to the issues that are affecting our country and our people.  The Leader of the House has responded previously to these requests for a response to the issues and to the problems in agriculture, particularly the GATT talks at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Leader of the House for agreeing so courteously to the debate on motion 79 and to say that it is quite satisfactory to me if it is taken the week after next.  I understand the pressures on Government time and business.  It is a controversial, complicated and technical area involving a judgment of the European Court and I would be very happy if any Members of the House would be interested in a briefing, which I could arrange, so that we can have the kind of debate for which I think, this Chamber was designed in which the subject is illuminated rather than clouded by controversy and irrelevancy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he would allow a debate on the political fund ballot taking place next week by SIPTU?  I can understand the interest of all the Members here given that this union is reputed to have 200,000 members which would give an income of roughly £100,000 per week.  This debate would establish how SIPTU are going to disburse or apportion this fund to the different political parties and it would also establish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise on the Order of Business with the Leader of the House what I would hope would be the House's condemnation of the jailing yesterday in Iraq of an Irishman for allegedly trying to escape.  I am sure all of us would treat this as one violation of human rights following on others.  I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, with the ambassador and with the EC and the UN. I would also like him to raise the matter regarding the PARC employees.  While recent releases are welcome, I do not think any of us should take any kudos in these people being allowed home.  Every pressure should be brought to bear on the authorities to ensure that no-one is detained against their will.  I spoke to a relative of one of the people who was recently released and their ordeal has had a traumatic effect on them.  It is important that the PARC authorities give greater consideration to the human aspect than to the commercial aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible for the Leader of the House to convey to the Commissioner for Agriculture, Commissioner MacSharry, our total support for the stance being adopted of not giving one iota further <i>vis-a-vis</i> agricultural cuts?  In fact, there were some reservations about the distance we have gone.  Would it be possible to convey, firmly and vehemently, our absolute support and approval for the stance he and others are taking, and we hope will continue to take, against dictatorial attitudes of the US, the Cairns Group countries and others about altering the 30 per cent reduction in the agricutlrual area?</P>

      <P>I wish to join in the tributes that have been paid to the Clerk of the Seanad, Kieran Coughlan.  During the time that I was Leader of the House <Col N="2045" /> I always found him to be extremely courteous and, at all times, he attended to the duties of this House with caution, care, diligence and expertise.  I know he will do an extremely good job in his promotion and I wish him every success. Whoever takes his place will have an extremely difficult job to fulfil his or her duties in the manner in which Kieran has carried out his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Clerk of the Seanad and thank him for being so helpful to me in my first year as a Senator here.  I found him most courteous and helpful and I would like to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>A number of the issues raised this morning highlight the question once again of the relevance of the House in dealing with current matters.  The GATT talks which are extremely important and pressing deserve a debate.  Northern Ireland deserves a debate and we have been looking for one for a long time. So, too, does the issue in relation to the prisons, even the political fund for SIPTU and the question of the source of funds for political parties are subjects that require a good airing in the House.  We should have an opportunity to put relevant issues on the agenda.  I know the Leader of the House will say to me, as he has said before, &ldquo;you can put down the item in Private Members' time&rdquo;.  We should have a more structured formula in the agenda of the House where we could discuss very pressing and relevant issues as they arise.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning referred to item No. 3.  I said that, if possible, we will take all Stages but if that is not feasible, we will not rush it.  He referred to the Companies Bill, as did other Senators.  That matter will be discussed by the Whips when the Order of Business has concluded.  I am not under pressure from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the question of time for the Companies Bill.

      <P>Senator Ryan also commented and raised a query on it.  Senator Upton spoke of a full debate on the Companies Bill and he asked what was the approximate plan of programme for next week and the week after.  We have a lot of business and next week we will have the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill and the Companies Bill.  We will have the Independent Group's motion in Private Members' time.  The following week we will have other legislation and the Companies Bill.  We hope to have a debate on motion 79 on the Order Paper on that Tuesday and we hope to make a start on the Appropriation Bill which must be passed before the end of December. Senator Upton asked for a debate on fuel prices.  I can say for certain that we will not have a debate on it before Christmas.  It is something for the future.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly asked about the Amnesty International report.  It is something I have noted.  Senator Ross referred to the Companies Bill and he asked questions about Northern Ireland.  I assure Senator Ross of two things: we will not have a debate before Christmas on Northern Ireland but it is something on which I will endeavour to facilitate him in the New Year if at all possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked about agriculture and the GATT talks.  We had a fairly long discussion on agriculture recently and we will not have a debate on it before Christmas but I appreciate the concern of many Senators in regard to the whole area of agriculture, the GATT talks and so on.  Senator Doyle also referred to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris briefly referred to motion 79 and noted what I said.  Senator O'Keeffe referred to the activities of SIPTU.  I have no proposals to investigate that matter at this time.  Senator Cosgrave referred to the person who was jailed in Iraq and he also asked about the PARC employees.  I have no plans for a debate on that before Christmas.  I also <Col N="2047" /> noted that Senator Cosgrave spoke on the two items.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan referred to agricultural matters.  I have given my reply to him on those.  Senator Lanigan paid tribute, and rightly so, to Kieran Coughlan. Senator Costello referred to debates on a whole series of matters &mdash; Northern Ireland, the prison service and so on. With regard to the role of the Seanad and whether it should be open to debates on whatever is the order of the day or the flavour of the month, I am not certain that should be the way forward but it is something for the future.  I noted what Senator Costello said.</P>

    <Title>Fóir Teoranta (Dissolution) Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the tributes paid to Mr. Coughlan who, I understand is serving his last day in the Seanad.  They are elevating him to our House and I will be there to welcome him next week.  I have always found him extremely courteous and efficient in this House.  This Bill provides for the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta, the repeal of existing Fóir Teoranta legislation, the transfer of its assets and liabilities to the Industrial Credit Corporation plc and related matters.  It gives effect to the Government's decision, announced in February 1989, to wind-up the activities of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta was established in March 1972 under the Companies Act, 1963, as provided for in section 2 of the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972.  It was designed to fill a gap which was perceived in the range of State services available to manufacturing industry at the time.  Its purpose was to provide an orderly procedure for restructuring ailing, but potentially viable industrial concerns which encountered financial difficulties and which were <Col N="2048" /> unable to obtain their financial requirements from commercial sources.</P>
    <P>Fóir was established in a period of structural change in Irish industry prior to EEC membership in 1973, and the removal of many trade barriers.  The progression to the open economy which we now have was taking place rapidly and the Government at the time took the view that transitional measures aimed at helping Irish industry to adapt to the new, more competitive conditions would be reasonable.  Fóir's busiest period of activity was during the recessionary period of the early eighties when it provided very substantial assistance to Irish industry, mainly in the traditional sectors such as textiles and clothing, footwear and leather, furniture, etc.  Unfortunately, despite Fóir's efforts, many of its client firms in these sectors did not survive.  It would be difficult to assert that Fóir Teoranta had anything but a marginal effect on the overall performance of these sectors, one way or the other, over the period since its establishment. On the positive side, it must be said, that some firms in various sectors which were assisted by Fóir prospered and are trading successfully today.</P>
    <P>Ireland joined the European Community in 1973 shortly after Fóir Teoranta was established.  Since then, there have been wide fluctuations in the performance of the economy.  In part, fast growth periods were stimulated by increased Government expenditure and borrowing.  These borrowings eventually became unsustainable and the previous Government embarked upon the implementation of a Programme for National Recovery which had as one of its central aims the improvement of the environment for industry so that industry would be in a position to stand on its own feet and compete in the world marketplace.  The aim was to reduce excessive Government expenditure, thereby reducing Government borrowing and lessening the upward pressures on interest rates and inflation.  As Senators know, very considerable progress has been achieved in the past three years in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> The level of activity in Fóir Teoranta had tapered off considerably in recent years, reflecting the improved outlook for industry from a peak of about £23 million in disbursements in 1983 to about £7 million in 1988.  The number of applications received, cases approved and the average size of cases approved, had also substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>In line with the fall-off in demand for its services and the virtual disappearance of large cases, together with buoyant own resources, Fóir Teoranta's requirement for Exchequer funding also declined in recent years.  The last occasion when the company needed to call on the Exchequer was in 1987.  Since then it has financed its operations from on-going income from its investments by way of interest and capital repayments, including a considerable element of pre-payments and share realisations.  In fact, during the winding down phase, Fóir Teoranta has repaid a total of £10.6 million of Exchequer advances &mdash; £4 million in 1989 and £6.6 million this year.  The company has been closed for new business since 23 February 1989.</P>
    <P>Since Fóir Teoranta was a lender of last resort it is not all that surprising that a high degree of failure took place among its client firms.  However, the failure rate experienced by Fóir Teoranta involved very considerable cost to the Exchequer. The failure rate may be measured by the fact that some £75 million of the Exchequer advances of £85 million currently outstanding has, in effect, already been written-off by the company as irrecoverable.</P>
    <P>The level of write-off in Fóir Teoranta reflects the fact that many firms failed despite the assistance given by Fóir Teoranta. Many of those firms left it far too late to go to Fóir Teoranta for assistance in the first instance.  Nevertheless, where assistance was given in such cases, the damage had already been done and the firms eventually went to the wall anyway. While there may be economic benefit in keeping jobs in existence longer rather than being lost at the outset, the prospect for long term sustainable employment may be better if firms are transferred to <Col N="2050" /> new owners quickly in the receivership/liquidation process than if they are kept in existence, with Fóir Teoranta's assistance, but with existing high levels of indebtedness and generally poor management as well as other weaknesses. The new examiner provisions in the Companies Act, 1990, will play an important and positive role in the area of company financial reconstructions in the future.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which the Government considered the future of Fóir Teoranta.  Their decision that Fóir Teoranta should be wound up, as indicated in the announcement I made on 22 February 1989, was based on the following: (i) the low level of demand for Fóir Teoranta's services; (ii) the very much changed industrial environment, as a result of the firm action taken by this Government and the previous one, as compared with when Fóir Teoranta was established; (iii) the provision, now enacted in the Companies Act, 1990, allowing for the appointment by the courts of an examiner in order to prevent a potentially viable company from going into immediate liquidation; and (iv) the need to prepare Irish industry to be ready to meet the challenges of the more competitive regime which will apply when the internal market is in place after 1992.</P>
    <P>The decline in demand for Fóir Teoranta's services was due to a number of factors.  The new climate of confidence in the economy and the favourable environment for industry were obviously major influencing factors.  Another important consideration was the fact that finance for industry is now available on a much wider scale than ever before from private sector individual and institutional sources.  Individual investors have the powerful advantage of State-backed tax schemes such as the Business Expansion Scheme.</P>
    <P>Venture capital funds also exist on a significant scale with an important role in this regard being played by public sector agencies such as NADCORP and the investment arm of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  Given these developments, it was inevitable that, leaving aside the improvements in the economy generally, <Col N="2051" /> demand for Fóir Teoranta services would be considerably lessened and the need for such an organisation diminished.</P>
    <P>The examiner provisions of the Companies Act, 1990, have now been in operation for about three months.  It is of course, too early to see how successful the provisions will be but there is, I believe, a strong desire among all concerned that the new procedure operates effectively to achieve the purposes for which it was intended.  The similar Chapter 11 process in the United States has, of course, operated there for many years. The Companies Act, 1990, allows for a stay on the rights of creditors while the examiner attempts a reconstruction of the company's finances.  One of my objectives in preparing the Bill originally was to provide a new procedure which would help to obviate the need for a separate State company to deal with industrial rescue, and indeed Fóir Teoranta itself advocated that the new procedures should be implemented. There is sufficient scope under the new procedure for genuinely viable firms to stave off closure if they are threatened by merely short term financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>The industrial environment now is very much changed from the one which existed when Fóir Teoranta was established 18 years ago and during its main periods of business.  Business confidence has never been greater.  I believe that State intervention such as that provided by Fóir Teoranta has no place in this environment.  Interest rates and inflation are at lower rates than those that exist in many of our competitor economies.  The Confederation of Irish Industry is on record as stating that industry in Ireland would &ldquo;prefer to have a competitive cost environment than seek to compensate for deficiencies in the environment through cash grants&rdquo; etc., from the State.  Clearly, we are living in an environment much more conducive to getting industry back on its feet and achieving increased long term industrial employment.  The best action which the Government can take in relation to the survival of firms is to <Col N="2052" /> contribute as much as possible to lowering the input costs of industry, rather than giving them handouts when it is probably too late to save them anyway.</P>
    <P>The underlying performance of manufacturing employment has been improving in recent years.  The target set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to generate 20,000 gross jobs on average per year in manufacturing and international services was achieved with average annual gains over 1988-89 of 20,900 jobs. The net annual gain in employment on average over the period was 4,700 in this sector.  Total manufacturing employment is expected to grow further in 1990-91. The level of growth will be dependent on a number of factors, in particular the performance of economies such as those of the UK and the US.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Government took their decision in relation to Fóir Teoranta in the light of prevailing circumstances.  The Government's view at the time was that with the other sources of finance available for investment in industry and with the economy in good condition, there should be little if any adverse impact on employment as a result of the closure of Fóir Teoranta.  I am happy to say that view has proved correct; as already indicated, in the period since Fóir Teoranta closed for new business, employment in manufacturing industry increased.  As regards the view that a need may arise in the future for the State to be actively involved in industrial rescue should economic conditions deteriorate, it has to be made clear that the days of feather-bedding Irish industry are over.  Irish industry must be able to compete in the marketplace and in an intensive effort to ensure that this will be the case post-1992, the Government are already devoting greater resources to industry in the context of the EC Structural Funds over the next few years.  Expenditure supported by the Structural Funds will be over £1 billion over the five-year period to 1993.  There is, therefore, no lessening in the level of resources being devoted to industry.  It is the purpose for which those resources are used which is important and we will ensure that the funds involved are <Col N="2053" /> put to best effect in order to secure good solid progress the aim of increasing the level of employment in the economy.</P>
    <P>There has been an orderly winding down of Fóir Teoranta's activities.  Its portfolio of loans and investments under the terms of the legislation now before the House, will be assigned to the Industrial Credit Corporation to administer. The Exchequer's investment in the client firms concerned will be looked after by the Industrial Credit Corporation in accordance with the contractual arrangements entered into by those firms with Fóir Teoranta.  It is not possible to say how long the administration of the portfolio in the hands of the Industrial Credit Corporation will take.  However, I expect it will probably take of the order of five to seven years, but it could be longer in particular instances.</P>
    <P>My Department are negotiating with the ICC on the fee for remunerating the ICC for its work in administering the Fóir Teoranta portfolio.  The House is aware that in relation to ICC I have employed consultants to consider and report on the State's options in relation to the future of the company.  Whatever the Government's decision in due course on the future of the ICC, I envisage that ICC will continue to administer the Fóir Teoranta portfolio on the basis now being established.</P>
    <P>As regards the staff of Fóir Teoranta, I am pleased to report that the bulk of the staff have now either been redeployed to other parts of the public service or have taken early retirement on terms similar to those under the general public service early retirement scheme.  Some temporary staff have been taken on so as to ensure that the winding down process proceeds smoothly and that the Exchequer investment is protected.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the specific provisions of the Bill, I would like once again to express publicly my appreciation and that of the Government of the work done by Fóir Teoranta since its establishment. I wish to pay tribute to the hard work, commitment and dedication of the staff, management and directors of the company over the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2054" /> I will now deal with the individual sections of the Bill.  First of all I should point out that the provisions of the Bill will come into effect on a day to be appointed by Ministerial order.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a definitions section.  Section 2 dissolves Fóir Teoranta.  Section 3 transfers all the assets and liabilities of Fóir Teoranta to the Industrial Credit Corporation save for a sum of £75 million of Exchequer advances which is being written off.  This amount has already been written off in the books of Fóir Teoranta as being irrecoverable.  It is important to emphasise that, apart from about £10 million written off in 1983, this £75 million represents losses incurred by Fóir Teoranta over the full 18 years of its existence.  The balance of the outstanding Exchequer advances, which is about £10 million, will be transferred to the ICC.</P>
    <P>Moneys received by the ICC in respect of the assets of Fóir Teoranta, mainly its portfolio of loans and equity investments will, under subsection (4) of this section, be paid to the Exchequer.  Subsection (5) allows the Minister to pay to the ICC a fee in respect of its management of the assets and liabilities transferred to it.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the preservation of existing contracts of Fóir Teoranta and their transfer to the ICC.  Section 5 provides that the ICC will be substituted for Fóir Teoranta where the latter is a party to legal proceedings immediately before the commencement of the Act. Section 6 exempts the transfer involved under these provisions from the imposition of stamp duty.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the final accounts of Fóir Teoranta which will be prepared by the ICC and submitted to the Minister who will present them to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The section also requires the corporation to keep all proper and usual accounts in relation to the assets and liabilities transferred to it and to present them to the Minister who will submit them to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the ICC shall present a report of its activities in relation to the assets and liabilities transferred to <Col N="2055" /> it to the Minister who will present it to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (1) provides that the Minister may make advances not exceeding £2 million to the corporation in respect of liabilities of Fóir Teoranta, arising from the exercise of its statutory functions, which had not been discharged by Fóir Teoranta as of the transfer date.  These liabilities arise from some outstanding commitments to client firms and to receivers of client firms where in certain circumstances moneys paid to Fóir Teoranta by receivers may have to be returned to the receivers together with interest thereon.  The remaining sub-sections contain standard provisions in relation to Exchequer advances.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the repeal of existing Fóir Teoranta legislation.  Section 11 provides that the expenses incurred in the administration of the Act be paid from moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 12 deals with the short Title and the commencement.  As I mentioned already, the Act will come into operation on such day as the Minister may appoint by order.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I beg the indulgence of the Chair.  I want to add a few personal words of good wishes to our Clerk, Mr. Kieran Coughlan, as this is his last day in this House.  My colleague, Senator Maurice Manning, spoke very eloquently on behalf of all the Fine Gael Senators.  I am sure his sentiments expressed the views of all of us in this House.

    <P>I would also like to thank the Minister for coming and presenting this Bill to us in the Seanad.  He was with us last week and I appreciate when a busy Cabinet Minister like the Minister for Finance takes time off to deal with a Bill in the House himself.  Having been a Minister of State some years ago, there is a sympton which prevails I am afraid with all Governments at times, that you wheel in some unfortunate Minister of State and <Col N="2056" /> thrust a script into their hand as they are coming in the door and say, &ldquo;read that and get it over and done with&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Naturally.  There is a sort of <i>déja vu</i> feeling about the script this morning if you read what was delivered in the other House &mdash; all the more reason I thank him for bothering to come and put it if you like, twice on the record in these Houses.  There is only so much that can be said about a technical Bill and that is understandable.</P>
      <P>We all appreciate what the Bill is setting out to achieve &mdash; the winding up and dissolution of Fóir Teoranta and the transferring of any assets and/or liabilities to the Industrial Credit Corporation.  We have had some time to think about the principles involved in this because the Minister flagged his intention originally back in February 1989, if memory serves me correctly.  Circumstances were somewhat different in February 1989 to those of today and I still remain to be convinced that the procedure we are taking today is the correct one.  I understand the technical reasons behind it and, to a certain extent, the Minister is in a position to justify what he is doing.  I will go through in a moment the main points he gives for justifying the situation we have before us today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be fair to say that the main plank is that macro-economic indicators are most important to industry, particularly to small and manufacturing industry. Interest rates, inflation rates, the <Col N="2057" /> debt-GNP ratio and the cost of fuel are all factors that allow industry to be competitive and profitable and, we hope, not need a State rescue service of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>In February 1989, if one recalls, interest rates were 3 per cent lower than they are today.  Without going into the vagaries of interest rates in the interim, they have gone down and they have gone up, and the net result is that they are now 3 per cent higher today than they were at the time.  The cost of money and access to it, particularly for smaller companies and the higher risk end of industry, for example, manufacturing industry, are the chief aspects of competition and viability.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that Fóir Teoranta was established in 1972 just prior to our entry into the European Economic Community, as we referred to it at the time, and prior to the rapid removal of trade barriers that took place around that time.  They were to fill what was perceived to be at the time a gap in State services to manufacturing industry. Eighteen years on, much has happened and there have been major changes not only in the Irish economy but in the economy of Europe and the world economy generally in the intervening period.  Fóir Teoranta was to allow for what was referred to as an orderly restructuring of ailing but viable industries.  They have been referred to as &ldquo;the lender of last resort,&rdquo;&ldquo;the State rescue bank&rdquo;, &ldquo;an industrial rescue company&rdquo;.  Lots of labels have been pinned on Fóir Teoranta over the years.  Indeed, I think all would be reasonable descriptions of the role they played.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta had a most important role to play in regard to manufacturing industry while industry generally was adopting to a more open economy and the competitive environment of free trade especially in industries such as textiles, clothing, footwear and furniture as the Minister pointed out.  In recent times, particularly since 1982 or 1983, their role has appeared to be declining in as much as the demand for their services, if measured in terms of money lent, would show a decline.  One can see that £23 <Col N="2058" /> million was lent in 1983 and that decreased to £7 million in 1988.  I am not sure whether that is the only indicator of the role of Fóir Teoranta but I suppose it is the only tangible one we have got to measure it by.  There were some great success stories as the Minister is well aware over the years but there was a high failure rate in relation to Fóir Teoranta involvement in different manufacturing companies.  Most companies that approached Fóir Teoranta ultimately did not survive because by the time they got to Fóir Teoranta, the lender of last resort, they were of questionable viability, in many cases.  Forty thousand jobs saved in the last eight or nine years is an impressive record and that is the record of Fóir Teoranta.  For the people employed and for the management of the companies involved in relation to these 40,000 jobs, Fóir Teoranta provided an invaluable State service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated the four or five reasons on why he justified the winding down of the business of Fóir Teoranta and transferring what was left to the ICC.  We should look at these in more detail at the moment: the low level of demand for Fóir Teoranta services.  I presume one reads into that that companies with viability problems, companies that are under-capitalised, companies in profitability difficulties of one kind or another have been going elsewhere for rescue finance rather than to Fóir Teoranta.  If I read the Minister's statement correctly, one assumes that the business expansion scheme, venture capital provisions generally and the establishment of the venture capital NADCORP, must be where these companies now in problems are finding themselves. I am not sure if the type of company that had to resort to Fóir Teoranta for State rescue during the past 18 years will find much succour or comfort in any of these avenues today.</P>
    <P>All of these schemes operate on a strictly commercial basis.  NADCORP, for example, is not a rescue capital company; it is a venture capital company and their terms of reference are completely different from those of Fóir Teoranta.  If <Col N="2059" /> I were managing director or chief executive of a small manufacturing company that needed what we have understood over the years to be rescue finance, the type of finance that Fóir Teoranta provided, I am quite sure I would not be received with open arms by a venture capital company whose brief and terms of reference are quite different.</P>
    <P>If we are going to justify the winding down of Fóir Teoranta as a State rescue company and say that one of the reasons is the success of the BES, if the Minister uses that as a plank of his argument, he owes it to the House to explain how he sees the future of the business expansion scheme.  Only in the past few weeks a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General has questioned the whole BES situation throughout the country.  There is a serious question mark over whether the Minister as a result will renew the BES from April next year.  If the Minister is using this as part of his argument for winding down Fóir Teoranta, he should give the House assurances that the BES will be renewed from April next year when the present course runs out.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know the views of the Minister for Finance on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the references to the BES, which are reasonably alarming and which certainly question the whole situation at the moment.</P>
    <P>The second plank of the Minister's argument for winding down Fóir Teoranta was &mdash; and I quote &mdash;&ldquo;The very much changed industrial environment as a result of the firm action taken by this Government and the previous one as compared with when Fóir Teoranta was established&rdquo;.  Fóir Teoranta was established 18 years ago.  I certainly do not have any clear recollection of the business environment at that time; I probably was not paying as much attention to it in those days as I would have to today in any case, but I think the Minister, if he is being reasonable and if he is being fair, can add to his script and expand the point he is making as to why there has been a very much changed industrial environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2060" /> At the general election in 1987 &mdash; and the Fine Gael manifesto for that election is in print and it is quite clear &mdash; we put the macro-economic climate of this country above everything else in terms of being the way forward for industry generally, not just manufacturing industry, and for the viability of this country from an economic point of view.  As the Minister knows, his own party opposed everything we said and went to the doorsteps contradicting the points in the Fine Gael election manifesto of 1987.  We knew the medicine would be difficult for the electorate to take.  The electorate said to us quite clearly: &ldquo;Sorry, there is a much sweeter message; there is more sugar on the Fianna Fáil message, we do not want to know the hardship and the hair shirt that you say will be necessary for the next three or four years&rdquo;. Consequently, we lost the election.  We were very straight with the electorate at the time.</P>

      <P>As a result when Fianna Fáil got into office did they implement their plans to the economy?  Did they do as they had said to the electorate they would do?  Where were the goodies? Where were the deliveries and where were all the promises?  I have to say, fortunately for the country, they did not run the country according to their 1987 election manifesto.  What did they do? They stole our clothes, having told the electorate they would suffer from the hair shirt policies if they elected us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>They picked up our manifesto, they picked up our policies and they ran with them.  What did Fine Gael do on the Opposition benches &mdash; and this is what I would have liked the Minister to have acknowledged.  After much heart-rendering and soul-searching and having <Col N="2061" /> campaigned on the basis of what was necessary and what was in the interests of the State and our people, we decided under the Tallaght strategy to support the very difficult measures the Government were then implementing.  They were after all, implementing what we had been saying was absolutely necessary and for the sake of the country, we supported the Government when they got into office in 1987.</P>
      <P>I am running on this point because the Minister specifically refers to the firm action taken by this Government and the previous one.  The previous one was the one that came into office in spring 1987. The reason, and the Minister knows it, that firm action was possible on the economy was the conditional support of Fine Gael in relation to the economic measures that had to be taken at that time.  If that is a justification for what we are about here this morning, we must understand clearly the reasons why firm action was possible by a Fianna Fáil Government at the time.  It was because of the bravery of Alan Dukes as Ceannaire at the time and because the party put the country before their own political ends.  Politically, we possibly have paid the price but I have no doubt that history will recognise and reward, not only Alan Dukes, but the Fine Gael Party for the stance it took.  If the Minister is right &mdash; and to a point generally the climate has changed; it is much more positive and some of the problems are being ironed out with constructive help from the Opposition in these Houses &mdash; it is only fair to recognise history and not to be slightly revisionist about it as with the greatest respect, the Minister's script might be considered to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving that political interlude aside, there is one point I would like to bring in here, and that is, the whole problem of interest rates.  I mentioned earlier that effectively they are 3 per cent higher now than when the Minister indicated his intention to dissolve Fóir Teoranta, wind it up and transfer the assets and liabilities to Industrial Credit Corporation.  That was in February 1989.  For the last six months the Central Bank has had quite <Col N="2062" /> a clear policy in that the punt was pegged very clearly in line with the Deutschemark. It was around the 2.68 level and there was virtually no fluctuation.  In the past two weeks it appears the Central Bank's policy in this area has changed. There were no headlines, no major announcement, we do not know what went on, but it appears the punt is now fluctuating within the EMS and is not as clearly pegged with the Deutschemark as it was.  The Minister shakes his head.  I would appreciate if the Minister would refer to this point in winding up Second Stage and explain why, suddenly, the apparent change.  Does it indicate nervousness on the part of the Central Bank in relation to the Book of Estimates and the budget we are about to face?  Does it indicate that the Central Bank are a measure of the political nervousness that is apparent in the main Government party?  What do we read, if anything &mdash; and I am prepared to be corrected by the Minister on this &mdash; from what would look to be a change in policy in relation to the Central Bank?  It may seem a technical issue but it has far-reaching effects on all of us because it could herald greater fluctuation in interest rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It has happened quite a few times before if the Senator looks back at the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it did not but any time it happened one could read from the political scene of the day why it happened.  What I am asking is for the Minister to interpret now why the change in the last fortnight in terms of the internal political scene and the external, the Community scene generally.  There may be explanations on both fronts.  For the record, we should straighten out the situation because if it means we are in greater risk of higher interest rates it would weaken the Minister's argument, apart from the fact that they are 3 per cent higher than they were in February 1989 when it was decided to dissolve Fóir Teoranta. This apparent policy change with the Central Bank could further weaken <Col N="2063" /> the Minister's argument in relation to justification of what he is now doing.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned as his third point in defence of the procedure he is now enacting, the enactment of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, if I give it its correct title, and what is generally known throughout the country as the Goodman Bill.  Apparently Goodman is not the only company to benefit from this Act; even though it is only with us a short couple of months a small textile company is also benefiting.  He has certainly made an approach but whether the company is actually in the hands of an examiner or not, I am not too sure.</P>
      <P>We all stated &mdash; and I am sure the Minister over the years was also of this view &mdash; that justifying the existence of Fóir Teoranta when we did not have what we call the examiner procedure on our Statute Book was very easy.  We all called at different stages over the years for bringing forward this section of the Companies Act.  It was subsequently taken out of the major Companies Bill that is going through the Dáil at the moment, and is shortly to reach us here in the Seanad, and was presented as its own Bill in August.  This would allow companies who were getting into difficulty to stave off the receiver and their creditors by approaching the High Court and having an examiner appointed to allow them manage and work themselves out of their financial difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this provision will work as efficiently as we had all assumed it would. In the case of a company as large as the Goodman group of companies I see little difficulty in terms of the expenses and cost involved in invoking the provisions and the establishment of the examiner procedure.  I would like the Minister to be specific as to whether the cost of one, two or three or several trips to the High Court under this provision would leave it out of the reach of most small manufacturing companies if they needed rescue of one kind or another.  We all know the legal costs generally and the higher the court the more prohibitive the cost.  If the procedures now under way in <Col N="2064" /> relation to solving the difficulties of the Goodman group of companies are a reasonable headline and if the number of trips backwards and forwards to the High Court indicate the normal procedure under the Act, it would be ruled out for the vast majority of small manufacturing companies for rescue and who would look for the examiner provision.  The cost would appear to be prohibitive for anything but very large companies.  I would like the Minister's comment on that.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, the procedure enacted in August cannot be considered a fall-back for small manufacturing companies and thereby the removal of the provision of the facilities of Fóir Teoranta will further weaken the possibility of these companies being able to trade out of their difficulties and become viable.  I await the Minister's specific response to that.  I accept that that Bill, enacted in September of this year, is but in its infancy.  We have only had a couple of months of operation.  I also understand &mdash; and I hope I am correct in saying this &mdash; that there are amendments included in the Companies Bill that is about to reach the Seanad &mdash; the major Bill &mdash; referring specifically to the Companies (Amendment) Act of September last. Already difficulties, be they technical or otherwise &mdash; flaws &mdash; have become apparent in this new piece of legislation and two to three months later we are amending legislation which passed through both Houses in the past few months.</P>
    <P>If we use the Minister's third plank of defence for the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta, the Companies Act, 1990, any difficulties that have become apparent in it in the short time of its enactment should be spelled out here.  We should be assured that they are not of such a nature that they would preclude access to this legislation by companies that need an examiner appointed to allow them to trade out of their difficulties and stave off creditors, but particularly that it would not preclude small manufacturing industries, the type of industry that has been the main benefactor of Fóir Teoranta in the past 18 years.  From a cost point of view and <Col N="2065" /> possibly because of some of the difficulties that have now become apparent, the very industries that Fóir Teoranta was set up to help would be precluded from using this legislation.  They would not be precluded in law but in practice because of the cost.  I feel it would be out of their reach and I worry about that because of the High Court implications and the enormous legal costs involved.</P>
    <P>Constitutional difficulties are also becoming apparent in this legislation and I would like the Minister's comment on that also.  Is the Minister satisfied that there is no constitutional question at all in the provisions in the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990?  I would like to know the Minister's views on that.  This question is being raised in legal circles and one hears it bandied about from time to time in both Houses.  I would like the Minister to expand on that.  If it proved either with the present companies that are being examined or in the future that there was a constitutional question, then the Minister's argument is further weakened in using that legislation as a defence for winding down Fóir Teoranta.  My main concern is for the small to medium manufacturing industry that has been traditionally under-capitalised.  They were the industries that used Fóir Teoranta for the past 18 years particularly in the early 1980s when the demand for Fóir Teoranta's services was at its peak.</P>
    <P>The Minister's fourth plank of defence for the winding down of Fóir Teoranta is the need to prepare Irish industry to be ready to meet the challenges of the more competitive regime which will apply when the internal market is in place in 1992.  We all agree with that.  It is a kind of &ldquo;mother's milk&rdquo; type aspiration; we could say that about anything.  We all hope we will be able to compete in the open market and in the barrier-free Europe and that industry will be more competitive.  The Minister in his speech was not slow to give bouquets to himself and the previous Government.  It may be justified.  In the area of preparing industry and Irish companies for the Europe of post-1992, I do not think bouquets are as deserved.  The enthusiasm that should <Col N="2066" /> have been there in awakening Irish awareness to the reality of the situation post-1992 was absent.  There was a programme &mdash; Europen, if I recall it correctly &mdash; that ran for a while.  There were pretty billboards around the country and a few documents landed on our desks here and there and certainly the CII tried to stir up a little bit of interest at different levels of their activities but there is a justifiable feeling throughout industry and the commercial world in Ireland that the hard competitive realities of a barrier-free Europe really have not come home to roost yet.  The Minister used the eloquent expression in relation to the abolition of Fóir Teoranta &ldquo;they need to prepare Irish industry to be ready to meet the challenges&rdquo;.  If that is one of his planks in preparing Irish industry to meet the challenges, he is stating effectively to small manufacturing industries, &ldquo;Sorry, mates, no more State rescue for you.  You have to stand up and be counted now. You are big boys.  We are in a free Europe.  Run off and look for BES.  Go look for some venture capital from NADCORP&rdquo;. It is a different ball game from rescue capital and the Minister knows that.  I know that.</P>
    <P>The type of argument could be used retrospectively with great justification for all the companies that came to Fóir Teoranta and subsequently failed.  The art in what we are talking about now is in having in place the correct formula for distinguishing potentially viable small manufacturing companies from those that obviously are destined, regrettably, for failure.</P>
    <P>Certainly in the commercial reality of the banking world, whether in terms of venture capital or the strict commercial banks and the ordinary banking system that we have always been used to, most of the companies that went to Fóir Teoranta would not be received with open arms and the Minister realises that.  They will now be left without any State rescue capital at all.  If that is what we want, let us talk about it.  Trying to pretend that there are alternatives in place when a company gets into financial difficulty is being slightly disingenuous.  Effectively, from <Col N="2067" /> the vast majority of companies that would heretofore have approached Fóir Teoranta there will be no alternative in the future if they run into these financial difficulties.  If that is what the Minister wants let him say that and let us talk about it because that is not what is being said.  We are justifying the winding down of Fóir Teoranta on the basis that the whole climate has changed and there are alternatives in place now.  They are the main thrust of the Minister's argument. There are effectively no alternatives. There is no State rescue bank there now. The Minister is stating that it is not needed.  I am questioning that.  I do not quite accept the Minister's argument, I am afraid, because it is his job and the job of the scriptwriters to justify the policy change he made in February 1989 and in a well-written script it is easy to gild the lily.  We have all done it.</P>
    <P>There is a very good debating point in what we are talking about here.  Some will agree with the Minister, others will not agree.  Others like myself, will have reservations, particularly reservations about the reasons he gives to justify it which do not stand up to scrutiny.  The action in itself may be the right thing in the end but to try to justify it on four points through all of which one can drive a horse and cart is not the way to go about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated, not this morning if I recall correctly &mdash; I think it was in his presentation of this Bill last May to the Dáil that there would be no adverse effects for the employees of Fóir Teoranta in this dissolution.  There was quite a good uptake I understand of the early retirement scheme and that for the rest it would be a matter of redeployment. Could the Minister assure this House that since May, in fact, those who have not opted for early retirement have been successfully redeployed within the public service and that all that matter has been resolved in relation to it?</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta is to be dissolved and its assets and liabilities transferred to the ICC and the portfolios will be wound down over, hopefully, the next five to <Col N="2068" /> seven years.  Any outstanding legal actions will be taken over by the ICC from Fóir Teoranta and the technical details are quite clearly spelt out in the Bill.  What is the future of ICC?  The Minister did indicate last May in the Dáil that he was going to employ a consultant to advise him on the future options of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  Has he employed that consultant?  Has he or she reported yet?  Could he briefly synopsise the thrust of that report for the House this morning?  Perhaps it is the private sector that will have to deal with the winding down of Fóir Teoranta or perhaps it is not.  I have no ideological hangups on this.  I ask the question out of interest because if we are handing over an extra portfolio of investments to ICC, let us be told frankly this morning what is the future for ICC and what are the details.  I would be very interested in knowing generally.</P>
    <P>There are two interesting references this morning in the Minister's speech and I think there is further reference to it. The first is, again, one of these aspirations we all have them from time to time.  It is hard to disagree with the general thrust. In the present context they bear looking at.  The Minister said that the best action which the Government can take in relation to the survival of firms is to contribute as much as possible to lowering input costs of industry.  Yes no one will disagree.  That is another mother's milk aspiration.  There is no difficulty about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say &ldquo;rather than giving them hand-outs when it is probably too late to save them anyway&rdquo;. Do I detect from that statement that the Minister is now questioning the whole rationale behind what Fóir Teoranta have been up to for the last 18 years, that they were shovelling out money to no-hopers to shut them up in case they would become a political embarrassment in a certain constituency?  Alternatively, one could interpret from that statement that the Minister had not a lot of confidence in the judgment of the board of directors of Fóir Teoranta and in their ability to decide those who deserved what he terms <Col N="2069" />&ldquo;hand-outs&rdquo; and those who did not.  I understand that the terms of reference referred to companies that were likely to be viable.  It is a technical job to assess, given the state at a certain period of time of any company, the likelihood of its being viable.  To talk about Fóir Teoranta giving hand-outs when it was probably too late to save them is questioning the <i>modus operandi</i> and the whole competence of the board to assess the cases that came before them and those that did not.</P>
    <P>In the same vein, the Minister said: &ldquo;It has to be made clear that the days of feather-bedding Irish industry are over&rdquo;.  Is it the Minister's opinion that that is what Fóir Teoranta has been doing for 18 years &mdash; feather-bedding Irish industry?  I doubt if the boards over the years would agree with the Minister on that.  I doubt if the Minister's late and I am sure, esteemed colleague &mdash; we all held him in much esteem, we might have disagreed with him on political idealogies &mdash; the late George Colley, who was responsible for the terms of reference of Fóir Teoranta would agree with those two sentiments the Minister expressed here this morning. I am plagiarising directly from the contributions in the Dáil in May in putting on the Seanad record the terms of reference and procedures of Fóir Teoranta.  It is in fact from the speech of Deputy John Bruton that I am quoting these specific words, as reported in the Official Report of 31 May, columns 1073-74.  He said, &ldquo;Fóir Teoranta are not and never were an easy touch for a loan&rdquo;.  The Minister used the words, &ldquo;feather-bedding Irish Industry&rdquo; and &ldquo;State hand-outs when it was probably too late to save them anyway&rdquo;.  Deputy John Bruton said that Fóir Teoranta were not and never were an easy touch for a loan and he was a former Minister for Finance and Minister for Industry and Commerce, if my memory serves me correctly.  He made the following comment that under Fóir Teoranta's terms of reference, established by the late Deputy George Colley:</P>
    <P>... in order to qualify for aid from <Col N="2070" /> Fóir Teoranta a company must: (1) be engaged in industrial activity; (2) have significant employment involved which is either nationally or locally significant; (3) there must be a sufficient contribution of money from the owner of the company going in at the time of the rescue; (4) there must be reasonable prospects of profitability on a permanent basis;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Minister's view is that he is giving hand-outs, when it was probably too late to save them anyway&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(5)  its continuance is in doubt because of inability to obtain its financial requirements from commercial sources and, finally, failure to receive assistance would have serious repercussions either nationally or locally.</P>
    <P>Those are the five points Deputy John Bruton put on the Dáil record as being the terms of reference established by the late Deputy George Colley when he set up Fóir Teoranta 18 years ago.  Deputy Bruton went on to say:</P>
    <P>All of those criteria must be complied with if a company is to get aid from Fóir Toeranta.  There is no question of Fóir Teoranta ever being used simply to bale out the banks because, under the law, if a company can get assistance from the banks, they cannot get it from Fóir Teoranta.  It is only companies that cannot get assistance from the banks that are qualified to receive assistance from Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>To complete the record, the late George Colley's terms of reference setting up Fóir Teoranta need to be spelled out here today, particularly with regard to the two questionable references to the operations of Fóir Teoranta by the Minister in his contribution.  The Minister feels that lowering input costs for industry is the best contribution he or the Government can make.  Yes, we do not disagree with that. But I object to the Minister's further reference in his statement when he says &ldquo;... rather than giving them hand-outs when it is probably too late to save them anyway&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2071" /> I object to the statement by the Minister when he said: &ldquo;It has to be made clear that the days of feather-bedding Irish industry are over&rdquo;.  I do not accept that Fóir Teoranta ever feather-bedded Irish industry.  Of course, they made decisions that ultimately did not stand up and the companies did not prove to be viable; but they also saved 40,000 jobs in the last eight years.  If the commercial banks and the other financial provisions that the Minister states are now there &mdash; and hence Fóir Teoranta is no longer relevant &mdash; if they can come back in eight years' time and state that they saved 80,000 jobs in the manufacturing industry sector, I would be prepared to come in here again and debate it with whatever Minister happened to be in place on the day.</P>
    <P>A point on BES which I did not refer to is this.  The Minister opened it up to the tourist industry generally last spring and I welcome that move.  It was a well-judged and very welcome move, Given our potential in the leisure activity area. BES was opened up to the leisure industry and, as we are talking about investment in fixed assets, many small investors hoping to avail of the tax breaks involved in investing in BES schemes have now opted for the tourism and leisure industry rather than the higher risk manufacturing industry sector.  Therefore, as a consequence of what was a good move, there will be less money available now to manufacturing industry, which of its nature is higher risk investment, from the small investors through BES.  That is a further reason why the Minister's four points of justification for the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta at this point are weakened.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government have prepared the ground sufficiently for our taking a full and equal position in the European Community and post-1992.  It will be a highly competitive free trade environment and our manufacturing industry will be exposed as never before.  I hope we know the realities of what we are entering.  There are marvellous advantages, provided we are properly prepared. I hope the realities are being faced <Col N="2072" /> up to and that the relevant sections and sectors of industry and commerce are being prepared properly.  There will be winners and losers post-1992.  No matter how well the job preparation is done &mdash; and I do not think it has been done sufficiently well &mdash; there will still be winners and losers.  I remain to be convinced that the advent of BES, particularly with the extension of BES to the tourism industry, the venture capital schemes, the advent of the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1990 and even with the present macro-economic indicators, all add up to justify the abolition of our only State rescue bank for a most important sector, the manufacturing industry sector.</P>

      <P>I will try and not be too political, but with Senator Doyle across the way it is particularly difficult.  She speaks about Fianna Fáil coming into Government in 1987 and taking on Fine Gaels' clothes. It is right to acknowledge the role that Deputy Alan Dukes adopted in the Tallaght strategy.  However, one would want to temper that somewhat by asking the question: what other role did he have to adopt at the time, given that he was a new leader and that he did not want another general election?  While we acknowledge what he did with the Tallaght strategy, did Senator Doyle's party in the long term acknowledge what he did because for some reason we have a new Fine Gael Leader?  Many people have suggested to me that the Tallaght strategy was the beginning of the end for that leader.  In terms of acknowledgment he got more from this side than from his own party.</P>

      <P>But not to his long term survival.</P>
      <P>Up to the time of the Government's decision to put an end to the existence of Fóir Teoranta one of the things that was agreed by everybody was the multiplicity of agencies.  In every county there were county development teams, the IDA, Shannon Free Airport, Fóir Teoranta, venture capital groups and NADCORP. Anybody dealing with these groups had difficulties in trying to get through the mesh and any rationalisation would be welcomed by people in political circles generally.  We have seen the amalgamation of SFADCo and the IDA.  One has to look at what the position of Fóir Teoranta was and why the Government of the day took that decision in 1989.  It is important to acknowledge the crucial role that Fóir Teoranta played in regard to manufacturing industry during the transition to full open trading.  They performed extremely well during that period but the question has to be asked: are the same circumstances present now as were present then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the difficulties for politicians dealing with a multiplicity of agencies.  I should also acknowledge the level of representations from Members of the Oireachtas to Fóir Teoranta when it came to difficulties with firms in their constituencies.  The pressure being applied to Governments, Ministers for Finance and Ministers for Industry and Commerce is again reflected in Fóir Teoranta itself.  I quote from an article by a financial correspondent: &ldquo;Fóir Teoranta had an unhappy knack of backing losers.&rdquo; While Senator Doyle is adamant about the excellent role that Fóir Teoranta played over the 18 years, I think we must also take cognisance of the fact that at this present time the Exchequer is writing off £75 million.  That in itself begs the question: were all the decisions made on good, sound commercial analyses?  In my view it must indicate that a restructuring was urgently called for.  Is it any wonder that in 1989, when the Government in <Col N="2074" /> their budget had as an underlying objective the promoting of good, sound economic activity and sustainable employment, that Fóir Teoranta should come under the microscope?</P>

I hope that I will set out the parameters under which Fóir Teoranta often worked, given the level of representation that was coming from Members of the Oireachtas in a constituency, to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Obviously, that representation landed at the door of Fóir Teoranta.</P>

      <P>If we are now writing off £75 million, surely it is a logical question to ask: did commercial analysis play its due role right down through the 18 years?  It is also important that we look at the performance of the economy since 1989.  If we do that it will bring us to the view that the existence of Fóir Teoranta may not be as critical from here on in, because the provisional figures for the end of 1989 show that the employment in the manufacturing sector rose by 4,900 over the previous year.  In the year up to May 1990, unemployment figures were down by 13,300.  Everybody will accept that this must be seen as the result of the Government's sound and responsible economic and financial management.</P>

      <P>My apologies, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. If one looks at the activities of Fóir Teoranta one will see that it has tapered off from a peak of about £23 million disbursements in 1983 to something like £7 million in 1988.  If you look at the number of applications received, the number of cases that were approved and the average size of case approved, that had also substantially reduced in the interim period.  The facts are there to show that.  Fóir Teoranta's requirement for Exchequer funding also declined in those years and the last occasion when the company actually needed to call on the Exchequer was in 1987.  Since then, the Minister has pointed out, it has financed its own operations from ongoing income by way of investment, interest and capital repayments, including a considerable element of premiums and share realisations.  During that winding down period Fóir Teoranta repaid to the Exchequer something like £8.2 million of Exchequer advances and that was <Col N="2076" /> reflected by £4 million in 1989 and £4.2 million in 1990.  So, in many ways the going out of existence of Fóir Teoranta will not have that dramatic effect on the viability of industry in this country.</P>
      <P>We should also look at what the Minister called the &ldquo;environment costs&rdquo;. Inflation was at 3 per cent when the Government decided to wind up Fóir Teoranta; it was 4 per cent on average in 1989 and in 1990 we are now back to 3 per cent.  That is well below the European average, which is expected to be in the region of 6.25 per cent.  We also had a welcome easing of interest rates and again we are considerably below the UK interest rates.  The higher wage costs in the UK have also significantly improved our competitiveness relative to that country.</P>
      <P>We should also take into account something that was mentioned by Deputies when this was being discussed in the Dáil. That was the examiner provision; and, with the amendment to the Companies Bill referred to by Senator Doyle, this has in fact got us over any temporary discomfort that any operation might have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view is that Fóir Teoranta did have an unhappy knack of picking losers.  In many respects Members of the Oireachtas have to take a fair share of the blame for the undue pressure that was exerted.  While one can claim that many jobs were saved over the years through Fóir Teoranta, I would like to mention an occasion quite recently in Cork when we had the closing down of the Sunbeam Wolsey factory.  I can remember well the furore on that occasion.  I can recall quite vividly the expressions emanating from Deputy Bernard Allen at the time &mdash; his call that Fóir Teoranta would be brought back into existence and that money would be made available to management in the Sunbeam factory to keep it open.  With hindsight what has happened there would again indicate that in fact Deputy Allen was very foolhardy on that occasion, because what has happened is that another company has come in and has taken over.  It is providing 150 jobs and, <Col N="2077" /> please God, the growth over the next couple of years will indicate that the employment levels could be back to 450, not far removed from what it was previously. That in itself is a clear indication of the type of thing I have been talking about &mdash; Deputies in constituencies making the case, putting the pressure on, to try to get Fóir Teoranta to give handouts, when in fact the jobs are not sustainable.  They were not in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>One must take into account that finance for industry is now available on a much wider scale than heretofore and that this in itself has been seen as one of the reasons why there is a demand for further investors.  Individual investors have the advantage of State-backed schemes, tax schemes such as the business expansion scheme.  The Minister also mentioned that there was a decrease in funding for the manufacturing sector since it was related to tourism export. That would not be accurate, because in the tax year 1989-90 manufacturing accounted for over £20 million, or 30 per cent, of the BES investment notified to the Revenue Commissioners.  These figures speak for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that we should acknowledge the precarious position in which the management of Fóir Teoranta found itself during the recession years because of the large increase in the number of applications coming before it because fire brigade action was needed and fire brigade action was provided, very often with disastrous results.  Demands at the time <Col N="2079" /> for decision-making in regard to what would lead to sustainable employment were questionable.  There is genuine concern that the adverse consequences arise from the administration of Fóir Teoranta and this is understandable if one recognises that the IDA itself &mdash; we are talking about what remains &mdash; has the power to provide finance for the restructuring of companies and that this is particularly significant for the food sector which is export related.  We also have to realise that we have venture capital funds to provide equity; there is the role played by NADCORP and the role and investment section of the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>We should take into account at the end of the day what the Confederation of Irish Industry states.  It is an important statement.  It states that Ireland would prefer to have a competitive cost involvement than seek to compensate for deficiencies in the environment through cash grants from the State.  The best action the Government can take in relation to the survival of firms is to contribute as much as possible to lower the input costs rather than givng them hand-outs when it is probably too late in many instances to save those firms.  Indeed, the Minister is quite right to end the featherbedding of Irish industries, because they must be in a position to compete in 1992.</P>
    <P>A question was raised by Senator Doyle about the establishment of Fóir Teoranta.  I understand that, out of 31 staff, there were 17 voluntary redundancies, that nine were redeployed.  At the moment there are two permanent staff left and that obviously all of these are being looked after.  With that, I will leave you to calmer waters and say that I support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that should be said about this Bill is that in many ways it is the cart before the horse.  The Minister announced the decision in February 1989 and it is now that we get the legislation, over a year later, which seems to be a curious way of doing business.  I would like to pay tribute to the work <Col N="2080" /> which Fóir Teoranta did over the years. In many ways it was very valuable and worth while.  A number of speakers have alluded to the fact that Fóir Teoranta lost a lot of money; the figure of £85 million in losses is being bandied about.  We need to keep in mind when we are talking about Fóir Teoranta that its job was primarily one of damage limitation.</P>
      <P>When Fóir Teoranta moved into a company, the company was already in difficulties; and that is, of course, one of the reasons why Fóir Teoranta had such high levels of losses and failures.  That is a very important factor which has not been adequately considered by many people alluding to the inability of Fóir Teoranta to pick winners.  Fóir Teoranta only met losers; they were in trouble when they got to them and that is one of the reasons the losses were as great as they were.</P>
      <P>The other thing that has not been taken into account is the question of the real net loss after many of these rescue attempts by Fóir Teoranta.  Fóir Teoranta were instrumental in saving many jobs in a number of industries situated all over the country.  There was a consequent saving in social welfare payments because of the fact that people remained in employment.  Indeed, because of the fact that they continued in employment they were able to continue to pay their own contributions to the social welfare system.  Of course, there was the reduction in emigration numbers arising from the successes which Fóir Teoranta had over the years.  Those aspects have been too easily brushed aside in this debate.  I also believe that many of the infrastructural limitations or difficulties of Irish industry are not considered when people talk about the failures which Fóir Teoranta had to encounter.  These difficulties include very high overheads, costs of energy and fuel and so on are, by international standards, quite high. The telecommunications system up to recently was quite problematic and remains expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all happy about what alternatives might fill the functions which used <Col N="2081" /> to be filled by Fóir Teoranta.  The Minister, in a curious type of way, seems to have tried to assure us that we are all going to live happily ever after Fóir Teoranta, that everything will be hunky dory as we drive off into some place of great industrial development and, indeed, great industrial happiness.</P>
    <P>There were allusions made to the value of the provisions of part of the Companies Bill which went through the House last August.  As I understand the provisions of that Bill, they are not going to be very relevant to anything other than to very large industries.  For small industries the service which that Bill will provide or the facilities which it makes available are going to be very expensive and difficult to utilise.  For small firms I do not believe that that is a practical proposition.</P>
    <P>Another thing which is being forgotten about is that for the most part Fóir Teoranta rescued small to medium-sized industries and most of those industries were Irish-based.  It was Irish entrepreneurs who had developed those industries and, unfortunately, had got into trouble.  Again, that is something which has not received the attention that it might have.  The multinationals to a large extent were outside the scope of Fóir Teoranta.  The basic strategies and decisions made by those companies would not have been influenced to any great extent by any of the facilities which Fóir Teoranta would be able to provide.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the staff of Fóir Teoranta would be adequately catered for.  I am happy to hear from Senator O'Keeffe that, to a fair extent, that seems to have been the case or at least that things appear to have resolved themselves now.  I would be concerned however that the people who worked in Fóir Teoranta would be adequately looked after and redeployed in circumstances which would be acceptable to them.  I hope that that is the case and I certainly have no difficulty in accepting Senator O'Keeffe's assurances on those matters.</P>
    <P>I want to allude to some aspects of the Minister's speech &mdash; he certainly seemed to be off form this morning.  First of all, <Col N="2082" /> there was his lashing out at the featherbedding of Irish industry despite the fact that he has been Minister for Industry and Commerce and has been an important player on the economic stage for many years.  It is as if he is now, in a funny type of way, almost starting to attack himself because of what he has done in the past. He then went on to tell us that business confidence was never greater.  I find this a puzzling type of statement.  The Minister is a very experienced politician.  If one reads the newspapers and believes the rumours he is on his way to becoming even more experienced and even more important but we will have to wait to see how those things happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Business confidence, he tells us, was never greater.  I thought that one of the first lessons that people in politics were told was never to use the word &ldquo;never&rdquo;.  I suppose that could be modified to say never use &ldquo;never&rdquo; when it refers to the future; but, as for the past, it might not create that great a problem. &ldquo;Business confidence was never greater.&rdquo;  I am hearing and reading in newspapers about industrialists being worried about the effects of 1992.  I am reading about the disturbance in the farming community about the effects of the GATT negotiations, hardly enhancing their confidence and hardly encouraging them to make investments.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Keeffe quoted some interesting figures about employment.  He reminds me of the Professor of Philosophy in UCD who spoke about an abstraction from the totality of reality. Certainly, Senator O'Keeffe's figures were an abstraction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a big need for them and I am glad the Minister raised this item.  I can assure the Minister that I had a wonderful response to that suggestion. <Col N="2083" /> I am sure the Minister is well aware of the situation in Dublin but I can tell him the number of pubs is not really that much greater than the number of pubs in the town of Kilrush, a town with which he is quite familiar as I have been myself over the years.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Business confidence was never greater&rdquo;.  I find that puzzling.  We have had GATT, 1992, the unemployment figures which are the ones that I would be drawing attention to; the emigration figures.  Senator O'Keeffe dealt with some aspect of employment.  I am sure that the data is right but it is much less than the whole story.  In today's <i>Irish Independent</i> I read on the front page that there is a threat to 900 jobs in Aer Lingus. What will come of that threat, I do not know; but it is hardly the type of headline that one associates with business confidence never having been greater.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by reiterating my concern about the necessity to provide some special care for small to medium sized Irish industries which get into trouble. I am not happy that that is adequately catered for and I would be interested in hearing the Minister spell out in a little more detail what he has in mind or what proposals, if any, he has in relation to the help for industries which are small and which find themselves in trouble.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill.  It is really a tidying up exercise for a body which has tried to perform an almost impossible task at times, tried to perform it to the best of its ability and on a few occasions has been successful.  It is a body which was set up in the climate of the time.  It was set up with very good intentions and now really has been overtaken by events and the changes in both the local economy and world economy.  We now realise that bodies such as Fóir Teoranta and efforts such as that, however well meaning, however temporarily prolonging a situation, basically and uneconomic.  they raise false hopes which are then cruelly dashed for the employees and indeed all <Col N="2084" /> people associated with the companies concerned.</P>
      <P>This raises some general points in relation to the funding of industry and Government/industry relationships.  One has to take it as a fundamental point of business that you must have some risk/reward ratio.  It is up to business, it is up to industries, it is up to the shareholders, it is up to those people who are involved in industry to assess to the best of their professional ability, of their competence, what are the risks and likely rewards.  There should be a reward, not an immoderate or gross reward but certainly there must be rewards both for the business people concerned and their employees and everyone else associated if they are successful.</P>
      <P>Equally well, it is not a situation in which there can be no risk.  When you are setting up a company there is no such thing as no risk.  When a company is ongoing there is no such thing as no risk. Any attempts to fudge that situation merely mean that eventually any artificial crutch just crumbles away and one is left with a situation far worse than that from which one started out.  I am not sure if all businessmen fully realise this.  They may perhaps wish to have the risk element removed and simply have the reward. There is a tendency on all sides to imagine that, if we can rush to bring up an industry or a company or whatever institution it may be which is running into trouble, pump money into it, keep it going, it will provided jobs and so on.  This is very understandable, very well meaning, but likely in the end to have quite the opposite effect.  They will probably end up losing jobs anyway and in the meantime something much more viable will have been prevented from becoming established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It raises a very general point.  Many industries have been undercapitalised. There must be a working partnership between Government, industry, the unions, the various parties concerned. This extends far further out than just simply the immediate industry, business and Government people.  It involves such things as education.  One of the reasons <Col N="2085" /> why the Japanese and some other economies have been so successful, particularly the Japanese, has been this interrelationship between Government and industry and also a tremendous emphasis on a very high standard of education.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons why as well.  I talked about rewards, short term rewards.  There is something very inappropriate about them.  It is one of the major deficiencies in present western style economies, particularly here and in the European Community and in North America, this desire and drive to produce, for example, three month figures or six month profit figures.  One had an almost imbecile situation at one time in which various financial institutions were posting up the fact that they had done half per cent better than some other financial institution.  You cannot run a proper company, a proper industry, on 12 week figures.  One of the great advantages that the Japanese have is that government, trade unions, shareholders all recognise that it is the long term strategy that matters.  That is where the real growth is, growth and profits for the company, development of technology which can beat its competitors and full employment at a profitable rate for the employees.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, which is bringing us up to date.  I am delighted to see it.  I am very happy to support it and congratulate the Minister on speaking on it here in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators who have contributed to the debate and I concur with them in paying compliments to the work of Fóir Teoranta during its 18 years of existence and agree that it contributed well to manufacturing industry during the transition to full, open trading conditions in this country.  That transition has now been completed and the company has outlived its original purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer again to the overall economic environment, the essential background against which the Government decision to wind up Fóir Teoranta was <Col N="2086" /> taken in February, 1989.  The 1989 budget had as its underlying objective the promotion of sound economic activity and sustainable employment throughout the economy.  The plain fact is that manufacturing employment has begun to recover, following a long period of decline.  Provisional figures up to June 1990 show that the total employment in manufacturing industry rose by about 7,000 from a year earlier.  It is also reflected in the falling level of unemployment. In the year to the end of October the Live Register fell by 1,800. This is a welcome result of the Government's sound and responsible economic and financial management.</P>
    <P>The external economic environment is uncertain but I am confident that Irish manufacturing firms are in a strong position to take advantage of the opportunities that will arise in Western Europe in the post-1992 situation and possibly also in Eastern Europe, now that the barriers of trade are breaking down in that region.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle asserted that the reasons given in April 1989 for winding up Fóir Teoranta were no longer valid and therefore that this Bill should not be proceeded with.  I cannot accept that.  In April 1989 the Minister stated that the decision that Fóir Teoranta should be wound up was founded on four main points.  They are as follows: (1) The low level of demand for Fóir Teoranta's services. The fact is that in the years leading up to 1989 the amount of funds disbursed, the number of applications received, the cases approved and the average size of approved cases all fell sharply.  (2) The very much changed industrial environment now as compared with 1972 when Fóir Teoranta was set up.  (3) The beneficial effect of the Examiner provisions of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  The House is aware of course that these provisions are now incorporated in the Companies Act, 1990.  (4) The need to prepare Irish industry for the more competitive regime which will apply when the internal market is in place after 1992.</P>
    <P>As was said in the opening remarks by <Col N="2087" /> the Minister, we are now in an environment much more conducive to getting industry back on its feet.  As regards the cost environment, this is largely determined by the general rate of inflation and the cost of funds, that is, the interest rate. As to inflation, the rate was 3.3. per cent when the Government took their decision to wind up Fóir Teoranta.  It was 4 per cent on average for 1989 as a whole.  The figure for 1990 will be about 3 per cent &mdash; in other words, below the level which prevailed in February 1989.  The likelihood is that the Irish inflation rate in 1990 will yet again be below the average for the European Community where the average inflation this year is expected to be 5 per cent.  The recent easing in interest rates is also a welcome development and our rates are still considerably below UK rates.  The considerably higher inflation, higher interest rates and wage rate increases in the UK will aid the competitiveness of Irish firms relative to their UK competitors on both the domestic and overseas markets.</P>
    <P>The best action the Government can take in relation to the survival of firms is to contribute as much as possible to lowering the input costs of industry rather than giving them handouts when it is probably in many cases too late anyway.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to a change in recent weeks in exchange rates <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Deutsche Mark.  The very minor change that took place over the past few weeks has been the strengthening of the Deutsche Mark against all currencies. The change in our case was very small and has very little, if any, significance one way or the other at this stage.</P>
    <P>The general economic position and the question of the impact of the closure of Fóir Teoranta on employment was dealt with by the Minister in his opening statement and I am not going to deal with it here now.  Extra employment will only be generated on a sustainable basis when the general economic environment is correct. There is little point in trying to save jobs by direct State intervention in firms <Col N="2088" /> which are perhaps grossly undercapitalised, badly managed or perhaps both.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy made the point very effectively that such firms should have to sort themselves out.  There is no easy way to deal with this otherwise than that people will do it for themselves.  It would be far better to see a firm taken over on a newly recapitalised basis, with perhaps new dynamic management, than to prop up old firms with taxpayers' money which may well not yield any positive results for the company itself.</P>
    <P>The overall level and quality of employment in the economy is what we are really concerned with at the end of the day and the Government will do everything in their powers to ensure that the increased industrial production necessary to sustain increased long term viable employment is achieved.  I am encouraged and the Minister is encouraged in this regard by the fact that the number of proposed redundancies notified under the Redundancies Payments Scheme has decreased from about 24,200 in 1987 to about 11,500 in 1989.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton raised the question of other sources of finance in the absence of Fóir Teoranta.  Only manufacturing companies are affected by the decision to wind up Fóir Teoranta.  The examiner provisions of the Companies Act, 1990, on the other hand, apply to companies generally.  Such companies who experiencing financial difficulty may approach other financial institutions, such as the Industrial Credit Corporation, or seek equity finance with a view to having their financial requirements met.</P>

      <P>To get back to the points that were made in the debate, the business expansion scheme &mdash; Senator Upton was concerned about this &mdash; may be of assistance to firms in this situation. NADCORP or the private venture capital companies, may also be in a position to provide equity finance to suitable firms.  The Industrial Development Authority has power to provide, in the interests of promoting the restructuring of Irish industry, financial assistance where an industrial concern is being merged with or indeed acquired by another industrial concern.  There is also of course a range of State services which includes the provision of financial advice for industrial firms generally.  In fact, in my own region I have seen precisely how this can work very effectively with companies like Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  We had a review and rationalisation of the agencies there which has worked out very successfully. We had a number of agencies with various responsibilities often overlapping, duplicating effort and creating problems and difficulties not only for industrialists but indeed for politicians as well.  We had a rationalisation there which has proved very beneficial and where with the work of the Shannon Development Company it is possible to rationalise the services of State agencies and to get a very good return for the kind of investment made.</P>
      <P>NADCORP is not, as was suggested by Senator Doyle, a replacement for Fóir Teoranta.  It was never seen as that.  It is there as a source of venture capital for Irish firms and had been operating very successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle also referred to the number of jobs saved as a result of Fóir Teoranta's operations.  There is no doubt that jobs were saved but they were saved at a very high cost to the taxpayer and, of course, not all the jobs were saved permanently.  As has been said before, the days of giving hand-outs to industry <Col N="2090" /> are over.  But, even in many cases where Fóir Teoranta assisted by giving financial handouts to companies to save jobs, some of these jobs &mdash; I have experience of this &mdash; were lost afterwards.  In many respects it was more to do with management rather than just providing capital.  I have seen very few companies close purely for lack of financial resources but I have seen many companies close because of bad management, poor capitalisation and many other reasons.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe and Senator Upton referred to the staff of Fóir Teoranta. Every step was taken to ensure that the staff were dealt with fairly.  The Department initiated discussions with both management and staff representatives immediately after the wind up decision was announced.  The terms of the public sector voluntary redundancy/early retirement scheme programme were offered to the staff and at the same time, staff wishing to be considered for redeployment to other areas of the public sector were facilitated in so doing.  Of the 31 staff at Fóir Teoranta at the time of the wind-up announcement, 20 have taken the voluntary redundancy/early retirement package, nine have been redeployed to other areas of the public services, two heads of staff are still employees of Fóir Teoranta and it is expected these two staff members will be dealt with satisfactorily in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle also raised the quesiton of what would happen to Fóir Teoranta's portfolio if the State shareholding in the Industrial Credit Corporation were to be sold to a private sector entity.  If the Minister's shareholding in the Industrial Credit Corporation were to be sold suitable arrangements would be made as part of the terms of the sale which would ensure that Fóir Teoranta's portfolio would continue to be administered by the ICC in new ownership on the same basis as is at present contemplated i.e. in accordance with the contractual arrangements entered into by client firms with Fóir Teoranta.  There would be no question of clients of Fóir Teoranta being thrown to the wolves or abandoned.</P>

She raised a question on the business expansion scheme.  As she will be aware, the scheme is under review by the Department at present and some announcement will be made by the Minister on that in due course.  The business expansion scheme funding for the manufacturing sector had become virtually non-existent since the inclusion of export tourism in this scheme.  I can assure the Senator that this is not so and in the tax year 1989-1990 manufacturing accounted for over £20 million or some 30 per cent of all the BES investment notified to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The statement was made that good money was thrown after bad money by Fóir Teoranta.  It is a point of view that people are entitled to hold but we can be wise after the event.  The severity and length of the recession of the early and mid-eighties caused a great shakeout of long-established indigenous firms, many of which were household names. The recession also led to a big increase in the number of applications coming before Fóir Teoranta and in the payments and disbursements it made.  The latter was affected by a small number of very large applications for assistance.</P>
      <P>I have dealt fairly fully with the points that have been raised.  I want to thank the Senators for contributing to what was a very constructive and worthwhile discussion.</P>

      <P>I did not call any more votes on Committee and preceding Stages as I took the count to be as it was at the end of Second Stage.  I would have liked to oppose Second Stage, the whole principle of the dissolution of the company, on the basis of the Minister's justification for what we were doing here this morning, which I do not accept.  I would like to point out that there is no alternative rescue finance available for small to medium sized manufacturing companies, the very companies that Fóir Teoranta helped.  The examiner provision of the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1990, with which the Minister justified a lot of his argument for dissolving Fóir Teoranta, is effectively out of the reach of small to medium sized manufacturing industry because of the huge legal costs involved in invoking the examiner provision.  As those were the two main justifications given by the Minister for what was before us in the House this morning, I cannot accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I last spoke on this issue I referred to the marvellous performance of the Taoiseach at the 34 member Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.  I welcome the innovations that were decided on at that conference and pay tribute to European political leaders in general who have shown the way and grasped the challenge facing Europe with broad, bold strokes combining idealism and realism, leading to what all of us hope will be a new era of peace and prosperity in Europe.</P>
      <P>There are conflicting reports and very little consensus on whether European monetary union and political union will bring real benefit to Ireland.  The NESC report earlier this year was dismissive of Commission inspired reports that Ireland and the poor regions generally would be better off as a result of a single currency.  It would, they said, lead to inwared investment particularly in those economies with low wage costs and mobile labour forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I favour the NESC conclusions, especially in the light of German unity.  Despite assertions to the contrary, the German economy will have to pay heavily for unity.  Last year the German budget deficit was a derisory 0.5 billion DM; this year it is estimated at 1.25 billion DM and next year the estimates are that it will be at an intolerably high 40 billion DM.  The implications for Ireland are self-evident.  Germany, as the EC's largest paymaster, will be in no mood to <Col N="2095" /> continue paying out to eliminate the regional disparities at the rate of previous years while it struggles at home to improve the lot of its new citizens from the former territories in East Germany.</P>
    <P>However, I am pleased to note that the Department of Finance and the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, have already put down a marker that acceptance by this country of the full responsibilities of European monetary and ultimately political union will have a price.  I believe that that price should include the question of our national debt.  It now stands at £25 billion and the obligation to eliminate this staggering amount in the long term and to service it in the short term is already putting an intolerable burden on our people and our economy.  Indeed, historians and economists, who do not often see eye to eye, would probably come to a broad agreement that the ongoing national debt has inhibited the orderly prosperous development of this economy. In that context, if we are to really move into a new Europe and a new European order where disparities between the regions will be eliminated, this is a very big halter around our neck.  Although it might seem radical and perhaps might not seem practical, perhaps it might concentrate the minds of our European partners on the real problems that we face in the onward rush to European monetary and political union.  I believe that discussion of the debt should be our price for being good Europeans, and the progressive elimination of the debt through a system of credits granted by the new proposed European Central Bank might be a way forward.  It would give this country, with its limited financial resources, an opportunity to set about real improvements in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>A commitment by our European partners to assist Ireland in this practical manner would release such an outpouring of national rejoicing that, for the first time ever, Ireland would be able to tap its unlimited resources of talent and compete on an equal footing with its European partners.  The question of our national debt and our status as a trading <Col N="2096" /> nation has come sharply into focus in recent weeks and days with the imminent collapse of the GATT talks, which will have the most serious implications for this country.</P>
    <P>I put on record that I am fully supportive of the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and the farming organisations generally to protect and maintain farming in this country.  I come from a rural area where there is heavy dependence by the population on traditional beef and the buying and selling of stock. The implications for my part of the country and for many of the disadvantaged areas in Ireland are too horrendous to consider if agreement is not reached on these talks.  They are germane to the discussions we are having today in that we are talking about European economic union and the elimination of trade barriers.</P>
    <P>There are obvious concerns about the threats to our already less effective sovereignty. These are key questions to be addressed by our Government in dealing with our European partners.  These decisions must be taken in the political arena.  Left to economists, industrialists and bankers, Ireland could find itself in a new Europe as economically poor as North Dakota in the United States, a state which is often referred to in the context of European political union. Within the federal states of the United States there is an example of a state which is far from the centre and has not benefited heavily, if at all, from the attractiveness and advantages of free trade in the American context.  I would hate to see Ireland becoming the North Dakota of western Europe.  All these arguments strengthen our case that decisions on future fundings should be part of the political decision making process before 1992 and not after.  The recent response by Dr. Karl Otto Pöhl of the Bundesbank should leave nobody in any doubt, when it comes to helping the periphery and to eliminating the regional disparities that are so obvious in our community, that left to bankers and industrialists there would be little hope for the future.  Dr. Pöhl was asked how he saw the European Central <Col N="2097" /> Bank dealing with regional and social policy objectives and his reply was: &ldquo;Why do you ask these questions of a banker?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Doubts have been expressed as to whether the new bank, when and if it will be set up, would be able to pursue policies designed to reduce disparities between the richer and poorer regions of the community. Other commentators have taken the view that it would inevitably mean deflationary policies, constraints on public spending and more unemployment. These comments were made on debates in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Concerns about our sovereignty have been with us since our accession to the European Community in 1972-73 and I do not wish in any way to diminish the sincerity with which many people in this country address the question of the erosion of our sovereignty in the European context.  I welcome the debate which was initiated by the Taoiseach and the Government in the context of more powers being granted to either the Commission or the European Parliament or indeed to European structures generally, post-1992.  I believe that the Government are correct in taking the stance that the national parliaments of member states should not in any way be superseded and that the question of granting extra powers either to the Commission or to the European Parliament should be treated with great caution.</P>
    <P>Power rests with the Council of Ministers. Within that Council Ireland has an equal vote.  Its power is greatly disproportionate to its geography and to its economic clout in Europe.  It gives us an important vote on issues which directly affect us and ultimately the power of veto when those interests and that of the Commission are in direct conflict. Consider the situation if more powers were given to the Parliament or to the Commission or, alternatively, if powers were taken away from the Council of Ministers and given to other European structures.  In the Parliament, Ireland has 15 members from the South and three from the North.  Admittedly their interests converge, particularly in the area of agriculture and perhaps in other areas of the economy.  Eighteen votes out of almost 600 is small potatoes.  The <Col N="2098" /> Commission, on the other hand, is a bureaucracy and Ireland would have a limited power role if the Commission's powers were extended and enlarged.  The idea which is being floated around by our Government for further discussion is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The proposal &mdash; although I am not sure if it has been put as a formal proposal as yet but certainly the idea is being discussed increasingly &mdash; that there should be a second tier in Europe, a European Senate, is an idea which should be discussed as it would give each national parliament and its representatives an opportunity to debate issues of Europe wide interest and, of course, of national interest without the fear that when a decision is taken it would act contrary to individual interests and particularly Irish interests.  I make no apologies for emphasising in all the debates and discussions on Europe and European political union that Ireland's interests must remain paramount. We have not benefited to the same extent from membership of the EC as was predicted in the early seventies. Agriculture went through a very successful period, a purple patch, but in recent years, let us be honest, Ireland has been up against it.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed about the military aspects of political union.  I have no wish to underestimate the strength of feeling on this issue either, but I believe it is time that we had a definition of just what is meant by Irish neutrality.  We are militarily neutral in that we are not part of, or wish to be part of, an alliance such as NATO or the Warsaw Pact.  Surely as a nation state of the European Community we have an obligation to defend ourselves and if called upon, to defend European community interests.</P>

That has nothing to <Col N="2099" /> do with support for or otherwise involving ourselves in military alliances.  A debate should be initiated in this country as to just what our future is in the context of European and Irish national defensive interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to confine myself to the European political union aspect.  The House has heard my views on neutrality a good number of times.  My starting point would be to see myself &mdash; indeed I have been so described &mdash; as an old-fashioned nationalist.  Many of my critics might dispute that definition, but I am to the extent that I cling to the illusion that we should look after our own affairs.  As Senator Mooney said, it is the Irish national interest that should prevail.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Senator Mooney and I seem to be out of line with the movement towards European union where the national interests is, by definition, supposed to be merged into a larger European interest.  Senator Mooney called for clarification of what we mean by neutrality. I agree fully with him.  Although we have debated it many times, it appears that people take what meaning they like out of neutrality.  Its critics call it opting out, fence-sitting, burying our heads in the sand and so on.  They point to what is obvious: that we would not have any hope of defending ourselves in any major attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the traditional canons of international law, reasonable ability to defend oneself &mdash; the prospect of giving a good account of yourself if you like, and therefore arming yourself and spending money seriously on defence measures &mdash; is one of the indispensable marks of the neutral nation.  All these definitions really go out the window in a nuclear age.  Neutrality is not about defending ourselves in that sense; besides who is going to attack us?  What it has come to mean, to make a quite long historical story short, is that from having an isolationist attitude in World War II &mdash; though in my opinion historically a very justifiable policy &mdash; we have moved to a view of neutrality, and what an inadequate word it is to describe a quite complex attitude, which means for me non-participation in a military <Col N="2100" /> alliance.  I could never see the sense, in a world where we need more and more disarmament not simply in the cause of peace but in the cause of social justice, of us somehow adding our little mite to the bristling arsenal of Europe.  It means non-application in military alliances but, more than that, it means an independent position in foreign policy as far as that can be maintained, given the reality of the international situation.</P>
    <P>When people worry about European union and abandoning our neutrality they are really worrying about giving up whatever semblance we have of taking our own decisions in international affairs and submerging ourselves in a common European opinion where obviously we are not going to count for very much.  That is what people fear.  I fear that.  I want to see a lot more of what European political union is going to mean before I would be happy to subscribe to a common European foreign policy.  I am apprehensive about what is going to happen.  There is evidence that our large European partners are very seriously contemplating moving towards a common European Government.  The Germans, and the Italians particularly have made no secret of the fact that they are quite ready to transfer substantial sovereignty to a common European Government.  Ireland, Denmark, Portugal possibly and Britain for its own reasons are in a minority now in the movement towards European union.</P>
    <P>What is interesting about it is that, despite what some of my friends on the left might say, this movement towards Europen union is not a right wing conspiracy or a capitalist conspiracy.  It has the strong support of socialist movements in many Community states.  Just as happened to English socialism in the 19th Century, the socialist view of the future is that nationalism is bad for the working class anyway and their true interests would be promoted the more you have this broad framework.  We are in a minority at the moment and the intergovernmental conference is looming.  We have just had the parliamentary assises which was attended by a delegation as you know from the joint committee on EC affairs.  At the meeting yesterday of the joint committee it became obvious <Col N="2101" /> that the delegation which went to Rome under Deputy Barry's chairmanship was not of one view about what was happening and what was going to happen. Quite clearly the Labour members and the Fianna Fáil members of the delegation would differ from the Fine Gael members.  In the context, the new leader of Fine Gael conferred his retrospective <i>Imprimatur</i> on the various pronouncements which had been made over the years by numerous Fine Gael speakers that we should get rid of our neutrality.  Fine Gael are committed Europeans in that sense.  Fianna Fáil, because of a residual nationalism and the idea that neutrality equals sovereignty, still cling on to sovereignty.  The Workers' party cling on to it because they see neutrality as an expression of anti-imperialism. These different attitudes reflect the historical development of neutrality in the country.</P>
    <P>Irish opinion was divided in Rome last week.  Irish opinion, even if it had been united in Rome last week, was totally powerless to stop the very significant resolutions that were passed by the Conference of the Parliaments of the European Community.  Among the resolutions that were passed was that the conference urged the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to note that the parliamentarians believe in political union.  They defined what it was: a political union comprising of foreign and security policy on matters of common interest must be established.  So the parliamentariens are now committed to a common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>What does security policy mean?  One of the things I hope to see coming out of the debates in the forthcoming months is a clear set of definitions.  What does European security mean?  What is the difference between security and defence? I do not know.  I hope that security means taking proper measures to protect law and order in the Community states, in the Community as a whole, and that to that end there must be a very effective police force.  I would have no objection to that.  It would be our obligation and our duty to make a contribution in that regard to the security of the European Community.  But defence is another <Col N="2102" /> matter altogether.  What is defence?  Is there going to be a common European army?  Will there be a general headquarters in Strasbourg or somewhere, or will it be the case that if an international crisis arises our Army will be called upon to contribute to a European force set up for that purpose?  I do not know.  Who is going to attack Europe?  Where is the enemy now from without, given the collapse of the eastern bloc?</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to address this particular conundrum: will it be the case that if a member state is attacked &mdash; for example, if Portugal is attacked by Libya or Greece is attacked by Turkey, which is still outside the Community &mdash; are we supposed to go to their aid?  In that case we would have the bizarre realisation of the old joke about the two fellows in a pub, one of them says: &ldquo;Would you die for Ireland?&rdquo;  and the reply is: &ldquo;I would die for Greece if the money was right&rdquo;.  We may well come to a stage where people will have to die for Greece and the money might not be right either.</P>
    <P>These may sound outlandish and facetious illustrations of what I mean, but I am absolutely adamant that no one has yet told me or the Irish people what security means in a European context or what defence means.  Is there a difference between them?  What commitments will we have to make?  We are making statements here but we lack any real consensus. We will go into the intergovernmental conference with, as far as I can see, the Irish Government taking a different line, having reservations about safeguarding neutrality, to that of the main opposition party.</P>
    <P>In an ideal world I would prefer us to keep absolute control over our own affairs.  I recognise the reality of an increasing move towards European union and, I suppose, in the end a federal united states of Europe.  Perhaps that is a long way down the road.  We would be ill-advised to take the dismissive attitude towards neutrality which is now current, particularly in Fine Gael circles.  There is a scornful moralistic attitude about our neutrality in the past and its alleged uselessness in the present.  It has its faults.  It has its inconsistencies and its hypocrisies; <Col N="2103" /> but it is own.  If I may quote Touchstone in <i>As You Like It</i> and his description of Audrey his helpmate.  He said about her: &ldquo;A poor thing, sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own&rdquo;.  It is our own and we should be very slow to abandon it.</P>
    <P>I would remind Fine Gael that in this House only last March Senator Manning dismissed as paranoia on my part the allegation that Fine Gael were going to turn their back on neutrality.  We have all seen what has happened since, but in the meantime I end by reminding Senator Manning and the House of the very forceful way in which he described our policy on neutrality and why we should carry it into the new Europe.  He said: &ldquo;It is a distinctive aspect of our European presence&rdquo;. If it is to be a Europe of diversity why can there not be room in it for the particular world view we have and the particular way we relate to the rest of the world outside Europe?  I am apprehensive but I hope my contribution has been a positive one nonetheless.</P>

      <P>: Senator Norris has given me notice that he wishes to make a personal explanation to the House. Before I call on the Senator I want to make it clear that I will not allow a debate on this matter.  Once the personal explanation has been given the matter is closed.  It is also worth noting that the personal explanation should be brief, should be non-argumentative and strictly personal and should not be such as would give rise to any further debate or cause for further debate.  I call on Senator Norris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I was the subject of strong criticism from the Leader of the House, Senator Seán Fallon, for remarks I was alleged to have made on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; on 23 November. Let me say, first of all, that I am grateful to Senator Avril Doyle for providing Senator Fallon with the opportunity to <Col N="2104" /> make these criticisms on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>There were three comments in particular to which Senator Fallon took exception.  The first was: &ldquo;It seemed almost as if there was an attempt to vote this matter through without any sustained discussion at all, that it was to go through on the nod&rdquo;.  The second was: &ldquo;It was introduced by leave of the Government and the Government intended to let it go through on the nod&rdquo;.  The third was: &ldquo;It was felt by a few of us in the Seanad that we would be lax in our responsibility if we just connived at this Bill going through on the nod&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator Fallon stated that I should apologise to the House but that he did not believe that I would and that he could refer this matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but quite honestly could not be bothered.  I requested an opportunity to explain my remarks and you, a Chathaoirligh, ruled this out of order but said that I would have another opportunity.  Having discussed this matter with Members on the Government side, I have decided that the proper way to address the situation is to make a personal statement in explanation. I am grateful for the opportunity you have afforded me to do so.</P>
      <P>I approached Senator Fallon and asked him for a copy of the transcript of the programme which he had in his possession. Although at first reluctant to oblige me in this matter, he eventually consented.  I have read the transcript and am now in a position to state that I believe it is a fully accurate transcript of what I recall saying.  Yesterday, Senator Fallon informed the House that his own integrity and that of many of the Members of the House had been put into question by my words in this interview.  That was most certainly not my intention and I would sincerely regret it if I felt I had brought into question the integrity and dignity of either Senator Fallon or the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to Senator Fallon for placing the introduction of the Alta-mount Bill in its proper and highly unusual context.  He indicated yesterday that there is, for example, a separate set of Standing Orders for the Dáil and Seanad relative to Private Business which <Col N="2105" /> provides for the promotion and conduct of a Private Bill through the Houses and that these Standing Orders are completely separate from the Standing Orders under which public business of the Seanad is usually conducted.</P>
    <P>I may say that on election to Seanad Éireann I was provided with a copy of the Standing Orders of the House but not with a copy of these completely separate and different Standing Orders, nor was I made aware of their existence.  I think few people also were aware of the existence and activities of a parliamentary agent by virtue of whose application a Private Bill is promoted for the particular benefit of any person or locality.  I doubt if many people were aware that the Leas-Chathaoirleach, by virtue of his or her office, has a statutory responsibility formally to move such a Bill or, indeed, aware of the existence of an official with the Dickensian title of &ldquo;The Examiner of Private Bills&rdquo;.  It is even stranger that, according to Senator Fallon, the Leas-Chathaoirleach is not in charge of the Bill in the same accepted sense that a Minister is in respect of a Public Bill.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I think it was a pity that the Bill was not circulated in advance to all Members of the House, although I understand that a note was sent round indicating that the proposed legislation could be inspected by appointment and that there was no provision of the usual explanatory memoranda.  This strange concatenation of circumstances is certainly not my fault, nor, may I suggest respectfully, Sir, is it conducive to a full and informed debate, with which responsibility this House is most seriously charged.  Yesterday Senator Fallon assured the House that he indicated to the Senators before they came in that if any one Senator on any side of the House queried or wanted information he would feel it his duty to stall and to ask for explanatory memoranda.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Senator but he has been addressing the House for the last five minutes and I want to point out to him that what he is required to do by way of personal explanation is to deal with the substance of his radio interview and in <Col N="2106" /> that context alone.  The Senator is engaged in quite a different area, quite a separate matter, and it is important that he be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, you did offer me the opportunity to explain my remarks.  I am attempting to do so.  I have established the context and I intend to demonstrate to the House that what I said was not calculated to offend and is capable of a serious, responsible and mature interpretation. I would not think it a good idea if I were to be deprived of the opportunity to do so but if this does occur I will have simply to call a press conference and issue what I had intended to say.  I know Senator Fallon to be a man of his word.</P>
      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed that Senators would welcome my saying that I know Senator Fallon to be a man of his word. Is there an objection on the Government side to my saying that?  I have no doubt that he did say to some Senators on the way into the Chamber that it was his intention subsequently to ask for an explanatory memorandum.  I have to say here that if by my contribution on this Bill, about which Senator Fallon permitted himself to engage in some patronising clichés, I have been responsible for Members receiving this information to which they are entitled, I cannot find this to be a matter for apology or reproach; in fact, quite the contrary.  I think it would have been much better had the Bill been properly placed in context prior to its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may turn, as the Cathaoirleach has invited me, to the actual substance of the words which gave offence, there is a common element between all three, that is, the phrase about the Bill going through on the nod.  I would like to state categorically that I did not believe at the time of the debate, nor when I spoke on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo;, that the Government side or any Members of this House were engaged in trickery or deceit in an attempt to foist this item upon a gullible Legislature.  However, there is no doubt at all that what was contemplated was that the legislation should go through on <Col N="2107" /> the nod, at least as I understand this phrase.  My feeling and interpretation is entirely confirmed by what Senator Fallon said.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that this is a personal explanation.  It is a personal explanation in the only way it is possible to explain what was said on the radio. I believe that, if you will allow me to conclude this explanation, you, Sir, will also be satisfied that there was no malign intention on my part or no attempt to blacken the reputation of people in this House but in order to demonstrate that I have to be allowed to show that the words I used were properly used and that I was acting responsibly.  After all, Sir, you permitted an attack upon me yesterday.</P>

      <P>As of now the Senator is certainly going into very dangerous waters when he has made a suggestion such as he has made.  I explained yesterday that the Leader of the House had a right of reply.  He was exercising that right and in the context of exercising that right he was replying to matters raised by Senator Avril Doyle and he considered it appropriate to make the references that he made and that is within his discretion.  I allowed for that. Shortly afterwards I informed the Senator that if he came and spoke with me I would make arrangements for the facility to make a personal explanation available to him.  He did that this morning. I afforded the Senator that opportunity. I spelled out very clearly the circumstances in which that personal explanation must be made.  Any departure from that, I must inform the Senator, he will be ruled out.</P>

In other words, if it did not receive a nod from the House which, by his own admission, was inadequately prepared or briefed to discuss the matter, it would then be referred to a committee but if there was no objection raised &mdash; and none was raised &mdash; by the Government benches, it would then glide surreptitiously on past Second Stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of adding a few comments to what has already been said regarding economic and monetary union and, indeed, Europe as we perceive it for the future.  I believe that progress towards economic and monetary union has a double significance for the current development of European construction. On the one hand, it can be seen as a natural compliment to the full realisation of the Single European Act and, of course, of the realisation of the 1992 objective, the Internal Market without frontiers as we perceive it.</P>
      <P>From an economic and social point of view, the member states and the citizens of the European Community will benefit fully from the positive effects of the creation of a large common market and co-operation only if they can use a single currency &mdash; that has been mentioned as the ECU at the moment &mdash; and if they are capable of reinforcing their co-operation. I believe we will not get full benefits if we cannot do that.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, to be fully effective, economic and monetary union requires an institutional jump, if that is the right phrase, which will bring the Community considerably nearer to a political union.  How is it possible to envisage this union if member States are not in agreement, either with its necessity or with the objectives of an economic and social policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This agreement, which is already often expressed within the present framework of the functions of the Community, is <Col N="2113" /> founded on the conviction that member states have a common view of their essential interests and are convinced that by acting in common they are expanding their capabilities with regard both to their own internal development and the duties that would fall on them in, say, an external affairs situation.</P>
    <P>There is a new frontier, as it were, taking shape for the Community and that frontier needs to have the means of enforcing capacity for action; it needs to have an efficiency in the areas of foreign policy and possibly in security.  Other essential elements, of course, would be European union which would include the Single European Act.  Basically, you are talking about political objective also of the twelve member states.  I believe that for us to advance harmoniously towards this European union, the Community will have to have institutions or institutional schemes which meet the two imperatives of efficiency of action and democracy in the decision-making process.  That is very necessary.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Treaty of Rome would have to come into question at this stage in so far as there will have to be amendments to the Treaty of Rome to strengthen the political dimension of the Community on the one hand and so that it would possibly have expansion of powers.  There would have to be a discussion and amendment to the Treaty of Rome.  This would be a new institutional framework within which the European Community would be working.</P>
    <P>The six original members, with all their experience of 40 years can play a major part in advice and reviewing how things have gone to date.  The members can learn from the history of living together. The founding fathers of the Community had great imagination and realism and devised a system for the gradual integration of our countries in a setting where the workings of the institutions are open. I believe they have to be open, dynamic and realistic.  They definitely have to be open.  This opportunity is available and it is one that has to be availed of.  I understand there are discussions going on on that very issue at this time.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union is part and parcel of our future and of the further <Col N="2114" /> development of the Community.  I am glad of the way our Government and our Ministers are upfront in this whole area and have shown themselves to be very far-seeing and very European in their thinking.  We have to congratulate them on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to refer to the NESC.  It had been alluded to by an earlier speaker and the impression I got was that the recommendation from the NESC was that it would not be to our advantage to have a monetary and economic union.  It may be that I took that up incorrectly.  I think it is quite clear that following a detailed analysis of the relative merits of the different levels of economic integration the NESC concluded that Ireland's best position lay in advanced economic integration.  Consequently, Ireland's stragetic approach should be the objective of creating a European economic and monetary union coupled with a political union.  That would be down the road somewhat because the first point I would make in this whole matter is that a monetary and economic union are an absolutely necessary pre-clude to any progress in the political arena.  Quite frankly, we must bear in mind that the establishment of an economic and monetary union must be done in tandem or in parallel or at one and the same time.  It has a lot to offer us and there is a great deal of work involved.  It is a type of situation that is changing with the changing events of world economies and the changing political situations in many countries over the last 12 months. I would like to emphasise that without economic and monetary union we would be wasting our time in talking about political union.  It would not be a runner under any circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must consider the various stages of the establishment of economic and monetary union.  There can be no precise time-table laid down for the accomplishment of these objectives.  This would not be because of lack of agreement, but it is not practicable to put deadlines on matters that are uncertain in some respects.  For that reason we must work with the various governments and within the EC to ensure that we do accomplish <Col N="2115" /> monetary and economic union at the earliest date possible.  However, we are talking about some years down the road.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve the required degree of convergence of the whole financial situation we must strive for a system of multilateral surveillance and a very general economic budget developmental approach which has to be introduced. Otherwise, I do not think we will succeed. The two areas of monetary and economic objectives must be co-ordinated. The importance of this cannot be overemphasised.  There is at the moment a very wide difference within the Community. Progress is being achieved, and a meeting being held this month will have achieved a certain amount but it will only have set the course for future progress.</P>
    <P>From Ireland's point of view we must welcome the points made in the Delors report, which clearly states that there must be a guarantee of full and irreversible convertibility of currencies, full freedom of capital movement, complete integration and backing of financial arrangements, the elimination of margins of fluctuations and the permanent fixing of exchange rates.  This is something that from our point of view, would certainly be an advance forward.</P>
    <P>As has been referred to by other speakers, the situation has changed very significantly in the last 12 months in Germany and eastern European countries. In East Germany on the eve of its preparations to celebrate 40 years of its existence, there was a dismantling of that type of government.  We have now, thankfully, and to the pleasure of us all, a united Germany and a democratic country, which of course has its overtones as far as we are concerned and certain drawbacks on the financial side from our point of view.  Nevertheless, we must welcome the development that has taken place in Germany even though it is, perhaps, going to mean greater difficulty as far as the financing of the EC is concerned in so far as Germany, who has been the main payer of money to the EC funds this far, will have to devote a considerable amount of money to the general development of all Germany.</P>
    <P>We also have the situation with regard <Col N="2116" /> to the EFTA countries where Austria, especially, and Norway and Sweden are anxiously looking forward to being part of the EC.  This is a development we must welcome.  Further, I can anticipate a situation where many other East European countries will be very anxious to become part of the EC.  This is relevant in the context of the difficulty facing our Government and other governments at the present time in talking about a coordinated policy with such elements of change and possible change in the future.</P>
    <P>The final phase of the European Monetary Union would be that exchange rates would be irrevocably fixed.  The Community will have, as has been referred to already, a single definite currency.  This is the objective, but this is distant from us at this point in time.  The second phase of the operation begins in 1994 and is subject to certain conditions, such as the real convergence between the economies. That is one of the major and key points.</P>
    <P>During our Presidency of the EC it is only correct to recognise and acknowledge that progress was made along this route we are now talking about.  The fundamental principle of the Irish position was established.  That was extremely important.  The Community as a whole was seen as a very unifying force in Europe.  There is also a great deal of internal efficiency in various currencies within the EC which has to be tackled and on which work has been done in recent times and which is ongoing.  I believe that a significant improvement has been made along this road.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that our commitment to economic and monetary union is absolutely complete.  I also link with that political union, but I purposely leave it aside because I see it as a further measure. In line, for example, with the analysis contained, in the NESC report &mdash; to which I referred already &mdash; in Ireland we must work towards that objective.  There should be no doubt that it would be to our advantage over the years ahead to <Col N="2117" /> have established that kind of development.</P>
    <P>It would be rather remiss of me at this point if, in common with other speakers, I did not refer to the problems that have been presented by the GATT in recent times.  In regard to the GATT, the most recent news available to us today indicates that no progress is being made. Frankly, as I said in this House earlier today, I believe that we as a country and in particular the Commissioner for Agriculture, Commissioner MacSharry, have gone as far as we can go and we cannot afford to be bullied, shoved and pushed by the Americans, the CAIRNS countries or any other country.  Frankly, we have made extreme sacrifices.  We have, as was said by a previous speaker, gained substantially in the agriculture sector in the earlier days, but in latter times we are losing very heavily.  One of the most recent figures of a net gain to the country through agriculture in the main was £900 million.  That shows that to us the EC is an extremely important vehicle and therefore we must not allow the EC to be in any way dismantled and must in no way support or agree with the proposals of the Americans and the others who suggest the total dismantling of price supports and other aids through the EC.</P>
    <P>We are, like Greece, Spain and Italy, a disadvantaged area.  We are a small island on the periphery of Europe.  I believe earnestly that there is no doubt that we have an excellent case for preferential treatment.  We cannot be expected to compete with very developed economies that have a high scale of production. Should we be forced into a position &mdash; which we should never be a party to &mdash; of accepting the proposals being put to the EC by the Americans and others, we would effectively be taking half the price for our milk and half the price for our beef, mutton etc.  World prices would approximately reach 50 per cent of the present prices of beef, milk and the various other commodities.</P>
    <P>I feel that we are a very important country from the point of view of our location.  For that reason I think we should use our political position to our economic advantage.  By that I mean that <Col N="2118" /> we are in a very strategic position and that the European Community should recognise that in terms of preferential treatment.  For example, I believe that the whole island of Ireland should be classified as disadvantaged.  I believe that from there on one should begin to take out obvious areas that were not or are not disadvantaged.  That is a point that has not, to my knowledge, been aired to any appreciable extent.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that it is in all our interest that political, monetary and economic union should take place and that we are part of it.  I want to conclude by reiterating what I said <i>vis-a-vis</i> the EC: that we must, as a disadvantaged island far away from the main market place, get some form of preferential treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Is ábhar fíor-thábhachtach é seo.  Tá go leor cainte á dhéanamh i láthair na huaire maidir le haontacht na hEorpa.  Ní dóigh liom, áfach, in ainneoin an méid cainte seo, go bhfuil daoine ag scrúdú go mion céard a chiallóidh na gnéithe seo go praiticiúil do dhaoine.</P>
      <P>European union of various types has become a very popular buzz word.  It is very important, if we are going to make progress, that we are quite clear in what we are setting out to achieve and what structures we find acceptable.  My understanding of European unity is the concept of a free association of nations working in their common interest but at the same time retaining their own independence, an association that we would like to see growing as the European Community has and embracing in time all the nation states of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that too many people are in favour to European unity on the model we have, for example, in the United States of America, particularly in this country, where under a Constitution we have basically a people led state.  We have a lot to protect and to ensure that we protect in any new structures that are created in the new Europe.  Unlike some of our neighbouring states, in this country the people are supreme and in matters of basic law all matters have to be referred back to the people.  We have also of <Col N="2119" /> course, in common with all modern democracies, a Parliament.</P>
    <P>When we look at the European situation the basic government of that Europe to date has been through the Council of Ministers and through the Commission working on their behalf.  We have gradually seen the growth of the European Parliament with and ever increasing role.  We would have to question in the long term which we wish to maintain supreme.  I believe that when we sought independence in this country we did not seek it out of any hatred for the people in our neighbouring island, but we sought it because we believed quite genuinely that with independence we could achieve the better good of our people.</P>
    <P>Those people who set up this State believed in associations of nations &mdash; we were already members of the League of Nations &mdash; and in co-operation; but they also believed in the importance of having an autonomous Parliament.  Therefore I would favour European unity or integration along the lines of maintaining the Council of Europe, on which we have as our representatives Ministers from Governments elected by Dáil Éireann, and that that would be the main force for decision making in Europe.  I can accept, however, that there would and should be consultation with the European Parliament and that that consultation and those methods of consultation could be improved.</P>
    <P>The second reservation I have about all the talk about Europe is that I do not see that we would be well served by a central bureaucracy that would be making minor decisions that would affect people in this country.  I personally am also one of the few people who have preached caution regarding the circumventing of the Government here as regards the application of funds from Europe on the ground in Ireland.  I think that, while that might be attractive in the short term, there is a very serious inherent danger in such a policy when one is talking about developing a coherent and cohesive national policy within this country.</P>
    <P>People on the ground tend to have a <Col N="2120" /> honeypot attitude towards Europe.  They are all in favour of European unity because they see it as a kind of honeypot that money flows from.  That is a dangerous and facile attitude in regard to what real European unity should be about.  In an age where we talk nationally about decentralisation, not only in physical terms but in political terms, where we talk about devolution of powers to local authorities, where we are talking at the moment about a whole review of local authority structures to make them more meaningful, that at the same time it is coherent thinking to be sure that more and more decisions are being taken in Europe that could be better taken at a national or local level.</P>
    <P>As somebody living on the periphery of this country I am very conscious that the bigger a scheme and the further a decision is made from where it is being applied, the more likely that it will have a distorting effect.  Therefore I am very much in favour of what is termed, I understand, in the technical jargon the principle of subsidiarity.  That is, that only those decisions that would need to be made at a European level would be made at a European level and that we would resist the temptation of the bureaucrats to draw more and more minor decision making, minor controls that are unnecessary, towards themselves.</P>
    <P>There has been great talk about European monetary union.  I have no problem with the idea of having a situation where we would have one single currency.  The practical advantages of that are obvious, although I think it has to be pointed out in passing that it will not protect us from fluctuations.  It will only mean that it will be our currency <i>versus</i> the rest of the currencies of the world; but we will be still subject to fluctuations against the dollar, the yen and all other currencies. However, the reservation I would have relates to the drawing of fiscal policy in towards the centre that might be and could be and, I understand, it is mooted as being the necessary corollary of European monetary union.  The dangers of that are that the practices in monetary and in financial policy terms that are commonplace at the moment and that are perceived by the economists to serve the <Col N="2121" /> requirements of Europe at present might become embedded.  Whatever about trying to get those changed at local level, it might prove very difficult and a very slow procedure to change such a large body as would be necessary to control the financial policy of a European unified state.</P>
    <P>On the question of security and defence, I would have grave reservations on the ground of a common defence policy.  The first thing we would have to recognise is that, if there was European unity in the terms of defence policy, we would be, in part, with neighbours who have overseas interests outside the European union.  The second thing we have to recognise is that generally in larger states there tends to build up a paranoia that out there somewhere there must be some enemy about to attack us.  We had this syndrome for the past 40 or 50 years when it was believed, up until four or five years ago, that we were in imminent danger from the eastern bloc.  I do not honestly believe at this stage that we need in real terms to defend ourselves against any outside nation.  I do not believe there is any nation that has designs on us.  I am absolutely convinced that it is not our defence forces that are deterring people from attacking.  I am equally convinced that it is not the defence forces of our neighbours either that are deterring such an attack.</P>
    <P>However, on the role that we could play in defence, I think our role should be a positive one.  Ireland is in a unique position to say that the road to peace is not by nuclear deterrent, is not by mounting an equal threat, but by preaching the gospel of disarmament, the gospel of resolution of international disputes by peaceful methods, and by trying to persuade our fellow nations that the way forward in the future is through peaceful negotiation and not through armed conflict or deterrent which, by a wrong pressing of a button, could extinguish mankind.  I am convinced we have a positive role to play there.  To play that role it is very important that we maintain our traditional independent stance in these matters, not as a negative value but as a positive value, because we as a small <Col N="2122" /> nation cannot be thought to be a threat to any other nation.</P>
    <P>On the question of common security, I agree that, not only within Europe but throughout all civilised nations, there should be co-operation on security.  In a world where people are very mobile and where crime tends to be international, it is very important that not only within Europe but on a broader scale we continue to build our links with the security forces in various lands.  However, in doing that, we should also avail of the opportunity to look at arrangements that would ensure, in relation to nationals from various countries, that agreements are made for the humane treatment of prisoners.</P>
    <P>One thing that could be developed on a European level would be the concept of reciprocal arrangements for prisoners, where people would have the choice to apply to serve their sentence in their country of origin on humanitarian grounds.  I would also see that for certain types of offence we could look at a direct European court which would be seen to be independent.  These are only ideas that could be passed around, honed and refined in the developing Europe.</P>
    <P>If we are going to make progress on European unity, and not only on European unity but also on world unity, if we are going to bring down the barriers right across the world &mdash; and it was proved in the past year that European unity is not what we thought it meant two years ago; it is a much grander scale of things &mdash; it is important that we are willing to flesh out and be specific on exactly what powers we mean to pool, how to share our sovereignty and which powers we feel we should maintain also as a nation state. It is a new concept.  It is a concept that Europe has pioneered.</P>
    <P>Unlike the United States, my understanding of what we mean by European unity is a free association of nation states pooling their sovereignty in common interest and in common pursuit of common goals.  I do not think that anybody within those terms means to do away with the independence of, for example, this Parliament.  For example, I do not think anybody is suggesting we would give up our seat in the United <Col N="2123" /> Nations and that we would have one European representative there, and so on.  If they do mean those things they should spell them out, because I cannot see that we can progress on this line until people become specific about what exactly we are talking about in this sphere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Ó Cuív, I think this is a tremendously important topic.  It is a topic that has been aired well in the Seanad over three different sessions, but it is one which I think has not been debated to anything like the degree and the extent that it merits debate in the country.</P>
      <P>There are two broad aspects to the proposed European unity.  There is the question of the Community's competence and responsibilities and there is the question of institutional reformat. Many aspects of the Community's responsibilities are to be welcomed in the context of their being expanded and reformed.  It is highly desirable that people talk in terms of minimum standards in the social field in the establishment of these standards and their implementation.  It is very important that the Social Charter be adopted and that it be made a matter of compulsion, of obligation, and that we meet the obligations laid down in the Social Charter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to economic and monetary union, certainly on the question of a Central Bank, I would be concerned at the <Col N="2124" /> idea that that Central Bank would be an autonomous one and that it would not be subject to political control.  I would also be concerned at the desirability of monetary stability being considered in isolation and not being considered in the context of an obligation also to achieve a goal of full employment.  It is very important that those aspects of social policy should receive the attention they deserve.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Community's foreign policy, this has been one of the areas which is now beginning to be debated in a manner that is justified.  On the question of defence, I would be concerned that this country would be engaging in European defence policies, which might well be a misnomer for policies which are not simply a matter of defence but also a matter of dealing with potential aggression and so on.  That is the double edged aspect of defence.  In relation to defence in this country there is something relating to our history that we should keep in mind.  The history of this country is different from the history of the other 11.  Most of the other 11 countries &mdash; and I am speaking now as anything but a historian &mdash; have had a history of being dominant powers; they have had a history of overseas adventure and so on.  We have been at the receiving end of those types of attitudes and policies.  That is a very fundamental difference between us and the rest of the Community.  Indeed, I think they have a good deal to learn from our experiences and our history in that matter.  I think it is something that we should have been laying a lot more emphasis on than we have.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties and problems that our party and people like myself have in relation to neutrality I do not think anybody would disagree that there is now going to be increasing pressure on this country to get involved in European commitments which certainly would be at variance with our policy of neutrality. One of the regrettable aspects of our policy of neutrality over the years is that once de Valera had followed his neutrality policy in the last war, we simply forgot about it.  It was something that did not really matter.  It was just there in a cupboard and never considered or developed.  Now, long overdue, we are <Col N="2125" /> beginning to put together an argument in favour of the positive aspects of that neutrality.  I think there is a very strong case to be made there.</P>
    <P>I regret that to a large extent it is coming from the side of the House I am on &mdash; in other words, the Left in Ireland. That is a pity.  I would like to see some of the other shades of the political spectrum throwing in their twopence worth and declaring what their attitude is.  We will find it very difficult not to be swept away in Europe unless we get up and make our case, and make it very strongly.  I think we have a very strong case which can be made.  I would agree with the argument Senator Murphy made in his contribution in relation to that aspect of our existence and our policy over the years.  It is an awful pity that it was left dormant for so long, but it is still useful and valuable and is something that we can contribute to Europe.  I think it is something on which the rest of Europe might have a good deal to learn from us.</P>
    <P>In relation to matters such as environmental policy, most of the objectives would be desirable as a matter of sustaining economic growth with policies which are ecologically acceptable and sound.  In relation to questions of European citizenship, there is a case to be made for a declaration of fundamental rights applicable right across Europe. There is a case to be made very strongly for a declaration which will prevent things like racism.  Those are very important items.  They may not be directly relevant, although in some ways they are.  They are the kinds of issues on which we should be making our views known to a far far greater extent than we are prepared to do at present.</P>
    <P>Moving on to the institutional matters and the changes which are taking place, I think we are going to see a lot more majority voting in the Council.  That has its own problems for us.  In many ways we are going to find ourselves increasingly marginalised because of the small size of our economic clout.  There will be further dimunitions of the role of the people in Ireland in implementing European policy.  I think you will see a lot more implemented from the centre.  Again, that is going to sharpen up the effects of <Col N="2126" /> changes in Europe.  In the past we have been able to cobble together stories which allowed us to get derogations from various European initiatives.  Some of these derogations were highly regrettable; others prevented very undesirable social affects.  I would be anxious that the democratic control over Community legislation would be enhanced.</P>
    <P>I would also be very interested in seeing an Irish view put forward in relation to how national parliaments and the European Parliament might be integrated. There have been some suggestions made here in relation to how this House would be integrated with the European parliamentarians, how this House would be made more relevant and indeed how we could learn from what is going on in Europe.  It seems to me to be quite daft that you have 15 Irish parliamentarians in Europe and that the Legislature in this country does not have any formal way of dealing with them. That is a pity.  There is a very important case to be made there for developing systems and structures which will allow what is happening in Europe to be more readily and more directly incorporated into the Irish scene.</P>
    <P>I believe that what is happening in Europe is going to become more and more relevant.  It has been suggested to me that in politics here in ten years' time, how the leaders of the different parties most of us belong to are performing will not make all that much difference.  What will really be relevant is how the leaders of those groups in Europe will be performing, that it is from the success or failure of the leadership of the groups in Europe to which we are attached that we will derive political success or failure in this country, that the roles of the leaders of our own local parties will be greatly diminished in terms of their importance and that we will to a far greater extent be influenced by what is happening in Europe.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that I continue to be bothered by and to regret the fact that we in Ireland still seem to put far too great an emphasis on what Senator Ó Cuív called the honeypot aspects of Europe &mdash; going across and making these special cases and pleas.  That is OK, but <Col N="2127" /> it is being done in isolation.  That is dominating the whole thing.  We should be contributing a far greater amount than we are in relation to the development of Europe.  Invariably the rewards and returns on that will be in the long term &mdash; unfortunately, in Irish politics there is far too much emphasis on the short term and not nearly enough on the long term. Generating ideas on change and development in Europe from this country will stand to us very well if we are prepared to look at the next ten or 15 years or beyond that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome this debate and to thank you for giving us such an amount of time for it.  The interest that has been shown proves that we are very grateful.</P>
      <P>Nearly all points were covered by various Senators who have already contributed. Since my colleague from across the border on the bridge of Finea wants to get in before 4 o'clock, I will be brief.</P>
      <P>I firmly welcome the process of European economic and monetary union and European political union.  I want to deal with the question of democratic accountability and also I would like to make some references to Irish neutrality and how this might be affected in the proces.  I very much welcome the move towards economic and monetary union and political union.  Like other Senators, I would like to welcome the satisfactory outcome of the Council meeting in Rome on 27 and 28 October.  At this Council meeting it was agreed that the Inter-governmental Conference would be held in December. Only eleven of the states of the EC agreed to this so it was unfortunate that our neighbours, the UK, did not.</P>
      <P>I agree this is a very timely debate indeed and it is something to which the Seanad should pay great attention.  The cynics might say that of course we are all in favour of economic and monetary union and European political union but that is because we do not know what it is.  Everybody is in favour of it but nobody can quite say what at this stage it is.  That is what the debate is all about.  I am sure that is why we had all been here for the past number of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2128" /> There can be no doubt in anybody's mind that EC membership has been very good to us in Ireland.  It has been very good from an economic, political view and cultural point of view.  That must surely be beyond dispute.  It has brought about widespread economic prosperity to us in this country since we joined.  It has brought us into contact with many other political cultures and so enhanced the political process here.  It has also brought us into contact with many other cultures of Europe and that has again enhanced our own culture.  Nevertheless there are groups that still oppose our membership of the EC.  There are not very many people who would go on the record and say they are opposed to EC membership but there and others who would certainly say that they were opposed and are still opposed.  We heard our colleague, the previous speaker, speak in this debate but his party in the referendum was totally opposed to it.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the question of democratic accountability.  The Oireachtas has not been particularly vigilant regarding the process of European integration.  I firmly hold that view.  As the power and influence of the EC increases, effective measures need to be examined to ensure democratic accountability. There is now a need to strengthen democratic accountability and this involves a number of questions.  The power and balance between the EC institutions need to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The role of the national parliament also needs to be carefully examined.  Professor Basil Chubb in his book <i>A Source Book of Irish Government</i> says that surveillance and control on behalf of the public of Community activity is tenuous. The cynics might say that we have come this far with European integration but that nobody has noticed it.  It has not been debated and nobody knows where exactly we are at this stage.  It must be said that the Oireachtas has little power of scrutiny and it is deficient in this regard.  At present the Taoiseach merely reports twice a year to the Dáil following the meeting of the European Council.  I believe this can be further enhanced and developed and that perhaps a debate <Col N="2129" /> should take place regarding the communiqué after each Summit meeting.  I believe the Dáil and Seanad must become much more involved in debating each communiqué as it is released to the general public following the summit.</P>
    <P>I also believe there is a need now to enhance the role of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community.  I was very disappointed at the resources which the committee had to undertake its work.  It simply could not deal with its workload. The committee should be given adequate resources to undertake its existing work and its terms of reference should be broadened to encompass this whole debate and the debate on European integration. I am talking about a foreign policy committee.  I did call for more debate on economic and monetary union in this regard.  I have many other points to make, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, but as the time allowed is running out for my colleague from County Cavan I will allow him to speak before the Minister concludes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation of Senator Cassidy's accommodating attitude in wanting to ensure full participation by speakers in the debate.  It is very much appreciated.  It establishes that there is a parochial feeling that works in our part of the country.  We certainly look after each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of European union I would say this at the outset: we often forget now that after the Second World War Europe was absolutely devastated. It was devastated in terms of railways, a total dislocation of population and industry. The entire infrastructure of society had been ruined by the Second World War and all of the militaristic exploits associated with it.  Out of that devastation and total chaos emerged the European Coal and Steel Community.  That was a major factor in bringing back industrial, economic and social progress to little Europe or to the centre of Europe.  That was to culminate in the EC which has met with phenomenal success.  It is a very happy story that the evolution of the EC has coincided with a rebuilding of Europe <Col N="2130" /> and that now we are talking of greater levels of integration.  That is very good.</P>
    <P>I am going to say something now with which I know Senator Cassidy will not agree but that is the purpose of the debate, to bring out these issues.  I am conscious of the time factor so I will make actual points rather than a very long speech.  The first substantial point I would make is that I think the day has come when we will have to look at the question of our neutrality.  I am not convinced that we can go on with our traditional form of neutrality any more.  The Warsaw Pact and NATO are historical affairs.  They are now obsolete after the great success of the recent conference on security and co-operation in Paris.</P>
    <P>I believe that in a new integrated Europe we cannot have it both ways.  We will have to be in there in a very complete sense and I believe that may ultimately involve not just security co-operation which is inevitable but also defence co-operation. I do not think we can shrik that.  We have a certain philosophy, that we are lovers of peace, we are against militarism, a philosophy we will obviously want to build into any European network but I think we cannot shirk our responsibilities to an integrated Europe in the defence area any more than in any other one area.  Ultimately we will have to make a defence commitment if we are to be part of an integrated Europe.  We will have to set our own agenda within that Europe, but it will involve that commitment.</P>
    <P>I believe an integrated Europe and the kind of harmonisation that is arising now in post-1992 Europe is the greatest Godsend to dealing with the Northern Ireland problem that has arisen for a long time. I am extraordinarily conscious of this as a representative coming from a Border area.  I believe that with the harmonisation of taxes, with the total freedom of labour movement, with industrial integration, with integration of trade and with complete free trade, all but the abstract political concept of division will be gone.  In other words, in reality we will have a united Ireland in the late 1990s.  That is an exciting thing.  It is a most remarkable thing and a most providential thing for this country at this stage. <Col N="2131" /> I would be interested in the Minister's response to that and his perception of that oncoming reality and how we might adjust to it.  I believe it will break down all the barriers.  That has to be a critical development.  We will be left with nothing but the old ballads in the bars late at night, the chantings, the well trodden histories of the past and the folk memories. All of the reality will be in a unified country.  We should be aware of that and try to use every conceivable stratagem at Government and at all levels to ensure that we fully exploit that by ensuring that we have interplay of education, tours, parliamentary interplay, all sorts of social interplays and that we grasp this opportunity for integration and what it will mean in terms of our national question which has bedevilled us for so long.</P>
    <P>We have to accept that there is a commitment in the Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act to strengthen the peripheral areas through the use of regional social and structural funds. There has been criticism by the National Economic and Social Council and by the European Commission of our use of structural funds.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister addressing the question of how he sees the future in terms of how we use structural, regional and social funds.  I do not think we should view this in begging bowl terms.  It is a philosophical commitment on their part that they believe in evening up the entire EC.  That would be necessary for proper harmonisation and integration.  It is not going to be viable if we allow peripheral areas such as Ireland, the Iberian Peninsula and Eastern Europe to fall behind socio-economically.  Then you will not have proper integration.  It is a correct strategy in the long term.  I would be interested in how we will grasp that.</P>
    <P>I will be parochial in making my next point, but it is important and I would urge the Minister to have a look at it &mdash; and I know the Minister will not take issue with this coming from the constituency he comes from.  At present there is a critical problem with farm incomes.  That is an accepted reality. There is a critical problem with rural depopulation, with the small family farm <Col N="2132" /> breaking down and the structure of rural Ireland breaking down.  For that reason, given that there is 65 per cent funding from Europe, the extension of the severely handicapped area designation to the areas in the west and in the heart of Ireland not already classified as severely handicapped would be a good thing.  In Cavan and Monaghan at the moment it is not Government policy to declare those two counties fully severely handicapped. Were they to be declared severely handicapped it would, at very little cost to this State, bring an income into the homes of the small farmers of that area.  I would appeal to the Minister to examine that and see that this is a mechanism to bring in money to keep the small farmers of Cavan and Monaghan on the land.  That is the kind of intelligent use of the social funds of the EC that I would commend to the Minister.  I urge him to examine that possibility and I await his reply with interest.</P>
    <P>On the question of the democratisation of institutions, I believe that we are not sufficiently linked into the European network. I am of the view that about 80 per cent of the decisions relevant to this country are made in Brussels.  If 80 per cent of the decisions that affect our lives are made outside of our county councils, or Seanad and our Dáil, we are going to have to look at mechanisms for linking ourselves into the European parliamentary process.  An initial step has to be taken by putting in motion a process whereby members of the European Parliament would speak to the Seanad and would attend Seanad meetings, where we could have reports which could be debated in the Seanad with the European Parliament members.  Perhaps they should have automatic proxy membership of the Seanad in the sense that they could come in and explain to us what is going on in Europe.  That should be the minimum.  The Government and all the parties in the Oireachtas should look at the Oireachtas Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, expand its terms of reference and use that as a mechanism for networking into Europe to a greater degree.</P>
    <P>At the moment our MEPs, once they <Col N="2133" /> are elected, become fanciful creatures who fly off to Strasbourg or elsewhere once a week.  We occasionally see them at party functions around the country. We have no direct link with them.  I am glad to see that the Minister is indicating agreement with this, because it is a practical and relevant step that we could take immediately to link them up.</P>

      <P>Ireland has to have a very big part to play in the question of establishing civil liberties, justice, peace and the concept of equality of opportunity. Our politicians in Brussels and Strasbourg have a role to play in developing that concept.  I would not agree with some of my colleagues who in previous sessions of the Seanad said that they would favour Turkey being given membership of the EC at the moment.  The EC must expand to include many countries that are not members.  Austria is awaiting membership at the moment and East Germany now is <i>de facto</i> a member of the EC.  I would not favour the accession of Turkey at present.  Many of my colleagues indicated that they would. I would not, because there is a lot of evidence to suggest that there are major problems there with civil liberties, with the rights of the individual.  Any country that flaunts Amnesty International regulations, that flaunts natural justice and that flaunts the concept of the liberty of the individual cannot be accepted as a full participant member of the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Europe is heading towards complete integration.  That is an exciting prospect and we should go along with that.  If we do not, it will happen anyway; but we must be part of that process.  We have to be creative in the way we go about that and link in with the Euro-network.  We have to look at our defence policy.  We have to be willing to participate and <Col N="2134" /> develop a Euro awareness to a greater degree than we have been doing; and possibly there will be an improvement in the British attitude under their new leader.  We hope that will lead to a more positive and less archaic attitude on their part to European integration and that they will show less of the island mentality and the old imperial concept on that one. We must look at this as offering the potential for harmonisation and we must prepare ourselves adequately for that.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator John A. Murphy that he proposes to raise the need for the Minister for Education to extend higher education grants to the small minority of students who, while not meeting formal academic requirements, are admitted to third level institutions on the grounds of mature years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the question of the small group of mature students attending third level institutions who at the moment are not in receipt of any third level grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had a life-long interest in adult education generally.  It seems to me that the people who come late to education are a very special breed and in general <Col N="2135" /> they perform extremely well.  They have developed maturity and an ability to pick out what is significant in what they study. Generally, they are people of very fine character as well, so I am making the proposition that they deserve well of us.</P>
    <P>Let me clarify the category I am talking about.  There are mature students and mature students.  There are people who did their leaving certificate or Matriculation examination perhaps five or ten years ago who were unable to go to college at that time &mdash; I am speaking of course about all third level institutions and am using the word &ldquo;college&rdquo; in general &mdash; because of personal circumstances or because they were not of that way of thinking at the time and then five or ten years later they decide to take up their Matriculation option and go to college. All things being equal, these people qualify for a third level grant.  If they got their Leaving Certificate or Matriculation in 1980 and they go to college in 1990 they get a grant but, unfortunately, the grant they get is determined by the eligibility criteria of 1980 and not 1990 and that is a particular grievance.</P>
    <P>However, I am not referring to those people.  Although they have a grievance they are in receipt of some kind of financial assistance.  I am concerned about the mature students who never got to Leaving Certificate or Matriculation.  Some of them may not have gone to secondary school at all.  I recall two cases of people of primary education who came into this category.  what happens is that they apply to the college authorities when they have reached the mature age point, which is 24 years, in the October of proposed entry, and they say they do not have the Matriculation or Leaving Certificate but can offer evidence that they are a serious student.  In some cases they might have participated in voluntary work in their community or perhaps have carried out investigation of local history or that kind of thing, although they have no formal qualifications.  On the basis of what they can offer and on their promise, as it were, the college authorities agree to accept them as students even though they do not have the formal Matriculation or Leaving Certificate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2136" /> It must be pointed out that some of them are rejected as well.  Not everyone over the age of 24 who has not had the formal qualifications is accepted.  I have seen such applications rejected.  They are carefully considered and, in some cases, there is a question of interviewing these applicants.  The point I want to make is that the college accepts them but only after careful consideration.  In my view they have fulfilled a particular criterion by the mere fact that the college has accepted them.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately these people do not qualify for any financial assistance because they do not have the two honours which is now the basic criterion for financial grant and they are in a financial limbo.  There are not very many of them. My information is that in University College Cork, just taking my own college, no more than about 70 places are set aside for mature students and some of those places are not taken up.  It would be an interesting exercise to do a nationwide tally of the mature students in our third level institutions.  I am sure their numbers are quite inconsiderable and, therefore, any costs involved would not be great.</P>
    <P>I said they deserve very well of us. When third level colleges decide to accept a student of mature years, their progress is watched and nine times out of ten they do extremely well.  They vindicate the trust placed in them.  They are strongly motivated, critical, mature and fine people.  They show considerable courage in coming back to college.  There are certain psychological difficulties in mingling with people half their age and there are other problems of adjustment they have to make.  They deserve our support on those grounds as well.  We are talking here about second chance education and a fundamental sense of justice.  We are talking about giving cothrom ná Féinne to this small group of people.</P>
    <P>I am aware, and the Minister is aware, that a short time ago in Dáil Éireann the Minister for Education was questioned on this matter.  It was essentially the same question I am asking now but it was a written question and it got a written answer.  I refer to the Official Report of the Dáil dated 31 October 1990, Volume <Col N="2137" /> 402, No. 3, column 759-760.  Her answer in effect was that there are two criteria for financial assistance: one is educational attainment and the other is that you satisfy the eligibility criteria.  She said if these students do not have the actual formal educational attainment, namely two honours in the Leaving Certificate, why do they not go back to school and get their Leaving Certificate and then go on to college and they will have their grants?  With respect, that is a very unsatisfactory and unrealistic answer.  It is tough enough on these students to seize their second chance and go to college without imposing upon them the very onerous requirement that they do two years at Leaving Certificate level.  My submission is that it is not academically necessary for them to do that because the college, by accepting them, has indicated that it marks their attainment of that criteria.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there are cost constraints but the cost would not be considerable. I urge the Minister to give careful consideration to this and at least to check out the costings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Mature students who did their Leaving Certificate or Matriculation, even then or 15 years ago, qualify for third level grants.

There is no other source of financial assistance for them and, I think morally they are entitled to support.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Murphy for his contribution and indeed for assisting me and the office of the Seanad on an occasion last week.</P>
      <P>Just to clarify the position, those students are taken in to third level colleges without the academic qualifications necessary and that clearly implies that they are coming from a severely disadvantaged background of one type or another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, some of them would come from a menial position perhaps and they want to improve themselves.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some provision for reduced fees.  It is a small fund. They have to make further application and a special case for that.  My submission is that they are entitled to more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point the Senator made.  Where there is a small number of students coming from a background with a special set of circumstances, we should perhaps try to look at the possibility of responding to their needs in a positive way.  I will mention first the negative side of doing so.  If there were a large number of students and it had a major financial connotation, that would make such a decision more difficult.  The second difficulty would be that if we were to create a precedent of this nature, we would find significant numbers of people coming forward who would claim equal treatment, and rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main difficulty for the Department would be the financial implications, no matter how small, of making a decision like this.  Having said that, I undertake to discuss with the Minister the possibility of implementing a proposal along the <Col N="2139" /> lines suggested by Senator Murphy.  I know the Minister has been most anxious to try and accommodate them and all the credit to her.  She has succeeded in enabling people from poorer backgrounds to go to college who otherwise would not have the opportunity to do so. I know she wishes to give every possible opportunity to people from disadvantaged backgrounds to go to college. I will be happy to discuss with her the proposals made by the Senator and perhaps carry out a study of the numbers involved and the difficulties with which they have to contend.</P>
    <P>I accept that the regulation at present is that they must obtain the Leaving Certificate. However, it may be possible to look at that provided we do not create a situation where we would have a stream of people coming along.  If we can establish a special category which would remain at a certain level, I will undertake the examine it and request the Minister to look at it favourably.  Such an initiative <Col N="2140" /> would have to be taken in association with the colleges involved.  Therefore, were the Minister to agree to a proposal along those lines it would be on the basis that the colleges would be agreeable to row in with a lower fee level or whatever the case might be.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy's proposal is an admirable one with which I agree.  Whatever we can do to make third level education accessible to our most disadvantaged &mdash; and I would think that is the most important term in today's short debate &mdash; we should certainly endeavour to do.  I undertake to do that with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
