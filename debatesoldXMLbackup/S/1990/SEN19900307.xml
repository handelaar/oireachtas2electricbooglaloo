      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
      <P>A cheistiú faoin chumhacht atá ag Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí reimsí móra talún príomháideach timpeall na tíre uilig ach i gConamara go speisialta a ainmniú mar Cheantar Spéise Eolaíochta (Areas of Scientific Interest nó A.S.I.'s) gan stadas reachtúil nó dlíthúil Eorpach nó Náisiúnta a bheith ag Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí é seo a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to ensure that all the necessary preparations are put in order to prepare for the policing implications of open borders post-1992, and if he will make a statement on this matter.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase funding to enable Dublin Corporation to continue its programme of upgrading its housing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> I also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The critical problems caused to all sectors, rural and urban, by recent storms on our coastline and inland, the lack of Government response and the totally inadequate emergency moneys offered by Brussels.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Pat Upton of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The discontinuation of grants for smokeless heating conversions by virtue of the Government's refusal to make any further special central area orders with particular reference to the Crumlin, Drimnagh and Bluebell areas of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The unacceptable delay in the processing of investigations by the Garda Complaints Board and the need for the Minister to allocate additional staff immediately thereto.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Carmencita Hederman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister to intervene in view of the concern with the section 4 motion tabled in Dublin County Council to achieve material contravention of the county development plan to permit development on the agriculturally zoned lands in the Liffey Valley at Cooldrinagh, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to appoint a temporary teacher to Killaloe national school to cover the period September 1990 to 1991.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ó Foighil, Neville, Costello, Doyle, Upton, Ross and Jackman as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator Ó Foighil and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Neville, <Col N="407" /> Costello, Doyle, Upton, Ross and Jackman may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule that the matter raised by Senator Hederman is not suitable for discussion on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1 and 2 today.  Item No. 1 is the order for the Second Stage of the International Carriage of Goods by Road Bill, 1990.  We will take Second Stage (Resumed) of the Marine Institute Bill, 1989, up to 6.30 p.m. and the Fine Gael composite motion from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  We will resume Committee Stage of the Derelict Sites Bill, 1989, tomorrow morning and at 1.30 p.m. we will take the motion &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann wishes to discuss the measures already taken on the impact and extent of recent storm and flood damage&rdquo; I suggest that be a three-hour debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I wish to raise a number of points. First, I would like to note and to welcome the return to the House of Senators McKenna and McDonald from observing the election in Nicaragua.  In view of the fact that two Members of this House were there, would it be possible, tomorrow or next week, to make available half an hour for them to report back to the House on their observations on the election there. If there are observers it is worthwhile getting the benefit of their observations. Secondly, in view of the fact that two of the Senators from Trinity have added &mdash; without consultation, but nevertheless welcome &mdash; their support to Motion 81, which calls for the setting up of a special committee, I suspect there is all-party agreement that we go ahead with this and perhaps that matter could be expedited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On today's business, I am fairly certain that the Marine Institute Bill will not last for very long and that we will not fill all <Col N="408" /> the time available.  In view of that &mdash; there are very few speakers offering &mdash; would it be possible, because of the tragedy in Mountjoy Prison last evening, to devote one hour this afternoon to Item No. 83 in the name of Senator Neville on today's Order Paper, if there is an hour available.  That motion is directly relevant to last evening's tragedy and perhaps one hour could be made available, even without a Minister, for statements on that subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my disappointment that we have not progressed further on the Marine Institute Bill.  There was an understanding that Committee Stage would be taken today and, as Senator Manning has pointed out, it is unlikely that Second Stage is going to take us very far.</P>
      <P>I would also urge the Leader of the House to consider making time available for a debate on two mainline issues.  The first is the urgency which now attaches to a debate on Northern Ireland because of the implications of the Supreme Court judgment in the McGimpsey case.  Secondly, at this stage with historic events happening like wildfire under the Irish Presidency, it seems to me imperative that we have an immediate debate in this House on the interim developments on the European and world scene under the Presidency.  I hope it would not be too much to expect that the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs would take time off from their whirlwind schedule to put in an appearance in this House and not simply when there is a gala occasion offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Manning on his proposal that Item No. 83 be discussed.  In doing so I would like to convey our sympathy to the family of the bereaved person who committed suicide in Mountjoy yesterday. It is wrong to have somebody who has committed petty crime &mdash; this person was convicted of just shoplifting &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach báire mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Chathaoirleach go speisialta as an obair an-phraiticiúil atá déanta aige le go mbeadh córas aistriúcháin sa Teach seo go luath.  Is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil litir faighte ag an Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge, a bhfuil mise i mo bhall air, go mbeidh an córas aistriúcháin insealbhaithe sa Teach seo an samhradh seo chugainn, ar a dhéanaí.</P>
      <P>Because of that I would like to place on record the appreciation of people on both sides of the House for the efforts that were put into having this direct translation sevice made available, and especially the Chair and the Leader of the House.</P>
      <P>Mar gheall air sin tá mé sásta anois gan leanúint leis an chosc a bhí agam ó thaobh dátheangachais, agus an Béarla agus an Ghaeilge a úsáid.</P>

      <P>Would the Leader of the House agree that it would greatly enhance the reputation of the Seanad, which on occasion has been tarnished, if we were to have wide-ranging discussion very soon on the health services, on achieving better value for money and on achieving better patient care.  Would the Leader of the House agree that this is a most urgent matter and that the reputation of the House would be enhanced by our taking on board an issue of such national concern?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>May I beg your indulgence, first, to welcome the students and teachers of Loreto College, Swords, who are present in the Public Gallery?  It is an important matter that young people in their teens who will be voting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important matter that people who are voting have the opportunity of seeing the Houses in operation.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I wish to support the motion in relation to Item No. 83 that was proposed by Senator Maurice Manning and seconded by Senator Dan Neville in regard to the recent appalling death in Mountjoy Prison.  I had intended to put in a motion under Standing Order 29 on the matter.  I think it is of extreme urgency that the entire area in relation to deaths in prison, and particularly in relation to this suicide, where for the first time in the history of the State a young woman has died&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirdly, I wish to add my voice to what has already been said by Senator Murphy in relation to a debate on Northern Ireland.  We have raised this on a number of occasions.  Many international issues have been debated at length in this House, quite rightly, but now because of the very specific developments that have taken place in relation to the Parliamentary Tier and the meetings between the North, the South and Britain in parliamentary terms and also because <Col N="411" /> of last week's decision in the Supreme Court case which raises new issues in relation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to pick up on a number of issues which we seemed to have dropped off the agenda for the last period of time.  Over the past number of months a number of commitments have been given to us by the Leader of the House, one in particular on the Death Penalty Bill.  On two occasions we have asked that this be placed on the Order Paper and on one occasion we put it to a vote.  On both occasions the Leader of the House have us to understand it was his intention in the first case before Christmas and then in the spring that the Government would introduce a Bill calling for the abolition of the death penalty. There seems to be total consensus and it was in the Programme for Government. However, there is no indication when the Bill will be published and we certainly need a very clear indication in terms of dates when this is likely to happen.  It is not that one would wish to set out to embarrass the Government in their Programme for Government but we would like to have an undertaking on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times, if I can put the question to the Leader of the House, we have also had various discussions here on the need for a foreign policy committee.  We have had a debate on foreign policy almost on a weekly basis since we resumed last October and raised at that time the Government's attitude towards a foreign policy committee.  We were led to believe that the Government had that matter under active consideration. However reports from another place in <Col N="412" /> the past number of days have indicated that the Government feel this would in some way inhibit the democratic process. I would like to hear from the Leader of the House if the setting up of a foreign policy committee is still on the agenda of Government.</P>
    <P>A commitment was also given recently that the report on libel and newspapers was something that would be discussed in the House, the report of the commission and so on.  I would ask for the views of the Leader of the House on that point at this stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I certainly support the idea of filling in some extra business this afternoon. The debate on the Marine Institute Bill is going to collapse in two hours' time at the very latest, &mdash; there are just not that number of speakers.  I know you normally rely on the Independent group to keep the speeches going, but most of the Independents have spoken on it already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been one of those pressing very regularly for the establishment of a foreign affairs committee of the Oireachtas.  The Leader of the House is aware of this.  There is just a simple aspect of what that committee should do which I want to bring to the attention of the House.  Given that power has shifted to such a huge extent since 1973 to European institutions, there are many times when I feel here much more as a county councillor than I do as a Member of a national Parliament.  If one is not on the committee dealing with secondary European legislation, which is reactive in dealing with existing legislation, there is no mechanism within the two Houses of Parliament here for any liaison between Members of the Oireachtas and European institutions.  I have been in touch recently with the Office of the European Communities to see if there are facilities from that source. There are virtually no facilities from that source either and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your tolerance. I am just simply saying it is imperative that this issue be raised so that responsible Members of the Oireachtas may occasionally get into the necessary dialogue in the areas of which they have speciality in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have found it easier to join with Senator Costello in his welcome to the students now absent had that distinguished order not chased out to Swords from North Great George's Street in full pursuit of the middle classes. However, I take his point that it is important that young people be brought into the democratic process.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the Order of Business under which Senator Manning has included on the Order Paper a motion concerning the enfranchisement of further University constituencies.  I was some what surprised at his remarks that I added my name without consultation.  I would like to take this opportunity to point out to the House that Senator Manning placed this on the Order Paper without consultation with me, and it is a matter that materially affects my constituents. I hope we will return to the normal courtesies in this matter.</P>
      <P>I would like also to ask the Leader of the House if he would be in position to give the House some information on the current state of play with regard to the Clinical Trials Bill, which is a matter of very considerable importance as its slow passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas is currently holding back access to DDI, a very important drug in the fight against AIDS, which is available at the moment in the United Kingdom, is available here through the voluntary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I just would like to finish that sentence, if I may, a Chathaoirligh, and that is to say that, if it is passed, it will become available to about 19 people who are currently endangered because of its lack of availability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind Senator Lanigan <Col N="414" /> that I am still very actively interested in Item No. 30 on the Supplementary Order Paper which is the European Court judgment.  I have discussed this with other people on this side of the House.  I will not be pushing it to a vote today.  I will not be seeking to amend the Order of Business because I believe in being constructive, and I understand the Leader of the House is bringing it to Government.  I look forward to an early answer from him with regard to the Government's response to the European judgement.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the House last week gave an undertaking, which I would like him to specify and make clearer today, with regard to Item No. 32.  There were very positive indications that this might be taken as an all-party motion.  I wonder if he will confirm that and give some indication of a date.</P>
    <P>With regard to Item No. 38 in my name and those of Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator Carmencita Hederman about Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, I would like to support what my distinguished colleague, Senator Murphy, has said with regard to the importance of this item, taking into account the McGimpsey judgment.  I believe Item No. 38 will have to be withdrawn and redrafted to read that a referendum should be held to abolish Articles 2 and 3 in the light of the McGimpsey judgment. I have now formally changed my view on this in the light of this very worrying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would also like to ask the Cathaoirleach if it would be possible to have the issues covered in Item No. 89 on the Order Paper relating to the lack of grants being provided for conversion to smokeless heating systems.  This is a particular concern of mine.  It is especially relevant in the Crumlin/Drimnagh areas of Dublin where very many people had made preparations to convert their homes on the assumption that grants would be provided and they now feel, arising from the Minister, Deputy Harney's statement this week, that the rug has been pulled from under them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say &mdash; and, like Senator Ó Foighil, I have more than a few words of English &mdash; Members of this House will be well advised to read a book that has recently been published about what the decline of the language represents in this <Col N="416" /> country.  It is an interesting essay by Joe Lee on our national psychology which deserves to be read by everybody in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  May I, and without making a speech, associate myself with the request to the Leader of the House for time to discuss the 18th suicide in six years in our prisons?  It seems to me that to discuss the abolition of capital punishment when we have 18 people who have committed suicide in our prisons is a little bit of a side issue. I support fully the abolition of capital punishment.  I wish we did not create prisons which effectively result in the death of shoplifters.  It is an appalling situation, a scandal, and we ought to have a serious discussion on it.</P>

In saying so, I think I should say to Senator Manning, when he refers to the two Senators as &ldquo;Senators from Trinity&rdquo;, that for an academic as distinguished as himself I might correct him.  We are not Senators from Trinity; we are Senators from Dublin University &mdash; a distinction which undoubtedly he will understand.</P>

      <P>The unruly element in this House is always very difficult to control. <Col N="417" /> Secondly, I think the Leader of the House missed answering my question last week about the death penalty which Senator O'Toole has already asked.  He simply did not answer the question last week.  I do not put this down to any particular sinister motive but I would ask him to answer in a more specific way.  Finally, it is possibly indicative of the rigid procedures of this House that we are this week discussing storm damage when the storms are over.  I welcome the fact that we are discussing it, but perhaps we should in an all-party non-partisan way introduce procedures which are not competely at the discretion of the Chair and which will allow this House to discuss matters such as storm damage which are very serious when they are happening.  I welcome the suggestion, for instance, that we should discuss the suicides in the prisons today. It is an urgent issue.  We should discuss Nicaragua today because it is also an urgent issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a question asked about agreement among the Whips.  The Whips meet every Thursday morning and agreement is reached on the business for the following week.  I must say I am surprised that questions about what happens at the Whips meetings continually come up here.  The agreements have been made.</P>
      <P>Questions were asked today about the Marine Institute Bill and it has suggested that this item might not last the length of time suggested by me &mdash; 2.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  There was agreement between the Whips that we would take this item between 2.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. and it was the Opposition Whips who asked for an extension of time.  We will take it until 6.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Senator Manning's point about Nicaragua, I think there should be a debate on that matter.  The Whips can have a discussion on it tomorrow morning. On the setting up of a committee on <Col N="419" /> the extension of the franchise to the other universities, I am not too sure how we will do that.  We can have a discussion at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this evening on the formation of that sub-committee.  I think that is the best way to go about it.  On Item No. 83 which was raised by a number of Senators, I would suggest that that, as a matter of urgency, there can be a request to the Cathaoirleach to allow a motion under Standing Order 29.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy asked about the Marine Institute Bill and it was suggested also that the debate might fall.  The Whips had agreed that there would be a need for the time we have allowed for that item today.  On the question of a statement on the developing situation in the north raised by Senator Murphy, that can be taken up tomorrow at the Whips meeting to find out the best way to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I do not understand what Senator O'Reilly means by &ldquo;enhance the reputation&rdquo;. If he wants a debate on health matters he can ask for it and we all see if that can be brought forward.  I will look at the matter of a debate on the health situation in consultation with the Whips and the Government to see how best we can deal with that.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked a question on the Clinical Trials Bill.  I will query the Government on that matter.  On Item No. 30, the European Court judgment, that matter is under active consideration and as soon as the Government are clear that it can be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas in the proper manner it will be brought forward; I think that will be at an early date.  The Senator also asked a question about the debate on the railways and so forth.  That is a matter for debate tomorrow morning at the Whips' meeting.  The matter of overflying Shannon Airport is not a matter I can discuss here.  It has nothing to do with me on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton also raised the matter of Item No. 83.  Again, I suggest that it could be dealt with by requesting permission to raise the matter under Standing Order 29.  On Item No. 89 which <Col N="420" /> concerns smokeless fuel and which was raised by Senator Costello, again that is a matter that can be raised by the Labour group as their own motion.  If they feel that is the most urgent item they have on the agenda.  They can bring it forward. Senator Ryan asked about Item No. 83 also and I give him the same answer.</P>
    <P>Senators Ross and O'Toole asked a question about abolition of the death penalty.  The Minister was in the House last week and he gave a reply on that in his speech on the Larceny Bill.  That is a matter that will be coming before the House in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said I gave a certain agreement in this House regarding a foreign policy committee.  I never gave any such commitment.  I never said it was under active consideration.  There is no question or doubt about that.  If I was asked a question about it, I gave a reply that it was a matter for the Government and that I would carry the wishes of the people who asked the question to the Government.</P>
    <P>A report on libel and the newspapers was mentioned by Senator O'Toole.  That is a matter that was raised originally by Senator Manning.  We can get agreement to have a debate on that particular report at any stage.  The Whips agreed the business for today.  It was agreed between them that we would have the debate on the Marine Institute Bill from 2.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>A question was raised by Senator Staunton in relation to the foreign affairs committee.  There was a motion before the House last week and also this week on the setting up of a foreign policy committee and I presume there will be a vote on that matter this evening.  The matter is under debate.  I cannot understand how people can stand up here asking for something that is on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that fully.  This is very important legislation because the whole issue of the rational exploitation <Col N="422" /> of the sea and the seabed and the resources of the sea generally will be even more important in the future than heretofore. They will account, as the Minister said, for an increasing share of the world economy.  As a small island nation, I suppose we stand indicted in the way we have treated our marine resources over the years.  The concept of a Roinn na Mara or a Department of the Marine promised a change in this regard, and in the lack of concentration on the marine resources.  We have waited in anticipation for the Marine Institute Bill we now have before us.  I agree with the principle of the Bill.  I have no difficulties with the general thrust of the Bill but there are certain areas where we would require some clarification from the Minister and answers to certain questions.</P>
      <P>The principal functions of the institute could not be argued with.  Section 4 clearly defines those as undertaking, co-ordinating, promoting and assisting in marine research and development and the provision of related services &mdash; aspirational but excellent.  The Minister could perhaps explain whether there will be any rationalisation of the bricks and mortar involved in marine research, or are we imposing an administrative structure over what is already in place in the different locations?  There is some confusion in the industry generally in relation to this.  We are not, I hope, talking about empire building in any sense nor creating another quango.  If, as I interpret the Bill to mean, we are talking about putting a co-ordinating administrative structure over the existing work that is taking place in this area in the diverse locations that now exist, I think that would be a very good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the making of charges for the provision of any services by the institute.  I fully support that.  As a nation we have accepted quite happily over the years the concept of paying for goods but the concept of paying charges of any kind, be they water charges, garbage collection charges or planning charges, or in this case Marine Institute charges, has never been accepted.  There is a net cost in providing any service and <Col N="423" /> I think the public or different institutions will have to accept the principle of paying for that today.  I fully support section 6 as outlined.</P>
    <P>I approve also of the appointment of a chief executive officer.  Of course, the person concerned will make or break the post as it were.  Again, on the assumption that my interpretation is correct, that we are not talking about amalgamating bricks and mortar only putting a superstructure in terms of co-ordination and development over the existing situation, I think the right man or woman in the right place here will make or break the Marine Institute.  Initially it will be even more important that you get the right person to head up the new Marine Institute so that it becomes firmly established as a very worthwhile research body in our country.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the transfer of designated staff to the Marine Institute from the Department of the Marine. Again, I presume this is a nominal transfer and it does not refer to any physical relocation of staff.  Maybe there is some physical relocation that I am not aware of; if there is, perhaps the Minister could indicate what he has in mind.  I am assuming it is not an entire relocation of the existing research facilities into one building but there could be some small relocation in certain areas, or rationalisation of research if there is duplication at the moment.  I think it is very important for this House and for the industry that the Minister spells out exactly what he has in mind by the expression &ldquo;the transfer of designated staff to the Marine Institute&rdquo; and whether there will be any physical relocation, even in a small way, of resources.</P>
    <P>I applaud section 17 &mdash; the provision of scholarships and other awards.  There is no better way to encourage the best and the brightest coming out of our universities and research institutions generally to get involved in marine research, than, if you like, to hold out a carrot there, to provide an incentive for them to spend some of the best years of their lives, when their initiative is at its best <Col N="424" /> and when academically they are at their hungriest and to direct them into this particular area.  I have called previously, and indeed in the other House, that we use this as a carrot.  Some time ago we were discussing the bovine TB legislation and the bovine disease levies issue generally. A couple of years ago when I was speaking on that, a point I made very strongly at the time as that as the present incumbents in the research positions in that area had grown old over 30 years in the various research positions and that it was time to use the carrot and the incentive of scholarships and awards to attract the best and the brightest into areas where we have difficulty or into areas where we need research.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the annual report.  It may not seem a big issue as we debate the whole concept of a Marine Institute but if we just look at the track record of the publishing of annual reports from other State and semi-State institutions, I plead with the Minister that an annual report should come within six to eight months at most in the year following, the year to which it is supposed to refer.  I will not go through them now but we have had them over the years where two and three years later we are getting reports out of date.  If annual reports are to mean anything, or if we are to learn anything from what is contained in an annual report, it must come shortly in the year preceding the year to which it refers.</P>
    <P>The Minister says no additional Exchequer cost will arise in the current year.  By additional I presume the Minister means additional to what is being provided.  The Minister goes on to say that a provision of £110,000 has been made for the Marine Institute in the Estimates for 1990.  I would be interested to know how the Minister envisages this money being spent this year.  It is unlikely that the legislation will be implemented before mid-summer.  The Bill is unlikely to be completed here in the next two or three weeks but then it goes to the Dáil and you are into the various Estimate debates and given the normal course of events, it is probably going to be June <Col N="425" /> before it sees the light of day as legislation. How does the Minister envisage the £110,000 being spent between then and the end of the year?  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on what will be involved in the headquarters in Galway?</P>
    <P>What exactly is envisaged to be in place in the headquarters in Galway?  Will we be just using existing facilities there or will there be any need for increasing space for administration or indeed any other function in the proposed headquarters? Is it there the £110,000 is intended to be spent or has the Minister some immediate research programmes that he intends to direct extra moneys towards in the current year?</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle of the Bill but I find the lack of detail on some of these issues I have mentioned and a few more I will mention, a little disconcerting. It would appear this is really only enabling legislation or the setting up of a framework into which subsequently Roinn na Mara will be able to slot different research programmes or different matters as they arise.  I would like assurances that there will be no waste of money in establishing an institute as such.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination and rational development of research programmes in the years ahead are obviously badly needed. Perhaps the Minister could explain to this House in his response to Second Stage what sort of procedures he envisages for the co-ordination of research?  What level of consultation will there be with the board and the CEO and the various research institutes that will still be located around the country once this institute has been established?  What size of an institute are we actually talking about?</P>
    <P>I presume that the staff of the fisheries research centre will still be in Abbotstown. They will be officially staff of the Marine Institute rather than Roinn na Mara but Abbotstown is effectively a new building.  It has only been built for 12, 15 or 16 years.  I take it there will be no change there?  I presume the UCC salmon research will continue where it is now located or is there a question of rationalisation?  What is the situation in relation to the Geological Survey Office? <Col N="426" /> There are only a couple of people involved in the Marine Geological Survey.  I hope the Minister does not intend separating marine geological survey from terrestrial geological survey as it were.  They should be kept together. I would be very interested in the Minister's views as to what is intended in those areas.</P>
    <P>What will the role of the Marine Institute be in relation to inland fisheries?  This is a most important area with marvellous potential.  The whole aquaculture area too, I presume, will come under the umbrella of the Marine Institute.  There have been environmental issues rearing their head in relation to the development of aquaculture.  Do I take it that all these issues and questions and any research that would be needed in this area will be handed over to the Marine Institute?</P>
    <P>Work under the Coast Protection Act and all that hangs around it has recently been moved from the Office of Public Works to the Department of the Marine. Would coastal erosion and a national coastal survey that is urgently needed become the responsibility of the Marine Institute or would that just stay as part of Roinn na Mara?  The urgency that is required in dealing with this area has been highlighted in the recent months of very inclement weather.  On the whole coastal erosion question, the funding of a national coastal survey, tidal research and currents etc. &mdash; will that be Marine Institute or will it be the Department of the Marine?  I would be very interested in getting the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of talk recently about the EPA &mdash; the Environmental Protection Agency, which the Government propose to enact.  The Minister of State, Deputy Harney, is on record as saying that the EPA will have control over estuarine waters.  The Minister's own words were, &ldquo;There is a strong need to clarify the relationships between the roles and responsibilities of the bodies already involved&rdquo;.  I suggest this is an area where there is more confusion being heaped as it is far from clear where the roles of the EPA and the Marine Institute we are now discussing will overlap.  Will <Col N="427" /> Wexford Harbour, which is an estuarine water, be the responsibility of the EPA or the Marine Institute?  We could go around the coast and take other examples as well.  One of the strongest reasons for supporting the legislation proposed here today is because it would co-ordinate and clearly define areas of responsibility in relation to marine research.  If, at the outset, almost in the same week as we are debating a new Marine Institute, we have the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, saying that the whole responsibility for estuarine waters is to be the baby of the Environmental Protection Agency, we are starting off on the wrong foot.  This is an area that needs a clear definition.  I request the Minister's response to that point.</P>
    <P>In 1979 and 1980 when the Minister for the Marine was negotiating in Brussels the quota levels for Ireland we appeared to have come off very badly as a country. We are a small nation surrounded by water with 25 per cent of the European fishing waters.  The abysmally small quota, the abysmally small slice of the cake we got from Brussels, that we will have to live with until the review that is promised us in 1992, shows that we are almost too late in forming this institute. We can muse to ourselves whether the situation might have been quite different if we were in a position, through a co-ordinated marine research policy generally, through a thorough knowledge of our sea resources and the seabed surrounding us, a thorough knowledge of the importance of the Continental Shelf to us as an island nation, to hold out for a larger slice of the quota cake when they were dividing up the various fish species among the nations and the quota they would be allowed to fish.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Marine Institute will be in a position to brief the Minister when it comes to the review of quota levels in a couple of years' time to insist that there is a total look at the allocation of the cake and that we get what should rightfully be ours as a nation with 25 per cent of the European fishing waters.  The appalling <Col N="428" /> quota allocated to this country for the different species was a major disappointment to the development of our fishery resources both on the sea and on shore because for every fisherman at sea there are five potential jobs on land.  We have the whole major difficulty of the restriction of the gross registered tonnage of our shipping fleet which follows directly from the present restrictive quotas.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are supposed to be cutting back our GRT by 16 per cent per annum.  It was 16 per cent for 1989.  I am not sure if we achieved that in terms of our registered tonnage.  Not only are we to cut it back, but licences for new fishing fleets, the ability to trade-up using more modern boats and more modern technology, has been removed from our fishermen generally because we would exceed our GRT and unless a boat is scrapped or sold out of State new licences cannot be issued.  The fact that the fishermen cannot trade-up and cannot match the modern technology of some of the other continental fleet means that we are being put at further disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Will the establishment of the Marine Institute strengthen the hand of the Minister for the Marine when it comes to renegotiating our quota levels is for the different species, and indeed increasing our GRT which effectively means an increase in the issuing of licences particularly for trading-up and keeping up with the size of boat and the technology that will be needed in the years to come to develop a viable, thriving fishing industry.</P>
    <P>We have all talked about the potential. The potential of our natural resources has become a sort of a catchphrase, a buzz word.  Our fishermen cannot develop their potential if they cannot trade up, if they cannot get new licences, if we cannot increase our GRT as a small maritime nation.  We must be able to hammer the table in Brussels in a couple of years time and say we demand 25 per cent of the Community quota as we have 25 per cent of the Community fishing waters.  Unless we go in with all guns blazing with the facts and the figures from research that has been established and properly co-ordinated, we are again <Col N="429" /> going to come out with one arm longer than the other, as the Minister of the day did in 1979-1980 when the levels were established.</P>

It was Deputy Daly, to put the record straight, who negotiated the terms.  They were fired out of office before anything was signed and sealed and it was the Coalition Minister for the Marine who went in and could do nothing but rubberstamp the terms that Deputy Daly had agreed to.  It is the normal procedure in Brussels, that if Governments come and go in the individual countries when we go over there we stand behind one another, rather than against one another, in terms of agreements, etc.  I had not intended to mention politics but the Members on the Government side have decided that politics must be brought into this most important legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth is that the terms were laid out and agreed by Minister Brendan Daly when he was the Minister at the time.  There are a couple of other areas whose relationship to a new Marine Institute remains far from clear at this stage and again, I would appreciate clarification from the Minister.  The International Council for the Exploration of the Seas I suppose is the main body in terms of assessing fish stocks in different areas and doing research and surveys into the levels of different species and from that we assess what quotas are available to be divided out between the different trawlers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister, how will ICES relate to the Marine Institute?  Will we have a mechanism through which we can bring <Col N="430" /> in the research, the surveys and the figures that the ICES trawlers are gathering on a full-time basis on the seas around our coasts?  They are a most important body because without knowing the levels of the different stocks at different stages, rational commercial exploitation of fish stocks is not possible.  We get into the area of over-fishing which is doing enormous long-term damage to the industry in respect of certain species.</P>
    <P>On the other hand perhaps we could be rationally exploiting other species that we are not exploiting at present.  Most importantly, perhaps, are what we call the non-quota species at present and these non-quota species are where we should be encouraging our fishermen and our trawlermen to be setting their sights. I mentioned our abysmally low quotas for the quota species but any encouragement we can give our fishermen and trawlermen to go after non-quota species will be in our interest if and when quotas are set for these very species, in the years ahead, as looks likely.  The relationship between ICES and their surveys of fish stocks that are available and the new Marine Institute needs to be spelled out by the Minister.  I would also like to know whether the research vessels that we have on our coast will become part of the Marine Institute or what their relationship will be to it.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned various areas and most of what I have said is by way of question or, indeed, rhetorical question. I support very strongly the principle of the legislation before us but the lack of detail is causing major concern in the industry generally.  Perhaps the Minister could spell out answers, please, with respect, to the various questions I have asked about the relationships between the various areas of research that now exist.  There is excellent research being done all around our coast and on inland fisheries at present &mdash; excellent research on aquaculture and shellfish generally on the western coastline, particularly in Galway and Carna.  There is excellent <Col N="431" /> research being done in UCC and Abbotstown at present with the ongoing geological survey.  We could all mention a great deal more.</P>
    <P>There was a time when I would be standing here requesting that the Marine Institute should be based in my own county of Wexford.  If it is not too late, I would ask the Minister to give it consideration even now.  We have a wonderful facility under-utilised in Johnstown Castle.  It was part of An Foras Talúntais; it is now part of Teagasc. There is excellent staff, excellent laboratory facilities, in the maritime county of Wexford.  I would appreciate very much if the Minister would consider the possibility of locating either the institute itself, or a major portion of the work that will be done under the aegis of the institute, in our county particularly having regard to the wonderful facilities available there and the expertise available in Johnstown Castle, County Wexford.</P>
    <P>Another area that concerns me is whether the formation of the institute involves the actual relocation of bricks and mortar and research personnel, or is it merely a matter of transferring people in name only from the Department of the Marine to the new Marine Institute, as I would hope it would be.</P>
    <P>Finally, could the Minister answer for me what the relationship will be between the soon to be formed or so we are told, Environmental Protection Agency and its control over estuarine waters as claimed by the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the new Marine Institute that is being set up to co-ordinate and rationalise development, research and resources in this area to avoid overlapping and duplication. It would appear there is an immediate over-lap and or duplication in this area at present between two new bodies that it is proposed to set up.</P>
    <P>I support the legislation before us today.  I sincerely hope it will be successful. We have enormous potential in this area as an island nation.  Proper exploitation of our sea and seabed and our Continental Shelf, the proper support <Col N="432" /> of our fishermen and the fish production and processing industries will be perhaps in the hands of the Marine Institute, if and when it will be set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who comes from a coastal part of a coastal county, the very scenic Hook Peninsula I can assure the Minister that I fully support this legislation and, while welcoming the Minister, I welcome it as well.  I live among the fishing community and the people whose sons' and daughters' first desire is to join the Naval Service, the lighthouse service or, indeed, to become fisherpeople.  I am involved from time to time in representations to various quarters.  It would be very beneficial for me and for anybody in a similar situation to be able to go to one body rather than to be sent from Department to Department which has been the case in the past.  For that reason alone I welcome the Bill and I would like to compliment the Government for introducing it.  It is something that should have happened long before now.</P>
      <P>It is great to see that all maritime interests will be located under one roof. I was interested in the Minister's statement at column 1234 of the Official Report of 13 December 1989 and I quote:</P>
      <P>Many of the problems currently affecting the development of our maritime economy and marine resources can be attributed to the absence of a clearly defined policy accompanied by a fragmentation of administrative structures.</P>
      <P>If anything has held back progress in the maritime industry, it was that very fragmentation. The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>We want to get the structures right so that the latent marine potential of the State can be fully realised in everyone's interest.</P>
      <P>It is my contention that there is tremendous potential in the sea if only we can develop it.  I am certain that this legislation will be the beginning of the road towards achieving that goal.  Later the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> In the case of Ireland, the marine area constitutes a major but underdeveloped natural resource and offers significant opportunities in terms of wealth and employment creation for a broad range of industries.</P>
    <P>As an island nation every aspect of our daily lives is in some way influenced by the sea that surrounds us, whether it be the effect of the sea on our climate or the distance from mainland export markets.</P>
    <P>This is the most important paragraph of the Minister's statement:</P>
    <P>Yet, as a nation we do not perceive ourselves as a maritime people and, worse, the sea continues to be regarded as a barrier to development rather than a natural resource to be utilised and devloped for the benefit of the nation.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with that.  The sea has enormous potential for job creation. If the institute gets off the ground and gets the support it deserves financially and otherwise, I think the Minister's figures are possibly understated.</P>
    <P>Fishing is the obvious conventional part of the maritime industry we are concerned with.  In order to develop the industry, the first essential is to have a proper fleet and suitable harbours.  This has been referred to by Senator Doyle. The harbours in County Wexford, at any rate, are certainly way below par.  For quite a while now it has been recommended that Kilmore Quay fishing harbour should be upgraded to major harbour status.  The size of the landings by Kilmore fishermen are greater than in the case of some harbours that have already got major harbour status.  The figures may be distorted by the fact that congestion in Kilmore means that some of the catch is landed at Rosslare, Duncannon, Dunmore, even as far afield as Howth.</P>
    <P>Kilmore Quay, as was announced during the recent storms, was very badly hit.  The position at present is that Wexford County Council are expected to put up half the cost of the improvement of Kilmore Quay.  We are talking in terms <Col N="434" /> of millions of pounds and I am sure the Minister, the Government and everyone else will know that county councils do not have that kind of money these days.  I would like to recommend to the Minister today that he would consider Kilmore being brought up to the level of major harbour status where the Government would fund, as it does the other harbours in that category, on a 100 per cent basis. Until that happens, I am afraid Kilmore will have to remain totally congested, with very little water and absolutely no shelter.  The absolute essentials for any successful harbour are deep water and shelter.</P>
    <P>There is another harbour that should be developed &mdash; Duncannon and I was delighted the Minister visited there recently.  As was pointed out to him on the day, Duncannon Port is just 100 metres from the main shipping line to Waterford and New Ross and coincidentally was one of the very few harbours that did not suffer as a result of the storms of the past ten weeks, which is a clear indication that it is well sheltered. Because it would be so easy and at relatively small cost to get water &mdash; it already has shelter &mdash; it is an area that should be considered for development.  I am asking the Minister today to state he has found it to be as we believe it to be, an area of great potential development.</P>
    <P>It was brought to my attention on Saturday last that one of the bigger trawlers using Duncannon was holed because of the rocks at the foundation.  This was pointed out to the Minister.  That boat, unfortunately, was damaged to the sum of £500,000 and will be laid up for three or four weeks.  This will mean a substantial loss to the trawler's skipper, his family and crew members.  I ask the Minister to take up the case of Duncannon immediately and to give it his support.</P>
    <P>As a final point on piers and harbours, if the industry is to progress there must be proper harbour facilities.  In the case of Duncannon the harbour was built in the last century and very little improvement has been carried out since.  That is an indictment of us and a clear indication <Col N="435" /> of our lack of interest in the fishing industry and in the resource that there is in the sea.  I hope as a result of the introduction of this Bill the whole scene will improve.</P>
    <P>Obviously, fish processing is an important part of the industry.  While great strides are being made in this area, it should be said that in other European countries the ratio of people working onshore to those fishing is as high as five to one, whereas in this country, I believe it is nearer to one to one.  We must try to improve that situation.  Whether it is that we have an inferiority complex or not I am not sure but undoubtedly there is something wrong when as Senator Doyle rightly said, we have 25 per cent of the sea and seem to be making very little use of it.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Doyle in relation to the quota situation. Yes, tables will have to be banged.  We will have to seek a proper level of quotas when decisions are being taken in future. When we entered the EC our fishing industry was used for bargaining.  That was a very bad mistake.  If the quota situation improves so, too, will the number of licences.  At long last, we are beginning to realise there is vast potential there.  The only way we can take advantage of it is to have our quotas increased and, indeed, to pay attention to the non-quota species that have been named here at other stages, such as tuna, argentines, scad or hore mackerel, sprat and all shellfish. We are inclined to be very conservative and to stay with the species for which there are quotas.  I have two suggestions: that we promote the nonquotas species and that we seek a vast increase in the non-quota species.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention boat building. It was brought to my attention very recently by a boatbuilder at Ballyhack, quite close to my home, that the number of boat building yards has decreased from 16 to five within the past ten years.  This is not acceptable, particularly in light of the fact that many of the trawlers now purchased by Irish fishermen are bought from abroad.  It is a further indictment of us that here we are creating jobs for <Col N="436" /> people in other countries while there is unemployment here.  The tremendous skills that were available in those boat building yards had to be seen to be believed.  I spent quite a time in Paddy Carroll's boatyard and I was most impressed.  He is one of five remaining boat builders.  He is under heavy pressure at present and I must say that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are not helping the situation by delaying the commissioning of certain trawlers.  I ask the Minister to take up this very issue with the board to ensure that at least the few Irish boat builders that are left will be given every opportunity, which they obviously have not been getting in the past.  If Paddy Carroll's yard &mdash; and it is only a small boatbuilding yard &mdash; goes to the wall, we will lose five very skilled people.  I was discussing this earlier on with Senator Fitzgerald who tells me that in his area there are about 26 people employed in a boat building yard.  It goes to show the amount of potential that is there if An Bord Iascaigh Mhara were to direct some of the work to Irish people whose skills are comparable with what is available in any part of Europe.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that shellfish production is undoubtedly progressing. There is a tremendous amount of research being carried out and it is fair to say that the greatest potential for development of our maritime resources lies in the shellfish industry.  I ask Senators to take note of the work done by the Leck family in County Wexford. They are world-renowned and they have succeeded in achieving markets in the USA and several countries far afield. They have proven what can be achieved by ability, initiative and good workmanship. As a country where conditions are suitable for the shellfish industry, we should take advantage of this and as the Minister said, we should exploit it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made on many occasions to the pollution of the seas that is caused by nuclear power stations in Britain.  I am anxious to know if the Maritime Institute will have any say in the levels of pollution allowed in the Irish Sea.  As a Parliament we have been <Col N="437" /> inclined to take the softly, softly approach to this matter.  It is raised here from time to time and also in the Dáil but that is the end of it.  We have got to consider this situation very seriously.  I hope the Maritime Institute would have some power to deal with this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>You could start at home with Minister Bobby Molloy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave that to the Senator.  I am inclined to agree with the Senator that we are taking the softly, softly approach and that we have to adopt a tougher attitude than that adopted in the past.  Pollution is on the increase but very little attention, if any, has been paid to it and little noise has been made about it, either here or at EC level.  Pollution of our seas will damage the fishing industry and we must ensure that the Maritime Institute take a very serious interest in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads me to submarine activity. A few years ago this was regarded as humorous rather than serious but over the past eight years 50 people have lost their lives as a result of continuous submarine activity in the Irish Sea.  There is as much submarine activity there as there is vehicular activity in O'Connell Street. It seems the Russians, Germans, English, Americans and the French are playing war games there continuously.  When that creates a situation where our fishermen are at risk it is time for us to sit up and take note and not to accept the weak excuse given to us by the British Ministry for Defence, that it is essential that they operate in the Irish Sea.  War games should be played elsewhere than in seas that are known to be fishing areas.  It seems, if a British submarine travels down the Irish Sea that must be followed by Americans, followed by Russians, Germans and French.  Close to the Wexford coast six years ago we had the situation where ten French fishermen lost their lives.  That puts the matter in perspective. That is how close we are to losing some of our people.  On many occasions there has been a serious loss of equipment. I am sure Senator Daly knows that an <Col N="438" /> American submarine surfaced in the middle of the Kilmore fishing fleet and, as a result, the Kilmore fishermen changed from wire ropes to nylon ropes in the hope that if they became entangled the ropes would break and that no lives would be lost.  That is not acceptable in this day and age.</P>
    <P>There is a very active group called the Celtic League on the Isle of Man who keep a close watch on all submarine activity in the Irish Sea and their information is that the incidents are on the increase.  We have raised the matter here and at EC level but every little has been done.  I appeal to the Minister to see to it that all submarine activity ceases in the seas used by our fisherman.  I ask him to insist with the British Ministry for Defence that if they must carry out these games &mdash; I am sure it is essential for them &mdash; they would take themselves elsewhere. Surely, this country which is neutral, should have some control and some say with regard to what happens in our own waters?  It has been said to me that we only control waters three miles out. If our people are using the Irish Sea it behoves us to ensure that as far as possible that sea is a protected area.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle spoke about coastal erosion. I would like to join with her in asking the Minister to make coastal erosion a national problem rather than a problem to be dealt with by local authorities, which has been the case up to now.  We have had so many problems during the recent storms with coastal erosion that it will be imposible for Wexford County Council to make any impact. Acres of land have been lost to the sea in the recent storms at Rosslare, Courtown and Cullenstown and right around the 177 miles of coastline.  This will have to become a national charge rather than a charge on local authorities if we are serious about dealing with the problem. Somebody said rather facetiously recently that we do not have any coastline left in Wexford; it has all been washed away.  Considering the damage to property, land, houses, hotels and so on, it has to become a national charge.  The EC would look favourably on providing <Col N="439" /> funding in the case of coastal erosion if a very strong case were made but it is my understanding that to date no case has been made to Europe for funding for coastal erosion.  I am asking the Minister to see to it that such a proposal is made to Europe.</P>
    <P>We are in a difficult situation in the Rathangan area of south Wexford where 7,000 acres of land had been protected by a sea wall which was breached during the storm.  But for the quick work of the Office of Public Works, whose people were out at midnight, the situation would have been worse.  People do not realise that there is a polder in this country, as there are many in Holland, that there are 7,000 acres of land under sea level protected by a sea wall at Rathangan.  As a result of the storms, that wall has been damaged, undermined and weakened and before next winter the Minister, as the person responsible for the institute, should see to it that it is strengthened so that it will not be breached in future.  We are talking about livelihoods and lives in that instance.</P>
    <P>I would like to move on to the lighthouse service.  I live under the shadow of the Hook lighthouse, the oldest in Europe.  I understand now it is intended to take the manpower from that lighthouse and to operate it electrically without anyone being present.  It is absolutely essential in coastal areas to have a continuous coastal watch.  On Saturday evening last, a young man who set out from Waterford in a yacht was unfortunately lost.  It was reported by the lighthouse keepers he did not round the Hook lighthouse.  Had those lighthouse keepers not been there, I am sure the Naval Service and the rescue services would have been looking for him anywhere from Waterford to Rosslare since he was on his way to Dublin.  The Hook lighthouse people did not see him pass round Hook Point and, therefore, they were able to concentrate on an area between Waterford and the Hook.  Our rescue services are small enough at present without stretching them way beyond the limit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> I ask the Minister to ensure in the interests of the people who use the coast, not only fishermen, but the many people who use the coast for pleasure or otherwise, that there be a permanent coast watch, as there is on the coast of Britain and in all other European coastal countries.  It is accepted that lighthouses should be operated by electricity but they must also be manned.  There must be some service there to replace the one that obviously now will be removed.</P>
    <P>The rescue service is totally inadequate. I would like to compliment the lifeboat people and the many people around the coast who, if there is ever a problem, are prepared to drop what they are doing in an effort to prevent loss of life.  The lifeboat service is a tremendous service, one with many courageous and unselfish people.  Their efforts should be complemented by improved rescue services.</P>
    <P>In the Hook people are lost every year. I know they are seeking to have a helicopter service on the west coast.  That should be considered for the south and south-east coast also.  Many lives might have been saved if the service was adequate.</P>
    <P>I was very disturbed to hear over the weekend that when a fisherman friend of mine telephoned the Meteorological Service asking for a weather forecast &mdash; it was obvious in light of the storms we have had for the past ten weeks that that might be expected &mdash; he was told: &ldquo;no forecast unless you pay&rdquo;.  This was on a Saturday so I do not know when the money would be expected to arrive.  That sort of attitude is small-minded.  This institute and the Minister's Department should immediately take this up.  In the light of the storms we have had for the past ten weeks, the damage, the loss of property and the loss of life, the Minister should see that the forecasting service is free to all people at all times.  I am certain that no fisherman would ring up the Meteorological Service for fun.  He would only ring up if he felt it were necessary. I see no reason whatsoever to charge.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat what I said at the beginning.  I welcome the Bill.  There <Col N="441" /> is tremendous potential with our maritime resources, I sincerely hope this is the first step towards achieving that potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome both the Minister and this Bill.  I have a few comments to make on this very important subject.  In confronting the Bill, the first thing that came into my mind was a song by the late and much lamented Dominic Behan:</P>
      <P>The sea, oh the sea, is grá geal mo chroí.</P>
      <P>Long may it roll between England and me.</P>
      <P>It's a sure guarantee that some day we'll be free,</P>
      <P>Thank God we're surrounded by water.</P>
      <P>I might not share quite the xenophobic point of view of the author, although it is charmingly expressed, but indicates that we understand the significance and the importance of the fact that we are now shortly to be the only island state in the European Community.  I say this because the neighbouring island will be linked directly to the mainland of Europe by the Channel Tunnel in the foreseeable future.  The first given fact that we have is the vital importance of our island status, the fact that we are surrounded by sea and that this is one of our great and very largely ignored national resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is an excellent idea, as presented to the House in three forms, the Bill itself, the explanatory memorandum and the Minister's speech. There are certain areas of vagueness, which may perhaps be necessary, but I wonder if it will be possible for the Minister to clarify some of them for the House.  For example, in particular I take it that the Marine Institute is intended to become some kind of overall governing body co-ordinating research and so on. This is no doubt good and valuable intellectual discipline.  I would like to ask precisely how it is envisaged that the marine departments of the various universities will fit into this Bill.  I would like to ask how the Naval Services will fit into this <Col N="442" /> Bill.  It does not seem that either of these aspects have been tackled head on by the legislation, by what the Minister has said or indeed by the explanatory memorandum. Perhaps we could have some additional information on that.</P>
    <P>I would like also to ask if the Minister could be a little bit more particular with regard to the budget because a large section of the Bill is technical governing the financing of this proposed institute.  It is all fairly run-of-the-mill statutory stuff containing phrases such as: &ldquo;the funds of the institute may be used for the payments of expenses incurred by easing the performance of its functions&rdquo;.  One would expect no less.  That is almost tautological to the concept of the existence of the institute in any case.  I wonder if the Minsiter has any notion of the kind of budget he envisages.  Does he envisage any limitation? In other words, what is the expense to the State likely to be?  I say this not in any parsimonious fashion because I greatly welcome this endorsement of the importance of the practical realities of research by a Government whom I have frequently taken to task, not later indeed than last week for cutbacks in the research area.  At the same time, in view of the Government's attitude towards finance in this area, it would be interesting and valuable to be given some indication with regard to the sort of budget because, frankly if a decent budget is not produced, if no money of any real size is forthcoming, then they simply will not be able to do the work that we are all expecting of them.  I would like now to list a couple of the areas, some of which may have been touched on by other speakers where I think this money would be very well spent.</P>
    <P>I was surprised and very pleased to see in the Minister's speech that he spoke of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention and the possibility of extending our territorial claim over the Continental Shelf because, as he will know, this is a rather contentious area.  He said:</P>
    <P>The limits of the Irish Continental Shelf will require to be delineated.  The definition of the Irish Shelf area will <Col N="443" /> require a major investment, both in terms of shiptime and scientific effort.</P>
    <P>Already there are numbers of conflicting claimants for vast tracts of the Shelf which experts consider should rightly belong to Ireland...</P>
    <P>I and other Members of this House are aware of this.  Shortly before Christmas a very important, though sparsely attended, lecture was given by somebody whom I gather it would be invidious for me to name but his services as a lawyer were formerly engaged by the Department of Foreign Affairs in precisely this area.  He gave a very illuminating lecture on the ten, 15, 20 year process of negotiations that have been going on and the different concepts, the different methods of measuring what our Continental Shelf should be, some of which are totally legal, the notion of equi-distance from the coastal line, the notion of ancestal rights, various legal concepts and so on.  I am very glad indeed that the Minister is acknowledging very clearly in a long detailed paragraph here the importance and relevance of this new proposed Marine Institute in determining and establishing certain scientific facts upon which may rest some of our claim to the resources of the sea.  This is an area in which the world of politics, the law and scientific investigation merge.  It is very important and I welcome very much that the Minister should have drawn attention to this.</P>
    <P>Why is it so important?  It would not be important at all if it was only a territorial claim, if it was only a question of drawing a nice little boundary around Ireland and saying: &ldquo;We are king of this particular maritime castle&rdquo;.  It is important because of the resources of the sea.  It is important because we must understand how to manage those resources.  It has been said by Senator Doyle that we have got to monitor the catches, we have to monitor the kind of fish that are the targets of our fishing fleet.  I would also say we have got to monitor the size of the trawlers.  The Minister I am sure is well aware of the <Col N="444" /> fact, as I am, as an ordinary layperson in this matter, that there has been a very considerable alteration in the last 10 to 20 years in the nature of the construction of the fishing fleet, the trawlers, their constant expansion in size.  We are moving towards factory fishing.  We already have the Russian factory ships off our coast, perhaps out of our territorial waters.  Here again, there is tangential situation, the improvement of the resources of the Navy so that we can adequately police the area surrounding this coastline.</P>
    <P>There is no question of doubt that the resources that surround this island are in considerable danger of being drastically diminished and being fished out by unwise exploitation of our resources.  I remind the House, as I am sure the Minister does not need to be reminded, that we are in a quota situation and because of the fact that we are in the European Community a number of nations who, through their own folly, have exhausted their own stocks of fish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like to add my voice to those who feel in this Chamber that we have a moral duty to discuss this very important matter.

    <Title>Marine Institute Bill, 1989: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the kind of operation this Marine Institute could be involved in and, in particular, the question of trawler size.  This also means the Marine Institute ought to look at the kind of ships we should build, the kind of machinery we use, the kind of companies we have for developing and building ships.  We should be involved in the whole question of pollution research. Perhaps the Minister would consider <Col N="447" /> some degree of direction not, of course, dictation, a little application perhaps to this new Marine Institute.  They should consider a hobby horse of mine, that is, the fact that, as human beings, we are among the single greatest force in terms of impact on the marine environment.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be unwittingly repellant to anybody in the House, but it is a fact that an enormous tonnage of human sewage is deposited in the sea around our shores by an antiquated sewage disposal system.  This is very largely still what is termed raw sewage.  I am sure it has not escaped the Minister's notice that our neighbouring island has given a commitment to phase out putting raw sewage into the seas over a ten year period.  I wonder if we will make any parallel commitment?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister suggest to the Marine Institute that they investigate the possibility that there is a very convenient coincidence of location in this city of Dublin between one of the principal sewage outfall works and the electricity generating station.  Would the Minister not agree with me that it would be far better if we were to collect this resource at that point at Ringsend and treat it as other countries do so that it may be reclaimed as energy in terms of the various gases for heating and the solids retained for fertiliser purposes. This is done in other countries.  It would mean that we would not only clean up our seas, make our bathing places far more attractive and less dangerous to the many families who enjoy the facilities of our beaches through the summer months and would also provide a resource in terms of heating.  I acknowledge this would require an investment.  Here, again, the Marine Institute could intervene. One of the things they could do, in co-operation with universities, might be to construct a mathematical model of the economic impact which I believe as a layman would demonstate that such a programme would have an economic value for the country over a ten year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal reasons I welcome the establishment of the Marine Institute <Col N="448" /> is because it may place this kind of area of concern outside the realm of immediate party politics.  What I am suggesting only really allows its benefits to come onstream over an extended period.  I do not wish to be cynical but it is noticeable, as an Independent politician and as an observer of the political scene over many years, that most political parties are only interested in something that produces dividends within about three years so that they can collect on their investment and draw the attention of the voting public to this in the run-up to an election.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, a myriad of resources in the sea not just the fish. Again, I worry when I see in fishmonger shops such strange fish on the slab because it tells me that very often they must be going into areas where they never went before.  They are obviously not producing what they think the consumer requires so they must be hoovering up species that were never touched before by the ever-extending range of their trawlers</P>
    <P>It is not just fish, it is also mineral resources.  There are ordinary everyday minerals that are immensely valuable to any economy, such as sand and gravel.  I presume that the institute will look at this, will determine where these resources lie, where they can be most easily extracted, where it is most financially viable to extract them and also look at the other range of sometimes rare minerals and minerals such as molybdinum that may exist in the seabed surrounding this country.  I am old enough, even if the Minister may not be, to remember 15 or 20 years ago when the late Howard Hughes was sending his glomar explorer round this neck of the woods.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that Howard Hughes was a pretty canny animal and if the glomar explorer was out vacuming specimens of the shores of this island there is a pretty good possibility that there is something there, of which Mr. Hughes, with his notorious nose for profitability, had some suspicion.  I would like, as a good socialist &mdash; I know socialism is not popular these days but it will be back &mdash; to feel that these resources <Col N="449" /> would not be exploited on behalf of all the people of Ireland.  It is also important that this institute gives advice as to how any such exploration and retrieval of minerals &mdash; of course the obvious ones are oil and gas &mdash; can be done with the minimum damage to the sources we have in terms of animal and marine life.</P>
    <P>There are one or two further comments I wish to make, if I may, about particular features such as the whole question of acquaculture.  This is very important.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly said this is an area where we can make significant economic progress, that will pay dividends not just in terms of money but also in terms of jobs, I agree wholeheartedly with him. This time last year I was lecturing in Yale University and my host was a graduate from Trinity College, who is on the staff in Yale.  He had invested in the north western corner of this island, partly out of scientific curiosity and partly out of patriotism, in a small aquaculture programme. It is, in fact, now giving some reasonable return in terms of employment and of profitability for the area.  I believe it is very important that these kinds of ventures are supported with the resources of the State.</P>
    <P>Of course we have got to watch the impact of these things.  There has recently been some controversy about precisely the impact of fish farming in the kind of open sea containers and the difficulties of introducing particular strains of fish which may be subject to specialised forms of disease.  I am not competent to talk about this but I presume the Minister will be suggesting to the institute that they look into this possibility.</P>
    <P>I hope that the food aspect in its commercial sense, in terms of exporting, will be looked at, I would like again to place on the record some small experience of my own, when I was for a brief and inglorious period a restaurant correspondent of a Sunday newspaper in this city.  I had occasion to go to a very fine restaurant in the centre of the city when I commented particularly on soused herrings. This may sound a very humble item but I discussed it with the owner of the <Col N="450" /> restaurant.  He told me a tale of disappointment and frustration; a year prior to my visit a Japanese businessman had come into the restaurant, had eaten the soused herrings and said, like myself, they were the most delicious things he had ever eaten.  He arranged to have these Irish soused herrings imported into Japan but the Japanese have extremely strict regulations with regard to the method by which it is done.  This man very meticulously established precisely what the Japanese wanted but the factory he engaged to assist him took a short cut and was discovered at the other end and the entire contract was aborted.  Investment was wasted, the opportunity was destroyed and &mdash; probably the most important thing &mdash; the reputation of every other person involved in this area from this part of Europe was threatened and the possibility of this export industry being developed was marginalised.  That is very unfortunate.  I presume it will be one of the responsibilities of the institute to look at this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>Most people now accept the fact that we live in a global village, that we are all interdependent and that we should not be just selfishly interested in our own resources, our own fate.  The Minister, I am sure, will have noticed the fact that a very rare species of turtle &mdash; rare, at least for this part of the world &mdash; was washed up recently on our shores and was revived and painstakingly returned to its home waters off Mexico.  In Mexico the turtle is already under threat of extinction because it is being hacked to death, butchered in masses by the peasants of the coastal villages of certain sections of Mexico because of the appetite of the Japanese fashion industry for handbags, shoes and other accessories made from the skin of this gentle and inoffensive animal.  I hope this institute will enable Irish representatives and international oceanographic conferences to make a plea for some degree of concern, of interest, for the welfare of species other than man.  This gross and disgusting exploitation by cruelty and greed of fellow-creatures on this planet is a very bad sign for the values we have in this society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> I would like to make a final point.  I started out by welcoming the Bill but saying that there was some areas of vagueness.  I would like to end by saying that one of the areas of vagueness was delicately hinted upon by many of the speakers here this afternoon who had some special interest in the question of the location of the institute.  A number of people felt it would be most appropriately located in their particular area.  This is a judgment of Solomon.  I do not envy the Minister.  But I would like to say this, and demonstrate my altruism in so doing, that I believe this presents a golden opportunity for the Minister to demonstrate the Government's commitment to a policy of decentralisation.  There are already quite enough institutes and academic resources and industrial plants in this capital city of ours.  I believe it is time some of these important areas of our civil life were moved to other parts of the country.  If the Minister can give an undertaking that this will be located in an area of our coast which is not Dublin, I certainly will not cavil at his decision from a parochial point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> First, I would like to express my thanks to the Senators who have spoken in this debate for their very important contributions.  I have listened with great interest to the very worthwhile contributions made by the Members and I want to say in all sincerity that the contributions which have been made will be considered both by myself and my staff in the Department of the Marine and will be taken into consideration very carefully in formulating of the institute and its establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind Senators of my opening remarks regarding the purpose and the main elements of this Bill, the Marine Institute Bill.  The Bill enables me to establish the Marine Institute.  In so doing it aims to address the necessity &mdash; and I think the important necessity in a maritime nation like ours &mdash; for the development of marine resources. <Col N="452" /> Listening to the contributions of the Senators, that was the underlying point in all their contributions.</P>
    <P>I agree totally that the marine area, as outlined by many Senators here constitutes a major but underdeveloped natural resource.  It offers a significant opportunity &mdash; indeed, many opportunities &mdash; in terms of wealth and employment creation for a broad range of our industries.  I am of the opinion that we cannot capitalise on these opportunities until we can measure the resources, understand how they behave and devise the most effective methods for their exploitation.  I feel this Bill will fill the gaps in our knowledge in this regard.  It will provide the very important vehicle, which is indeed so long overdue, for the development of marine resources across a very wide range of sectors.  It is my earnest hope and wish that the Marine Institute will play a leading role in the development of marine industries in Ireland.  I believe the institute will be an essential element in the development of these industries.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening address &mdash; and it was reiterated by many of the Senators here &mdash; a wide range of organisations are now involved in marine research in this country.  The Marine Institute will at long last co-ordinate the work of these organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you list them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I will be referring to some, of them later, not all of them.  This co-ordination, I feel, will eliminate both the gaps and overlaps which currently exist between Government Departments and other agencies operating both within and outside the marine area.  It will ensure the rational development of this important resource.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the institute will lead to a major improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the marine research undertaken within the State.  As is outlined in section 4 of the Bill its functions will be &ldquo;to undertake, to co-ordinate, to promote and to assist in marine research and development and to <Col N="453" /> provide such services related to marine research and development, that in the opinion of the Institute will promote economic development and create employment&rdquo;.  Following the establishment of the Marine Institute, persons currently involved in marine research in State-funded organisations may be transferred by agreement from their parent Departments to the Department of the Marine and then to the institute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I will come to that in a moment.  I will be referring to the points the Senator raised.</P>
      <P>Transfers will be effected in consultation with all parties concerned.  It is important also that all funding which was previously allocated to marine-related research should continue to be so allocated following the establishment of the Marine Institute because the priority attaching to marine research is now generally agreed.  It would be my aim that the funding allocated to the Marine Institute, both from the Exchequer and EC sources, would increase in future.  I would like to refer here to a point raised by Senator Norris that the budget for the institute will be adequate to meet its needs.</P>
      <P>Some of the points raised by Senators are relevant and I would like to comment on some of them at this stage.  A number of Senators have complained that the establishment of the Marine Institute as provided for in this bill is too little, too late.  I cannot accept this.  Work on the preparation of this Bill has been ongoing for a long time &mdash; indeed, by my predecessor &mdash; in order to ensure that the Bill provides for all the issues which must be part of the Marine Institute.  I am satisfied with the work and that the time taken has now produced a Bill, indeed a blueprint for the institute, of which I feel we can all be proud.  It certainly will satisfy all of our needs in the area of marine research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the point &mdash; and it was raised also by Senator Doyle &mdash; that the work of agencies such as BIM, <Col N="454" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta and the universities is not recognised in the Bill. I would like to draw your attention to sections 4 and 17 of the Bill where these matters are dealt with.  I am also well aware, I would like to assure Senators, of the contributions made by the various agencies to marine research in Ireland.  It is my intention that the contribution of these agencies will continue, and indeed should continue.  The Marine Institute will harness the expertise of these agencies in its work in the future.</P>
    <P>I would like also to refer Senator Doyle to the fact that it will not be a bricks and mortar outfit.  Rather it will be a rationalisation, or a co-ordination, of existing structures because, given the nature of marine research, it will be necessary to continue this research in many diverse areas and locations around the country and the coast.  Therefore, it is not intended to be a physical relocation of staff.  I am confident this would not be in the best interests of the institute.</P>
    <P>I have noted the points raised by Senator Doyle, Senator Byrne and Senator Norris in regard to the location of the institute.  I want to say that it will be located in a place outside Dublin, keeping in mind the Government's contribution to decentralisation.  The question of the £110,000 of additional funds was also raised.  This will be required for additional very urgent research into marine areas this year rather than for a headquarters.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to section 1 of the Bill.  This was raised by many Senators.  I want to refer particularly to the definition of &ldquo;marine&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;marine&rdquo; means of, in, near, concerned with or belonging to the sea and tidal waters, inhabiting, found or got from the sea or from non-tidal waters...</P>
    <P>Further on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;research and development&rdquo; includes research into all pure and applied sciences, including economics and social sciences, investigations, tests, experiments, analyses and other <Col N="455" /> studies and the application of science and technology to innovation and development.</P>
    <P>That, I feel, covers the points raised by Senator Doyle and others with regard to the definition of &ldquo;marine&rdquo;.  There are at present &mdash; and I will let the Senator have this information later &mdash; 11 State-funded organisations with a staff of about 250 persons currently involved in marine research.  All of these will be involved either directly of indirectly with the work of the institute.  I will be in a position to let the Senator have a list of those later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Many points were raised by other Senators which are not really relevant to the Bill &mdash; for instance, the question of pollution of the Irish Sea.  The Department have an interest in it but not a fundamental one.  They have an interest with regard to dumping at sea and where licences are issued.  It is partially relevant to the Bill. The question of coastal protection and erosion has only been taken over by my Department since 1 January.</P>
      <P>I agree with those Senators who pointed out the importance of the composition of the board &mdash; this was outlined very positively and significantly two weeks ago when this Bill was before this House &mdash; of the institute and it was stated by me that it would have a major bearing on the success of the work of the institute. It is for this reason that the members of the board shall be appointed by virtue of their experience and their expertise in the field of marine research which will be very relevant to the functions of the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators also referred to the importance of the collection, maintenance and dissemination of information on marine research.  I agree this is most important and to ensure that this will happen I have included section 4 (2) (e) of the Bill which provides that the Marine <Col N="456" /> Institute shall have the function to collect, maintain and disseminate information relating to marine matters.</P>
    <P>The other significant areas which were raised by Senators, such as acquaculture, fish processing, exploratory fishing, vessel design, oceanography, environmental matters, coastal zone research, coastal erosion, seaweed research, leisure activities, will all be considered by the board of the institute when setting its programme of work.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to thank the Senators for their very positive and worth while contributons.  They will be considered carefully by myself and my staff in the Department of the Marine. Once again, I would like to commend the Bill highly to the House.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business today I raised the possibility of other business being taken this afternoon because I predicted that the debate on the Marine Institute Bill would not last for the full afternoon.  I was told by the Leader of the House that this was not possible.  He also said that it was the Opposition Whips who asked for an extension of time on the Marine Institute Bill.  I have since discovered, having spoken to the Whips, that this was not the case.  The Leader of the House, I am sure unwittingly, misrepresented the position of the Whips this afternoon.  I would like to offer him the earliest opportunity to put the record straight on this matter.  I will leave the matter rest until perhaps tomorrow morning but I want to put the record straight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having spoken last week about attitudes to ODA, to foreign policy and related issues, I want to use the last five minutes of my address to look at one small country where development was achieved, where progress was reported, where prosperity had begun to reach ordinary people in terms of both economic well-being, of their educational achievements and their health services.  I refer, of course, to Nicaragua and to the extraordinary achievements of that country in the first three years after its triumphant revolution against dictatorship. Infant mortality dropped dramatically, illiteracy of the adult population dropped from 53 per cent to 17 per cent and agricultural production grew dramatically.  Indeed <i>per capita</i> GNP grew faster in Nicaragua than in any other Central American country in those early years after the Revolution.  It was a welcome, courageous, outstanding development of the kind that one would think would be welcomed but what happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government of the United States of America, with the passive compliance of virtually every western country, turned the full ferocity of their hatred on that country's achievement.  In the name of freedom they murdered, bombed, brutalised and economically assassinated <Col N="461" /> that country and for almost ten years the people of that country resisted.  Having brutalised and having bombed and having terrorised, they then proceeded to give them a lecture about democracy.  Apparently they could not believe that justice was possible in a poor country.  They could not believe that economic dignity was possible in a poor country and, above all, it appears they could not accept that actual development was really possible.</P>
    <P>Given the size of Nicaragua, given its political and indeed its military insignificance, the only assumption one can draw is that it was just in Nicaragua, it was democracy in Nicaragua, that presented a threat; the threat of good example, presumably, the image of achievement, of progress and of freedom, and what that could do in Guatamala, in Honduras, in El Salvador and in Mexico.  What we saw then was that assault on democracy by the so-called democracies.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate compliance in that policy of a number of Irish Governments dominated by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael makes a mockery of this motion.  It is obviously not possible to oppose this motion but it would be much easier to support it if we could see clear evidence of Fine Gael's commitment to development in the attitude of their then Minister for Foreign Affairs to these issues.  If he had said a simple thing like saying that to murder Nicaraguan peasants to achieve political change is murder, is wrong and disgraces western Governments, if he, or indeed his succesor, had been prepared to say that those things were true, we could then talk about development.  To say that any political leader who supports that is guilty of terrorism and guilty of murder himself is to me self-evident.  It was particularly unfortunate, therefore, that Members of this House gave a standing ovation to the man who initiated that policy of international terrorism against Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>I conclude by paying tribute to the FSLN in Nicaragua.  I want to say it in their own words:<i>&ldquo;toda fue mejor&rdquo;, &ldquo;y toda sera mejor&rdquo;</i>.  Venceremos!</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to be in a position to speak on this motion.  Even though I do not necessarily concur with the full wording of the motion, I have great respect for some of the sentiments expressed in the debate in the House so far.  I first have to commend the work and the attitude to various matters of our Minister of State, Deputy Seán Calleary at all times.  This is acknowledged both at home and abroad.  He is the man responsible for putting forward Ireland's view on many matters and I must congratulate him on the way he has done this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in 1988 provided something in the region of £32.4 million in aid.  This is a very large sum if one considers that at that time, and indeed since then, they have had to deal with severe problems and have had to implement severe measures at home to save the country from possible bankruptcy. All those things had to take their place but the Government in that time provided that amount of money.  They have to be respected and indeed congratulated for it.  Ireland has a proud record in the provision of finance and personnel to developing countries and Third World countries.  We must all be pleased with the Irish development projects in Third World areas.  In particular, we must be pleased with the practical methods and designs that have been used in Irish-assisted projects.  We must be conscious that these projects at the end of the day help the developing countries to reach their own potential in vital areas such as health, education and agriculture. Every one in this country is conscious of the Irish people's great involvement in overseas development.  There are very few villages, parishes, areas or regions where people have not seen one or more priests, nuns or brothers leave our shores and go out to work on our behalf in Third World and developing countries.  We as a nation are not so far down the road from poverty.  I am not a very old man but I remember the arrival of rural electrification in the region from which I came.  We have only had pipe water in recent times.  Indeed there are still areas <Col N="463" /> that do not have piped water.  Tarred roads are everywhere at this stage but I still remember some roads that were not tarred.  We are not that far down the road from poverty and indeed oppression and every Irish man and woman is conscious of the link between the two.</P>
    <P>Indeed, people in other countries have taken note and followed in the footsteps of Irish people who have done what we would consider to be great things.  A typical example would be Nehru in India. He definitely followed in the footsteps of Eamon de Valera.  He took on board his views, his principles, his whole philosophy. The Irish in America have played a major part in the develpment of that country and if we look at the Declaration of Independence we can see the Irish involvement.  We have GOAL, CONCERN, GORTA and Trócaire.  All these bodies are doing massive work on behalf of the Irish people.  We just cannot take overseas aid on the basis of GNP.  These statistics are important, they are what will show in history, but there are very few of us who would consider that to be the input of the Irish people or the Irish nation in human terms.  The semi-State bodies such as the ESB are playing a major role.  They are involved in projects throughout the developing world.  Their contribution has to be taken into consideration. Ireland itself is playing a major role at EC and UN level.  I am always glad to hear the statements of our Minister and our other representatives at those meetings.  There we are playing a major part but we can play a part regarding overproduction and the distribution of food subsidies and I hope that at some stage the European Community will consider such a proposal.  That is an area where overseas aid to the Third World can be tackled.</P>
    <P>The other area that we as a nation should look at is third level students. Ireland plays a minor role in this area and that is a pity.  That is an area that could be expanded.  Maybe some of our third level institutions have cut back on the subsidies that used to be given in that <Col N="464" /> area.  Indeed, some of them may be subsidising their institutions at this stage with the involvement of third level students. The reverse should be the case.  We should have an opportunity of taking students for Third World countries into education here.  They can bring back the knowledge, expertise and indeed understanding of what is necessary to develop their own regions and their own countries. We have a fine educational system here.  We have a lot of the ethos and beliefs that are in those Third World countries due to the involvement of our missionaries abroad.  I think we would be talking to the converted and those people who go back could be a great advantage to their own nations.</P>
    <P>I believe Ireland is playing a major part in overseas development.  It is providing £32 million odd.  That is a big figure. Everybody would like if we were in a position to give more but we all have to be conscious of our own situation up to now.  I have no doubt that the Government agonised, and everybody agonises when we have cut back on any development. We had to cut back on hospitals, health, and education in our own nation. They were not easy decisions.  In all cases the decisions were taken in the interests of the country and in the interests of our survival as a good open economy.  They have proved to be very successful decisions in so far as we have achieved, by and large, the end results.</P>
    <P>We as a nation are doing our bit and our Minister is a great ambassador for us abroad.  I do not think we in this House should consider that Ireland's contribution to the developing and Third World countries can be managed alone on a percentage basis.  We have to take other matters on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to support this motion.  It is a three part motion, and the different parts are interlinked in many respects.  Firstly, we are talking about taking immediate steps to increase the level of Government aid to 0.25 per cent of GNP as it was in 1987 and to aim at a target of 0.27 per cent of GNP in the reasonable future.  Second, we want to <Col N="465" /> reconstitute the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Development Aid and third, to establish a Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs.  While 0.27 per cent of GNP has been indicated as a target, I feel we should make every effort to exceed that, and certainly to achieve it in a short period.  Throughout the world there are very profound changes taking place that nobody could have envisaged a short time ago.  These changes have taken place through Europe, Africa and the Americas.  We feel very strongly than an Oireachtas Foreign Affairs Committee is an essential vehicle at this time to enable us to play our part as a nation towards meeting the needs of the nineties and ensuring that this country will play a fuller role in the changes to which I have referred both politically and socially.  One cannot be too specific but there at this moment major changes taking place in the central American area.  There are massive changes, particularly in South Africa.  There have been changes too, in other countries adjacent to it, in the Far East, the Middle East and, I suppose most significantly of all from our point of view, in Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>We must respond responsibly to these various changes.  We cannot stand idly by and let these things happen.  We are a small nation and money is not necessarily all that we can contribute.  We can contribute very significantly in terms of influence and in terms of ensuring that other nations that are financially better off than we are, contribute their due share of what is required to the various nations that are so badly in need of help at this time.  If we do not respond actively we can easily be submerged in these various changes that are taking place.  Quite honestly, without being political, because one would not want to be in a situation such as this, a reduction in our contribution to overseas development at this time is not to be condoned.  There was, in fact, in the recent budget a reduction of approximately £11 million.  This is something that should not happen.  It is not the amount of money itself, but the very principle and what it might represent as our stance in regard to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> There is, of course, a major stumbling block, in the political sense, in transferring aid from countries that can afford to give aid to countries that badly need it.  That whole political position is very complex and, in fact, one would need a lot of time to go into all the ins and outs, rights and wrongs of this.  There are many under-developed countries throughout the world that badly need the massive surpluses that exist in other parts of the world and politics does, as you know, dictate a fair amount of what can and cannot be done.  Unfortunately people in countries that need aid very badly are, in fact, unable to pay for the transportation of the aid to their countries, even though the assistance is free of charge.  It is regrettable that while on the one hand, we have surpluses of large proportions, each day almost 40,000 children throughout the world are dying from lack of food. This is a very serious position.</P>
    <P>Further to that, we have a position where approximately 500 million people, or ten per cent of the entire world population are still seriously in need of food, some are in a very desperate state, some not quite so bad.  These matters highlight very clearly that no stone must be left unturned to try to get aid to the countries where it is needed.  Unfortunately &mdash; and I want the House to acknowledge the reality &mdash; we have a position where civil war and strife is preventing real progress in the context of getting the aid into the countries that need it urgently.  If any individual in this State gives £10, £20, or whatever, towards a good cause in any of the poor countries, there is a question as to how much of that reaches the individual in the end.  There is the whole question of administration, of ensuring that the maximum amount of every £ contributed by individuals and by nations actually gets to its proper destination.</P>
    <P>To be selfish about it, it is in our interest in the longer term that these under-developed nations should survive, that they would go through the trauma they are going through at the moment because we, as a developing nation ourselves, could do with a great deal of the raw materials that are produced in these <Col N="467" /> countries.  We have still a long distance to go before we could be classified as a fully developed nation.  It is only 140 years ago or thereabouts since we had a massive famine in this country, a famine of proportions just as great as exist now in many of these nations.  There is no way we can turn away from our responsibility in this whole area.  We must contribute the maximum amount possible and in addition to that, we must have established this Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Aid and also the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs effectively to handle the aid our country can contribute.  As we progress and develop further, hopefully that can be proportionately far greater.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on each and every one of us to make sure, regardless of political affiliations, that we give the best possible help in whatever way we can, whether it is money, food, advice or influence, to these countries so badly in need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, the overseas development assistance which we give is divided into two parts; multilateral and bilateral.  The multilateral part of this assistance is where we are a member of different international organisations and they in turn distribute the aid for us. There we are providing, in 1990, almost £21 million.  Now in the bilateral area &mdash; that is country to country &mdash; we provide £13 million.  There is a bilateral aid programme of about £9.5 million, of which £6.5 million goes to four countries that Ireland has specifically designated for relief, these are Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and the Sudan.  A further £3 million goes to other countries.  The remainder of the £13 million is divided up between the Agency for Personal Services Overseas, the Refugee Resettlement Committee and the Advisory <Col N="468" /> Committee on Development Aid.  So this year there is a total of £34.36 million provided.  That is a fair amount of money for a country of this size.  We all want to help and it is very easy to put down a motion like this which says there is a totally unjustifiable cutback.</P>
      <P>I have difficulty with this motion from another point of view in that it is a composite motion which I do not like.  There are three parts to it.  You might want to vote for one part and vote against the other but you are given a package.  For that reason I will find it difficult to support this motion.</P>
      <P>The strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade &mdash; 1971 to 1980 &mdash; was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1970 and called upon economically advanced countries to do their best and to give a mimimum of 0.7 per cent of GNP to net official development assistance by the middle of the decade.  We committed ourselves, and all Governments since that time have committed themselves, to trying to reach this target but without a time limit for its achievement and we still have not reached it.  I know we should reach it, but we do not have the money for all we would like to do.  Running a country budget is the same as running a household budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We help other countries in other ways. For example, out of the disaster relief fund this year, £100,000 went to purchase medical supplies for Romania and £50,000 to purchase medical supplies for Ethiopia.  Of the aid we give Ethiopia, $300 million from the EC was taken by Mengistu and was not used for aid purposes. Why can we not meet this target &mdash; at the moment we give 0.16 per cent of GNP?  The reason is the national debt. We have to pay the debt before we pay anything else.  It is like running a family home.  If you do not pay your mortgage you cannot give money for anything else no matter how needy the cause is.  We have had a series of cutbacks in all areas, such as eduction and health, and we have to service the national debt.  We have been doing well on the national debt.  We <Col N="469" /> have brought down the servicing from 1986 to 1990 from £2,145 million in 1986 to £449 million in 1990 but we still have to meet a phenomenal servicing figure.</P>
    <P>Senators might ask why.  As Senator Doyle mentioned last week, one of the reasons was the oil crisis when we were in Government.  That did not help.  When the Fine Gael and Labour Coalition took over they succeeded in doubling the national debt.  We are left with legacies of these things and we have got to try and pay them.  Instead of criticising we should try to help.  We have to distribute the food surplus.  To talk about a mountain of food or a lake of wine is phenomenal when people are starving.  I do not see why they could not be distributed better.</P>
    <P>I am sure the joint committees are for the Whips to decide in consultation with the parties.  I have nothing against these committees being set up and as the Taoiseach said, they are under review and they may or may not happen.  I have no comment to make on them because I am only concerned with the aid part of the motion.  We could do better and we must always strive to do better.  Under the present stringent economic circumstances we are doing our best.  Our best is never good enough when people are dying but it is our best and we have to keep on trying to improve it.  However, I do not see any point in attacking the Government at this stage and saying they are not doing something.  They are helping and £34 million is a substantial amount to provide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Lydon I will be brief so that my colleagues, Senators Raftery and Norris, can make their contributions. I would support a committee on overseas development aid and a foreign affairs committee.  The suggestion that grant aid would be raised to 0.25 per cent of GNP, and ultmately to 0.27 per cent of GNP, is disappointing; they are a third of what the United Nations recommend. It is depressing that that is the best objectives we can set for ourselves in the foreseable future.  Our record in Third World aid is very depressing.  There have been significant decreases since 1986.  In <Col N="470" /> 1986 we were providing 0.25 per cent of GNP which is very modest, and that has declined to 0.16 per cent of GNP.  That has to be seen in the context of what is recommended by the United Nations &mdash; 0.7 per cent of GNP &mdash; and in the context that some of our European partners considerably exceed that contribution.</P>
      <P>The other thing I find very depressing is the way overseas aid has been reduced in the past few years.  You can look at overseas development aid under two broad headings &mdash; first there is the multinational aid and second, there is bilateral aid.  The reality of the multinational aid is that one way or the other we are locked into it.  It is not discretionary.  We do not have any choice but to pay that amount. However, we have a choice in relation to bilateral aid and since 1987, there has been a reduction of 30 per cent in this area.  If one is to believe what one hears, some elements in the Department of Finance were anxious to fully phase that out.  I find that very disappointing.  It is disappointing that the Sudan office, which was established to promote aid in Sudan, has had to be closed.  These are the reductions which have taken place in the context of Ireland claiming very high moral positions in a variety of differing areas on the world stage.</P>
      <P>It is depressing that Third World aid is reduced when it may be very much in our own interests to make worthwhile contributions.  A lot of the money which will be contributed would be used to employ Irish people in the Third World; Irish products will be sold in the Third World; Third World students would use the Irish aid money to come here, and that would circulate back into the Irish economy.  Above and beyond all that, there is the question of the goodwill which this country could gain for itself by committing itself to the United Nations' targets in relation to world aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of how we respond in the need for world aid is a moral question. The problems of the Third World are appalling.  Large numbers of people in this country must find it very difficult to comprehend how dreadful the situation is.  Large proportions of the population <Col N="471" /> in some of these countries suffer from protein energy malnutrition.  Their income is minimal compared to the income of people in this part of the world. We are in the first league of the world in terms of development.  It is appalling that we cannot do better than 0.16 per cent of our gross national product.</P>
    <P>I find it disappointing that we do not seem to have many ideas, nor is there very much debate, on issues relating to the development of the Third World. There has been little debate on how that would be best approached, what strategy should be and what the Irish contribution should be by way of suggesting new initiatives. This has not been a very live issue. The fact that the Third World can be marginalised to the extent it is and that real reductions have taken place confirm my belief that as far as the Third World is concerned the Establishment do not care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion calling for a modest increase, restoring the Government aid to 0.25 per cent of GNP as it was three years ago, and with the aim of reaching 0.27 per cent in the reasonable future.  That is a very modest target, perhaps too modest.</P>
      <P>I would also like to support the motion calling for a reconstitution of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Development Aid.  In that respect it is regrettable that the Government are opposed to the establishment of an Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs.  I speak on this subject as a former member of the council of Gorta for many years, during which time I got an insight into the problems of hunger in the developing countries and how these problems might be dealt with. I also speak as a former member of the European Parliament, during which time we dealt with the problems of hunger in Ethiopia, the Sudan and elsewhere and during which time too, we were wrongly criticised for the surpluses which existed in Europe while famine existed in Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very simplistic views were expressed then, as is also the case now, about the whole question of surpluses in this part <Col N="472" /> of the world and deficits in other parts. My experience teaches me that the most effective way we can help these people is to adopt a philosophy of giving them a fishing rod rather than a fish, in other words, teaching them how to help themselves rather than handing food or cash to them.  We in Ireland are poor in terms of material things, although rich relative to the very poor countries, but we are rich in terms of technology.  It is in this respect that we can help most.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran has already referred to teaching them, bringing them to this country to our universities, to our regional technical colleges and so on.  He is absolutely right.  In fact, in my own college I have advocated it for many years and in my faculty of food science we are now increasing the amount of help we are giving to Third World countries.  That is to be welcomed.  We hope other colleges will do the same.</P>
    <P>We can also help by encouraging more Irish people to go out and work among these underdeveloped countries.  We do have a situation in Ireland at the moment and indeed in most developed countries, where people are retiring earlier.  These people have a lot to offer.  I can think of people from the Departments of Finance, Agriculture, Education, from outfits like the Agricultural Institute and ACOT, now Teagasc, who have an enormous amount to offer.  Many of them, when they reach retiring age, taking early retirement at 60, have still plenty of energy left to undertake a new challenge and at that stage in life, they are very often free of family commitments.  It would be very desirable for the Government to encourage these people to go out to help the less fortunate brethren in the Third World.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to something that time and again we were criticised for when I was a member of the European Parliament, that is, the food surpluses we had in the Community while people suffered hunger in Africa.  Despite our best efforts trying to get food to them we were frustrated by Governments who were using salmon as a weapon of war.  It was galling to see ships from the Community <Col N="473" /> carrying food and grain into the ports of Ethiopia, having to queue up and wait while shiploads of arms from Russia were being unloaded.  It was galling to find that food convoys were being strafed by Government jets to prevent that food getting to the needy in Eritrea and other areas.  That is the kind of problem we were up against.</P>
    <P>There is another problem also.  Most of the surplus we had were unsuitable for these people.  For example, what is the point in talking about a wine lake?  God knows their problems are bad enough without give them our surplus wine.  How can we give them our surplus butter when they do not have the cold storage facilities to handle it?  Similarly how can we give them our beef when they have no cold storage facilities?  The people who talk about these solutions simply do not know what they are talking about.  There is only one form of surplus we have that we can usefully give to them, that is our surplus grain.  That we have been doing as best we can although I think we have to put more political pressure on leaders like Mengitsu who use famine as a weapon of war.</P>
    <P>There is one other danger about giving food to these people.  Of course, we must keep them alive &mdash; that is absolutely essential &mdash; but simply throwing food at them indiscriminately carries a danger in itself.  Let me recall for Senators what President Kaunda of Zambia said to us in the European Parliament when addressing a world conference on food and hunger.  He said food aid simply fertilises famine.  He meant by that that if you simply dump food into these poor and needy countries, you will undermine the local producers and when you have not got a surplus next time round, the local producers are gone and you have simply exacerbated the situation.  This is a danger we must always bear in mind. Above all, we must try to ensure that whatever we give really gets to the needy, not to the greedy.  I am afraid too much of it in the past has got to the greedy.  I wish to support this motion, I sincerely hope it will have the full support of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my appreciation to the other Senators who have made time for me.  First, I would like to say how heartened I am that so many speakers have referred to the question of a foreign affairs committee. Nothing illustrates the need for such a committee better than this debate.  I invite the Minister to withdraw his comments made in the other House yesterday, as I understood them to be reported, which seem to imply that sensitive negotiations could be prejudiced by the existence of a foreign affairs com mittee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to Senator Norris that he should not make references to procedures in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just referring to reports in the newspapers, I will address the principle then that I think it is a libel upon Members of the Oireachtas to imply that they are not as trustworthy as civil servants.  I welcome the support for a foreign affairs committee.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that on 23 November 1989, the Taoiseach indicated that the Government remained committed to meeting the target of 0.7 per cent of GNP being devoted to overseas aid.  He then proceeded to announce a series of cuts.  I would like to ask the Minister if he can demonstrate to me the logic of how you can achieve a target by moving backwards.  I seem to remember something along those lines being proposed in a comic novel by Lewis Carroll but I was not aware that it had become a feature of practical politics.  I believe it to be a matter of self respect for this country that, in the light of our understanding of our history and of the famine that struck this island in the 1840s, we should do something to redress the imbalances that exist on the globe, particularly with regard to those traditional recipients of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to believe that the Government are serious about achieving their targets when they have indicated that Overseas Development Aid will stand at <Col N="475" /> 0.16 per cent of GNP in 1990 as compared to the target of 0.7 per cent, which is even quite a small amount of money.  I find it difficult to give credence to the kind of thing I heard earlier when we were told that this was a budgetary matter.  Does anybody actually seriously believe that these miserable, parsimonious, tiny, almost microscopic amounts, in terms of our national budget, will really over balance things?  Can we not afford to be moral?</P>
    <P>I know that it is no longer fashionable to espouse the cause of socialism or indeed communism but I have no difficulty, and I think the plain people of Ireland have very little difficulty, with what used to be the basis of the Communist credo, &ldquo;to each according to their need, from each according to their capacity&rdquo;.  There is no question of doubt in my mind that our capacity far exceeds 0.16 per cent of GNP and that we ought to move rapidly towards fulfilling our obligations, as the Taoiseach has indicated.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one final point, I appeal to the Minister to make exceptional efforts to ensure that two countries in particular are included in overseas development aid.  From statements he has made in this House and in other places in the past year or two, I know that the Minister is sympathetic to both. The first one is Cambodia, which is being starved of development aid.  Now that there is the appearance of a package and that the threat of the Khmer Rouge may well be faced by the international community, for God's sake can we not get some aid directly to the unfortunate people there?  Now that the Americans have pulled off their little trick of subverting the unfortunate people in Nicaragua, of starving them into voting the way &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; wants them to, can we not look favourably upon the needs of this small country with a history similar to our own?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I deliberately waited until this time <Col N="476" /> so that as many Senators as possible could speak and that would give me an opportunity of trying to reply to the various points made.  I would like to thank all of the Senators who have contributed to the debate.  May I also thank Senator Avril Doyle for the manner in which she proposed the motion and for the manner in which she spoke to it?  It was very sincere and, apart from one or two little points, non-political, and I would like to thank her for the manner in which she proposes the motion.  As Senator Lydon quite rightly said, this is a composite motion.  I am sure nobody will be surprised if I say that I cannot accept the actual motion, apart from the fact that it starts off by condemning the Government.  It is a very complex motion, and it is one that I can have certain sympathy with.</P>
      <P>As part of its recognition of the common humanity of man and of its commitment to the maintenance of peaceful international relations, Ireland recognises a special obligation to contribute to the economic and social development of the poorer countries of the world and the poorest population in them.  The obligation is expressed through the provision of official development assistance.</P>
      <P>In 1974, Ireland established its own bilateral aid programme with the aim of making a distinctively Irish contribution to development through the provision of forms of technical assistance in which Ireland has a special interest or competence. Within the bilateral aid programme, as Senator Lydon said, assistance is concentrated on four priority countries, Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania and the Sudan, which are among the least developed countries in the world.  As a member of various multilateral organisations active in development assistance, such as the European Community, the United Nations and the World Bank, Ireland also provides funding towards the development co-operation programmes of these organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The official estimate for ODA in 1990 is £34.4 million.  Nearly two-thirds of that, or £21.4 million, is for multilateral assistance, a point mentioned by Senator Lydon, while the balance of £13 million <Col N="477" /> covers Ireland's bilateral aid programme. The largest item under that heading is the bilateral aid fund for which £9.5 million has been provided in 1990.</P>
    <P>This overall amount is very slightly less than the amount of £34.6 million provided in 1989.  I am, indeed, very sorry that it has not been possible to provide a larger amount.  As I said, I have tremendous sympathy with that part of the motion that seeks an immediate increase of ODA by approximately £20 million because that is what the figure would roughly come to.  Indeed, what Minister or Minister of State would not have sympathy with a motion that suggests he would increase his budget by approximately 60 per cent?</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Senators that the 1990 estimate for official development assistance was very carefully considered by the Government, who took account of all the issues.  However, this had to be done against the background of the general economic situation.  The major factor in that situation is the scale of the Government's debt and the related need for continued financial stringency by the Government.  I wish to remind Senators that if the Government had not taken resolute action in regard to their finances in the period since 1987, they might now be facing bankruptcy rather than discussing the level of assistance which can be provided for developing countries.  It has only been through very difficult decisions &mdash; a point mentioned by Senator Finneran &mdash; that progress has been achieved, progress which will pave the way for increasing ODA in the future in line with the Government's commitment to maintain and increase it as economic circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general issue of Government policy on ODA, may I note that the Government remain committed to reaching the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product devoted to official development assistance. No date has ever been set by this or previous Governments for the achievement of this target and in the present difficult budgetary situation it is not possible to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> Senator Doyle suggested that we are at the moment preoccupied with our own debt-servicing crisis and that this was used rather lamely as an excuse for not honouring our commitments over the years.  As I said, and as pointed out by other Senators, it is a reality and if we had not taken the action that we took since 1987 then we would be facing bankruptcy. It is of some significance that the annual borrowing requirement in 1986 was £2,145 million.  It is estimated that in 1990 it will be £449 million.  That shows the actual major reduction that has taken place.  As every Senator knows, this was vital to maintain our capacity to provide State services.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle also raised the question of a White Paper on ODA policy and mentioned that a suggestion has been around since 1974 or 1975 that a White Paper is to be published.  She wonders what the situation is now.  I suppose that if blame has to be apportioned it should be apportioned equally between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, or Fine Gael and Labour and Fianna Fáil, because, roughly, half and half, they have been in Government during that period.</P>
    <P>The preparation of a White Paper setting out current Government policy and ODA is something that is constantly kept under review.  Senators would agree with me that the timing is very important and at a time when it is difficult to find the finances to fund our existing programme it is hardly practical to discuss producing a White Paper.  However, I can assure Senator Doyle that as soon as the situation improves, which is hoped will be very soon, consideration can then be given to that matter.</P>
    <P>I know that Senator Doyle, because she mentioned it in the debate, is very aware of the debt problem.  Senator Doyle also mentioned APSO and asked whether the Minister is making use of this body in terms of advice and whether a lot more could be garnered from that particular source.  Yes, I use APSO any time I can and I take whatever advice they have to give me, but the Senator is confusing the role of APSO and ACDC because, as Senators will know, ACDC <Col N="479" /> is a body set up to give advice to the Department of Foreign Affairs and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to development co-operation.</P>
    <P>The allocation for 1990 is, as I have already noted, comprised of two main elements, one of which is multilateral aid which covers our contributions to major international agencies and which are generally fixed.  The estimate of amounts required under that heading fell slightly for 1990, as compared with 1989, from £21.5 million to £20.8 million.</P>
    <P>On the bilateral side, where levels of assistance are generally more open to the Government's discretion, the allocations rose by an average of 4 per cent, thus keeping pace with Irish inflation.  The amounts provided are sufficient to meet all commitments and enable us to maintain a basic programme of assistance.  I would like Senators to know that the programme is achieving effective results and that it is very much appreciated in recipient countries.</P>
    <P>I have recently returned from a visit to Tanzania and Zambia &mdash; precipitately, I might add.  In Tanzania I participated at the opening of a technical school in a rural district built with Irish aid funds. The establishment of the school is being ably assisted at the moment by a team from FÁs.  I have no doubt as to the practical value of this school to Tanzania, which has very severe shortages of craftsmen of every kind, with the result that economic development is seriously hampered and even basic maintenance of existing facilities cannot be carried out.</P>
    <P>In Zambia I was particularly impressed by the Irish-assisted project of building and rehabilitating very basic maternity facilities in the poorest districts of Lusaka.  Its importance in ensuring safe deliveries for thousands of Lusaka mothers and infants was stressed to me by the Zambian authorities.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senators that Ireland's standing is very high in Zambia and Tanzania and other countries: a doubt may well have been expressed by some of the remarks here tonight about that standing. I would like to say a special &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;<Col N="480" /> to the many Irish people engaged in these projects and in others I visited and to assure them that their efforts are recognised and encouraged.</P>
    <P>I might add that, in relation to the point made by Senator Raftery concerning people who have retired and who could have a role to play, very many of them are actually over there at the moment playing a very vital and important role in our development assistance to various countries.</P>
    <P>I turn now to that part of the motion which calls for the establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs.  This is not the first time that such a committee has been proposed.  Motions to this effect were discussed and debated in this House in 1986 and in 1988.  I agree that very significant and fundamental changes are occurring right through the world, as mentioned by Senator Hourigan and indeed other Senators.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are accountable in a very real and practical sense to the Oireachtas for their management of Ireland's international relations.  Members of the Oireachtas, and through them the public, have a right to be well informed and to express opinions on the State's foreign policy.  Similarly, they have the right to criticise Government decisions in this area if they consider such criticism to be justified, and they have done so in the past.</P>
    <P>There are many opportunities open to Members of the Oireachtas to exercise these rights and to review and debate aspects of foreign policy.  These can be raised and are raised in both Houses either in the form of special motions or on the Adjournment.  In the past four months Senators will be aware that issues as diverse as Cambodia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, famine relief and emigration have been discussed in one or both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is clear from this that adequate arrangements exist for Senators and Deputies to discuss in public various aspects of foreign policy. The annual debates on the Estimates for Foreign Affairs and the Estimates for <Col N="481" /> International Co-operation, the presentation of reports on developments in the European Communities and on meetings of the European Council provide valuable opportunities for debate and discussion on our external relations.</P>
    <P>Senator Michael Finneran, Senator O'Keeffe and Senator Brendan Ryan mentioned the very practical and down-to-earth nature of Irish projects in the developing world and I can agree, having visited the various projects.  I can also assure the House that Ireland's development policies are formed in consultation with the countries in which the bulk of the projects are situated.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran, and indeed Senator Raftery, also mentioned the question of third level education.  I agree wholeheartedly with both of them.  This is a very important area and approximately £125,000 of our bilateral aid fund is provided for fellowships to provide training for developing countries' personnel in many institutions throughout Ireland and, where necessary, in other countries if we have not got the expertise that is needed by the developing countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon and Senator Hourigan mentioned the loss of the Concern ship. We were all greatly concerned about the loss of that ship, which was taken by the EPLF rather than the Ethopian Government. However, I would like to assure the House that the substantial bulk of aid gets through.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan has drawn attention to the imbalance between surpluses in some countries and the desperate want in others.  However, I feel I should reassure the Seanad that a great deal of the surpluses are made available and are indeed transferred to poor countries. However, as pointed out very forcibly and strongly by Senator Raftery, the situation is that some types of products &mdash; for example, butter and meat &mdash; are very expensive to transport and may become unusable without elaborate storage facilities which are not available in developing countries.  Therefore, most of the aid is supplied in cereals with milk powder and the like.  I share the concern of Senator Raftery and Senator Hourigan <Col N="482" /> about the effects of war preventing aid getting through and indeed, as Senator Raftery said, the use of famine as a means of war.  In that I am particularly conscious of the difficulties in Sudan and Ethiopia at present.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the question of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Co-operation, I would like to pay tribute to the committee which operated during the 25th Dáil and which produced some very excellent reports.  While the Development Co-operation Committee did very useful work, I might note that the absence of a committee is not preventing either House from discussing both the broad development co-operation issues such as that covered by the first element of the motion before the Seanad and also specific issues such as the situation in Ethiopia.  There was a very well-informed debate on Ethiopia in this House before Christmas and it was my privilege to attend and to respond. I am sure there will be many further occasions for satisfactory debates on the issues involved.</P>
    <P>May I assure Senator Norris, in relation to Cambodia, that last year an allocation of £50,000 for emergency supplies was made last November.  I would also like to reassure him that we will also accept applications from Irish NGOs for eight projects for Cambodia which will be decided on their merits and if funds are available.  An allocation of £10,000 was made last year for an NGO project for Nicaragua.  Likewise, we will accept applications from Irish NGOs for Nicaraguan projects in 1990 on the same basis as for Cambodia.  However, I think the House will agree with me that it makes sense for us to concentrate the available resources we have in a certain number of countries rather than dissipating them by sending them to a large number of countries. I think it is something that all of us can agree on.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the general trend of some of the motion, but all I can say is that, as Members of the House will be aware, the Taoiseach stated in the Dáil last month that the question of establishing further Oireachtas committees <Col N="483" /> remains under consideration and the establishment of those committees is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas in conjunction with the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I was a little bit embarrassed at his precipitate return from Africa and the circumstances involved, especially as he was the bearer of goods and good wishes to a brother of mine who works in Tanzania.  My apologies to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I cannot compliment the Minister too much for his speech because it is running counter to what we seek in this motion.  Let me refer briefly to the motion: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government's totally unjustifiable cutback in the current level of overseas development aid...&rdquo; The motion then calls on the Government to take immediate steps to increase the level of Government aid to 0.25 per cent of gross national product, as it was in 1987, and to aim at a target of 0.27 per cent of GNP in the reasonable future.  This is against the background of the United Nation's target of 0.7, which is approximately three times our present level.</P>
      <P>It is very important that there should be a bilateral approach on this Government aid issue between Government and Opposition because of its hugely fundamental social significance.  It has to be very tempting to any Government in office in difficult times to seize whatever revenue it can lay its hands on for sound national purposes.  There are issues at the moment such as the flooding of the Shannon and elsewhere in the country, issues in the agricultural sector, or relating to storm damage and so on; there is a huge temptation to dive in where there is limited political sensitivity, grab the loot and transfer it.  It is a temptation that should be resisted in all possible cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relative terms we have to say we are a wealthy nation.  There is no getting away from the fact that Ireland is a very wealthy nation in global terms.  We are members of an extremely élite group in the European Community and we are <Col N="484" /> one of the poorest nations only in that context.  We use all the levers at our disposal in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg to argue the case that, as one of the poorest countries in western Europe, we have special grounds to take huge chunks of money out of the European cake for our regional development needs, for our small farmers, for social and industrial purposes.  At the same time we are arguing in a western European context of our relative poverty, we are much less than generous when the shoe is on the other foot and when we are in this relatively very wealthy position in this country in comparison to the abysmal poverty and deprivation which exists in the Third World and in the Fourth World.</P>
    <P>There is a massive level of dedication to the Third and Fourth Worlds by the vocational sectors in this country.  We have the most incredible people working in the missions &mdash; men and women &mdash; on the African continent, South America and Central America.  You meet the most embittered agnostics and atheists working in those areas, in those countries, who have the highest possible regard and respect for the work done by Irish Christian missionaries and lay missionaries such as teachers.  That is the saving grace when we look at what Ireland is doing abroad, but at Governmental level I submit to the Minister we are not doing enough.  Regardless of what the Irish problems may be &mdash; the problems we have had in the economy; the problem we are facing at this time &mdash; this is a very fundamental issue where I would like to see agreement between Government and Opposition in the Dáil and Seanad that there is a certain proportion going in there increasing annually, a proportion of GNP agreed across the House, that it is sacrosanct and is going to be untouched regardless of the national circumstances.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion which we put down seeks the reconstituting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Aid which was establshed some time ago and which operated through the 25th Dáil.  We know the terms of reference: nine Members of Dáil Éireann, none of whom should be a <Col N="485" /> member of the Government, to be joined with the select committee to be appointed by the Seanad to examine such aspects of Ireland's relations with developing countires in the field of development co-operation and the Government's official assistance in developing countries.  There was a distinguished membership of that committee.  Reading it from the list of Members and not giving any political preference to any party: Fine Gael &mdash; Deputies Owen, Glenn, Enright, Crowley; Senators O'Brien, Connor, Browne. Fianna Fáil &mdash; Deputies Niall Andrews, Leonard, Kirk, Ned O'Keeffe; Senators Hanafin, Killilea.  Labour &mdash; the late Frank Cluskey, Senator Michael Higgins and Senator Brendan Ryan.</P>
    <P>There was a prestigious membership of Members of the Oireachtas on that committee.  The Minister in his speech paid them a tribute.  He paid tribute to the excellent work which they did in the 25th Dáil and he referred to the fact that they produced excellent results.  At that point the Minister's speech is simply full stop.  Having paid such glowing compliments to this particular committee for the work which they did and the excellent results which they produced, the Minister does not say at that point whether it is the intention of the Government or of the Minister to re-establish the committee.  I think we are due clarification there.  The implication of the Minister's speech seems to be that, despite their excellent work, since their demise work has continued effectively; and, possibly by implication, it is not necessary to reconstitute the committee.  However, the Minister does not say clearly it is the Government's intention.</P>
    <P>There is a little line at the end of it, that the Taoiseach states it is possible that future Oireachtas committees may be established, that it remains under consideration. May I ask the Minister specifically, what is the position of the Minister and Government on that point? Is it the intention of the Minister, along with the Government, to re-establish that committee or is it not?</P>

      <P>I will.  It was merely what I think was a reasonable request for clarification, which the Minister has attempted to satisfy to an extent, but the matter is not clear, so far as I am concerned.  I believe the committee should be reconstituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third issue we have in this motion is that we are calling on the Government to establish an Oireachtas Joint Committee on foreign affairs.  In relation to this matter there is a very strong desire in this House in the most apolitical sense to establish such a committee.  It has been a matter discussed on the Order of Business for some weeks now, it has been a matter to which the Leader of this House has given a personal commitment.  It has been an issue in relation to which members of the Government party here have been as strong in advocating the <Col N="487" /> establishment of this committee as have been Senators in the opposing parties. The Leader of the House has been implying to us here that this committee was going to be established.  The Minister in his speech states fairly categorically that no such committee will be established.  It is running very much in conflict.</P>

      <P>I will have to intervene again.  The Senator is developing this into a question and answer session and I advise him that he has the opportunity to reply.  I would ask him to confine himself to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, but let me say this.  The Minister, in his speech in relation to the foreign affairs committee, makes a number of statements which imply that the Government do not see the need for the establishment of such a committee, that adequate arrangements exist already so why go into this committee. I do not accept that adequate arrangements exist.  There are suggestions that there would be duplication with the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community. I cannot accept that statement for one minute.  The Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community is a reactive type of committee, dealing with legislation as it comes to us from the European Community. It is dealing with issues of a very historical nature, dealing with many issues about wine lakes, olive oil lakes and issues that have very little relevance for this country.  It is certainly not in the policy sector.  I would reject completely there being any question of duplication with the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must also dispute the Minister's remarks that the additional burdens of <Col N="488" /> the European Community Presidency in Ireland at present make this time unsuitable. Time is passing very quickly.  We are now into the middle of March.  Even if there was the will politically to establish this committee, the time is certainly right now to get on with it because by the end of June that Presidency will not be our burden any longer.</P>
    <P>There is mention in the Minister's speech about sensitive negotiations and the implication that a parliamentary committee might somehow or other impede or make difficult existing workings within the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I do not accept that for many reasons.  There are so many precedents in the Oireachtas with existing committees and recently established committees where there are no breaches of confidence &mdash; for example, the recent development of an Oireachtas committee concerning semi-State bodies, which I regard as an excellent development.  It should, perhaps, have happened many years ago.  Within the semi-State bodies there are sensitive issues and yet this rapport that is developing or the cut and thrust between that committee and the semi-States is, I believe, very healthy for this country.  It has not in any sense done any damage in the area of confidentiality, in so far as I am aware.</P>
    <P>We have our other committees in the House.  We have our Committee of Public Accounts, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the European Committee.  I do not see for one instant that the establishment of this specific one creates all kinds of problems which have not been created elsewhere.  I do not think there is evidence to suggest it would do that.  That is my view.</P>
    <P>I also understand that, if we are looking at this area of foreign policy and parliamentary committees, this is one of the very few countries in Western Europe which does not, within its Parliament, have a committee dealing with foreign relations.  We are very much the exception rather than the rule if we believe that <Col N="489" /> we can proceed on the basis of debates in the House on the Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs or special motions.  There is a great deal of evidence that the committee system can work very effectively and there is no reason why it is not as necessary in the area of foreign policy as it is within other areas of public activity.</P>
    <P>The last issue I would like to deal with is to point up the necessity for such a committee for foreign affairs.  It relates to our membership of the European Community.  That is of profound importance. It is a fundamental truth that since we joined the Community in 1973 there has been a huge shift of power to European institutions.  It is an enormous fact of life.  I said in this House today on the Order of Business there are times when I feel more like a member of a county council in the Seanad now than a member of a national Parliament.  An issue I raised relating to the importance of foreign affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is nothing wrong whatever with being a member of a county council.  I was an elected member of Mayo County Council for about 13 years and I was every proud of it &mdash; with the Minister, in fact.  The point I am <Col N="490" /> making is that this is a national Parliament with a different function.  What I want to hit at here is this: with that shift in power we do not, as parliamentarians, have a fraction of the power that the people we succeeded had prior to 1973. The issue I want to raise is that if a Member of the Seanad or the Dáil has a particular interest in regional development, in agricultural policy, in education, in social welfare, in infrastructure, in environment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am just concluding on this sentence.  If we want to follow up a line and to investigate and to establish a satisfactory brief so that we can address ourselves as we should to these issues in this House, there is no arrangement within the Oireachtas, either in the Dáil or in the Seanad, and there is no arrangement through the offices of the European Community to facilitate that type of fundamental activity.  That is the root of this issue that I am addressing.  It is for those reasons that we call on the Government to take these steps under these three headings.</P>

      <P>Tá mé anseo anocht le labhairt faoi ábhar an-tábhachtach go deo, ábhar go bhfuil an-spéis, ní amháin ag muintir an iarthair inti, ach ag muintir na hÉireann fré chéile.  Is i lár na seachtóidí a thosaigh an chaint ar an ábhar seo ar a dtugtar ASI, Areas of Scientific Interest, agus is é an Foras Forbartha a bhí ag plé leis.  Anois is é Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí atá ag plé leis.</P>
      <P>There is no dispute in my mind regarding the importance of the principle of outlining areas of scientific interest.  An overwhelmingly large majority of people would concur completely with the idea of ASIs.  The conflict has arisen because of the manner in which research and updating is being carried out.  Thousands of privately owned acres of land have been designated by the OPW Wildlife Service as areas of scientific interest. Such designation has caused havoc among the poor farmers especially in the west of Ireland and in particular in Connemara. I and other people who have done some study on this believe that the manner in which designations of private property &mdash; I am not talking about State property or any multiple of State property, I am talking about private property &mdash; take place by the Office of Public Works is <i>ultra vires</i> and constitutes an act of great injustice against many small farmers in Ireland, and especially in Connemara. Too many small farmers have suffered as a result of this.  It is about time this Government did something about it, something pragmatic, something that would alleviate the desperate situation that is now being experienced by small farmers, particularly in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, I know five Connemara farmers who between them have 2,005 acres of a mountain bog.  Approaches were made to those people by private investors who wanted to buy 800 acres for afforestation.  The price was almost agreed on.  It was hovering between £200 and £250 per acre.  Eight hundred acres at £250 is £200,000.  Those five farmers, smallholders with nothing only that type of land and bog and mountain which would not feed a snipe, had an opportunity of bettering themselves and their families by an income which would only come their way once in a lifetime.  While negotiation were proceeding the proposed buyers checked to find out the level of grant that would be obtainable for afforestation.  Lo and behold, they were told that no such money would be available because the land, the mountain or the bog which they intended to buy was now deemed an area of scientific interest. The people themselves, those five farmers to whom I have spoken individually, never heard of the term ASI, never heard of an area of scientific interest.  Their land had been designated by a segment of this State known as the Office of Public Works.  Without a by <Col N="493" /> your leave, without consultation, without notification, without any talk of compensation, their land had been devalued overnight to the tune of £200,000.  If that is not interference of the first order in private ownership of the citizen I am a Dutchman.  It is despicable in this day and age that we have a section of this Government known as OPW going around this country putting circles around areas of farmland and private land and people not knowing this has been done.</P>
    <P>I have done some research into this.  I find no legal basis in European law or in Irish law for such designation.  I firmly hold that the Office of Public Works and their Minister are not empowered to devalue private property by designating them as areas of scientific interest without enabling legislation to do so and without suitable legal compensatory arrangements having been put in place.  We have a book here which was distributed by the Minister for the Environment a few weeks ago.  On wildlife habitats there is one sentence which is very relevant to what I am speaking of.  He says nonchalantly without any leithscéal de chinéal ar bith don rud atá déanta anuas tríd na blianta ó 1975: &ldquo;In future areas of scientific interest drawn up by the Wildlife Service will be fully publicised. The views of landowners whose lands are affected by such areas will be fully considered and amendments to the Wildlife Act due for introduction later this year will deal with this matter further.&rdquo; Sin dar liomsa ag dúnadh an doras nuair atá an capall imithe &mdash; closing the stable door when the horse has bolted.  Between 1975 and 1990 about 1,600 areas have been circled by the Office of Public Works as areas of scientific interest and now, after all that time, they are saying in future they will talk to the people who own private land.  There is no great praise due to the Office of Public Works for being so benign to the poor farmers of the west.  Unfortunately, though legislation is not retrospective, when the Wildlife Act <Col N="494" /> of 1976 is eventually amended to take cognisance of these facts, it will apply only to future designations.  What is to happen to all the private land designated since the mid-seventies which will be outside the ambit of the amended legislation? Who will compensate the small farmers affected between 1975 and 1990, or whenever the Act as amended becomes operable.  Who will compensate them for something that happened to their property without their being told about it or consulted and without any compensation being given to them?  Who will compensate the Clifden farmer, for example, who is making some of his land or bog available for an airport and who found out when the planning process was going through that it was suddenly in an area of scientific interest?  He was never told about it, he never knew about it and now he is out of his £30,000.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works insist on telling me and other people that they are doing no harm to the small farmers in the west.  It is a shame that such harm is being done and has been done over the last 15 years.  Who will compensate the five farmers I just spoke about for the £200,000 out of their pockets?  Who will compensate the forest farmer in Moycullen who planted his trees and when he went to collect his grant was told: &ldquo;You will get nothing because your land is an area of scientific interest&ldquo;?  He knew nothing about it.  He was told nothing about it.  He was not consulted.  Who is going to compensate Údarás na Gaeltachta who purchased 1,200 acres of bogland for afforestation and now they are told they can do nothing with it?  Who is going to compensate the 12 owners in common on the Aran Island who were making a commonage available for a golf course and who have been told it is an area of scientific interest and they cannot sell it?  They cannot get anything for it. Still the Office of Public Works insist in discussions with me that they are not doing any harm to the poor landowners. Who will compensate a person like Harry <Col N="495" /> Conroy, for example, over in Letterfrack?</P>

      <P>Maith go leor.  This person who shall be nameless now, has been done out of £6,000 in premiums for his sheep at the behest of the Office of Public Works because his land is bordering an ASI area.  He is being accused of having his sheep wandering into land now covered by an ASI.  He is a farmer who has a proud tradition, as had his family before him since 1906, and had the use of that land and of that mountain.</P>
      <P>I am now asking the Minister here present to have this deplorable situation remedied once and for all.  There is only one way he can do that &mdash; and it is like recalling the troops back to barracks &mdash; he has to go back to 1975, when this dastardly thing started, and he has to remove every one of those circles that have been put on private land without the knowledge and without the consent of the farmers involved.  All those marked areas must go.  Amend the 1976 Act immediately, lay down the rules about designation and about what a person can do and what a person cannot do.</P>
      <P>I know this is the Green Presidency period and I do not wish to be seen as, or to be branded an anti-environmentalist because I am not.  I am sure the Taoiseach does not want to see his Presidency being tarred by an accusation of there being blatant acts of natural injustice against landowners just for the sake of environmental reactitude for which there is no basis in law.  The dichotomy which has arisen between the needs of environmental protection and the economic welfare of local communities should be clearly addressed and put into perspective by amending the Wildlife Act. ASIs do not exist in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be calling on the Minister to tell <Col N="496" /> me the name, the year, the section or the subsection of any Act he wants to produce which gives legal effect to interfering with people's land without their knowledge or their consent.  This has to be rectified and it is not an easy thing to do because we have a balance between progress and conservation.  We have to address ourselves to it before more bureaucratic bungling sets people at one another's throats.</P>
    <P>I was friendly with a great number of people in Connemara before the controversy about the airport started.  I numbered them particularly in my friendships.  Unfortunately, because of the draconian methods employed by the Board of Works, who are acting without the help and aid of the law, friends are being turned into adversaries.  If the Board of Works conducted their business properly and if they had recourse to the 1976 Wildlife Act there would have been no controversy whatsoever about the Clifden airport.  None whatsoever.  If the Board of Works people told the Minister that they could not operate the 1976 Act when they were addressing nature and matters of ASI, then the Act would have been repeated, would have been updated to take cognisance of those facts.</P>
    <P>I have teased out the 1976 Act, I have gone through it thoroughly and I have friends in the legal profession who have looked at it with me.  I repeat that nowhere in that Act is there an iota of evidence to suggest that the OPW have power to designate private property as an area of scientific interest.  I am asking the Minister in his reply to point out to me what section of the Act gives power to him and to his servants to be involved in ASIs without having an enabling Act to do so.  The Minister is bound to justify all the functions of his Ministry and those of his servants by way of report or relevant legislation.  The only legislative bible open to him to act on, chapters 2 and 3, pages 2075-2094, of the 1976 Wildlife Act.</P>

      <P>I have plenty to say on this matter, but unfortunately, I will not have time to say it.  I am asking the Minister one thing and one thing only.  Will he tell me why the Office of Public Works can designate private property without having any recourse to the law?  No matter what the Minister does, there is a statutory obligation on him to do so under an Act of Parliament.  Unless he gives me that answer and can produce evidence to substantiate his reply, I will have to be very strict and ask him to resign.  This subject has been mentioned in the Dáil, question after question raised and evasive answers given.  I want just one question answered.  Under what authority can the Minister interfere in the private ownership of private land?  Under what Act is he working?  It certainly is not the 1976 Wildlife Act.  I have to insist that the Minister in his reply tell me under which Act &mdash; chapter, number and section &mdash; the Office of Public Works can designate areas of scientific interest without consultation, notification or any thought of paying those people for the losses incurred by them.</P>

    <P>I want to mention very specifically that the areas of scientific interest are areas of special interest for their fauna or flora, either as individual species or as communities or eco-systems.  These are areas where rare or protected plants or animals occur.  They are part of the nation's natural heritage.  The areas of scientific interest would include certain woodlands, peatlands, fens, dune systems, marine areas, coastal areas, grasslands <Col N="498" /> and indeed, some very important bird sites and habitants.  These areas are indentified, not designated, and there is quite an amount of confusion in people's minds between areas which are identified as areas of special scientific interest, and areas which are designated and have been so under law.  The law in relation to designation of which the Senator, no doubt, is fully aware, is the Wildlife Act, 1976, and section 15 sets out very clearly the scientific interest.  I do not want to delay the time here by going through that.</P>
