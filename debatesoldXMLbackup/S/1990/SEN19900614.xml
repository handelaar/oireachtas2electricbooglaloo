      <P>I have notice from Senator Eamon Ó Cuív that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Energy to outline what plans he has for the development of further timber pulp users to ensure adequate outlets for the residues of timber mills which are vital to their viability.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to confer official sanction on Kilfinan Education Centre, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
      <P>Go ndéanfadh an tAire Comhshaoil a shocrú go ndéanfaí scrúdú láithreach leis an bpríomh-bóthar ó Chloch na Rón go dtí An Clochán a athghrádú le go mbéadh sé in ann busanna tuarasóireachta a thógáil.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice <Col N="1042" /> to alleviate the enormous delays and the deteriorating position in the Land Registry, and to make a statement on the future efficiency of the registry.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ó Cuív, Jackman and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ó Cuív's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Jackman and Neville may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Ó Foighil is not suitable for the Adjournment on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to taking the Order of Business, a Chathaoirligh, it is proposed that a vote of condolence be expressed to the family of Lord O'Neill. After the Order of Business it is suggested that leaders might make statements. So far as the Order of Business is concerned for today the first item is Item No. 1, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Order, 1990.  On conclusion of that order it is proposed to move on to Item No. 101 &mdash; the motion on South Africa.  In regard to that motion it is proposed by agreement, that notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders the following arrangements shall apply to this debate: the speech of each Senator shall not exceed 20 minutes and the debate shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 4 p.m. this evening.  That concludes the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Leader of the House for agreeing to make a short time available this morning for one speaker from each group to express their condolence on the death of Lord O'Neill. May I also, on the Order of Business, support a plea made yesterday by Senator Tras Honan that this House be given an opportunity to have a full debate, preferably with the Taoiseach or a senior Minister present, on the six months of the Irish Presidency and more particularly on <Col N="1043" /> the major developments that are now taking place within the European Community. I would like to urge you very strongly to see if that could be arranged as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I repeat a request that has been made frequently for a debate on Northern Ireland.  There has been an enormous amount of comment in this House about the whats and the hows of Northern Ireland and quite justified revulsiom at the continuing murdering. We ought to spend some time looking at the whys.  Anybody who had the good fortune to see two &ldquo;Radharc&rdquo; programmes last night and the night before on RTE 1 might have a further and deeper insight as to why the violence has continued.  We could do with a serious, open-ended and long debate on Northern Ireland and where we are all going on that issue.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to ask for guidance either from you, Sir, or from the leader as to the criteria on which rooms are allocated for meetings because I know that meetings to do with the Winchester Three and the Birmingham Six have been held in this House.  I, in conjunction with members of other groups, tried to have a meeting about a particular individual who feels aggrieved about his conviction for an offence committed in Britain and I was refused permission to have a room in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not understand who is deciding or on what criteria certain groups who feel rightly or wrongly aggrieved can be facilitated so that Members can hear their grievance within the House and other groups and individuals can be refused.  I am not asking for special treatment.  I am asking to be told what the rules are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that I raised this matter via the CPP two years <Col N="1044" /> ago and I have so far not heard anything about the rules and how certain categories of people are distinguished between.  I feel I am entitled to an answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Leader of the House for making time available to pay tribute to the late Terence O'Neill.  I would also like to thank him for limiting the debate to 20 minutes per speaker.  I have long been of the view that that is an adequate period of time for anybody to state their position.</P>
      <P>I would support Senator Maurice Manning's and Senator Honan's request that we have a debate on the EC Presidency now that it is reaching an end.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House what is the situation in relation to the visit of Mr. Nelson Mandela?  What arrangements are to be made for Senators and will it be possible for Mr. Mandela to address this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning referred to the question of a statement on the six months EC Presidency.  That is something I will certainly be pursuing.  I am not sure what the outcome will be but hopefully something can be done. Senator Brendan Ryan referred to a debate on the Northern Ireland situation. I have no plan for a debate at this time on that matter.  The other item he referred to is, as the Cathaoirleach said, not appropriate to the Order of Business and perhaps not appropriate to this House.  The Senator could raise the matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Upton referred again to the statements on the Presidency and to the visit by Nelson Mandela.  The situation has not changed.  Senators will recall that when President Reagan, President Mitterand and other Heads of State came to Ireland, because they were Heads of State we had a joint session.  Nelson Mandela is not in that category and for that reason there will not be a joint session. <Col N="1045" /> However, Senators can be seated in the division lobbies on the day.  I am not sure how many seats are available but certainly I would think there would be 50 or so seats.  That is what is on offer and I hope Senators will be content with that.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>As we agreed, it is appropriate that this House should express our condolences to the family of Lord O'Neill.  I think we all would agree that Lord O'Neill was very much a man of his time, indeed before his time, and a man of great vision.  He was ahead of his peers in his thinking in regard to the problems of this country, and one could probably make the point and regret that fact that his peers did not equal his vision and had not the same ideas and had not the same outlook in regard to the problems of this country.  It is appropriate that we as a House of the Oireachtas should send the condolences of the House to his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to associate the Fine Gael Party with this expression of condolence to the family of the late Terence O'Neill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Terence O'Neill represented the great lost opportunity in the politics of this country in the sixties and the seventies. He was a generous and far-sighted man. A leader who came after 40 frozen years in the Unionist Party, 40 frozen years of attitudes and reaction.  He very clearly saw the need for change, saw that change was desirable, saw that Northern Ireland could not survive as a peaceful and civilised state unless there were major radical changes.  Unfortunately, what he wanted came far too soon for his own people. Unfortunately, what he tried to do, especially his historic meeting with Sean Lemass, sparked of a backlash which is still very much a part of the problem and the troubles in Northern Ireland.  He was a man who deserved loyalty which he did not get from any of his closest supporters. <Col N="1046" /> He was a man who deserved to be listened to by his own people.  Unfortunately, they did not listen.</P>
    <P>When Terence O'Neill was driven out of politics in Northern Ireland all of us in this country were the poorer, all of us in a sense were the losers because his vision of peaceful, gradual progress was jettisoned and totally taken off the political agenda.  Today, on behalf of my own party, I would like to mark his passing by paying this tribute to him and by sending our regrets to his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on behalf of the Independents who wish to be associated with this vote of condolence. I came to know Lord O'Neill in recent years.  I met him a number of times at meetings of the British-Irish Association. His presence there indicated that even in retirement he still have a lively interest in the Northern problem and in Anglo-Irish affairs, though that interest was tempered by a certain melancholy, a certain depression, and a lack of any real hope about progress.</P>
      <P>It was said of him that he was naive and that he lacked any rapport with his own people.  One historian has said that he was the wrong man with the right ideas.  There is much in all that but these criticisms are minor compared with his remarkable courage.  Few people would think of Terence O'Neill as a leader and yet it is one of the prerequisites of leadership that a leader should take his people one jump ahead of where they are, so to speak.  He tried to do that; he did not succeed and he himself suffered the consequences.</P>
      <P>I would recall to the House that a popular Sunday newspaper here carried a poll which showed that the people of the Republic very much appreciated what Terence O'Neill was trying to do.  He made &ldquo;moderation&rdquo; and &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; words of virtue instead of reproach.  We would do well to remember that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, it is worthwhile noting that I heard him saying in recent years that he was absolutely convinced that the reason the Sunningdale experiment, the powersharing executive, collapsed was not <Col N="1047" /> because of any real internal difficulty but because of the unfortunate insistence on the part of one group to underline the all-Ireland dimension.  Perhaps there is a lesson in that for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like on behalf of the Progressive Democrats to join in the expression of condolence to the family of Lord Terence O'Neill.  As has already been said, he was indeed a man of integrity and, unfortunately, perhaps he was ahead of his time.  I have heard people say he was the right man in the right place at the wrong time.  He sought to build bridges not only within the communities in Northern Ireland but also between communities North and South.  He was a great loss to politics because he had so much to offer to us all.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I wish to express our condolences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party we would also like to be associated with the messages of condolences to the wife and family of the late Terence O'Neill.  He was a good and honourable man who meant well.  The events of January and later in 1965, his meetings with Sean Lemass, marked a breakthrough; they brought a thaw in a situation which had been going on for 40 years.  They were a breakthrough, perhaps even in the context of 300 years.  North-South visits are now a matter of routine and, broadly speaking, they are taken for granted. That was an historic event which set the pattern that has been followed since.</P>
      <P>Captain O'Neill saw no future in the old ways.  He saw that they were futile, that the whole thing was untenable, and I would suggest he also saw it was untenable as he visualised Europe developing. He was certainly a man of vision now that we look back on the initiative he took 25 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To some extent, I would agree with Senator Murphy when he said that he has been seen as naive but you can look at it the other way and say that he can be seen as being very wise.  In many ways he foresaw what was coming and he moved <Col N="1048" /> to try to prevent some of the terrible things that happened.  Unfortunately he was not successful but that was no fault of his.  Again, we wish to extend our condolences to his wife and family.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the Seanad today seeks the approval of the Seanad to a draft order to increase the board size of the National Rehabilitation Board from an existing membership of 15 to 20.  The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988, designated the National Rehabilitation Board as a body to which the provisions of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, would apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 23 of the 1977 Act as amended by section 21 of the 1988 Act provides that the Minister for Labour, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the appropriate Minister in this case the Minister for Health, may by order fix the number of member directors of a designated body including the number of worker directors.  The Acts require, broadly speaking, that elected representatives make up one third of the membership of each board.  In the case of the National Rehabilitation Board, however, there is provision for elected representatives to make up less than one-third membership.  The reason for this is that membership of the National Rehabilitation Board must be sufficiently large to allow for representation of a variety of specialist expertise and is, therefore, large in comparison with the size of the organisation.  Before the enactment of <Col N="1049" /> the 1988 Act appointments to the National Rehabilitation Board were governed by Article 5 of the National Rehabilitation Board Establishment Order, 1967, which stated: &ldquo;the board shall consist of not more than 20 members appointed by the Minister for Health.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The practice, however, within the board was to restrict the composition of the board to 15.  Since 1983 onwards three worker representatives were included among the 15 board members.  Following the enactment of the 1988 Act an order setting the size of the National Rehabilitation Board at 15 to include three worker representatives was made after the approval by both the Dáil and the Seanad.  Following the expiration of the term of office of 12 of the 15 members of the board on 28 February 1989, the Minister for Health had the position regarding membership of the board examined to ascertain whether an increase in membership from 15 to 20 was warranted.  Having considered the matter in great detail the Minister for Health came to the view that having regard to the particular functions of the National Rehabilitation Board, a board membership of 20 would be more appropriate and would bring the board size to that originally provided in a National Rehabilitation Board Establishment Order, 1967.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has had consultations with the various representative bodies and the unions representing employees and their response to the proposed change has been favourable.  I, therefore, ask the House to approve the draft order which proposes to increase the size of the vote of the National Rehabilitation Board from 15 members to 20 members.  The new board of 20 will include four elected worker representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As my party spokesman, I would like to support what the Minister has said.  He outlined the reasons the membership of the board should be increased to 20.  Obviously with specialised individuals being involved <Col N="1050" /> there is merit in that.  The fact that worker participation is still only at 20 per cent would give certain cause for concern as on many other boards it is one third.  We should welcome worker participation on these boards but I suppose theory is one thing and how it works in practice is another, and exactly what do we mean? For the successful functioning of boards and in relation to organisations in general, it is important that as far as possible problems are cited in advance than being reactionary.  In relation to the National Rehabilitation Board particularly, how it has developed and how we hope it will develop with the introduction of new work practices and methods and various developments that are to take place, it is important that there be full participation and full consultation between all concerned. I suggest that at some future stage we should have a report back from the board which should say how effective the worker participation element has been.  I would like to know if the worker participation element has been.  I would like to know if the worker participation end will be at the same level as the other members of the board.  Will they serve for the same length of time?  Will the elections be on term basis, the same as the other?  The Minister when replying might like to expand further on how he sees the board functioning.  This is an inherent part of how the board has developed in relation to the Department of Health.  It is important that all progress should be to the workers benefit.  Coming into 1992 it is important that the workers benefit and that they have a key role to play in consultations between unions and management.  There should be full consultation. The theory is grand but in practice it is another thing.  Hopefully we are going to see developments.  It might be interesting to have a debate at some stage in this House on how the Act has worked in practice.  It sounds great for solving a lot of our problems but I wonder how it works in practice.  We support this measure.  We recognised the need to have specialised people on the board; I suppose 15 or 20 is not a very big number in this day and age.  We would not like the <Col N="1051" /> board to become too cumbersome.  We support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the motion.  It is very appropriate that the National Rehabilitation Board should be one of the State bodies that comes under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act.  This is an opportunity to pay tribute to the National Rehabilitation Board for the absolutely marvellous, outstanding and excellent work it does on behalf of the disabled.  There are people who do not have day-to-day association or close comradeship with disabled persons. It is only those who have the experience of dealing with disabled persons who really appreciate the work of the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
      <P>The operations of the board fall into three principal categories.  It has an advisory role, a co-ordinating role and a services role.  Its main aim is to enhance the lifestyle, both physical and psychological, the well being and economic independence of disabled persons.  It is important also to acknowledge that the board works in very close co-operation with a number of voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>Again, this is an opportunity to pay tribute to those voluntary organisations who give time and effort and a lot of their own money to providing a variety of services for the disabled.  They do absolutely marvellous work.  I wonder at times where exactly we would be without the help of those organisations.</P>
      <P>The board is also Ireland's principal link with the ESF in the context of financial support for the disabled.  They provide counselling and a guidance service for the disabled and, very importantly, they provide a counselling and guidance service for parents.  There are two different categories of disabled persons; there are persons who are disabled from birth and persons who are disabled through some misfortunate accident or something like that.  In both cases the trauma for parents is absolutely horrific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have close association with the National Rehabilitation Board and I can <Col N="1052" /> say the board does fantastic work counselling and guiding parents as to how to deal with the problem.  The initial reaction of parents where a child is born disabled is of horror.  Subsequently the child becomes most affectionate and becomes the most prized possession of the parents. Disabled children bring a sense of achievement and satisfaction to their parents and enrich their quality of life. The parents of a disabled child regard it, not as a cross they have to bear, but rather as a gift which tests their resilience and makes them all the better.  It is in that area that the National Rehabilitation Board can do so much.</P>
    <P>There is the trauma, on the other hand, of persons who are in full health and are disabled through some unfortunate accident.  Their lifestyle is totally changed.  It is an absolutely horrible experience.  They have enormous difficulties trying to cope with their changed circumstances.  It is in catering for that category of disablement that the National Rehabilitation Board comes into its own and does enormous work.</P>
    <P>The general public are not closely identified with the disabled.  We tend to forget.  There is a great deal that we can do.  It does no affect us directly and, therefore, it does not concern us.  The National Rehabilitation Board tries to encourage people to recognise that there is a problem and that any difficulties put in the way of disabled persons should be removed, specifically in relation to the workplace.  It is important to remember that we are talking about disability and not inablility as has been proved time and time again where a disabled person gets the opportunity to do a particular job. There is a multiplicity of suitable types of work.  There are very few types of work that a disabled person is not able to do.</P>
    <P>The general public feel somewhat uncomfortable with a disabled person, for instance, a blind person.  Blind persons are quite amused at times when they come in contact with members of the general public who start shouting at them.  They feel that because a person is blind he is not capable of doing anything. That is absolutely ridiculous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> The National Rehabilitation Board is trying to encourage industry to provide facilities where disabled persons can be employed.  As I said, when they get the opportunity they prove in no uncertain terms that they are as efficient, and in a lot of cases even more efficient, than others who are not disabled.  The board tries to ensure that disabled persons can be independent.</P>
    <P>I would say to the general public, to organisations, communities, clubs, hotel owners and so on, that it does not cost a great deal of money for an employer to take on a disabled person.  In the general public arena, facilities should be provided so that disabled persons can have access. Lack of access can mean that disabled persons cannot attend functions or events.  They are entitled to have the same access as the general public.  Where a new hall is being built it takes very little to include a ramp for wheelchairs in order to provide access.  It is not that people do not care; it is just that they do not think.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the National Rehabilitation Board on the absolutely marvellous work they are doing.  Long may it continue. I also welcome the fact that the board membership is being increased.  I wish it well in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The real lesson to be learned from this order is the absolute and abject failure of the private sector to follow suit in the area of worker directors. That really is the message that goes through this debate.  This is certainly the second, maybe the third, order under this legislation over the last couple of years. It certainly is a progressive order and I welcome it.  I welcome it because I have long been committed to the concept of worker directors.  For many years I have seen the benefit that semi-State companies have gained from the involvement of worker directors on the boards whether in Aer Lingus, Telecom, An Post or wherever it happens to be.  It has been extraordinarily successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has long been an objective of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to develop the whole concept of worker <Col N="1054" /> directors.  Certainly, modern development in industrial relations is leading to more and more involvement of the workforce in the operations of the company. Modern development in companies is to establish a partnership between workers, management and proprietors, because those people would find at least some coincidence of aims and objectives, possibly not at all times but certainly in many of their objectives.  It is this coincidence of aims and objectives that comes together very clearly and very definitely in the order before us this morning.</P>
    <P>The National Rehabilitation Board deals with a very specialised service indeed.  The employees of the board will of necessity be persons with a broad range of expertise and specialisation which are and clearly will be extraordinarily important in taking decisions at board level and in deciding policy for the future of the board and indeed in making decisions arising from ordinary day-to-day problems.</P>
    <P>The difficulties which have very often arisen in large companies arise from the fact that the workforce is not kept informed of develoments in the company. I want to deal with that in two days. These might be positive developments or negative developments.  Let us take the case of a board trying to establish their service or trying to market their product, that is running into financial difficulties and needs to consider the dreaded word &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo;.  Difficulties always arise if the first the workers here about this is a notice in the newspaper or a note with the wages slip at the end of the week indicating that the company is now insistent on having redundancies.  This is where the problem is always created.</P>
    <P>Very often management, and those directing the operations of the company keep it from the workforce, when the reality is that given the same set of circumstances anybody, whether the managing director or the ganger on the shop floor, would probably come to some conclusions on which they would agree.  They might not necessarily agree on how to deal with the problem but they certainly would have to identify that there was a <Col N="1055" /> problem and recognise that a solution had to be sought.  People might find different ways of reaching a solution to such a problem but at least there is a coincidence of minds that at some stage that the matter has to be discussed.  The involvement of worker directors gives a responsibility to both workers and management to address the difficulties, the policies and the progress of the company in this particular case the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it leads to an inbuilt continuation of consultation, because the worker director will be representing the views of the workforce of the organised unions and will be insistent that this point of view is also considered when the board sets about taking decisions.  It is the proper development for industrial relations and it ensures there is a free flow of information.</P>
    <P>On the question of information, I would refer back to many of the discussions that took place when the Bill was going through the House in 1988. During the discussions at that time this question was one of the main reasons people opposed the idea of worker directors on the basis that one could not trust the workers to retain confidentiality on sensitive matters.  Attempts were made to introduce changes in the legislation in order to exclude the worker directors from certain aspects of the decision-making functions of the board.  This, of course, is utter nonsense.  The question of confidentiality is a matter of honour for the members of the board and one is as much likely to find leaks on the management side as on the worker director side.</P>
    <P>In the period since worker directors were set up I would certainly believe that they have been a tremendous force for good.  Certainly, speaking to the heads of many of the semi-State industries who have worker directors, they are more than pleased with the flexibility it has given them, because it allows them at board level to see what way things are going with the workers, what is likely to run as a proposal, what is likely to be <Col N="1056" /> resisted but, more importantly, what is likely to work.  If the workers do not have an input into decisions, the likelihood is that mangement can take decisions which turn out to be incapable of being implemented.</P>
    <P>In welcoming this order this morning, I would say it is completely in line with the policies of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It also is in line with the agreement worked out between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Government on the basis of seeking to extend worker directorships in semi-State companies and beyond.  Once more it points to the total lack of ideas and imagination in the private sector which still retains the old view that the workers' place is on the shop floor and they should never see the inside of the boardroom.  This is an opportunity which I hope the Minister will take when replying to make it clear to the private sector that they also have responsibility, not just for the broad general reason that it is positive or progressive to involve workers in the operation of the company but because it is a sensible to do and also improves industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Just this week there was a comment in newspaper editorials about the increase in strike days in 1989.  This, of course, is inevitable in a booming economy where wages are still being repressed and suppressed. This is bound to happen.  I do not want to get into that particular debate now but I want to use it as an example to point out that if the workers are aware of the state of the company it imposes whatever restraints are necessary in terms of wage claims on those workers when they are deciding what is an appropriate claim to lodge.  On the other side, it also shows that if the company is doing well the workers should be entitled to share in the benefits and in the expansion of the company.  In those cases they should also be beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>It brings expertise to the board, allows the specialisations of the workforce to be part of the decision-making role of the board, allows workers to have a commitment to the operation of the board. Remember, whereas other members may <Col N="1057" /> be able to walk away from the operation, the workforce have a commitment not just to their work, but to their families. They have personal commitment with regard to their homes, to a mortgage, their total livelihood and future is invested in the board.  Taking all these points together it is quite clear that there would be no sense of irresponsibility at any time as far as the workers are concerned. It also leads us to a more acceptable kind of future in industrial relations which should develop into a partnership between the workforce, management and ownership.  It also allows us to use this opportunity to point again to the private sector and ask them what are they doing about increasing the involvement of worker directors.  Do they not trust the workforce?  Why do they not take the lead from the semi-State bodies?  Why not move forward in line with the views of the social partners and develop the concept of worker directors?</P>
    <P>I welcome this order and look forward to further debate on this and similar matters in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Workers Participation (State Enterprises) Order, 1990.  Appointments to the National Rehabilitation Board were originally governed by Article 5 of the National Rehabilitation Board Establishment Order of 1967.  However, the enactment of the Worker Participation State Enterprise Act, 1988, ruled in respect of the designation of the National Rehabilitation Board as a body to which the provision of the worker participation legislation shall apply.  Section 23 of the Worker Participation State Enterprise Act, 1977 provided that the Minister for Labour may after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the appropriate other Ministers &mdash; in this instance it is the Minister for Health &mdash; fix the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 23 of the Worker Participation State Enterprise Act, 1977, as amended by section 21 of the 1988 Act, provides that Article 5 of the National Rehabilitation Establishment Order 1967 shall be <Col N="1058" /> construed and shall have effect in accordance with the order made under section 23 for so long as the order is in force.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 4 of the Worker Participation State Enterprise Act states that where an order under this Act other than an order under section 3 is proposed to be made, the draft order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and therefore we have this order before us this morning.</P>
    <P>The term of office of 12 of the 15 members of the board expired on 28 February 1989.  As three of the worker representatives were outgoing members, an election had to be held among the staff of the National Rehabilitation Board to elect their replacements.  The three elective representatives plus nine nominated by the Minister for Health were duly appointed to the board with effect from 6 October 1989 for a period of four years.</P>
    <P>During the period between the expiration of the term of office of the 12 and the appointment of the new members, the Minister for Health had the position regarding membership of the board examined and decided to increase the membership.  Having considered the matter in great detail, the Minister for Health took the view that he would now increase the membership to 20.  I worry about increasing any board to a larger number if a board of 15 has worked well but that is just a personal opinion.  Consultation took place with all the various representative bodies on the proposal to increase membership of the board from 15 to 20 and the response from these bodies was favourable.  They stated that the increased membership should be matched by a percentage increase in the number of worker representatives on the board and this I certainly welcome. Senator O'Toole mentioned how successful worker participation has been on boards and I certainly would endorse that view.  Senator Cosgrave asked had the NRB board with the worker participation worked and certainly the answer to that is that it has and worked well.</P>
    <P>The bodies consulted also suggested that, given that one of the functions of the National Rehabilitation Board is to <Col N="1059" /> promote access to and placement in employment of disabled persons, consideration should be given to the inclusion of representatives of the social partners: the ICTU, the CII, the FIE, Department of Labour, on the extended board.  A delegation from the ICTU union group of the National Rehabilitation Board have been met by officials of the Department of Health and this discussion has taken place.  The delegation was informed that their views would be conveyed to the Minister who has responsibility for the choice of the ordinary members of the board.  Consultation with various representatives bodies has shown that there are no objections to the proposed increased number.</P>
    <P>I would like to make reference here to consultation and to pay tribute to the Minister for Labour Deputy Bertie Ahern.  I have watched former Ministers for Labour and I have watched the present Minister and I realise that he firmly believes that talking through problems and consultation is certainly the best way to run the Department of Labour. He is an example to all of us of how successful talking through problems is and he certainly has had problems since he became Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>Given the need for representation of a wide range of specialised expertise in medical, paramedical and other relevant fields, the expansion of board membership will give the Minister for Health an opportunity to appoint to the board additional members with the required expertise.  I certainly hope the Minister would take a close look to see if there is somebody who has been very closely associated with disabled persons.</P>
    <P>I want to say how important his order is where I am concerned.  The Minister present in the House, Deputy Daly, is most welcome here.  On a local national level he has seen at first hand how important voluntary groups and statutory bodies are when dealing with the mentally handicapped and disabled persons.  I would hope that if there is an opportunity somebody who has common sense and <Col N="1060" /> who has given good service to the disabled will be appointed.  I am not looking for an appointment on this board just in case I sounded as if I were.</P>

      <P>No, no I have plenty to do.  I am fine.  I understand the composition of the board at present to be: a person from the Department of Health; three members of staff and that number will be increased to four; a chief executive &mdash; I presume of the Eastern Health Board; three disabled persons &mdash; that number probably will be increased.  I would like to put on the record of this House my personal acknowledgement of the excellent work of the National Rehabilitation Board and its staff.  It is a clear cut example to all of us.  After consultation has taken place Minister Daly with the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Health will see to it that there is proper representation on this new board.  I welcome the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the motion and fully support it.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay my tribute to the National Rehabilitation Institute who are doing excellent work for the disabled, the deprived section of society. I am glad to say that I have done some work with them organising fund raising activities.  It is very rewarding to work with them.  Maybe at some stage the whole funding for the National Rehabilitation Board should be looked at to ensure that their work is completed as effectively as is expected of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming the worker directors it is timely to look at the whole area of participation and how effective it has been since the Act was introduced in 1977 and the more up to date Act of 1988.  It seemed for some time, probably because of the economic climate, that worker participation was going out of fashion.  Many people, especially the private sector, often saw it as a time wasting pursuit which consumed resources they felt were best applied to other areas of activity.  In <Col N="1061" /> looking at participation at board level we are looking at a very small area of the whole participative approach through worker involvement.</P>
    <P>Participation is an evolving and dynamic character and if you do not have a climate of participation in an organisation you do not have real participation. Participation must include more involvement of the employees in all aspects of the work of the organisation.  It requires an openness from management, a confidence by management, in the workforce and an onus on management to communicate the activities and plans of the organisation to the workforce.  There are not enough participative activities in some organisations.  I am speaking about participative activities like briefing groups, quality circles, employee shareholding, work councils and so on.  While these are good in their own right, if there is not a culture of involvement in an organisation and a culture of participation by the workforce, these activities die and are often seen as sops to the whole concept of worker participation.  If the culture of communications and involvement is not there, it can often create frustration because expectations are not met.</P>
    <P>Worker participation and involvement of employees has become recognised internationally as a key element in competitive advantage.  We cannot overstate this; the more involved the workforce, the more information they have in the areas of activities, plans and success of the organisation, the more successful the company will be.  Worker participation is far advanced in countries associated with competitive excellence &mdash; like Denmark, Japan and Sweden.  We should aim to emulate their approach to worker participation in the expectation that we will reach the same competitive excellence and success as organisations operating in the private and public sectors in those countries.</P>
    <P>For proper worker participation it is important that an educative approach be taken to the workforce.  Responsibility is on management to ensure this.  Economic literacy by the workforce is necessary if only to understand, read and interpret a <Col N="1062" /> simple thing like the balance sheet, which often is quite complex to people who are not used to reading financial statements. Maybe the Minister would comment on the success of the semi-State organisations' approach to the greater involvement of the workforce at all levels and their educative approach to the workforce to allow them to fully understand the success, the difficulties and the financial returns of the organisations.</P>
    <P>The dominant form of employee relations in Ireland, of course, is collective bargaining.  This is based on the adversarial system.  I know that the Acting Chairman is very aware of the intricacies of that system.  In essence, all participative developments in Ireland are, in effect, filtered through the system. It would not be an exaggeration to state that both the employer and the trade union institutions would, in reality, have a veto on any particular developments because of our system.  It is a moot point whether this situation actually benefits the participative process.  On the one hand, the system ensures that any participative initiatives agreed by the social partners will subsequently stand an excellent chance of being introduced because of the agreement of both sides to having it introduced.  On the other hand, however, this adversarial or collective bargaining system tends to place worker participation firmly within the industrial relations arena and consequent on growing tensions between the participative and adversarial models.</P>
    <P>Management and unions are conscious of their roles within the organisation and often feel that if a development of participation develops outside that arena, it places under threat their role in the collective bargaining position.  This is one of the areas that inhibits the natural progression of worker participation between management and the trade unions.  It is unlikely, I believe, that we will witness any spectacular or dramatic progress on worker participation in Ireland in the very near future.  On the other hand, pragmatic and gradual gains will be made in the public sector especially and also in the private sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> Legislation has facilitated the developments in the public sector and, hopefully, it will be a headline for the private sector. What may be particularly unique is a further polarisation of activities within the public and private sectors, the public continuing to be underpinned, as I said, by legislative developments leading to structural initiatives, the private sector reflecting individual workplace activity and a strong bias towards the end result. As has been the case in most European countries it is likely that we will witness a move away from ideological and philosophical considerations towards practical action backed up by a new armory of techniques and strategies.  I again welcome the motion and I am glad to have had the opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the Rehabilitation Institute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the motion before us this morning.  However, there are one or two items with which I am concerned.  First, proportion of the board, which is made up of worker directors, is 20 per cent as against 33 per cent in other semi-State organisations.  The changes which are being made simply keep that ratio of 20 per cent.  In other words, it will be four worker directors out of a total membership of 20 on the new board compared with three out of 15 on the old board.  That is a matter of regret to me particularly when we realise how successful workers directors on the boards of semi-State companies have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the broad point the Minister made in relation to the necessity for specialists and experts on the boards of an organisation such as the Rehabilitation Institute.  On the other hand, one can make the point that in many ways the workers are specialists in their own field. They have an expertise gained from years of experience dealing with day to day matters.  I am certainly not satisfied that the ratio here should be 20 per cent compared with 33.3 per cent for other semi-State companies.  I welcome this initiative and I support what has been said about the success of the introduction of worker <Col N="1064" /> directors onto the boards of semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I would like to mention as the Minister is in the House and that relates to the facilities for the disabled in this House.  I plead with the Minister to take a look at the facilities and, if it is possible within the constraints of his budget, to make some changes because the facilities in this House for the disabled are unacceptable in this day and age.  I appreciate the problems the Minister has.  I imagine he will do what he can but this is a good opportunity to take some initiatives on the facilities which are available here in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first, to thank the Senators who have contributed for their very constructive and positive comments and I will endeavour to reply to the points made by the various Senators.  Could I express my deep appreciation for the work which has been done by the Nationala Rehabilitation Board over the years.  When you recognise that they train in the region of 4,500 people and have a small staff and a limited budget &mdash; they have about £3.5 million &mdash; you realise the amount of work they have done.  Many Senators have commented from their own personal knowledge on the work of the board and their achievements.  By any standard one would have to say that the board has been very successful indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave mentioned the appointments on the board and whether the term of office of the worker directors will be the same as the ordinary members.  The term of office of the worker directors will be for a four year period, the same as ordinary members. There was a general theme running through the whole debate.  On the one hand people commented on the general operation of the worker participation legislation and, on the other hand the very valuable work which has been done by the board in this particular area. Senator Honan, whose comments are <Col N="1065" /> based on a very long and deep understanding and involvement in the voluntary efforts of people dealing with problems, not only the physically handicapped but the mentally handicapped as well, demonstrated very clearly her deep understanding of the problem and the need to do further work in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister, at the end of the term of office of the board in 1989, reviewed the operation of the board and had consultation and discussion with the various interests involved and with the people employed in the board.  He came to the conclusion that it was necessary to make these changes.  Senator Honan made the point that she favoured smaller boards. Many people would be of a similar view. In this instance the special circumstances of the National Rehabilitation Board, and the point I made earlier on the necessity for representation from a broad area of people with expertise and specialist interests, had to be taken into account. It was fully taken into account by the Minister for Health when the review was undertaken.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke at length about the general operation of the worker participation legislation and its effectiveness and commented on the fact that the same drive and the movement forward that had taken place in the semi-State area did not appear to be applicable in the private area.  This is a matter for the employers and their workers in the first instance. The 1977 legislation was put in place to deal with about 35 designated companies in the semi-private area and the semipublic area.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the success that has been evident from the review which was undertaken by the Minister initially in relation to the 1977 Act, which brought about the 1988 Act, and the review of the 1988 Act demonstrates very clearly the success of worker participation in State enterprises.  That success must nudge people in the private area to take a similar line.  All we can do here is to encourage the private area to look at the success of the worker participation in the State enterprise area, and to examine very carefully how it has succeeded.  Any <Col N="1066" /> impartial assessment of the legislation would have to come down on the side of being successful.  There are some tentative discussions taking place between the employers and the Congress of Trade Unions and that is to be encouraged.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to encourage the people in the private area to look at the success of the operation which has taken place since the 1977 legislation was introduced.  I was in the Department of Labour during 1979-80 and was involved in the review of the operation of the 1977 legislation.  I see the desirability of this trend, in future closer management worker participation and, of course, closer Government participation, which is what we have had in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and co-operation we have had between Governments and trade unions and employers over the past couple of years, which brought economic success which is very important and significant.  I have replied to most of the points raised by Senator O'Toole.</P>
    <P>The initial worker participation legislation was reviewed and as a result the new legislation in 1988 was brought in. That has been looked at again and has been seen to be successful.  Senator Upton raised the question of facilities for disabled persons in the House of the Oireachtas generally.  I am not in a position to deal with that, at the moment, but I will make some inquiries and some representations in that regard and report back to Senator Upton and others on how we can improve the situation.  Certain minor changes have been made but as people know, in a building like this it is not easy to make the changes that are desirable.  I will certainly look at that and communicate then with Senator Upton.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna spoke about the voluntary effort in this area.  I know from his deep understanding of the problem that he is fully aware of the contribution the voluntary organisations have made to the care, provision of employment and opportunities for handicapped, disabled and mentally handicapped people. Everybody here will agree that no Government, no State agency, no board, <Col N="1067" /> can achieve what is desired on its own. Success in this area, as indeed in many other areas, depends on the amount of voluntary effort that can supplement and support the State involvement.  Anyone who would not know this, recognise it and encourage it, is certainly not living in the real world.</P>
    <P>We have to support in a positive way the work of the voluntary organisations. I would like to pay tribute to people like Senator McKenna, Senator Honan and others who have been to the forefront of the drive for more involvement in the community area and to get more voluntary effort working with State agencies.  Travelling the country, we can see what has been achieved through the co-operation of voluntary efforts and State agencies.</P>
    <P>The question was raised about the representation of the Department of Health. I have the names of the membership of the board here which I can circulate if any Member wants them.  The Mid-Western and the Midland Health Boards are represented on the National Rehabilitation Board in the person of Denis Doherty, the Chief Executive Officer of the Midland Health Board.  Mary Aylward Executive Officer at present of the Mid-Western Health Board.  Mary Aylward represents the Department of Health. When this order goes through one more person will be elected, and four will be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have covered the main points raised by the Senators in the course of the discussion, which has been very useful and worthwhile.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to thank Senators for their very positive and constructive contributions which we will take into account and which I will convey to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Labour.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the <Col N="1068" /> prospect of substantive negotiations involving all parties in South Africa; notes the announced intention of the South African Government to abolish apartheid; encourages all sides to proceed with the further efforts necessary to achieve that objective, which is not yet near realisation; and calls on the Government to maintain the necessary pressure on the South African Government with a view to promoting the profound and irreversible change that is required.</P>
    <P>It gives one great pleasure to be able to come into this House to propose a motion in which, at long last, we are welcoming the end of that appalling system of apartheid which was a blot on civilisation.  It is also a great pleasure for us all to be here discussing a motion in which we are considering the real progress which is now beginning in South Africa.  In many ways perhaps 1990 will go down in history, certainly so far, for a changing mood which seems to be worldwide, the astonishing changes that we have seen in Eastern Europe, the changes which we are seeing now in South Africa, changes which I hope we will see in Central America and indeed nearer home as well in which people will get together to solve difficult bitter problems, but to solve them by peaceful negotiation with concern for the rights of other people rather than just simply and totally selfishly looking at their own particular point of view, immediate advantage or interest.</P>
    <P>However, as regards South Africa, let us be quite clear we are only at the start of the process.  There is a long and very difficult way to go.  That is why we are anxious in this Government motion that the necessary pressure, whatever that may be, including sanctions, will continue to be applied.  This is absolutely essential. We do not lightly advocate such matters as sanctions and the process of these procedures.  I sincerely hope that sanctions can be lifted as soon as possible, that any necessary boycotts can be lifted as soon as possible and that South Africa as a country, and all the people of South Africa, may once again participate in <Col N="1069" /> economic progress, sport and all the international events in which all the people of that beautiful and great country should participate.</P>
    <P>We have to proceed very cautiously. It is no pleasure advocating sanctions. Sanctions very often strike at the weakest section of the community.  I say this without imposing anything of that nature on the South African population who have shown great heroism under the most harrowing circumstances.  Nonetheless any form of economic sanction inevitably bears on those who are least able to protect themselves.  Equally, I find it very unpleasant that we have to impose such things as a boycott of athletes.  In terms of general principle this is repugnant but unfortunately, they are necessary.  Basically, these sanctions and pressures were necessary.  They were imposed as a peaceful means of ensuring an end to apartheid &mdash; which we are beginning to see and of which we have promises &mdash; and other developments.  Just ending apartheid is a great advance but it is certainly not enough in itself.  It is a hideous, uncivilised system but there is a lot more to development in South Africa than simply ending apartheid.  Apartheid is, perhaps, the most obnoxious and obvious manifestation of the injustice of the system out there.</P>
    <P>The United Nations declaration has been referred to in one of the amendments. The United Nations, of course, laid down a whole series of fundamental principles.  I will mention a few of them; South Africa shall become a united, non-racial and democratic state; all its people shall enjoy common and equal citizenship and nationality, regardless of race, colour, sex or creed; all its people shall have the right to participate in the Government and administration of the country on the basis of universal, equal sufferage under a non-racial voters roll, and by secret ballot, in a united and non-fragmented South Africa; all shall have the right to form and join any political party of their choice; all shall enjoy universally recognised human rights; South Africa shall have a legal system that will guarantee equality of all before the law; <Col N="1070" /> South Africa shall have an independent and non-racial judiciary; there shall be created an economic order that will promote and advance the well being of all South Africans; and a democratic South Africa shall respect the rights, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and pursue a policy of peace, friendship and mutually beneficial co-operation with all peoples.</P>
    <P>We have agreed that each of us should only have a limited period to speak. Although I appreciate Senator Upton's general comment that 20 minutes is sufficiently long for any one speech, it is indeed very difficult to do full justice to the points that I would like to make.  I am sure speakers on this side of the House, and indeed on the other side of the House, will be expanding on these and mentioning other very crucial issues.</P>
    <P>Let us for a moment look &mdash; and it could be a total debate in itself &mdash; at the history of South Africa, a history of some of the worst aspects of colonialism, on the one hand and, on the other hand, a history of tremendous economic achievements. Let us in no way denigrate these. There are great achievements.  This gives hope not only for South Africa itself but for the whole southern region of Africa. There have been great achievements by the various groups there, not least, let me say quite clearly, by those of the Dutch groups, the Afrikaners, who went through their own very difficult times. Remember the words &ldquo;concentration camp&rdquo; started in South Africa.  Let us briefly glance back.  Basically it has been a history of colonialism and oppression, whatever else may have in some ways slightly modified that.</P>
    <P>It is really almost a miracle of history that at this particular time the South Africans should have found a person of the calibre of Nelson Mandela, somebody who is capable of going through so many years of imprisonment, some of it very foul imprisonment, whatever slight amelioration there may have been for the past year or two, and is still able to come out and say: &ldquo;It is better to let bygones be bygones&rdquo;, to come out also and talk <Col N="1071" /> in terms of love, that that is what one should have for one's fellow South African. He is a great man.  How fortunate we are also that, on the side of the whites, President de Klerk is attempting with great difficulties &mdash; let us clearly understand that &mdash; to extend his hand of friendship and co-operation to Nelson Mandela.  Each of them appreciates the other and have paid very warm tributes to one another.  Earlier today we had tributes to that other great man who tried so hard in this country to bring communities together.  Let us not underestimate the difficulties which President de Klerk and Mr. Mandela will have in their infinitely more appalling circumstances than we have experienced here.</P>
    <P>There are certainly grave dangers on both sides, the various African groups. Let us remember that these are various peoples &mdash;&ldquo;tribes&rdquo; is a totally inappropriate expression &mdash; the Xhosa people, the largest group, of which Nelson Mandela is a hereditary chief, as well as being Vice-President of the ANC; the Zulu group, an almost equally large group of about 17.5 per cent of the South Africans led by Chief Buthelezi.  We rightly pay tribute to Nelson Mandela but I would like also to pay some tribute to Chief Buthelezi, who, despite tremendous pressures and inducements, refused to negotiate with the South African Government while Nelson Mandela was kept in jail.  He and the other various important South African leaders all must come together if there really is to be a peaceful prosperous development in South Africa.</P>
    <P>However, Mr. Mandela and Chief Buthelezi have people behind them who may not be quite so tolerant.  President de Klerk has certainly got a very strong white opposition.  We are already beginning to hear talk of an enclave in South Africa which would be a white enclave with a certain number of non-white Africans in it and, no doubt, if they could cutoff that region they would begin to talk about democratic processes and so on.  It is going to be a very difficult situation for <Col N="1072" /> some years to come in South Africa.  We must hope that Nelson Mandela, de Klerk and like-minded people will be able to come together and bring the peace and justice in South Africa which that country deserves, that by raising living standards there for all the peoples of South Africa they will in turn improve the living standards, and the appalling circumstances in Mozambique, Angola, Namibia and other adjacent territories.</P>
    <P>We support the declaration of the 12 EC member states in relation to South Africa.  I would reiterate the words of the Taoiseach in hoping that there will be an agreed attitude of maintenance of pressure on South Africa but, at the same time, a recognition of the moves of President de Klerk and of the way in which Nelson Mandela has endeavoured to bring the majority population in South Africa with him.  I have great pleasure in moving this motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;while welcoming the prospect of substantive negotiations involving all parties in South Africa; noting the announced intention of the South African Government to abolish apartheid; encouraging all sides to proceed with the further efforts necessary to achieve that objective, which is not yet near realisation; calls on the Government to maintain the necessary pressure on the South African Government including the continued imposition of sanctions <Col N="1073" /> in accordance with the five principles enunciated by the sixteenth session of the UN in December 1989, with a view to promoting the profound and irreversible change that is required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The debate today certainly will be different in tone and in content to anything we could have envisaged perhaps even a year or two ago at a time of extraordinary changes in so many parts of the world, changes which very few of the experts in any of the areas predicted &mdash; certainly very few predicted the speed or intensity of these changes &mdash; the consequences of which for the most part are still very uncertain with, as the last speaker said, no guarantees of any happy endings.  The changes in South Africa have at least been as profound and as far-reaching as those in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>In the past in debates in this House and elsewhere on sanctions against South Africa have often been prone to a great deal of moralistic self-righteousness and postering by speakers.  There should be no place in today's debate for any attitudenising or striking of postures.  The simple fact is that what we are talking about today is a question of tactics and strategy.  The basic fact is that all Members of this House and all parties are, and have for some considerable time, been opposed to the system of apartheid and have sought to support steps which would lead to its destruction. There is no monopoly or exclusive rights on indignation or self-righteousness on this issue.</P>
    <P>I have to say in a positive way that over the years this House has taken a much more active and positive part then the other House in debating this issue and in highlighting the steps that needed to be taken.  Back in the sixties the then Senator Garret FitzGerald was one of the first to raise the issue here.  Over the years other Senators from all parties &mdash; Senator Robinson and Senator Katherine Bulbulia, who are both, sadly, gone from this House &mdash; have sought to raise this issue, to give it attention and to promote effort towards action on the matter.  In <Col N="1074" /> facing this debate we can be quite clear that this is not a party issue; it is an issue upon which all of us speak for the vast majority of the Irish people in wishing to see the best tactics used to bring to an end this abominable system of apartheid.</P>
    <P>The debate today to a certain extent has been sparked off by the action of two of our colleagues who recently visited South Africa to see for themselves some aspects of the situation there.  I want to say a word or two about that before I go on to the substance of the motion.  It was courageous on their part to go there. They risked being misunderstood and misrepresented, because there is in this country a type of knee-jerk reaction to any contact with South Africa.  This is a frame of mind which is particularly strong, I am sad to say, among certain sections of the academic community and among certain sections of the media.  It is an attitude which perhaps is almost certainly less understandable today than might have been a few years ago.  It is an attitude which I personally have never liked. I have always believed in the value of contact, in the exchange of views, in persuasion, in seeing things at first hand.  I hope from this point on that more Members of this House and more members of the Irish public will, within the confines of sanctions, at least take the opportunity to see for themselves and to use whatever means they have to bring about the change we all desire in South Africa.</P>
    <P>I also find a certain persuasiveness in what has been said by the two Senators so far and I am looking forward to hearing their contributions today because I am sure they will elaborate on the statement by Senator Murphy in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and the contribution of Senator Ross to the &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; programme last Sunday.  I find particularly powerful the view that Mr. de Klerk &mdash; the view expressed by Senator Conroy &mdash; needs to be buttressed and supported, that he needs friends, he needs to be able to show that his extremely courageous policies which were undertaken with a speed none could have predicted, do bring results and, to a certain extent, that the only real <Col N="1075" /> result he can show is that sanctions are being lifted.  This is a very powerful argument.</P>
    <P>Again, as the last speaker said, it is an argument that is particularly strong in view of the recent by-elections and in view of the obvious and increasingly growing threat of white reaction against the policies of Mr. de Klerk.  The glowering presence of Mr. P.W. Botha, the former Prime Minister, is there in the background, a focal point for drawing together those who oppose the line taken by the present Government.  All of us must be disturbed by the crude manifestations of a new form of white fascism which is emerging in South Africa and which in the right circumstances could become a hugely destablising force in that country.  We cannot underestimate the strength of that backlash.  We cannot underestimate the chaos it could unleash, the inevitable blood bath which it could very well provoke.  All of this could happen without any guarantee that apartheid would go eventually, or that the state of the blacks would be any better as a result.</P>
    <P>I am not going to pre-empt the arguments which my colleagues will almost certainly make in the debate, but against these two arguments &mdash; there are other arguments as well and, as is noted in the motion, the various areas of improvement which have taken place &mdash; it would certainly be a view that the process in the state it is in at present is not irreversible; it still could come to a halt and there could still be a great deal of chaos.  There is a feeling that to give in now, to ease sanctions now, might send a signal to the white extremists that they have created a situation in which sanctions are being lifted.  I think that would be a very unfortunate signal to send out.</P>
    <P>Anybody in this House who is honest with themselves will have to say it is not a question upon which any of us can be certain as to what exactly is the right policy.  I have many friends in South Africa, people who were at school and at university with me and with whom I keep contact.  I have had phone calls, letters <Col N="1076" /> and documents from them and they are confused, frightened and fearful.  They know that change is inevitable.  Many of them want to see an end to a system under which maybe they have done reasonably well over the years.  They also have this sense of terror and fear that events are going too fast, that events will get out of control and they they will end up, as in other parts of Africa, with a situation of vindictiveness and a blood bath.  One can understand their fears, one can sympathise with them, but nonetheless I am not sure at this point that I can accept their basic premises.</P>
    <P>It would be our considered view at this time that this is not the time just now to lift sanctions.  We note in particular that the ANC have been extremely conthey have been controlled.  This is something which is deeply encouraging and which we all wish to see continue.  But the ANC, who are at the forefront of the debate, have signalled very clearly their obvious concern that sanctions not be lifted at this particular stage.  They want to keep the lid on the trouble, they want to keep the talks going, they want to make progress through dialogue.  The ANC itself is adamant that the pressure must be kept up and, as Mr. Mandela said at the European Parliament yesterday:</P>
    <P>Any reduction in pressure on the Pretoria Government would diminish the impetus which is obliging the white population to accept change.</P>
    <P>This, I think, is the nub of the matter. The ANC is, I believe, the body best positioned to judge the rate of change and tactics.  The ANC has shown itself&mdash; and I have to emphasise this &mdash; in very difficult circumstances to be a moderating influence, to be highly responsible, to clearly want to see progress if at all possible made through dialogue and discussion. The ANC and Nelson Mandela are saying to us now: do not lift sanctions, do not ease sanctions, the pressure must be kept up no matter how strong the countervailing arguments.  This is a point of view that we must all take seriously.</P>
    <P>For the record, the Fine Gael view &mdash;<Col N="1077" /> and I suspect this is the view of most parties in the House; the other amendment showed there are obvious differences of tactics &mdash; is that the declaration which was adopted by consensus in the UN General Assembly in December 1989, in terms both of the goals to be achieved and the conditions, must remain the basis of policy.  The goals, the objectives, as expressed then by consensus was the abolition of apartheid, which included among other things that South Africa should become a united, non-racial and democratic state, that all its people should have the right to participate in the government and administration of the country on the basis of universal equal suffrage under a non-racial voters role and by secret ballot in a united and non-fragmented South Africa.</P>
    <P>That, obviously, is the long-term objective but that declaration lists the five conditions which are mentioned in our amendment today as preconditions to create the necessary climate for the actual negotiations.  These five are: first, the release of all political prisoners and detainees unconditionally and to refrain from imposing any restrictions on them; second, to lift all bans and restrictions on all proscribed and restricted organisations and persons; third, to remove the troops from the townships; fourth, to end the state of emergency and repeal all legislation, such as the Internal Security Act, which is designed to circumscribe political activity; and, fifth, to cease all political trials and political executions. These are the five conditions which the UN General Assembly adopted by consensus as the preconditions which should be satisfied before sanctions are raised.  I think at the present time it is wiser for us to follow along that particular line and those preconditions.  For that reason we will be saying there should be no easing at the present time on the question of sanctions.</P>
    <P>I would say, however, that it is comparatively easy for us in this country to strike attitudes on questions like this because it does not cost us a great deal. If we are serious about helping events <Col N="1078" /> in South Africa there are a number of smaller specific things we could do in promoting good relations.  Again, I think within the confines of sanctions, there is scope for a great deal of academic exchange in the bringing over here and training of people who will be assuming positions of great responsibility in the future in South Africa.  I would like to see some of the leading young blacks of South Africa, as part of university exchange programmes in this country, being trained for the day when they will have to accept responsibility, whether it be in financial, economic or educational matters in their own country.  Irish business, some of our bigger companies, could play a part in bringing people and arranging exchange programmes to train some of these people for the conditions in which trained expert black people will be essential to the survival and development of South Africa.  There is plenty of room in our Civil Service to help in the training of people such as this for a role which they could play in the future of South Africa.  Likewise, for our trade unions, who have taken a leading part in the fight against apartheid and in the imposition of sanctions, there is plenty of scope for them to become involved in a practical way in matters like this, as indeed there is for the Churches.  There is a whole range of ways which we do not particularly look at maybe because we are a little to obsessed with the major issue of sanctions.  If we are serious and if we are putting our money where our mouth is, if we want to see practical steps taken to show our sincerity in this matter, there is plenty of scope for all sections of our community, led perhaps by Government, led by academia or by unions, to get involved in developing measures along the lines I have just indicated.</P>
    <P>I can be very brief about the other part of the amendment, that is, the failure of this House &mdash; I am not going to assign any particular blame on this &mdash; to arrange for Mr. Nelson Mandela to address a joint sitting or for Members of the Seanad to be part of the occasion when Mr. Mandela arrives to speak to the other House. I do not think there is any need to labour <Col N="1079" /> the point.  I would simply urge the Leader of the House, the Government side, to make every effort to ensure that this House is fully involved in welcoming Nelson Mandela, that we are present, not as spectators but in some official capacity, and to ensure that this is a fully bicameral welcome which is made to Mr. Nelson Mandela.</P>
    <P>On that point I conclude by saying that I accept totally the sincerity of the two Senators who proposed the other amendment. I applaud them for having gone to see for themselves.  It is something which I hope will become a regular part of our relations with South Africa on this subject over the future months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. In a way there is a certain sense of <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> watching the Tsar in aspects of this debate in a sense that matters are in train in South Africa which have developed their own internal dynamism and which will certainly continue to do so.  The question of South Africa is one that always evokes a very emotive response because it is probably an aspect of deteriorated anti-democracy in other parts of the world to which people have been most exposed over a long period of years and because of that any development or any movement in it always leads to a great deal of soul searching.  I would also like to put on the record my views, as Senator Manning has done &mdash; I do not wish to personalise the debate &mdash; about the decision of my colleagues, Senator Murphy and Senator Ross, to visit South Africa.  I really believe there has been an awful lot of claptrap spoken about it. There has been an awful lot of facile, indiscriminate comment about it.  It is as well that it should be looked at.  I have taken the view from the very beginning that I did not agree that they should have gone to South Africa.  I still maintain that view.  I did not agree to it for the reasons I propose to outline.  Having said that, they are public representatives in their own right and they made a decision on consideration of the facts available to them.  It has been presented by some <Col N="1080" /> people as if they were simply going on a junket just to travel at all costs.  That is unfair, unjust and incorrect in the case of the two people involved.  I respect their judgment although I do not agree with their decision, but they have been there and I think their arguments and the positions they have taken are worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>I have always opposed intolerance at all levels.  I think it is our function as public representatives to argue from philosophical positions.  I want to put clearly on the record that my colleagues adopted a very strong philosophical position on the question of South Africa both before they went and since their return.  I also want to put even more strongly on the record that I utterly disagree with the point of view they have decided to adopt, but that is not new.  However, I think their point of view should be listened and responded to.  I have no doubt that this type of discussion and argument will always lead to modification of views on all sides.  That is the purpose of discussion; that is the purpose of argument. This idea that it is all black and white &mdash; to coin a phrase and not to make a pun of it &mdash; is certainly not the case.  There are points of view that need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I feel that the whole question of the future of South Africa and the future of Africa are closely bound together.  We need to look at South Africa in the context of the new Africa, an Africa which over a period of years has become post-exploration, post-colonisation and indeed post-proslytisation, an Africa which will be free and democratic.  In that context South Africa itself and its democracy, if there is an emerging democracy there, is certainly a very fragile flower at this point and needs to be nursed along.  The point of this debate is: how does one nurse the flower of democracy to grow through the democratic wasteland of South Africa?  That is the responsibility of states and public representatives the world over.  That is the reason for the debate here and that is the way we need to develop.  I think that responsibility includes all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the trade <Col N="1081" /> union movement.  That is one group.  The trade union movement has always been to the fore in looking at the needs of the Third World and indeed of the Second World and other aspects of global affairs. The trade union movement, on a number of occasions over the last number of years, has been invited by the South African unions to travel to South Africa. Indeed, the Churches have regularly been invited to send representative groups to South Africa.  Third World groups and committees have been asked to send representatives to South Africa. I want to put that point firmly on the record, because it has been clearly the position of many groups that it has been necessary to send observers to South Africa.</P>
    <P>In looking at what has happened there, I do not profess to be an expert.  We have a problem 60 miles away on this island, where it is impossible to find experts, and I certainly do not set myself up as being an expert on the situation in South Africa. However, I have given it a fair amount of study over a course of years, I have considered the situation in South Africa and I have learned a lot from colleagues in teacher unions, from teachers in the trade union movement in South Africa and through internationalists of various hues and types.  Therefore, I speak from that ground; I do not put myself forward as being an expert.  I will reject the views of anybody who set themselves up to be the experts on South Africa.  The reality is that with a country of that size it is hard to know who is an expert.</P>
    <P>Having said that, one has to decide from where does one take one's cue and direction.  I certainly will be dealing with that as well.  Apartheid itself has been a system of social engineering for the last 40 years in South Africa and indeed probably far beyond that.  From my point of view it, more than anything else, has been an educational system.  My introduction to apartheid was as an educational system, a system of social engineering. That is the way it was explained to me the first time I studied it.  It was under the heading of comparative education.</P>
    <P>When I hear people talking about <Col N="1082" /> situations in South Africa, the use of words is important to me in describing the educational system or any other social system there.  There are certain words which to me are key phrases.  One classic cliché is the multiracial one; I reject that one.  &ldquo;Multiracial&rdquo; is racist and it can be nothing else.  It is either racist or non-racist as far as I am concerned.  Multi-racial is just controlled racism; it is racism under another name.  I do not accept the concept, for instance, of multiracial schools, multiracial educational systems or multiracial anything in South Africa where people have tried to present this as moving forward.  It is not that.  It is racist controlled.</P>
    <P>Over the period of 40 years we have seen in apartheid a constitutionalised, legalised doctrine of white supremacy.  It has enshrined the concept of discrimination. Of course, it has been opposed, it has been seen as pernicious, invidious, and it certainly has been seen as undemocratic.  It is anathema to civilisation at any level.  I am conscious in saying this that I am stating well known truths and it is important that during the discussion we keep that clearly in mind. The view is often held that so much has already been said about apartheid in South Africa that no more remains to be said but I like to hear people talk about it.  I would like Members to clearly state their views on apartheid because not everybody is opposed to it.  Somebody referred earlier to the new emerging white fascism but I have always considered fascism to be white.  It is certainly a white tradition.  Some people support the idea of white supremacy, some support the idea of fascism and others support the idea of racism.  Part of the problem with regard to education is that people have not made a distinction between those different labels.</P>
    <P>In South Africa the system of apartheid has permeated and controlled all aspects of life, whether it be health, education, employment, or housing and we are all aware of this.  That has been recorded in books, films, songs, documentaries, folklore and surveys down through the years.  Recently a film on apartheid won <Col N="1083" /> Oscars and a book based on the apartheid system won the Booker Prize.  Therefore, it is a reality, and we must ask ourselves where we are going at this stage.</P>
    <P>The key figures for me in South Africa &mdash; this again is a subjective opinion &mdash; are de Klerk and Mandela.  I accept the point made about Buthelazi, and there are others also, but speak from the point of view of the people who represent both sides of the argument.  Perhaps that is a facile statement, but the people who represent both sides of the division are de Klerk and Mandela.  They are both world leaders by any standard.</P>
    <P>I see de Klerk as a figure, tragically similar to Terence O'Neill and, perhaps, President Gorbachev and others, who try to bring change.  Change is always dangerous.  The nature of the beast is conservative, that of maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  Change is resisted in all walks of life.  President de Klerk has been making changes but I do not want to go overboard on that.  The change taking place in South Africa is a direct result of pressure from the rest of the world, pressure which has clearly been the result of the policy on sanctions against South Africa.  The views, policies and movement by de Klerk would not have taken place of their own volition.  They have been the result of pressure from the world outside South Africa and I believe were that pressure to be relieved in any way the speed of change would slow down. The speed of change is a direct result of the force and pressure of the sanctions in place at the moment.</P>
    <P>Nelson Mandela and President de Klerk have worked closely together &mdash; this is a personal view &mdash; over the past number of months.  The release of Mandela, his various speeches, including his initial speech in support of the armed struggle and all the developments since that time have been part of a pattern.  It is a credit to both men that the recent talks on the armed forces, for instance, were dealt with and disposed of with such speed.  That aspect alone has been phenomenal.</P>
    <P>What is leadership about, if it is not <Col N="1084" /> about courage?  What is leadership about if it is not the desire to modify, improve and to make progress?  It must do these things.  It is not a question of thanking Mr. de Klerk for bringing us an infinitesimal move forward from where we were before.  The decision last week to lift the state of emergency takes us back to where we were some years ago.  The requirement of leadership is to seek change, bring about modifications of the system, consolidate that position, to put forward new policies, argue new positions, to make progress, to consolidate and to begin again.  Change must take place gradually.</P>
    <P>I accept the point, which was made by the mover of the motion, and which I believe will be the view of all, that there should be a significant recognition of the change that de Klerk appears to want and has brought about so far.  In cultivating the flower of democracy in South Africa we need to respond to what de Klerk has done already and assure him that it is recognised.  That should give him the power to consolidate support for himself. That does not mean lifting sanctions and opening doors, I firmly believe the opposite.</P>
    <P>There is a tightrope of leadership which both Mandela and de Klerk are going to have to walk at this point.  With the pressures from the radicals in their own groups, is significant that some of the fascist groups in South Africa are now issuing statements along the lines of those that were sent out by the ANC in recent times.  Perhaps that is a sign of the change that has taken place there.  The fact that white supremists now believe they are suffering in the same way as black people suffered at other times is important.</P>
    <P>The sanctions and the embargoes have worked.  They have led to the position where de Klerk found it politically expedient to make changes.  The sanctions and embargoes have convinced de Klerk to take a risk with his own people in order to save South Africa, because those were the stark choices facing him. There are no options in South Africa, there are merely alternatives.  It is either change or revolution and they will both <Col N="1085" /> eventually lead to the same result.  It is a matter of doing it in a peaceful, structured and democratic way or forcing people to resist by force the oppression which they have experienced.</P>
    <P>There is no case for the lifting of commercial, financial and economic sanctions in South Africa.  Arguments have not been put forward which convince me on those issues.  The hard economic pressure must be maintained.  Over the last week developments have taken place which have convinced me further on this.  Nelson Mandela, speaking in Strasbourg this week, pleaded with the European Community to maintain &mdash; not to lift &mdash; the sanctions against South Africa.  The argument might well be made as to why one should listen to Nelson Mandela as opposed to Chief Buthelezi or somebody else.  I see Nelson Mandela as the person representing the other side of the argument, as it were.  I take my cue from his statements, policies and views articulated, expressed and developed by the African National Congress.</P>
    <P>This week in his capacity as President of the European Community, the Taoiseach made the case that sanctions should be continued.  I suggest that the amendment which I am seconding is in line with Government policy and with the articulated Government position taken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently and by the Taoiseach this week. It is also in line with the policy of the European Community.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment in good faith.</P>
    <P>Since the original Government motion was framed last Thursday statements have been made by Nelson Mandela in Strasbourg and by the Taoiseach in Europe which I articulate in my amendment. I see no case for the Government not accepting amendment No. 1 and I ask the Minister to consider it.  It calls on the Government to maintain the necessary pressure, including the continued imposition of sanctions, in accordance with the five principles enunciated by the 16th session of the UN.  Those five principles have been put on the record by Senator Manning.  The point has been made that <Col N="1086" /> the UN will continue to promote profound and irreversible change but that is not the position.  Those five conditions, outlined by Senator Manning, must be met before the UN agree to lift economic sanctions.</P>
    <P>We should make some gesture towards President de Klerk to show him that we appreciate movement and change.  Economic, financial and commercial sanctions should be maintained and pressure in the placing of those sanctions should also be maintained.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the question of cultural interaction should be examined.  Sporting contacts should be reviewed, and I use the word &ldquo;reviewed&rdquo; carefully.  I am not saying that these sanctions should be lifted at this point because I do not know enough about the changes which are taking place in South Africa.  However, as there is some change, we need to review our position.  There should be balance on both sides and I am prepared to look at the question of culture interaction and sporting contact.</P>
    <P>I will make a final reference to political visits.  I have given this matter much thought over the last number of months. I disagreed with my colleagues going to South Africa and I gave the reasons. There should be a controlled approach to this question but the embargo on political contact and political visits should be lifted.  I am not talking about people going as guests of the South African Government or institutions of the South African state.  I do not want to hear about the position in South Africa from people in different countries in the Western world but from parliamentary colleagues who go in a properly structured context. It is time we reviewed our position on cultural interaction, sporting contacts and political visits to South Africa.</P>
    <P>The final aspect of the amendment deals with welcoming Mr. Nelson Mandela to Ireland.  I want to clearly state the position.  The protocol of the Houses of the Oireachtas to date has been that only Heads of State address joint meetings of both Houses.  That might well be the case but we are talking here about change.  The whole debate has <Col N="1087" /> been about change.  I want to tell the people in the Department of the Taoiseach that change also extends to their Department and that the protocol section needs to be reassessed.  Nelson Mandela may not be a Head of State but he is the head of a nation and chief of his people and he should be accorded the dignity and respect which goes with that.  I will insist that Members of this House are invited to hear the address of Mr. Nelson Mandela.  I am not saying he should address both Houses or that he should address a joint meeting of both Houses, but Members of this House should be invited to the session which he will address.  Out of respect for Nelson Mandela and in deference to this House, an invitation should be extended to its Members to participate in that function.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the debate has taken place and I look forward to hearing other points of view.  Later we will decide whether these matters need to be put to a vote.  Again, I ask the Government side to accept the amendment, which is completely in line with Government, European and UN policy.</P>

      <P>We are having a useful debate on South Africa which includes the motion by the Government which I moved.  It also includes an amendment moved by Senator Manning and seconded by Senator O'Toole.  The third amendment has been referred to by both Senators but there is another amendment and if it is agreeable to the House we will be willing to allow one of the movers of that amendment to contribute now because they have a slightly different point of view.  We are all agreed, in principle, on our abhorrence of apartheid and our anxiety to see things progress.  There is a point of view and we believe it would be helpful if one of those speakers was permitted to address the House at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the motion and I would like that the House would see our amendment as a qualification of the motion rather than <Col N="1088" /> being in direct confrontation with it.  We would have no intention, even if we had stronger support, of actually pressing the amendment.  We disagree with some of the emphasis in the motion and therefore, we have substituted the word &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; for &ldquo;notes&rdquo; because we think that the intentions are so clear and so positive that we should signal a welcome instead of the rather neutral business of &ldquo;noting&rdquo; the reform programme.  More importantly, however, we disagree with the implications of the phrase &ldquo;necessary pressures&rdquo; and we disagree, more specifically, with the other amendment which calls for the maintenance of sanctions. We do not think that is the right strategy to ensure a continuation of the reform policy now under way, we would stress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House knows by now that Senator Ross and I have come back from a two week tour of South Africa.  I would like to thank Senators Manning and O'Toole for their understanding of our position and, indeed, to Senator Manning, particularly, for his outright vindication of our decision to go.  It is interesting that the debate has somehow shifted to the middle, even in the context of Senator O'Toole's more radical contribution.  I would like, however, to emphasise that I never agonised for a moment about going to South Africa.  I did not lie awake at night wondering whether I would or would not go.  I never believed in censorship of any kind and I never believed in cultural restrictions.  I do not believe any good has been done by preventing intellectuals from going to South Africa and arguing with their counterparts.  In any case, in the context of the last few months, any talk of restrictions is increasingly idiotic and when we went there we found that that was very much so.  We found we need not have agonised about our visit.  Our visit was accepted as quite natural on the Left as well as on the Right.  Nobody asked us for our credentials in that regard.  I would like to point out, too, that we were not on a junket, that was a silly point to make; we were on a quite intensive, hard working <Col N="1089" /> schedule for two weeks.  We came to certain conclusions and it is on those conclusions that I wish to dwell for the remainder of my contribution.</P>
    <P>Of course, I assure Senator O'Toole that both Senator Ross and I regard apartheid as an absolutely heinous system, to quote the words of an Indian Minister of Government whom we met and who was extremely critical of the ANC but who shared with blacks a philosophical and profound emotional objection to the whole system of apartheid.  I do not see how anyone can justify the system as such.  White South Africans are now becoming ashamed, rather like liberal Unionists in Northern Ireland. They went along with the system because it suited them but would not we all?  Does the House not think that if we had a helot and suppressed community here who were ensuring our standard of living we would rise and revolt against the Government which represented us?</P>
    <P>The white South Africans' position is understandable in that regard.  The whole world changed for them on 2 February. In conversation they drop the date 2 February again and again.  It is rather like the way revoluntionary Americans must have felt about the 4th of July.  It is a critical date in their history; they do not know how extensive the change is going to be, but the sense of change and the sense of their awareness of change is absolutely palpable.</P>
    <P>Everyone is convinced that de Klerk's Government is sincere, and by everyone I mean opinions in ANC circles as well as in white South Africa.  We have been told &mdash; and we have no reason to disbelieve it &mdash; that personally he is going for broke and that he has no interest in his own future political career if it involves back-tracking on what he has promised so far.  The lifting of the state of emergency is another proof of the sincerity of his intentions.  There is no going back; reform is irreversible, irrespective of the attitude of the international community. The abolition of apartheid now has its own momentum and cannot be stopped. It is not a question of abolishing apartheid, it is a question of when and in what <Col N="1090" /> political and constitutional circumstances the whole system will crumble.</P>
    <P>F. W. de Klerk is a courageous man, rather like Brian Faulkner in 1974 or, perhaps, the late Lord O'Neill in 1968-69. He realised &mdash; let us put aside for the moment what caused him to realise it &mdash; at a certain point that his people had to be taken by the scruff of the neck and brought into a new post-apartheid South Africa.  He did this without any mandate from them.  The National Party whom he leads are in disarray to a certain extent because he took their core values &mdash; if I will be forgiven for using the phrase &mdash; away from them overnight and they are not sure what they stand for any more.  He is a man of great courage, a man in the Faulkner, O'Neill tradition and praised even by his enemies.</P>
    <P>Apartheid, taking the word in total, cannot be abolished overnight.  The Taoiseach was asked on a television programme on Tuesday night what further steps the South African Government would need to take in order for sanctions to be dropped.  He replied by quoting Nelson Mandela's own phrase, that Mandela went into jail 28 years ago and had no vote and when he came out he had no vote.  The Taoiseach's implication seems to me to be rather simplistic, namely, if de Klerk announces that there will be universal franchise in the morning and that is implemented, then sanctions will be lifted.  The fact is that apartheid forms the basis of the present constitution. Apartheid in its entirety is not going to go until that constitution is replaced by another, which is the subject of the talks which are going on at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would like the House to know that much of apartheid in the informal or petty sense, as the word is used, is a thing of the past and that much of apartheid is a dead letter in the sense that the separate amenities as far as the eye could see no longer apply.  Certainly, segregation no longer exists on beaches, trains, hospitals or public transport.  One is no longer conscious there of any segregated policy. Education, of course, will be much more controversial, as we discovered when we were out there.  Whether integrated <Col N="1091" /> education will be mandatory in the new South Africa or whether well off whites will have the choice of keeping their children at white schools in a private system, is not yet clear.  Even the Group Areas Act, from what we could gather, is not rigidly enforced.  In fact, much comment was made in a case where a very persistent Indian businessman had moved into a white area, had defied local white sentiment and was belatedly being prosecuted by their counterpart of the Attorney General.  The fact that so much publicity was given to this, indicated that the Group Areas Act itself is also falling into disuse.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the South African Government are allowing the legal structures to crumble as a way of conditioning the white South Africans to accepting the more formal ending of apartheid.  Let us remember also that the formal ending of apartheid is not going to solve everything. The fact that the Group Areas Act is abolished does not mean that the person living in the black shanty town of Crossroads can immediately move in to the affluent white suburbs of Cape Town any more than the unemployed labourer in Ballymun can purchase a six figure house in Dublin 4.  You do not need a law on apartheid to ensure that type of division. The psychological problems against the abolition of apartheid are enormous. There is no doubt that we met with racist attitudes &mdash; in a few honest cases, open racist attitudes.  I met a businessman who told me, quite frankly, that blacks are not ready for political participation and will not be for several centuries hence and that the whole thing was a ghastly mistake; South Africa should have stood firm against the outside world and handled its own resources properly to keep the apartheid system going.  You do not get that kind of blatant attitude everywhere but you learn to read the signals.  For example, a common phrase is &ldquo;culturally different&rdquo;.  We were told again and again, &ldquo;You must understand, of course, that blacks are culturally different from us&rdquo;. There is obviously the legacy of centuries of unconscious attitudes of white ruling <Col N="1092" /> black for over three centuries.  This kind of ugly racism raised its head in particular places, particularly in the bloodshed that took place in, ironically named, Welkom, in Natal, when we were there and which was due to flagrant white racist attitudes.  Attitudes vary from region to region and from one kind of white South African to another. Obviously the English speaking South Africans are less racist than the Afrikaners and so on.</P>
    <P>There is widespread private discussion of what the change will mean.  There is no shortage of private argument but curiously, there is little public discussion.  It seemed to me that newspapers, and particularly radio and television, were very bland in their attitude towards it.  It is remarkable how little public discussion there was on the Government controlled television.  The Minister for Communications would probably be very happy to be part of the South African Government in that regard.  What is emerging is a belated liberal Afrikaner opinion and my view that opinion should be encouraged by every means at the disposal of the international community.</P>
    <P>We are not talking just about the repeal of apartheid, we are talking about the wider matter of constitutional change, and there are enormous difficulties here, although talks about talks are going well. The peculiar thing is that while Mr. Mandela is maintaining a particular ANC line of propaganda in Europe, back at the ranch they are getting on with the business of talking about talks.  Our information is that they are going reasonably well.</P>
    <P>How are you going to get a constitution which will give universal franchise, on the one hand, but which will protect the rights of whites to individual freedom?  Will their rights to property be maintained?  Will that be enshrined in a bill of rights?  If so, will the new South Africa have any real social and economic meaning?  These are some of the questions being discussed and they are enormously complicated.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Mr. Mandela to <Col N="1093" /> say the other day, somewhere in Europe: &ldquo;Why can we not have one man one vote, universal franchise.  It is good enough for the Europeans, it should be good enough for South Africa&rdquo;.  It seems to me that ignores the realities of the situation. There is there a white minority, a white ascendancy, well entrenched, responsible for the infrastructure of the country, responsible for developing the country.  I do not think it will contribute to peaceful change in South Africa if you simply brush them aside, if you say: &ldquo;We are not interested in consensus, we are simply going to establish a `winner takes all' system&rdquo;.  That way you are not going to have peaceful change.  In some way that has to be taken account of in a new constitution, however that is done &mdash; proportional representation, a bill of rights, a second chamber, etc. &mdash; but that will all take time and infinite patience.  I agree with Senator O'Toole that it is only the ANC-Government dialogue which can hold out any hope of a peaceful solution. Let us remember that to the extent that we can influence and can contribute to a successful outcome in South Africa, it is a peaceful outcome we are interested in.</P>
    <P>Beyond all those problems again, you have the problem of how you are going to get 30 million or so South Africans of varying shades, tribes, regions and classes to acknowledge that they are all South Africans and give South Africa a common allegiance.  God knows, historically and politically, we find it difficult enough in this country to give practical affirmation to our lip service to the common name of Irishman.  Our problems are very small scale compared to theirs.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see the alignments in the amendments.  I did not think I would live to see the day when Senators Joe O'Toole and Brendan Ryan would be pillars of the Establishment, not only the Irish Establishment, against which Senator Ryan continually rails, but pillars of the European Establishment as well.  I notice Senator Ryan's name is not down to the amendments; perhaps he is going to enter one of his own in the name of <Col N="1094" /> the armed struggle.  That remains to be seen.</P>

We tried to express the situation according to our own prejudices.  Some of them are aware of the historic rapport that existed between Irish nationalists and the Boers a century or so ago.  They were interested in why Ireland was particularly adamant.  They are aware of the Presidency of the Community and they are aware that we have exerted a disproportionate influence on Community policy at present.</P>

It is now becoming a reasonable minority European view.  It is the view of such a respected South African progressive as Helen Suzman who is a great friend of Nelson Mandela and of other ANC leaders.  She is going to be conferred with honorary degrees in these islands in the next month or so and she is absolutely certain that sanctions have, to say the least, done their work.</P>

      <P>I will defer to your <Col N="1095" /> ruling.  We think the whole thing about sanctions is inconsistent and hypocritical, that it is not the only catalyst of change, that it does cause suffering to blacks and that cannot be sneered away or scoffed away.  It does not affect people like Archbishop Tutu living in his magnificent quarters in Bishopscourt in Capetown.  It does cause suffering to the small businessman and to the lower level of blacks.  We believe that change is irreversible.  We believe the de Klerk Government must now be encouraged, not censured, that he must be encouraged against his own right wing.  We believe that sanctions are targeting the wrong enemy, that de Klerk is not the enemy any more, and that what must be done now is to strengthen him against the white backlash which is the great fear of all the South Africans we spoke to.</P>
      <P>Let me conclude by giving a warning here.  It seemed to me that when Senator Manning was making his case about the maintenance of sanctions, his firmest card was that Mr. Mandela had said sanctions should be maintained.  We should ask ourselves whether Mr. Mandela really represents the voice of black South Africa.  He is given to speaking about the people of South Africa as if he represented the whole people.  We should, of course, respect his nobility and his generosity of character but let us not think he is infallible.  That is a mistake we may make in the next month or so.  We should not give his utterances automatic assent.</P>
      <P>It all depends on what we want.  What do we want to see?  There are people here in this country who from their armchairs shout &ldquo;Amandla&rdquo; and raise their clenched fists.  It is easy for them to do that, irrespective of what will happen in South Africa.  Those of us who want to see a peaceful outcome, a consensus, who realise how complicated is the situation in South Africa would do well to bring a great deal of responsibility to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the motion which I think is a good one.  It is <Col N="1096" /> worth while taking a look at what happened originally.  It is worth going back a little on history.  It was by the South Africa Act of 1909 that the British Parliament decided that the country should become independent as a dominion in 1910 but the British, as they have a habit of doing, left the vexed question of the native franchise to the South African Government to determine.  It was after the British handed over control that the seeds of white supremacy were sown. During the next four decades the political status of the non-white, particularly the black African, deteriorated considerably. The Miners and Workers (Amendment) Act, 1926 which permitted discrimination against native blacks and the Representation of Natives Act, 1936 which removed qualified Africans from the common voters roll at the Cape are two examples of copper-fastening this white supremacy.  It was in 1948 that D. F. Malan's Nationalist Party won the election when he defeated Field Marshal J. C. Smuts United Party. Malan's appeal was almost exclusively to the Afrikaner &ldquo;Volk&rdquo;.  He told them they had suffered at the hands of the British but, more importantly, he stirred up fears that the growing threat of native Africans moving closer to traditional white areas would threaten them.  He argued that if this urban influx was not halted it would threaten not merely white employment and white lifestyle but the very purity of the white race.  It was in this way really that the seeds of apartheid were sown; it was born and it developed very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apartheid involved the separation of white and non-white in all spheres of life except work.  Malan and then Strydom and then Verwoerd proceeded to enact legislation that wrote &ldquo;race&rdquo; into the whole constitutional fabric of South Africa.  There is a huge list of oppressive laws and legislation but the three principal ones are the Population Registration Act, 1949, the Group Areas Act, 1950 and the Separate Amenities Act, 1953.  These were the main supports of the apartheid system and these are still on the Statute Book and still enacted <Col N="1097" /> today.  The examples of discrimination are manifold.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about sanctions and their maintenance.  A previous speaker asked for a review.  Of course we should have a review of what we are doing and I support that idea but I am opposed to changing our stance until a substantial reciprocal change really takes place.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the third report of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries entitled &ldquo;Apartheid and the Development in Southern Africa&rdquo;.  I want to refer to section 14 which says although cases involving parole labour rarely reach the courts, court proceedings are the principal source of information.  Evidence was quoted from the Amnesty Report &mdash; South Africa (Imprisonment under the Pass Laws), January 1986 &mdash; to illustrate both that the parole system was deliberately used a source of cheap labour and that working and living conditions of parolees are inhuman.  That slave labour still exists today despite what anybody says.  I have proof of that.  There is a whole section of the African population who live in abject poverty.  Slave labour and poverty exist and I defy anyone to prove otherwise.</P>
    <P>The only way to bring about change is by exerting, and indeed extending, pressure on the South African Government. F. W. de Klerk has been praised as being a courageous man &mdash; perhaps he is, I will not say he is not.  I would prefer to think he is a pragmatic man and he sees the writing on the wall.  It is only because multinationals pulled out of South Africa and it is only because of the work of the Anti-Apartheid Movement and because of economic sanctions that there has been any response from the South African Government.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to one of the recent visitors to South Africa.  I agree with Senator Manning that the two Senators who visited South Africa recently had absolutely every right to visit the country both as private individuals and as parliamentarians.  In fact, they <Col N="1098" /> have a duty and not merely a right to go and to listen and learn.  I am interested in the views they bring back because they have obviously been to South Africa while the rest of us have not.  We have to listen to some extent to what they say. The previous speaker said that the whites, of course, have rights.  They have rights, natural human rights, but they also have a lot of so-called rights which are based exclusively on their white status.  It is these rights that should not be preserved.</P>
    <P>One of the previous speakers said that it would not be timely to bring in the concept of one man, one vote as asked for by Nelson Mandela.  It is precisely because this vote does not exist that the whites can exercise so much control.  I would hope that we would maintain sanctions. To say that Nelson Mandela is not the voice of the African people is true in one way but it is rather a sweeping statement.  Who is the voice of South Africa if he is not?  Above all, people in the world today look to him as that particular voice and he has called for the maintenance of sanctions.  The Taoiseach as President of the European Council has called for the maintenance of sanctions and the only one out of step is perhaps Margaret Thatcher who probably has a lot of interests in South Africa.  I do not know.</P>
    <P>I urge the House to support this motion because it has shown that the only way change can be brought about is by the continual agitation from inside and by force from outside exerting pressure for change.  The whites in South Africa had a very comfortable relationship.  I have met many people who lived in South Africa.  They had very cheap black labour who lived in hovels at the bottom of their gardens or in townships far away from them.  They were not going to change of their own accord because life was too comfortable.  It is rather like the way the unionists had a comfortable existence for a long time with the old Northern Ireland Parliament.</P>
    <P>I agree with Professor Conroy who said it is difficult.  Mandela could be outflanked by younger and more radical <Col N="1099" /> elements in the ANC and the PAC which does not believe in multi-racial democracy. Also the paramilitary Afrikaner Wehrstands Bewegung might release a white backlash in support of the Conservative Party, which would open up the possibility of a civil war.  We should try to help in any way we can to stop it.</P>
    <P>I agree with one or two of the previous speakers who said that change must come about slowly.  So it must.  But there are some changes which must come quickly and that is basic human rights; the right to vote, the right to work, the right to participate in everything that a person does which is not based on colour.  That really is what this is all about.  The sooner those rights are granted then the sooner sanctions can be lifted.  If there is anyway we can help, we should do so.  We should support perhaps de Klerk and Mandela at the same time.  I believe that because de Klerk has shown his willingness to change, and he has made remarkable strides, he should be supported.  Nevertheless the sanctions should stay until substantial change has been shown to have been effected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate the issue on South Africa once again.  We debated it last February after the release of Nelson Mandela and we had a good discussion at that time.  It is most appropriate that we now have a wide-ranging debate on the issue again considering the developments that have taken place since that historic moment and the fact that it is going to be a major item on the final EC Summit to be held in Dublin under the Irish Presidency on 25 and 26 June.  It is a most appropriate time for this House to debate and put on the record its position in relation to the situation in South Africa and in relation to sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome and I agree with the motion from Fianna Fáil.  It is a correct motion and I will be supporting it.  I have no problems with the first amendment.  I have problems with the second amendment and I will be supporting the third amendment as well which, of course, is <Col N="1100" /> one which reflects statements that were made in this House on a number of occasions in relation to welcoming Mr. Nelson Mandela to Ireland and inviting him to address the Members of the House during his Irish visit.  We have requested that and my memory of the situation is that we were the first House of the Oireachtas to ask that Mr. Mandela be invited to Ireland and to address this House.  I understand now that at least we will have the opportunity of being present when he addresses the other House.  It would be preferable to have him address this House and thereby add that status and respect to this Upper House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We discussed this matter after 2 February when we heard the joyful news of the release of Nelson Mandela who had been a prisoner for 27 years.  It was a matter for considerable celebration in this country which had been so involved in the whole issue of the apartheid movement nationally and worldwide because apartheid in South Africa is an international issue of major proportions. Nelson Mandela was the symbol of a whole generation, a symbol of courage, a symbol of hope and a symbol of progress for a people who were in a huge numerical majority &mdash; 27 million blacks compared with six million whites &mdash; who had been deprived of human and civil rights for a long period.</P>
    <P>To achieve a movement in the apartheid system which had been widely condemned throughout the world, the United Nations were the first body that proposed a programme of sanctions at all levels, but concentrating on economic sanctions.  This was taken up throughout the world at various levels and degrees of operation.  The EC played its part in imposing collective sanctions on South Africa.  We, of course, as a member of the EC were to the fore from the beginning. There is a strong anti-apartheid movement in Ireland and there has been for years.  We have to pay tribute to the contribution that has been made by this country in opposing the apartheid system.  We have the anti-apartheid movement, and we have the Congress of <Col N="1101" /> Trade Unions and individual trade unions raising this issue at every level throughout the country.  The Dunnes Stores strikers raised the issue for well over 12 months. They did so in difficult circumstances and highlighted it as a national issue among ordinary men and women.  Fruit imports were banned specifically arising out of the Dunnes Stores movement.  The Irish Rugby Football Union initially took a decision to get involved and go to South Africa for their centenary celebrations. They subsequently apologised and said they would never again get involved with South Africa as long as the apartheid system existed and that they would abide by the sanctions.</P>
    <P>The question of course now is should sanctions be dismantled.  Have we reached the stage where sanctions have fulfilled their function, and we can think about dismantling the sanctions?  The release of Nelson Mandela is the first major step in the direction of dismantling the apartheid system because he is such a potent symbol of opposition to that system.  President de Klerk and the Nationalist Party have embarked on a reform programme.  We have seen the unbanning of the ANC and the lifting of the state of emergency.  These are extremely important developments.  We have seen a degree of segregation not being enforced as rigidly as in previous years.  Senator Murphy said that the Group Areas Act is no longer as potent a force as it was in the past.  We will have to take his word on that.</P>
    <P>At the same time we see part of the fallout of the situation.  The more steps that are taken towards dismantling the system the more momentum and impetus is given to those who do not wish to dismantle the system.  That has been obvious in relation to the Conservative Party which has been making a lot of noise, having a lot of rallies and indeed has been successful in the recent by-election in Umhlatuzi.  The people of the Right, the people who want to maintain the inequality, who want to maintain the subservience of blacks even though they are in the vast majority, have been given a certain amount of impetus.  However, <Col N="1102" /> we should not pay too much attention to that last election because that election in Umhlatuzi was in a very strong white, English speaking area and is not representative of the country nationally.</P>
    <P>We have on the other side, to my mind, an even greater problem, that is the question of black versus black.  South Africa is still very much a tribal nation.  We saw that in so many other African countries that got independence where boundaries had been established by colonial nations on a geographical basis, not on a tribal or ethnic basis.  In South Africa there certainly is a very strong Zulu population. The Zulus are very powerful, quantitatively speaking, and traditionally and historically a warlike people.  In terms of their present numbers, particularly around the Natal Province there is a major problem of who exactly represents the black people of Africa and whether black man and black man can come together in unity rather than as at present, where there is considerable diversity and a tremendous amount of violence, injuries, maimings and deaths taking place.  That to my mind is the wider context in which this discussion has to take place.  It is one thing to see the black majority versus the white minority and dismantling the apartheid system, but within the black majority there is a need for peaceful integration and peaceful power-sharing.  Those are the forces that have been unleashed since we were debating this issue three or four months ago.</P>
    <P>I listened to the radio interviews yesterday on the death of Terence O'Neill and the movements that had been made by him towards the dismantling of what one might describe as an apartheid system in Northern Ireland, where one community was discriminated against in every sense, economically, socially, culturally and so on by another community. The one thing that came through all of the interviews with those who had been civil rights leaders in Northern Ireland was that no matter what step was taken there was the demand for one man one vote &mdash; nowadays we would say one person, one vote.  That was the bottom <Col N="1103" /> line.  That was the line that prescribed equality; one person is equal to another, irrespective of the colour of his skin, religion, cultural or ethnic difference, or whatever.  There is a sense of <i>déjá vu</i> about South Africa, the call for one person, one vote.  The dismantling of any system of apartheid or inequality comes about only when individuals are treated equally.  There is no way around that; no way of saying that some person for whatever reason has not got the same 100 per cent entitlement.  That principle can be demonstrated in political terms only in the context of democratic voting rights. That involves powersharing &mdash; one person, one vote &mdash; and must require the dismantling of apartheid.  That must be granted.  We have to think in those terms. Until that is done, we have not got to the core of the system.  Until political rights are there and all people have a say in the governing of the country and in the political system, until each person is treated as an equal, no matter what we say about progress, we have not achieved equality.  That must remain the bottom line.</P>
    <P>I have read what Senator Ross and Senator Murphy have said about their visits to South Africa I acknowledge all of that, that there is concern and anxiety from President de Klerk's point of view, from the nationalists' point of view, from the whites point of view, that it has been all &ldquo;give&rdquo; since 2 February.  They have been conceding right down along the line. They have been giving away along the line in releasing Mandela, unbanning the ANC, lifting the state of emergency.  All of those measures have been very welcome developments and have been seen as concessions.  But, what has been got in return?  The obvious thing that should be got in return from the whites point of view is the lifting of sanctions so that they would then be regarded as an equal community with any other community in the world.</P>
    <P>But how can you have a community equal to any other community in the world unless there is equality among the citizens of that community?  That is the <Col N="1104" /> question, the core, why I have a problem in coming to terms particularly with amendment No. 2.  I recognise the difficulties, the concerns, and anxieties and the polarisation that may take place.  I read in the paper today where 80 Members of the European Parliament have already signed a resolution to be debated today in the European Parliament calling for the lifting of sanctions, so there is a movement in that direction. We know that Margaret Thatcher clearly wants sanctions to be lifted.  She wants a move in relation to the EC.</P>
    <P>The final Summit is coming up on 25 and 26 June when the EC will address the situation in the light of the developments that have taken place.  Mandela, certainly for my generation, has been a symbol, he has been one of the people I have looked up to on the international stage.  He has acted very effectively since his release from prison.  He is a man of peace.  He won the Sakharov Peace Prize in 1988. He is a Freeman of Dublin and we will be delighted to see him addressing this House and the City on 2 July.  He addressed the Plenary Session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg yesterday and he put the case.  I have been following his journey since 4 June and all along the message was the same: that any relaxation of sanctions now would threaten negotiations that are talking place.  He stressed the need to maintain not just economic and political sanctions but also cultural and academic sanctions. We have to acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>Nelson Mandela showed himself to be a fine leader in prison and since he came out he has lived up to the respect he had earned inside.  His actual words in the European Parliament were as follows:</P>
    <P>The masses of our people must, therefore, continue the struggle within our country.  The international community shares the same obligation. That is why we continue to call on the peoples of the world to maintain sanctions.  We address the same call to this August Parliament with all the force and authority at our command.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would say that, he having so <Col N="1105" /> far used skilful judgment, having been a diplomat since his release and being the man at the heart of the developments that are taking place, this is not the time for us to go against his express wishes. The summit is about to take place, the man is about to address us here in the Oireachtas, he is to receive his honour as Freeman of the City.  Let us stand by his judgment, recognising that it has been good to date in diplomatic terms and in his negotiations and that he sees the continuation of sanctions at this point in all their force as being not just desirable but as a necessary part of the present negotiations.  Let us depend on his judgment, by what he stands for and let us continue with the sanctions until we get a strong indication that they have succeeded in dismantling the system and that the people who have been the victims of the system are prepared to acknowledge that and to say so.  That is where we should take our cue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important debate and I fully support our motion.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to pay a special tribute to Nelson Mandela, Deputy President of the ANC, who has spent many years in prison and over the years continued the struggle from behind bars.  The 1988 Peace Prize was presented to him this week.  This in itself is a tremendous achievement as it was recognition of his work over many long years in prison. Yesterday, he attended the European Parliament where he was given a standing ovation and the keynote of his address was that any relaxation of the sanctions would threaten the very process of negotiations on the future of South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers here this morning have referred to sanctions.  At this juncture I would like to congratulate Senator Murphy and Senator Ross on their recent visit.  I think they were quite entitled to visit there, both as private individuals and as parliamentarians and I certainly looked forward to what they would have had to say.  They had first class knowledge of the position there.  Nelson Mandela also pointed out that it was essential to maintain cultural, economic and political <Col N="1106" /> boycotts of South Africa.  He also pointed out that the ANC would not be expected to disarm while the South African Government continue to use force.  Mr. Mandela was awarded the 1988 Peace Prize for his commitment to the struggle against apartheid and recalled the political prisoners who died in custody in South Africa including the famous student leader Steve Biko.</P>
    <P>With regard to the EC Summit, I welcome the statement of the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerry Collins, that it is hoped the EC will take an agreed position on South Africa.  It is accepted that there is a lot of support for the progress being made by President de Klerk. Our position has been confirmed, we will fully support what Mr. de Klerk is doing, and it is agreed that he has made great progress and should be encouraged to continue.  The time has not yet arrived to change the position of sanctions and there is no doubt that dialogue is taking place between Mr. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela and that only good will come out of such dialogue.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mandela has to be congratulated for his drive and initiative.  He has pointed out on numerous occasions that any reduction in pressure on the Pretorian Government would diminish the impetus which is obliging the white population to accept change.  For this reason, the ANC insisted that the struggle continue as de-escalation would and could perpetuate the apartheid system.  Mr. Mandela availed of the opportunity when addressing the European Parliament this week to point out that the masses of his people must continue to struggle within the country and he was pleased that the international community shared the same obligation.  He called on the people of the world to maintain sanctions and he was seeking the full support of the European Parliament for this purpose.</P>
    <P>He went on to point out that sanctions were imposed as a peaceful means of ensuring an end to apartheid, that this has not yet been achieved, that it was only logical the existing sanctions be kept in place, that the situation should not be <Col N="1107" /> created where the people of South Africa would point an accusing finger at the Governments and peoples of the West, if, just when it seems movement was possible, they acted in a manner that denied positive development.  He said the ANC regard President de Klerk and his colleagues in the National Party as people of integrity who speak honestly when they claim to seek an end to apartheid.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, Nelson Mandela is a figurehead, a courageous man, who speaks with authority.  I trust and hope that the world will continue to listen to him.  I believe the sanctions should be maintained, as requested by Nelson Mandela, until such time as changes have taken place, and are accepted, in dismantling the apartheid system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be the last person who would feel in any sense entitled to act judgmentally on a colleague and to impugn any wrong motivation on the part of the Senators who travelled to South Africa.  I would not set myself up on that basis at all, nor would I feel qualified to do so.  I would just make the point to the House &mdash; and it would be less than honest of me not to say it at the outset &mdash; that I am one of the people who believe that that visit was a mistake.  I am also prepared to accept that the motivation for it may have been of the very best kind, but I do believe the visit was a mistake because of the pivotal position of the two Senators in our society and, secondly, because of the stage reached in the evolution of South African society.  I did not lightly or flippantly, or in any populist way, make that point.  I make it in a controlled fashion because this is not an occasion for mob rhetoric nor is it an occasion for scoring points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I genuinely believe that, given that apartheid outside of Nazi atrocities, has been the great abomination of the 20th century, we must handle the evolution of South African society with great care. Essentially, I believe there is still too much wrong in South Africa.  I do not propose, in a boring fashion to insult the intelligence of the House by going <Col N="1108" /> through every facet of existing South African society because they have been well documented in the media and book and film.  I want only to make the general observations that the black Africans still have no vote in parliamentary elections, the Population Registration Act dividing the population into four categories of whites, coloureds, Asians and Africans, has not yet been repealed nor has the Land Tenure Act.  While I take the point made by Senator John A. Murphy in relation to the breakdown of social apartheid, the Group Areas Act still remains on the Statute Book.  All of this, with the general state of apartheid, makes a very bleak picture and leaves a cause for major concern.</P>
    <P>I would argue that President de Klerk could not have moved to the degree that he has done without international pressure. This movement is welcome.  I propose to make that point in every conceiveable way, using fact and judgment and we should indicate our approval of what he has done.  It is worth remembering that President de Klerk could not have moved without international pressure.  He is having sufficient difficulty with his right wing as it is.  I do not accept the view that President de Klerk's movement can be interpreted as merely the action of one person.  He is probably an enlightened visionary of the same type as Lord O'Neill.  That I would accept.  At the same time, were it not for the background of international disapproval, international sanctions, international public uproar, I do not believe the movement could be there.</P>
    <P>As somebody who did some study of history, I have a lot of personal regard for Senator Murphy and for his work, but he did make the point that he believed that irrespective of attitudes among the international community, the process of disintegration of apartheid would continue. I have great difficulty in accepting that view.  Were we to give a green light to President de Klerk or were we to remove sanctions and tell President de Klerk that all is rosy all is well, we would let his right wing loose on him and undermine his work.  Contrary to Senator <Col N="1109" /> Murphy's viewpoint, I think it is a necessary part of President de Klerk's machinery that we maintained international pressure and fight for further breakdown of apartheid.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators spoke about cultural and sporting exchanges with South Africa.  Senator O'Toole said he could conceivably go along with sporting exchanges.  We have not arrived at the stage where we could realistically consider sporting exchanges with South Africa.  I am studiously avoiding claiming a complete knowledge of the way South African life is as we hear from the media, because I think that would be painful for the House, but we all know why I argue that position.  It is still such an abominable society and there are so many injustices and criminal aspects to that society that I would be of the view that we have to be reserved in our position about sporting exchanges.  We would want yet to keep that on hold.  We are still only at the stage of talking about talking.</P>
    <P>It is the nature of my party to facilitate diversity of view and diversity of discourse. The point was made by Senator Manning and he generally believes, that the visit of the two distinguished Senators was in order.  I differ from him on that. He also made the point that it is to the black people in South Africa we should offer an olive branch in the sense of organising training programmes and support systems for them in this country.  I go along with that and would applaud it as a reasonable suggestion.  We have a tradition of doing that in relation to developing countries and that would be perfectly in order.</P>
    <P>While I have argued consistently that we have not gone far enough yet to remove sanctions, that we have not even gone far enough yet to look at sporting exchanges, I think the point has to be made here today that just as there is an onus on President de Klerk and on the white community to move further there is an onus on the ANC to compromise. Whatever about President de Klerk as an individual, let us never forget that the majority of the white community were very, very happy to remain acquiescent <Col N="1110" /> in respect of a terrible system and the greatest travesty of natural justice and natural rights of the 20th century.  We cannot escape that reality.</P>
    <P>But, while President de Klerk and the white community must go on moving, I would argue that there also is an onus on Nelson Mandela and the ANC to compromise.  There is an onus on them to work extremely hard to heal divisions among the black community, to obviate the portents of civil war within the black community.  I believe Nelson Mandela has an important role to play and he should be urged in that direction.  It should also be remembered that Nelson Mandela's major weapon has been people power which was also the major weapon of many of the democratic forces in eastern Europe.  It is people power that has brought Mandela to the stage where he is now.  I am one of the those who believe that at the earliest opportunity the ANC should show the courage to denounce violence.  While I am opposed to any improper or premature acts of mediation on our side, I also believe there is an onus on the ANC and on Mandela to reject violence.</P>
    <P>My summation of the situation would be that there are too many things still wrong in South African society for us to wave aside the sanctions.  I still see it as a sick society, a society founded on injustice, and that injustice is manifested in many ways.  I also argue that the movement of President de Klerk could not have become a reality without international pressure and international sanctions and, contrary to the view that he needs a release of sanctions now in order to prevent his right-wing swallowing him up, he needs maintenance of sanctions to give his movement a legitimacy as a political tactic; it was out of that context that it was born.  The view that international pressure is irrelevant and that reform will continue is not acceptable in my view.  No matter how sincerely this view is put forward, I cannot see that that is the case.  I believe international pressure will have to remain.</P>
    <P>The message we should send out from <Col N="1111" /> this House is that we maintain the sanctions as of now, not as an end in themselves, not as something that we would want to maintain indefinitely but rather as tactically correct and as being still necessary.  That should be our first position.  Our second position should be that we go on welcoming the initatives of President de Klerk but arguing that we need more dismantling of the society, remembering that no matter how benevolent he may be the society he leads has a rotten core, is based on all the wrong principles and must be disintegrated in its present form.  That should be our second position.</P>
    <P>Our third position should be that we should be the people who would argue that the ANC give up the gun, that the ANC rely on people power, on the massive support of the ordinary people that was sufficient to undo dictatorships in eastern Europe.  They should look to people power, de Klerk should look to further reform and go down that courageous road and the international community should see themselves as something of a referee maintaining the pressure until there is a real sign of movement towards change.  It would be a tragedy if we moved too quickly.  We must gauge it.  I do not think the time for releasing sanctions has yet arrived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few brief words in relation to this very important issue.  I am not going to dwell on the pros and cons of whether Senators Ross and Murphy were entitled or should have gone to South Africa.  I listened attentively to Senator Murphy and I appreciate what he was saying.  I do not agree with a lot of the views he expressed but he did give us a fair insight into developments that took place there.  By and large, I would not agree with the reasons he was giving as to why sanctions should be lifted at present. He instanced that in practical terms quite a number of the sanctions had already been removed.  He mentioned integrated beaches and other facilities that have been provided in South Africa.  That, in <Col N="1112" /> itself, is an expression of the fact that we have now reached a decisive stage in the history of South Africa and in the struggle to overthrow apartheid.</P>
      <P>On paper, a lot of progress has been made.  The freeing of Nelson Mandela the partial lifting of the state of emergency, the lifting of the ban on the ANC and other organisations, the release of a number of political prisoners would appear to be very positive moves but to suggest that, as a result, it is now time to remove the sanctions is a misguided view because one would have to accept that the imposition of the sanctions has resulted in the progress that has been made in South Africa.  I acknowledge the fact that President de Klerk appears to personally be of the viewpoint that apartheid should go.  If I were in his position and sanctions that had an enormous effect on the country were being imposed from outside and if I was trying to achieve a particular aim the one thing I would not like to see would vbe the abolition of those sanctions.  The developments that have taken place will hopefully pave the way for early negotiations on the future of South Africa.</P>
      <P>It is important to restate the United Nations General Assembly Declaration on South Africa made in December 1989 which all member states of the EC supported. It states:</P>
      <P>To ensure that international community does not relax existing measures aimed at encouraging the South African regime to eradicate apartheid until there is a clear evidence of profound and irreversible changes bearing in mind the objectives of this declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sums up the whole emphasis of what we are about here today.  We must ask again why progress is being witnessed in South Africa and why it is taking place. I must reiterate that I think sanctions have been a major factor in the attitude of the Pretoria regime along the road to reform.  It is absolutely essential that we maintain those sanctions if we are to gain the result one wishes.  Everybody is of the <Col N="1113" /> same view that apartheid is an absolutely horrible system and that it should be got rid of as quickly as possible.  If at this point we were to remove the sanctions it would undo a lot of the good that has been achieved.  The South African Government would feel at that point that they have done enough and the impetus for change would slow down.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly appealed to the ANC to lay down their arms and reject violence. The method of sanctions is a peaceful way of ensuring that some changes are made.  Even from the point of view of encouraging the ANC to lay down their arms sanctions are a very positive and important vehicle to use to encourage the ANC to reject violence.  If we removed sanctions at this time it would be very easy for the ANC to say that sanctions have been removed, although they have been advocating at length that they should remain.  If we removed sanctions then it would give the ANC a free hand to continue with the violence and hostilities.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy said this morning that Nelson Mandela represents the majority of the black community in South Africa, and we must accept that he speaks for them.  When he was released it was a momentous occasion.  It would be impossible now for the Pretoria regime to reverse the present trend.  I believe it is inevitable that apartheid will be dismantled in the future and by keeping sanctions we will speed up the dismantling of this dreadful system of apartheid in the short term rather than the long term.</P>
    <P>There is a misguided view that the sanctions are causing huge problems for the black community in South Africa. One recognises that the black community are suffering enormous difficulties through economic blockades and that sort of thing, but we have to recognise that these people have always suffered. There was atrocious suffering in South Africa long before sanctions were imposed.  I believe the African community are prepared to accept that there have to be difficulties if they are to have control over their own destiny, and in <Col N="1114" /> fact have a say in their own destiny.  Comments are being made about unemployment in South Africa where enormous numbers of black people cannot get any work because of the sanctions. We have to take this in perspective. It is extremely important that we recognise what a free person is.  Senator Murphy referred to the fact that the Taoiseach was asked when he would see the sanctions being lifted, bearing in mind the fact that Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in jail to get the vote; the inference was that we would be satisfied when there was a system of one man one vote.  That is not in fact what the Taoiseach would have intended.  When everyone in a country can walk free, can hold the same positions and have the same respect from all sides, irrespective of creed or colour, that is the time we can say we have achieved the aim that everyone looks for in South Africa.</P>
    <P>I share the Taoiseach's view on what he hopes to achieve at the Summit.  I accept that some of the member states will feel this is the time for sanctions to be lifted.  I share the Government's view that this is not the time to consider lifting sanctions.  I have to disagree with Senator O'Toole in relation to reviewing the ban on sporting activities in South Africa. The movements that have taken place in South Africa to date have resulted from the pressures from the international community outside South Africa.  I can appreciate the reason a number of people would say they have shown they are able to change their views, that they can do something about this regime and that we should reciprocate by easing some of the conditions we have laid down against them.  I believe now is the time to stand firm; now is the time to say that sanctions must be maintained until the apartheid regime has been dismantled.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak those few words, I will support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the opportunity to debate a subject like this so soon after our return from South Africa.  I am very <Col N="1115" /> grateful that this subject has been debated so far in a very temperate, reasonable way, without too much acrimony from people on both sides who obviously feel very strongly about this.</P>
      <P>I should, first of all, partly because of what Senator O'Reilly said and partly because of other points that have been raised in the debate I think I should defend our visit to South Africa.  Senator O'Reilly specifically said we should not have gone to South Africa.  I can understand those who say that we were breaking the cultural boycott but that is overridden by one or two of the things which we discovered there.  Despite the pressure we came under not to go and despite the fact that we are bombarded with information about South Africa day in and day out in both the right wing and left wing press, having gone there with as open a mind as is possible, I could not claim to have had no prejudices, indeed I did before I went there &mdash; I certainly changed my mind about certain things. My perception of what happened there changed enormously by going there.  It was an insight.</P>
      <P>Let me give two examples to start with. One of those who was most vocal in criticising the visit and also one of those who was most vocal in his condemnation of the apartheid regime said it was a disgrace we were going there because blacks and whites could not share buses in Pretoria. I was not in a position to contradict him and I found that accusation uncomfortable.  When I went out there I discovered that blacks and whites happily share buses in Pretoria.  I confronted him with this when I came back and he said that he had read it in the <i>Guardian</i>.  It seems to me there is a great deal of misinformation; there is only one way of finding out the truth, that is by going out there yourself.</P>
      <P>Another perception on the other side which changed &mdash; it is a very important perception &mdash; was my perception of the ANC.  Having read about them over the years I certainly felt they were somewhat soft on the issue of violence and much more aggressive than I found them to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> The ANC, despite the condemnation of the Anti-Apartheid Movement here of the visit, gave us a welcome and were very enthusiastic about putting their point of view.  They also changed my mind and my vision of them by being quite obviously men and women who were looking for a peaceful settlement.</P>
    <P>We have to understand the position of the ANC.  A lot of what they are doing and saying in private is different from what they are saying in public and people should understand that.  It is important to make the following point &mdash; I do not know about Senator Murphy &mdash; my understanding of the situation changed dramatically, my position on South Africa and sanctions changed dramatically as a result of going out there, as a result of information which I got which I could not have got by reading newspapers here.</P>
    <P>Maybe I should put it on record that during our visit we met an extraordinarily wide range of people.  We had a very tiring schedule.  The accusations made by some more prominent members of the Anti-Apartheid Movement that it was a freebie and that nobody would meet us were quite absurd.  We came back maybe not with any monopoly of wisdom of the South African situation but certainly with an enlightened view by virtue of having been there to see what was going on.</P>
    <P>The amendment in the names of Senator Murphy and myself is about sanctions. It specifically calls on the Government to consider easing sanctions at this stage.  First, we should admit quite openly that sanctions have been a catalyst for change in South Africa.  I do not think anybody denies that.  I do not think we can find out, as is true in so many of these things, how far they have been a catalyst for change, how far they persuaded the Nationalist Government to change their mind but know the Government there have changed their mind and we know that sanctions were being imposed at the time.  There is no doubt that sanctions have changed the minds of the Government and have changed the course of South African history to a certain extent, maybe not totally, as the whole system <Col N="1117" /> of apartheid was grinding to a halt for lots of reasons, the tri-cameral system of parliament was not working, the system of apartheid which insisted that there were numerous Departments of Education and Health and other Government Departments made it almost impossible for apartheid to continue.</P>
    <P>Sanctions certainly were a factor in changing the mind of de Klerk and others.  It should also be pointed out that there is a great deal of hypocrisy attached to the sanctions issue, that whereas we beat our drums loudly about continued imposition of sanctions, especially in Ireland, trade with South Africa does not just thrive, it increases by the year.  I do not remember, I openly admit, what the figures were but I believe trade with South Africa in Ireland increased threefold last year, but I am open to correction on that.  That seems to be a strange situation when we are making a great virtue of not trading with that country.  We really ought to get this one right and be consistent about it.</P>
    <P>The prime reason sanctions ought to be lifted is simply the position of President de Klerk.  It is simply a matter of whether you believe him and whether you can support him.  It seems so clear, having come back from South Africa that what de Klerk is doing is so good, so revolutionary, so radical but also so dangerous in his own internal political terms that we should do everything, if we believe him, to support him.  Those who do not believe that de Klerk is in danger should only look at the result of the Umhlatuzi by-election last week, the day we come back.  It was dramatic in any terms; the sort of swing you do not see in elections in Ireland or England, a 115 per cent swing.  That was a direct swing from his party to the Conservative Party. If people think that is not the result of the reforms, they are wrong and they are fooling themselves.  There is a swing to the right which is very very dangerous.</P>
    <P>We met an MP member of the Conservative Party and he warned us fairly triumphantly about what was happening but he said quite openly, that de Klerk was giving everything and he was getting <Col N="1118" /> nothing back from the western powers, that if the western powers were to ease sanctions or to give him some hope that maybe the swing to the right could be stopped.  If that sort of swing continues de Klerk will certainly lose power in the parliament there.  Obviously he stated there will never be another all-white election but that is not the only way, as everybody knows, that power is transferred in countries of that sort.  It is an open secret that many members, if not the majority, of the security forces, certainly the police, are sympathetic to the point of view of the Conservative Party.  If it becomes legitimate to take that point of view and enough people take it the outcome will be a disaster for South Africa because the right wing have the power to disrupt what is going on, to disrupt the State.  They have the power to carry out a terrorist campaign.</P>
    <P>One of the things the ANC impressed upon us, more than anything else, was that the right wing were well armed.  It is very easy for us to say &ldquo;push on, it will be all right&rdquo; but we do not understand the consequences of the right wing gaining ground there.  The consequences would be an absolute disaster.  Unless we send signals of some form to de Klerk &mdash; I must say I like Senator O'Toole's idea of possibly &ldquo;reviewing&rdquo;, although I would say &ldquo;lifting&rdquo; the boycott on sports because it has a huge psychological impact on people rather than sanctions &mdash; people will flock to the Conservative Party, the extremists will win and they will take over by armed force or any other means.  That is the only way that apartheid can be discontinued in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Apartheid from what I found out and from talking to people, is as good as over.  It is absolutely fair for people, like Senator O'Reilly, to say &ldquo;Well, the Group Areas Act is still there, there is no one man, one vote, at this stage&rdquo;. That is correct.  The intention has been declared and is not disputed.  Senator Manning said he felt that the process was not irreversible.  That is not my understanding of the situation.  My understanding of the situation now is that so <Col N="1119" /> long as de Klerk is there in charge of his party the situation is irreversible.  Apartheid will be dismantled in the shortest possible time.  The steps have been taken from which there is no going back.</P>
    <P>There is a way back if the Conservative Party gain enough power.  We have a choice.  We can either assist apartheid being dismantled peacefully by easing sanctions or we can assist apartheid being dismantled by bloodshed by keeping sanctions.  That is the choice we have. Either way it will go but it is irresponsible not to respond and to throw a lifeline to de Klerk who, after all, is one of the two great men in South Africa at this moment.</P>
    <P>It is unfashionable, as Senator McKenna said, to talk about the people who suffer as a result of sanctions.  There is a reality and it is something which I find the proponents of sanctions never answer satisfactorily.  The reality is this: black people are the people who are suffering under sanctions, black people are the people who are out of work, black people are the people who are poor, black people are the people who are hungry, who cannot get education, health-care and who cannot get all the vital necessities of life as a result of sanctions.</P>

      <P>Sanctions are a source of discomfort for the white people.  It is inconvenient.  They have to by-pass them, they are not quite as rich as they normally would be, it is more expensive for them to live.  The people who suffer are the people at the bottom of the pile and they are the black people.  We met black people on the ground in Soweto, in Crossroads, and in many other places.  I took the opportunity, when I met people in those places and in factories, to ask what they thought of sanctions and I did not come across one who wanted them continued, not one.  These were not people who were chosen for me, these were people, to whom I spoke at random. They tell you it causes them poverty and discomfort.  They wanted negotiations <Col N="1120" /> and they wanted talks but not one of them said: &ldquo;Yes, this is a marvellous thing, we love suffering, keep it going, it is tremendous for us&rdquo;.  I am tired of people, from the comfort of the west and the comfort of cosy positions in Cape Town advocating sanctions, when other people have to suffer as a result.  If there was a case for sanctions I believe that case has now gone because the process is irreversible. There is no excuse for continuing imposing suffering on black people in South Africa in order to salve our consciences here and in order to pursue a goal which has already been conceded.</P>

    <P>I would like to say a few words about the strongest emotional arguments made for sanctions by those who have been proposing them today.  It is that Nelson Mandela wants them to continue. Speaker after speaker today said that the real reason we should have sanctions is because the ANC are asking for them and that Nelson Mandela would be undermined in some way by this.  It is very strong and it is a very difficult argument to counter, especially in view of the fact that Nelson Mandela holds a position of great moral authority and is undoubtedly a man of great stature in the 20th century.  However, we should stand back from the situation now and ask ourselves, should we blindly follow the ANC line in South Africa simply because apartheid is wrong, and it is, as the previous speaker said, an abomination and an offence to humanity.  But it does not mean that we should necessarily blindly follow the requests of one person and his organisation. Those who say that fail to recognise that there are others in South Africa in opposition to the apartheid system who begged us to bring one message back from South Africa and that was that sanctions should be dropped.  These included Helen Suzman and Dr. Denis Worrell, both well known and, certainly in one case, long-standing opponents of the South African regime, some of them who held positions of great respect in the world some years ago but whom it is fashionable now not to take so seriously <Col N="1121" /> because they do not follow blindly the ANC.</P>
    <P>The ANC have great men.  There is no doubt about that.  They have a position in South Africa of great influence, great power and great support.  We should not just say until we know what that power is that they are right and, as speaker after speaker today said, &ldquo;Follow Mandela because Mandela asks it, we must take it&rdquo;.  That is not a justifiable position.  We must examine it on its merits.  Those people who say that fail to mention consistently Buthelezi.  We met him and we had a long meeting with him.  I do not know what support he has.  I do not know what support the ANC have because neither of them has been tested. Buthelezi has consistently been anti-apartheid, he has consistently been a man of peace, he is a friend of Mandela, he consistently refused to negotiate with the regime while Mandela was in prison.  He is straightforwardly and openly against sanctions.  It is no good, as is the fashionable position now, to say Buthelezi does not represent the Zulu people any more. All we do know is that he is the accepted leader of the largest tribe out there.  It may be he does not represent them all. It may be the ANC who represent them but we should take his position seriously and when he says we should lift sanctions we should take him seriously as one of the leaders of black African opinion in South Africa.</P>
    <P>We should also not fail to mention &mdash; something not mentioned by anybody in this debate except Senator Murphy &mdash; namely, the position of the coloureds and the Indians in South Africa who comprise four million people of the population of South Africa.  We should take them into account.  I do not know if Mandela represents them or not.  I suspect they are diversified, they are desperate and they have different opinions.  Certainly the Indians and the coloureds, to whom I spoke, were against sanctions.  Mandela is a great man but we should not follow his line unquestioningly.  We should also consider the position of de Klerk and whether we want to throw him to the lions.  It should be acknowledged that <Col N="1122" /> what de Klerk has done is absolutely revolutionary. Not only did he release Mandela, not only did he unban the ANC, but he has put before parliament proposals for repealing the Special Amenities Act which is almost gone anyway in practice.  He has fulfilled ANC demands on the emergency powers.</P>
    <P>It seems, from my reading of the situation in South Africa last week, that it was de Klerk who wanted to lift the emergency powers everywhere including Natal but, as a result of the by-election, the Cabinet held back and they did not lift it in Natal.  My reading of the situation there is that there is already a move to the right within the Cabinet.  There are encouraging signs, there are tremendous things happening behind the scenes.  The talks on the security forces, the talks on the economy are going tremendously well with unexpected success.</P>
    <P>I ask this House for the sake of the economy of South Africa which the ANC will probably inherit, for the sake of the black people who are suffering, for the sake of de Klerk, to take a responsible attitude and to consider easing sanctions to avoid a possible blood bath in South Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the terms and the spirit of this motion summarise the best way forward in the light of the present situation in South Africa.  We can all say that we are gratified by the extremely hopeful developments in South Africa in the course of the past year or so.  We must acknowledge that under the de Klerk Administration real progress towards racial harmony and fair and equal treatment of all South Africans has been made.  In particular the declared intention of the South African Government to abolish apartheid, if sincerely meant, goes a long way towards meeting the justified objections of the international community to the South African system of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by many public representatives whose motives one must respect that it is now time to ease sanctions against South Africa.  Indeed, the amendment put forward in the names of <Col N="1123" /> Senators Ross and Murphy expresses this point of view.  I appreciate the good intentions behind the amendment and acknowledge that the views it expreses is shared by many sincere people and by many knowledgeable people.  However, I believe that the time is not yet right for the lifting or the easing of sanctions against South Africa.  For one thing, all we are sure of is that the South African authorities have declared an intention and this has not been translated into concrete form.</P>
    <P>Despite what Senator Ross has said, apartheid still exists.  Repressive legislation is still in place to support the hateful mechanism of apartheid.  Detention without trial, which, I suppose, one could say has nasty overtones in this part of the world, still operates.  Until solid evidence is forthcoming that apartheid is really being dismantled I believe that sanctions should be kept in place for the present as a sign of the determination of the international community to ensure that praiseworthy aspirations are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that sanctions have been among the most effective weapon in changing the attitude of apartheid in South Africa.  To end or to ease them now might well be interpreted by the South African authorities as a sign of weakening determination or even of indifference on the part of the international community.  In addition, it can be said that sanctions provide strong moral support for those people who are working so effectively against apartheid both within and outside of South Africa; and their ending or easing should be timed to coincide with the removal of the abuses against which they are directed. The bottom line for me would surely have to be that it does not make sense to withdraw an effective weapon before its aim has been achieved.</P>
    <P>Let me say in passing that I think it right to pay tribute to our own Government, and particularly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerry Collins, for the very constructive and helpful role that he and the Government have played in relation to this problem.  Deputy <Col N="1124" /> Collins in particular has performed a very delicate set of tasks with admirable diplomacy and statemanship.  I feel that we here in the Seanad should continue to uphold the policy on sanctions which has been formulated by the EC and which has been strongly supported by our own Government.  It is my sincere hope that the time is not far away when solid reforms in South Africa make it possible for sanctions to be eased and eventually to be lifted.</P>
    <P>In this sense I would have to say that I sympathise with the sentiments of the amendment in the names of Senator Ross and Senator Murphy, but I feel, for the reasons I have given, that it is somewhat premature at this time.  I also want to make the comment, in the hope of having a consensus opinion, in the hope of having a consensus/majority motion agreed, which would be to meet the obvious wishes of the majority of the House, that I am prepared to amend our motion as follows.  On line 5 after the words &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; to include the following nine words &ldquo;including sanctions for as long as these are necessary&rdquo;.  This is being done in the hope of having a consensus or a majority opinion.  I might mention that Senator Manning from the Fine Gael Party, Senator Upton from the Labour Party and Senator O'Toole, the three people with whom I spoke, would have been happy with that particular change. Unfortunately, procedural difficulties at this late stage dictate that this is not possible. However, I wanted to have inserted in the record of the House what I was prepared to do in an effort to have this consensus/majority motion agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Fallon has listened so carefully to the debate and has seen that the insertion of these few words would go a long way towards alleviating the problems that have been shown today.  I welcome those words.  Unfortunately, they can be stitched into the record but not, for procedural reasons, into the motion itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In supporting both Fine Gael amendments and this new notice of motion, I would like to comment on the visit of the <Col N="1125" /> Independent Senators to South Africa.  I feel that they were quite entitled to go and see for themselves.  I do not think we should sit at home when we do get an opportunity to visit such places.  That is the only way forward for all of us.  Unfortunately, not all of us had that opportunity and it was very interesting to hear the different viewpoints.  There is one point I would make in relation to the press statement from the two Senators.  I find it difficult to refer to the period now as &ldquo;post-apartheid&rdquo;.  It will take quite a while before we can actually apply the term &ldquo;post-apartheid&rdquo; to the period we are at now.</P>
    <P>Going back to the basics of what apartheid is &mdash; the Afrikans word for separation, Senator Murphy referred to the complexity of South African society, the multiracial society.  Going back to the figures of 1987, the only ones I have, out of a population of 35 million you have 75 per cent African, 14 per cent white, 9 per cent coloured or mixed race and 2 per cent Asian.  Those statistics in themselves are sufficient to show us the complexity of the issue before us.  The four groups have been kept apart, which was the stated aim of apartheid, and we would want to take heed of this.  The real aim was to enable the country's white minority retain control and to continue to dominate the political, economic and social life of the country.  We should not forget that.  That is what apartheid is, was and will be until it is dismantled.</P>
    <P>Looking at this multiracial society and looking at South Africa as an entity, geographically and physically, a climatically divided region, again I would agree with Senator Murphy's reference to the complexities of tribal tensions.  Having spent some time in Africa I now realise that the notion of nationhood is absolutely foreign to their psyche.  They think in terms of tribal loyalty.  There are tremendous complexities in what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>The apartheid regime, though it has taken its first concrete steps towards a negotiated end to apartheid, has not irreversibly committed itself to that path.  It has retained and has continued to use <Col N="1126" /> an armed repressive capacity inconsistent with a climate conductive to negotiations. We have heard the speech by President F.W. de Klerk at the opening of Parliament in early February and subsequent statements by Government Ministers. They initiated steps which, although widely expected, came sooner than most observers had predicted.  By the beginning of March the unbanning of political organisations and the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela, along with other moves, had opened a new phase in the struggle to end apartheid.</P>
    <P>A very important point to make is that the regime remained committed to constitutional principles and positions regarding the process of negotiation as fundamentally different &mdash; this is what is in the Fine Gael amendment &mdash; from what is envisaged in the Organisation of African Unity's Harare declaration, which again incorporates the United Nations five conditions referred to in our amendment.  The Harare declaration is based on the ANC's guidelines for a genuinely negotiated end to apartheid, and adopted by the non-aligned movement and the United Nations General Assembly.</P>
    <P>I will briefly mention the five steps Senator Manning referred to today which the apartheid regime needs to take to create the political conditions in which negotiations could take place.  The steps initiated or implemented since President de Klerk's speech on 2 February represent only a partial move &mdash; through I welcome it in the direction required.  The first step is the release of political prisoners. The release of political prisoners and detainees was supposed to be unconditional and refraining from imposing any restrictions on them.  Yes, we had the release of Nelson Mandela, which we welcomed, and a number of other political prisoners released last February, and more were due to be released.  However, only a small proportion of those imprisoned as a result of their participation in political protest were due to be freed unilaterally.  There was no mention of those held in detention without trial. There are still 300 political prisoners <Col N="1127" /> being held in Robin Island, although that number was reduced the other day by 28. They are on hunger strike to demand the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners and detainees.  As I said, and I will repeat it, 28 were released since February.  They rejected, through the Press, through their lawyers, de Klerk's categorisation of political prisoners where he said that all politically motivated offenders are political prisoners. That is still there.</P>
    <P>The second step is the lifting of all bans and restrictions on all proscribed and restricted organisations and persons.  All prohibitions on organisations under the Internal Security Act were lifted in February as well as all emergency regulations imposing restrictions on 34 named organisations. A ban on a number of newspapers and periodicals was also lifted, but even after the lifting of restrictions the United Democratic Front and the National Union of South African Students remain, and I quote, &ldquo;affected organisations under the Foreign Funding Act preventing them from receiving overseas funds&rdquo;.  Also, even though the South African Communist Party was unbanned, section 55 of the Internal Security Act makes it a serious offence &mdash; when you read the small print you see that all is not as it seems &mdash; punishable by up to ten years' imprisonment &ldquo;to advocate, advise, defend or encourage the achievement of any of the objects of Communism;&rdquo; and the Act defines the term &ldquo;Communism&rdquo; far beyond the political philosophy of that name.  On one hand, there is an unban, and on the other hand, it is not so.</P>
    <P>The third step is the removal of all troops from the townships.  Since September 1984 the South African Defence Force has stationed units in the townships. In 1985 there were 30,000 troop deployed in these areas.  This was announced by the régime.  The régime refused to disclose further numbers until February, when the Minister for Defence stated that there were fewer than 800 troops in the townships, despite the fact that previously they had acknowledged <Col N="1128" /> that there were 30,000 troops.  I do not see how 30,000 and 800 troops can equal.</P>
    <P>The possibility that the troop withdrawals could be completed in the foreseeable future &mdash; and this is an important point &mdash; has focused attention on the role of the police.  Over the past four years there has been a substantial build up of the police force in comparison with the army.  In October a plan was devised to double the size of the police force for the next ten years.  We can see that the police will be the first line in the enforcement of control over the population.  There are reports of considerable confusion and frustration among the police.  In the days following the announcement of the unbanning of the ANC and the release of Nelson Mandela we read in the newspapers that there were frequent police attacks on people celebrating &mdash; just celebrating. We were celebrating here.  There was no attack on us in any way by any subversive groups.  There were attacks on people there genuinely celebrating or protesting against rents and housing conditions. Could you imagine what would happen here if we were to forbid protests against rents and housing conditions and apartheid education?  In most cases the police used the Internal Security Act to declare the meeting illegal, even though technically they were not meant to do so. But they were able to use the Internal Security Act to legalise their attacks. Given the planned build up of the police force, the continued existence of laws which give them the power to use armed force against people participating in political protest is of critical importance.</P>
    <P>The next step was the ending of the state of emergency and the repeal of all legislation designed to circumscribe political activities such as and including the Internal Security Act.  Substantial parts of the emergency regulations were lifted on 3 February, the media emergency regulations and the education emergency regulations were abolished.  However, one aspect of the media regulations was restored &mdash; again behind closed doors &mdash; by inserting into the main body of the <Col N="1129" /> emergency regulations a clause prohibiting the publication and dissemination of any visual representation, whether it was a photograph, a film, a video or whatever of any scene of unrest in security action.</P>
    <P>Obviously I welcome, as we all welcomed, de Klerk's announcement of the ending of the four year nationwide state of emergency, though special security powers are still being retained in the troubled Natal Province.  That has happened since February.  So, the continual implementation of sanctions has caused further developments from February right up to the other day.  Nothing can be done immediately; it has to be gradual. But I believe that this would not continue on a gradual basis if the sanctions were lifted.</P>
    <P>The ANC have stated that the Government have not gone far enough.  They say that it is an obstacle to formal talks.  The Internal Security Act, as I said already, has not been repealed.  There is much more to be done in that area.  The last step, in relation to the United Nations five points, is the ceasing of political trials and all political executions.  A moratorium on all executions was announced by President de Klerk, but during that period changes in the law provided for capital punishment to be discussed.  In fact, it was for changes, not abolition.  At a time when we are debating the abolition of capital punishment here, it is interesting that that does not appear to be taking place in South Africa.  According to the Human Rights Commission, and we must believe them, 300 political trials were still in progress in February.  Progress is gradual, it is slow, but we have always to read between the lines.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, what do we say about President de Klerk and his courageous step forward?  As a result of his courage he has access to world powers which none of his predecessors had.  He has not had to endure the pariah status inflicted on his predecessors.  This is really <i>de facto</i> recognition that he has embarked on the right road, which should act as an encouragement to him to continue, despite the pleas today that the right wing <Col N="1130" /> will eventually do him in.  I do not see that.  He is now a world figure in the same way as Nelson Mandela has become a world figure.  You have two great visionaries. I would hope he will be able to stand up &mdash; at least he did not have 27 years in prison to cause any debilitation to his physique &mdash; and have the moral courage to continue to go on that road.  I think this in itself should be enough to show to the right wing that he means business and to demonstrate that, if he does continue, further recognition will come.  The first step to ending South African isolation is a recognition by world powers and the initiation of the right policy.  I would have to say here that good intentions are not sufficient to cause a major change of policy.  To appease the conservative wing he can show that his advances have got a response, the world media have shown that his advances have got a response, and that is why we are debating this issue here today.</P>

      <P>We have two visionaries, Nelson Mandela and President de Klerk and I said I hoped President de Klerk would have the physical and mental strength necessary &mdash; because, Nelson Mandela gained a tremendous amount of strength while in prison &mdash; with Nelson Mandela to continue as the builders of democracy in South Africa.  As I was saying, President de Klerk can use the continuing isolation as a stick with which to beat the conservative opponents.  But, unless real progress is made as distinct <Col N="1131" /> from good intentions, South Africa will continue to suffer economically.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a brief reference to inputs from Senator Murphy, who said that the black population are suffering. I do not think for a moment that the sanctions are affecting everybody in South Africa.  But in regard to those black people who are suffering, I have spent time in South Africa and I have seen them suffering.  Sadly, it will take quite some time before that suffering is alleviated because it is suffering in the deepest sense of deprivation; it is poverty; it is an accumulative lack of exposure to education of any kind; it is so complex that it will take a long time before it will be eliminated.  But that does not necessarily mean that if we lift the sanctions the black population will not suffer.  You can apply that to any part of Africa &mdash; the Sudan, the countries in the Horn of Africa.  We know that it is a long term situation.  The fact that we are debating this today is actually a step towards the alleviation of suffering.</P>
      <P>It should also be made clear to President de Klerk that when reforms are specified by the United Nations and are put on the Statute Book &mdash; many things are put on the Statute Book, as we well know in this country, and they are not implemented &mdash; then the dismantling of sanctions will begin.  It is not just enough that they will be on the Statute Book; they must be implemented on the ground. Intentions in South Africa must be paralleled by United Nations intentions. Action and reform in South Africa must be paralleled by reform in the United Nations and the EC as regards sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my last points is the use of international observers from the UN to ensure that changes get on the Statute Book and that real change takes place on the ground.  There must be a timetable for legislation, because this is not going to happen overnight and the implementation of a similar timetable as regards the reduction in sanctions.  A question: why did President de Klerk embark on a change of course?  I would have to accept, <Col N="1132" /> out of a certain conviction, but also in response to world pressure.</P>
    <P>Rules must be implemented when they are on the Statute Book.  It is not very long ago since we saw intense pockets of resistance in the Southern States of the United States of America at a time when their form of apartheid was technically ended.  That is going to be very hard to root out in white middle class and working class areas &mdash; I do not want particularly to categorise them.  I can see insecurities there as they will see their jobs threatened as more and more of the population of South Africa will come on the job market.  These areas must not be allowed to become traumatised areas of resistance which will only cause suffering for all eventually.  As I said, we should learn by the mistakes, by the intransigence of certain little towns in the deep South of the United States of America where intense resistance caused intense suffering.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as we have said today &mdash; and we have been applauded, small as we are within the EC and the United Nations &mdash; must stand firm against the removal of sanctions.  The pressure is essential.  Of course, it is not an all or nothing situation. There are grades of sanctions, ranging from a ban on coal, steel and military exports to those covering sports, cultural and academic contacts.  These should be kept under review, as several Senators mentioned today, and perhaps the more symbolic ones should be the first to go.</P>
    <P>Restraint is needed on all sides so that a gradual flow towards democracy does not become a torrent.  Leadership and vision were never more needed.  Both leaders, Nelson Mandela and President de Klerk are men of integrity.  Again in support of the Fine Gael amendment, I would say that when Nelson Mandela comes, despite protocol, because of the extraordinary history this has made, surely a case can be made for his addressing the House which is a forum for reasoned debate and expressing opinions on global issues.  The present situation is that on substantive matters the South <Col N="1133" /> African Government have so far delivered promises.  It would take an enormous leap of faith to withdraw official sanctions on that basis.  The sanctions &mdash; and they are a peaceful means of protest &mdash; should remain in force until there is an assurance of political stability.</P>
    <P>I will finish by supporting Senator Fallon's proposed added words to the motion which make it easier for all sides of the House to adopt the motion and the amendments as proposed by Fine Gael.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is virtually impossible, in my view, to visualise irreversible changes in South Africa as long as the entire power of the State still rests in the hands of the white minority.  There is a contradiction there that all of us ought to tease out at some stage because, while we have talked of certain conditions and while everybody is prepared, there is a remarkable act of faith contained in the suggestions by some representatives of the ANC that after a certain number of objectives have been met, like the release of all political prisoners, the end of the state of emergency etc, then they are prepared to make the extraordinary gesture of trust in what is still a minority white Government.  Let us remember that until the end of the state of emergency simply to refer to the South African Government as a white minority Government was a subversive statement that could land you in jail. But the extraordinary generosity of the <Col N="1134" /> African National Congress, the extraordinary generosity of black South Africans in being prepared to accept the bona fides of those who have ruled them, murdered them and oppressed them for close on 50 years is something that ought to be firmly enshrined on the record of this House.  I do not think I need to rehash the arguments about South Africa and about apartheid.  I am going to devote a considerable part of what I have to say here to the regrettable activities of two of my colleagues.  I think there are a number of reasons for dealing with them in some detail.</P>
    <P>First, may I say I was in southern Africa five years ago.  I was there with the full approval of the Anti-Apartheid Movement and with the full approval of the United Democratic Front which was then a legal organisation.  I was not in South Africa, I was in Lesotho.  We agreed on very tentative communications lines because they were frightened to meet the United Democratic Front.  They were frightened and they were nervous and they were extremely alone and isolated and this was only five years ago. The arrangements did not work out because on the day we were supposed to meet them in Smuts Airport in Johannesburg something happened, yet another massacre in another place in South Africa, and their entire resources were devoted to dealing with the consequences of that massacre.  When I got back here I phoned them &mdash; seeing myself as what I am, an obscure, backbench Member of the secondary House of the Parliament of a small country on the periphery of Europe.  Perhaps the most eloquent testimony to the state of affairs in South Africa was the extraordinary gratitude of a body that at that stage had international headlines in every newspaper in the world because somebody bothered to ring to say: &ldquo;We are concerned about you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What that particular limited experience suggests to me is the enormous importance of international solidarity with those who struggle.  We may not realise here with all the pressures of the international media but those who struggle in a country like South Africa know <Col N="1135" /> the importance of solidarity, they appreciate solidarity and they are the best judges of what form of solidarity is best and most useful for their struggle.</P>
    <P>While I was in Lesotho I met the ANC, I met black citizens of Lesotho who could tell you graphically about what it was like to cross from Lesotho where you were a free citizen, where the colour of your skin made no difference, into South Africa and suddenly discover the difference that made to how you did business with everybody because you were black.  I met white South Africans who epitomised everything that was wrong with apartheid and who less than five years ago were quite certain their system was going to last forever, quite certain that the Western powers could be relied upon not to impose excessively severe sanctions.</P>
    <P>One does not have to go to South Africa to meet people.  I met Dr. Nadoo here in Dublin in the past three years who was a member of the team that began preliminary negotiations with the South African Government.  I did not need to go to South Africa to hear from him what reality was like in South Africa.  I did not need to go to South Africa to know that black South Africans suffer, and suffer both from the system and also from the sanctions.  I know that the one legal body that is allowed to go out and look for support among black working-class industrial workers, among the black community, is the Congress of South African Trade Unions and they believe that sanction should be retained.  They believe there is no case yet to be made for the abolition of sanctions.</P>
    <P>Because I have been involved in the campaigns, like other Members of this House have been involved, in the struggles of black South Africans, I know what the suffering of South Africans is like.  I know about the poverty in South Africa. I know, in spite of the propaganda, that the infant mortality rate in the so-called homelands is higher than in many other areas of black Africa.  The incomes <i>per capita</i> in some of these so-called homelands are lower than the <i>per capita</i> incomes in many areas of black Africa. <Col N="1136" /> That was before we had sanctions, long before even the pathetic, limited, marginal sanctions the Western powers grudgingly agreed to impose in the face of murder on a grand scale.  I know what it was like.  I know the things that South Africa have done.  For instance, during 1986 some 85,000 children died in Mozambique because of South African-inspired aggression against that country. This is not South African or liberation movement propaganda, these are the figures used by the United States State Department.  I did not need to travel to South Africa to find out about that because there is plenty of information available and I do not have to look to the newspapers &mdash; there are plenty of sources of information.</P>
    <P>I do not think my two colleagues should have travelled to South Africa.  I think they gave signals to people that are the direct antithesis of the signals that should be given.  Because they are perhaps less than well informed on the issues in South Africa they are capable of making less than well informed judgments on what they saw in South Africa.  I was prepared to be reasonably tolerant about their decision to go but I am horrified by their decision to use the platform of that visit to fly in the face of the opinions of everybody that I am aware of who has any credible record in South Africa of struggling against apartheid.  I do not include white liberals who could not even say that they were in favour of one man, one vote as having a credible record in the struggle against apartheid.  Most assuredly, I do not believe that we should listen to Mrs. Helen Suzman who says that the time has come to end sanctions, bearing in mind that she was never in favour of sanctions in the first place.  I do not find that sort of view particularly credible and I am horrified at my colleagues.  I have no problem working out who to listen to, I have no problem working out who to believe, if I have to choose between the opinions of two friends and colleagues of mine whom I respect and whom I believe to be profoundly mistaken on this issue, and those who have suffered, not people <Col N="1137" /> who were just the other politicians in a political struggle.</P>
    <P>Calls for retribution are entirely pointless. We should not forget the difference between F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela. The fundamental differences are first, F.W. de Klerk has a vote and Nelson Mandela does not and, secondly, and much more profound, F.W. de Klerk has never spent a day of his life in jail. Nelson Mandela has spent 27 years in F. W. de Klerk's jail, jails run by a party that F.W. de Klerk was a member of and of which he is now leader.  That is a part of the reality of South Africa we should not forget.  If I have to chose between the views of those who suffered for 27 years and the views of those who spent a fortnight there and come back telling us how they are right and everybody else is wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The first public statement from Senators Murphy and Ross was a call for the end to sanctions, not a call to listen to F.W. de Klerk, not a statement of respect for F.W. de Klerk, all of which is perfectly valid, but a call to end sanctions.  I have no problem if I have to choose between two people and the combined weight of those who have suffered, not just the treatment of the South African security forces but 27 years, more than two-thirds of my life, in prison. Nelson Mandela entered jail when I was 17 years old.  People whom I know to be of considerable compassion in many areas ought to have a stem of sense and not give encouragement, aid or comfort to those in Britain and all over Europe who would still prefer F.W. de Klerk to be in charge of the old style white South Africa, who have never supported the end of apartheid.  Those people who opposed sanctions all over Europe never, ever, until they were dragged kicking and screaming into the realities of life, supported the end of apartheid.  Now they have to do it because they are told to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to the suffering of black <Col N="1138" /> South Africans, again I am aware, as anybody involved in the struggle for liberation in South Africa would be, of the sufferings of black South Africans.  I was aware of it before there were sanctions. I am aware of it now that there are sanctions and I am painfully aware that that suffering will continue after sanctions end and after democracy is installed.  I am also aware that people whom I trust spent 27 years of their lives in jail on behalf of those people.  If I have to weigh the arguments, the judgments and perceptions of those who have spent 25 years in jail on behalf of black South Africans against those who spent a couple of weeks there and saw what I know to be a horrific situation, then I have no problem about making up my mind as to who is the more committed to the cause of black South Africa.</P>
    <P>Finally, if I am asked to choose between people who look and people who struggle, as far as I am concerned I am a participant in the struggle for liberation, I am not a detached observer pronouncing on the rights and wrongs of a conflict.  I am unashamedly and proudly partisan on the issue of the struggle in South Africa.  I stand with those who have suffered, those who have been in jail, those who have been oppressed, and I make no apology for it.  Things have been said in the past couple of weeks that I find profoundly regrettable and I want to go on the record of the House and refute them.  I am quoting from an article by Senator Murphy in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of last Sunday where he said:</P>
    <P>It may be that anti-apartheid movements worldwide regard South Africa in terms of 20 years ago, that they lag behind the actual pace of developments, and that they are determined to see things in a simplistic perspective which is itself as racist as the apartheid mind they are concerned to challenge.</P>

In my time we have had different views on many issues, including Northern Ireland.  It is the first time he has ever implied that I am a racist and that I am a racist on the scale of those who implemented and supported apartheid in South Africa.  If that is what two weeks in South Africa <Col N="1140" /> does for his thinking, he should have stayed away.  If that is how Senator Murphy's thinking has been affected after two weeks in South Africa, then I know I am right when I suggest that both of them should have stayed away.</P>

      <P>What I most profoundly regret is that about three or four minutes of my 20 minutes is used up by Senator Lanigan's interruptions.  I have said what I wish to say about Senator Murphy's unfortunate choice of words.  Whether Senator Murphy appreciates it or not, it is a quite serious matter because for 20 years I and other people have taken the issue of South Africa seriously.  If you choose to go to South Africa at the invitation of a university which has become rich on the proceeds of apartheid, which <Col N="1141" /> has become powerful on the proceeds of apartheid, and having made itself rich and powerful can now make a token gesture in the direction of the small number of black South Africans who have the background education because of the system of education to get into it, you are actually accepting the funds of apartheid to visit and observe apartheid, because other countries cannot afford to have universities and cannot afford to bring visitors from half-way around the world to see the conditions.  When you travel there at the invitation of any institution which is a beneficiary or apartheid you are travelling as a guest of apartheid, you are travelling as a guest of the system that long ago should have been abolished and that has only survived because misguided liberals of the type of my two colleagues forgot that there is a distinction between right and wrong, between good and evil, and between those who suffer and those who inflict suffering.</P>
      <P>May I say that I only wish my two colleagues who have been so influenced by the suffering of the vulnerable and the oppressed in South Africa by a fortnight's visit would spend a fortnight in west Belfast, south Armagh or south Tyrone and see the sufferings of their Catholic fellow-Irishmen and it might have a profound effect on their views on a number of other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed Senator Ryan had to bring the situation in west Belfast and Northern Ireland into his closing remarks in a debate on South Africa.  There is absolutely no parallel between the two situations.  There are problems in Northern Ireland to which we must address ourselves and there are problems in South Africa to which we must address ourselves but I do not think that when we address ourselves to a problem in South Africa we should start equating it to the problem in the North of Ireland.  I have a certain empathy with him when he talks about people going to South Africa for two weeks and coming back with definitive statements as to what should happen.  I would always agree with people travelling to areas of contention <Col N="1142" /> in the world and listening to the people who are involved in conflict, talking to the people on both sides, but not putting into their minds some of the contentious opinions that Senators Murphy and Ross brought back as a result of their two week visit.  They suddenly seem to be people who know everything about the problems in South Africa.  The problems of South Africa will be there after they have gone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the Senator's fortnight in South Africa was informative for him, it is probably informative for us, but it is not going to make any difference to what happens in South Africa.  We do not agree that sanctions against South African should be eliminated because those sanctions have been a very effective method of proving to the South African Government that they cannot live on their own, they cannot deal with the black South Africans in the manner in which they wanted and whether it was Verwoerd, Botha or Vorster, it does not make any difference.  Over the years the Afrikaners did not believe that anybody of a different colour had any credibility.  They have tried to prove that if your colour was different you were inferior.  From 1946 to 1960 and from 1975 to 1982 having had various attempts by the Afrikaners to prove to the majority that they were superior.  They cannot win.  What they have to do now is to try to accommodate themselves to reality.  In 1965 they produced the Bantustans &mdash; 13 per cent of the land of South Africa was given to 75 per cent of the people by diktat.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Ross recognises that the argument is going against him because he has left the House.  I am talking to myself at this stage.</P>

      <P>Apartheid is a crime against humanity.  Apartheid has been approved by the Government of South Africa.  de Klerk has said that he will change this and that he will eliminate these crimes against humanity.  In 1960 Verwoerd said that he would eliminate, Botha said he would eliminate, Vorster said he would eliminate, these crimes against humanity, and what happened? We have seen an escalation of institutionalised violence against the black people of South Africa.</P>
      <P>I would ask that this motion be passed unanimously and we should ask President de Klerk to ensure that the white people of South Africa have no more rights than the black people.  The minute he comes out and says straighforwardly that the rights of individuals in South Africa are for whites and blacks, then we will support everything he does.  He is moving in the right direction.  This motion before us suggests that he is moving in the right direction.  We should support him.  We should ask him to accelerate the movement towards integration in terms of support for blacks and whites.  If we do not, we might as well forget about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I hope to take about ten minutes.</P>
      <P>We support the motion, particularly the part which is causing the Government to maintain the necessary pressures.  I would certainly be in agreement with what Senator Fallon suggested, including sanctions until apartheid is completely demolished and that is the position as far as I am concerned, and indeed as far as the Labour Party are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other parts of the motion, while they are welcome, talk in terms of prospects of substantive change, announced intentions and encouragement, all fine, highly commendable stuff, but when you go for the brass tacks, the basic reality still remains that apartheid is in place and that is quite unacceptable.  I know, accept and appreciate the fact that there have <Col N="1145" /> been changes in South Africa but there is a long road to go before South Africa reaches the standards which would be acceptable to the majority of people in this country.  The real question now is: where do we go from here, and how do we best facilitate the development of those types of standards in South Africa.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned I want to say without equivocation that I am fully in favour of the maintenance of sanctions until the whole apparatus of apartheid is demolished.  That is a matter of fundamental principle as far as I am concerned. It is a matter that relates to the simplest and most basic principles of decency and fair play.  I cannot see how anybody can find themselves at variance with that if they believe in those fundamental principles which relate to equality and justice.  If anyone doubts why we should remove sanctions, there is the question of the political prisoners in South Africa, there are the enormous powers of the police and there is the whole apparatus of apartheid still in place.  All we have got to at this stage is some talk about the possibility of dismantling it.  That is up in the air.  There is no point in lifting sanctions until there are firm achievements.  If you want evidence as to why that should be, I am prepared to take the word of Nelson Mandela who states quite clearly that after 27 years in prison he still does not have a vote.  I find it hard to see how anybody could want sanctions to be removed when it appears, and there is a considerable amount of evidence to suggest very clearly, that sanctions are working and that they have played an important part in bringing about the changes which have taken place and, indeed, will have an important part in continuing that process until the ultimate is arrived at namely, full equality.</P>
    <P>In relation to the visit of our colleagues to South Africa I do not want to say anything.  I certainly do not want to enter into the controversy between Senator Ryan and his colleagues.  What I say is this; for myself I would not go to South Africa.  I have not been invited.  I do not expect to be invited.  But I would not go <Col N="1146" /> and that is as much as I can say in relation to my own position on it.  I certainly would find it quite unacceptable to go to South Africa under the present circumstances. I am not going to get into the business or abusing, reprimanding or castigating people who went.  That is my position and where I stand in relation to that whole business.  There are also people who talk in terms of the effects of sanctions and the damage and the problems they create for black people in South Africa.  Maybe it does but in as far as you can judge, those people want sanctions maintained to achieve the goal which everybody else would take for granted, a basic right.  There are also people who talk in terms of a backlash from the far right and so on in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The other side of that is the question of justice.  I do not know how people can put aside the question of justice.  How they can put aside the idea and the notion of fair play, all on the basis that there might be a backlash?  Those things remain.  They are enduring concepts and I do not think we can walk away from them on the basis of some sort of threat. Certainly people in this country who are part of a struggle for what they would consider to be basic rights would not have been impressed by the idea that people should say we should back off on the granting of those rights on the basis of what some people who had power might do.  The question of justice cannot be put aside on the basis of might will be right or people will start throwing their weight around unless we are nice to them when they are unfair or and unjust.  The principle of justice is something we have to stand by in this matter.  I do not think we should be frightened or intimidated by notions or talk of what the far right will do.</P>
    <P>In relation to some of the points made earlier in the debate, I agree with Senator Manning when he suggests that in relation to the black community in South Africa this country should try to provide them with as much help as possible to gear them up to be able to properly run South Africa in a post-apartheid society. I would certainly be very much in favour <Col N="1147" /> of getting people from the black community, from the various communities who have been the victims of apartheid across to this country, so that they can benefit from what we have to offer them by way of our experience in the Civil Service, in the academic world, in the business world and in the trade union movement.  It is very important that people from those communities who have been the victims of apartheid should be helped in any way that this country can help by way of gearing them to be able properly and effectively to run South Africa in a post-apartheid situation.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that I regret the fact that Nelson Mandela is not going to be able to address the Seanad.  I hope that even at this late stage it might be possible to reach some accommodation whereby he could be allowed to address the Seanad or a joint sitting of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to co-operate with your wishes.  First, I would like to support the motion and amendment all in relation to maintenance of sanctions until such time as certain progress has been made in South Africa.  Obviously, we all welcome developments there.  Like Senator Upton, I welcome the fact that <Col N="1148" /> Nelson Mandela will be coming here in a couple of weeks time.  It is unfortunate that he is not addressing either the Seanad or joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, I am sure most Members of the House will be in the Dáil Chamber.  We will all welcome him and look forward to hearing him.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the situation that has existed in South Africa and, hopefully, we will see, progress in the not too distant future.  As one who has not been to South Africa I certainly would not object to Members of this House going there. While I would not necessarily agree on many things with the two Senators who went there recently, they are both experienced campaigners and I accept their right to go.  I do not think they would be too easily duped into believing a situation exists when it does not.  I believe in trying to find out the facts on the ground, from talking to people, from first-hand observation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to sanctions, if I thought it would result in further acceleration of progress I would say have a small lifting of sanctions.  They can be replaced if there is not a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  We have seen certain progress in South Africa.  The majority population has to be involved.  There has to be a proper timescale.  Issues have to be thrashed out.  We are aware of the far right situation there.  I do not minimise the difficulties that exist.  We have to encourage all sides.  We should do whatever we can do in Ireland and as a member of the EC, in the latter days of the Presidency.  I am sure the EC will hold their position in relation to sanctions but if there is a possibility of progress being made there should be some give and take.  Obviously some progress has been made, not enough and not quick enough for most of us here but I firmly believe we have at least to attempt to go down that road.  We have to attempt to put things on the agenda, to negotiate, to talk.  As with the problem we have had in this country for so many years, it is only by having dialogue, by talking to the individuals involved, that the problem can be solved.  Following the visit of Mr. Mandela we will be better informed. <Col N="1149" /> People who have been in South Africa and have talked to people there have been given first hand information.  Even if it is not necessarily the total picture, it is more than we are getting from other quarters.  We have to work towards progress. Every individual in this House without exception wants to see progress in relation to the apartheid issue, wants to see negotiations take place, wants a timescale.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have been able to contribute briefly to the motion and the amendments.  The majority of Senators are at one in relation to this matter.  On the question of lifting sanctions obviously we will be guided by what people in South Africa say.  What they are saying at the moment is that they do not want sanctions lifted.  If further progress can be made, I for one would say that maybe some sanctions at some stage could be relaxed if there is a <i>quid pro quo</i>, if the people on the ground think it might benefit them.  Obviously in all this there have to be negotiations and discussion.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in supporting both the motion and the amendment.  I am sure all of us in this House are at one on this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to have been afforded this opportunity to give the Government's view on recent developments in South Africa.  As many speakers before me have indicated the developments are truly dramatic.  Who could have imagined, even a year ago, that we would see the sight of the President of South Africa sitting down to negotiate with Nelson Mandela, the prisoner of an apartheid regime for 27 long years and the embodiment of the oppression of the majority by the white minority under the <Col N="1150" /> insane policy of separate development? This image, flashed across the newspapers and television screens of the world, symbolises the hope which we all share for a new dawn in South Africa, a new beginning which holds out the prospect of a new South Africa, free of violence and racism, which takes its proper place as an African nation in the international community.</P>
    <P>The potential of these developments, not only for South Africa but also for the African continent, has rightly been compared in its significance to the impact of the developments of the past year on the continent of Europe in which countries of central and eastern Europe one after another have succeeded in freeing themselves from the legacy of misguided ideology.  In the case of South Africa, the limelight must surely be shared by two men, President Frederick W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela.  On the one hand, a man whose spirit 27 years of imprisonment could not crush and whose dignity and statesmanship have amazed all of those with whom he has come in contact; on the other, a representative of the party that imposed the regime of apartheid on his country but who has come to see that the ideology that sustained it was bankrupt.  To the extent that hopes for radical change can reside in the qualities of individuals, then, for South Africa, the hopes, not only of South Africans, but also of the world reside in the trust that has been established between President de Klerk, the elected representative of a minority, and Nelson Mandela, the unelected but charismatic leader of the unenfranchised and dispossessed in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The changes that have taken place in the past six months have been truly dramatic when measured against the years of oppression, the release of Nelson Mandela and of many other imprisoned leaders; the unbanning of organisations such as the ANC; the suspension of the application of the death penalty &mdash; these early indications from President de Klerk's Government heralded a new phase in South Africa, so unaccustomed in its nature that it took time for many <Col N="1151" />&mdash; both inside and outside South Africa &mdash; to adjust to its significance.  After the brief &ldquo;honeymoon period&rdquo;, both President de Klerk and Mr. Mandela had to commence the difficult task of bringing their respective constituencies with them towards the far more difficult task of negotiating the future of South Africa, a process to which neither side is accustomed. In many ways, opposition and hatred is the easier path; the path of negotiation, with the inevitable compromises that it involves, is a far more difficult one, one that is a true test of leadership.</P>
    <P>Happily, we can also say today that &mdash; again thanks largely to the inspirational leadership of both Nelson Mandela and President de Klerk &mdash; the remaining obstacles to substantive negotiations on the future of South Africa seem close to being overcome.  The lifting of the state of emergency in South Africa has long been recognised as a key precondition to the start of negotiations, since its existence severely restricts the freedom of action of political movements.  The recent decision by the South African Government to lift the state of emergency, except in the strife-torn province of Natal, is therefore a development of major significance.  There is hope for an early resolution of the related issues of political prisoners and exiles, based on the work of the Government/ANC Working Group which was given the task of coming up with an agreed definition of political crime and recommending an appropriate mechanism for screening those involved.  The agreed conclusions of the talks-about-talks which took place at the beginning of May also committed both sides to work towards peaceful solutions.</P>
    <P>These recent developments all point the way towards an early commencement of substantive negotiations on the future of South Africa.  It is urgent that such negotiations, involving all parties &mdash; not just the government and the ANC &mdash; should commence without delay.  Ideally, all the participants in negotiations would be elected; in reality, this is not feasible <Col N="1152" /> and so it is necessary to ensure that all significant strands of opinion in South Africa are represented.  Statesmanship and compromise are also required on this issue so that unnecessary or unrealistic obstacles are not placed in the way of the commencement of negotiations.</P>
    <P>We must be clear what the negotiations are about, namely, the constitutional structure of a new, non-racial, democratic South Africa in which all traces of apartheid will have been eliminated. Since the whole structure of the present South African state has been erected on the misguided policy of separate development, this is a major undertaking.  President de Klerk's Government have taken the first steps towards dismantling the apartheid system by introducing legislation to repeal one of the so-called pillars of apartheid, the Separate Amenities Act.  This legislation, which authorises so called petty apartheid involving the degrading provision of separate facilities for different races &mdash; with the facilities provided for the majority being, of course, vastly inferior to those provided for the ruling white minority &mdash; is due to be passed through Parliament by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>President de Klerk has also promised to introduce legislation in the next session of Parliament to amend two other pillars of apartheid, the Group Areas Act and the Land Acts, which underpin the strategy of separate development, with different races being confined to separate areas, again with most of the land and the best areas being reserved for the white minority.  Finally, President de Klerk has stated that the fourth pillar of apartheid, the Population Registration Act which denies the franchise to the black majority, will, together with the full abolition of the Group Areas and Land Acts, be dealt with in the negotiations on a new constitutional order for South Africa.</P>
    <P>In terms of action to abolish apartheid, we are therefore at present at the stage of promises rather than action.  Furthermore, while President de Klerk has stated that he is committed to the abolition of apartheid and the establishment <Col N="1153" /> of democracy in South Africa, his statements about the need to protect the rights of minorities and about the unacceptability of an unqualified system of one man, one vote raise some questions. While constitutional protection of cultural and religious minorities is, in itself, unobjectionable, the suspicion inevitably arises when seen against the background of South African history, that what may be involved is the entrenchment in the new constitution of the privileges unjustly acquired by the white minority under the system of apartheid.  This will have to be clarified.</P>
    <P>We must also take account of the fact that, while most people &mdash; including Nelson Mandela &mdash; accept the sincerity of President de Klerk, he faces increasing opposition from white extremists who are unwilling to give up the privileges acquired under apartheid.  The opposition to reform seems also to come from the security forces, who continue to use excessive and lethal violence in dealing with members of the black majority.</P>
    <P>It can safely be said that South Africa is at a crossroads.  The way forward is along the path of the abolition of apartheid legislation and the establishment, through negotiation, of a new constitutional order in which all South Africans can benefit from true freedom and democracy.  The principles underlying the new South Africa were clearly set out in the declaration adopted unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly at its special session last December.  The task of the international community is to support the process of reform in South Africa.  This includes maintaining pressure on the South African Government until, in the words of the declaration, &ldquo;there is clear evidence of profound and irreversible changes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Within the European Community, foreign Ministers have agreed that the Community's measures in relation to South Africa can be reviewed when the state of emergency has been lifted and all political prisoners freed.  As I have already indicated, these conditions have not yet been met, though there is hope that they may be met in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" /> The Government's view is that, while recent developments in South Africa are encouraging, they do not yet meet the test of being &ldquo;profound and irreversible&rdquo;. We must remember that the actions taken to date by the South African Government welcome though they are, are still only in the realm of creating a suitable climate for negotiations in South Africa.  Even this objective has not yet been fully achieved and we have still to see concrete action to abolish the monstrous system of apartheid.  To abandon all sanctions at present, as some would suggest, would be a betrayal of Nelson Mandela and the difficult path he has embarked on.  We must remember that international pressure and moral authority are the only weapons Nelson Mandela has when dealing with the might of the South African Government and its security forces.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, must not rob him of that weapon until we are satisfied that it is no longer necessary to help achieve the profound and irreversible changes which are required in South Africa.  On the other hand, we must not elevate sanctions to the status of a principle; they are there to help achieve an objective and when we are satisfied that objective has been achieved, we should move to relax them, particularly bearing in mind the fact that President de Klerk also deserves and needs encouragement.  We must also remember that some of these sanctions bear heavily on the black community and that they should, therefore, only be maintained for as long as is strictly necessary.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, a Chathaoirligh, let me say that the Government view developments in South Africa with great hope, tempered by prudence and realism.  We welcome the prospect of a new non-racial and democratic South Africa taking its due place, as an African nation, in the United Nations and in the world community in general.  A dynamic and prosperous South Africa, which had harnessed the potential not only of its physical but also its human resources, could act as a dynamo of growth in its region, helping to relieve the image of poverty and backwardness which, sadly, <Col N="1155" /> is the one that Africa generally projects at present.  Let us, therefore, look forward to the early realisation of such a South Africa, without neglecting the steps needed to bring it about, including the maintenance of pressure on the South African Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to make brief comments on some of the amendments.  Senators Manning, Doyle, McDonald and O'Toole proposed that the original motion be amended by a call to the Government to maintain sanctions in accordance, they say, with five principles enunciated by the United Nations.  I assume that they are referring to the declaration issued by the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly previously referred to by me which met last December.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, this declaration calls on the international community to ensure that it does not relax existing measures aimed at encouraging the South African regime to eradicate apartheid until there is clear evidence of profound and irreversible changes, bearing in mind the objectives of the declaration. As I have already said, the Government fully support this position.</P>
    <P>Nowhere does the declaration lay down five principles as a condition for lifting sanctions.  The condition laid down is that there should be profound and irreversible changes.  I am sure if any Member wishes to get a copy of the declaration it would be readily available.  It is, therefore, obvious that this amendment, is based on a misunderstanding.  I hope the Senators involved will realise that and take the necessary actions as they see fit.</P>
    <P>Senators Murphy and Ross, on the other hand, proposed that the motion be amended by substituting &ldquo;calls on the Government to maintain the necessary pressure&rdquo; by &ldquo;calls on the Government to consider the easing of sanctions as an encouragement to the Government of South Africa&rdquo;.  Again, I will amplify what I have already said in my statement.  The Government, while wishing to encourage <Col N="1156" /> the South African Government along the path of reform, do not consider that the time is right to relax the pressure.  The time to relax the pressure will be when the Government are satisfied that profound and irreversible change leading to the abolition of the apartheid system has been brought about.</P>
    <P>I commend to Senators the original wording of the motion which I believe best reflects the spirit of the debate which has taken place here today.  I conclude by complimenting all the Senators on a long day's debate, their commitment to, their understanding of and the serious manner in which the motion was dealt with.  It is a serious matter indeed.  I appreciate the courtesy extended to me here in the Seanad all day and acknowledge on behalf of the Government and myself the sincerity of the contributions made by all Senators.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, may I ask the Minister to clarify one point.  In his statement he makes it clear that the Government regard sanctions, retention or maintenance, as a strategy, not a principle.  How can that be reconciled with such emotive language as saying &ldquo;dropping sanctions would be a betrayal&rdquo;?  It seems to me that no purpose is served&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should begin by giving an explanation of the background to this whole issue. The timber industry depends on integration of the uses of the timber produced from our forests.  Contrary to popular opinion there are various different uses of timber according to size and grade. <Col N="1159" /> When we go to harvest our timber basically there is a large volume which is not of millable quality and goes directly to our pulp mills.  As well as that, our pulp mills use up to 50 per cent of the production of our sawmills, that is to say for every tonne of timber a sawmill processes, a half tonne of timber will eventually wind up in a pulp mill.</P>
    <P>At present the sawmills throughout the country produce chips, bark and sawdust. To give an idea of the scale we are talking about in the timber industry in Ireland, we had last year volume usage of 1.5 million cubic metres which would be about 1.3 million tonnes with a value exforest to Coillte Teoranta of just under £28 million.  By the year 2000 it is expected that the volume of timber coming on the market in the Twenty-Six Counties, will be 3.2 million cubic metres or nearly three million tonnes.  This will have at present prices a value to Coillte Teoranta of about £60 million per annum. Of this production 800,000 tonnes approximately went into saw log and about 500,000 tonnes into pulp wood. The main problem that arises is that of the 800,000 tonnes that goes into saw log, we produce at present annually about 80,000 tonnes of sawdust and about 343,000 tonnes of timber chips.  The value to the timber industry of sawdust at present ex-yard is approximately £700,000 where the value of timber chips to the timber industry annually would be in the region of £4 million.  Added to that we would have a value on bark of approximately £800,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>It is seen that the residue industry from our sawmills is worth in excess of £5 million per annum to the timber industry. Ensuring stable markets for this material is of prime importance to the timber industry because if anything were to happen to the residue market, if any instability were to occur, the possible knock-on effects to the timber industry as a whole and to Coillte Teoranta would be of disastrous consequences.</P>
    <P>At present we have two main pulp users in the Twenty-six Counties Finsa Forest Products in Scarriff, County Clare, <Col N="1160" /> who manufacture chipboard, and Medite in Clonmel who manufacture medium density fibreboard, or MDF as it its called.  In the North, in Coleraine, Sanboard are in the chipboard market.  As is obvious, because we are very limited in the type of product we produce from our residues, we are very vulnerable to changes in the market.</P>
    <P>In their annual report this year Coillte Teoranta said that, in the pulpwood sector, increased processing capacity will be needed to absorb additional pulpwood supplies and sawmill residue.  This is probably an understatement of the urgency of the matter because they also say that last year while the market for saw log and timber stakes, etc., was buoyant, the demand for pulpwood from the panel board mills was less buoyant as a result of increased availability of sawmill residues. If that is the situation at present &mdash; it is my information that the pulpmills are not in a position even at present to absorb all the residues and material being made available &mdash; it is likely to get much worse in the years to come.  Furthermore, by basically having most of our eggs in one basket as regards the type of outlets we have for residues &mdash; they are mainly going into the manufacture of chipboard and MDF &mdash; we are putting ourselves at risk in a big way and making this industry unnecessarily vulnerable.  It is very important that there would be one or two new pulp users introduced into this country involved in different type of products, who would be involved in the international market, preferably involved in products outside the present range produced here, and that they should use the high grade quality chip, the full potential of which is difficult to realise on the domestic market.</P>
    <P>The urgency of this cannot be overstressed because, if further contraction occurs within the chipboard sector, the exposure of the timber industry would be at a dangerous level.  The possibility of exporting our residues, even if this were desirable, is also very limited due to the transport costs involved.  At present high quality chips are being exported from the east coast but this is not an option for the <Col N="1161" /> producer on the west coast where, even at present, the cost of transporting residues from mill to market or to user can take up up to 40 per cent of the value delivered to the pulp user.  In the case of exports, the cost of transport would exceed the money that would be paid for the product.</P>
    <P>On this particular issue it is very important that we look at the likely sources of timber in this country within the years to come.  Up to now, most people have associated production of timber mainly with the south and east of the country. While that is true on present figures &mdash; for example, in the Bray and Kilkenny regional areas last year the total volume of timber sold was 539,000 cubic metres compared to 332,000 cubic metres on the west coast in the Galway and Sligo regions &mdash; the reverse is true when you look at the hectares planted.  Due to the fact that this is young timber and has not come on the market yet, this has not shown up in sales figures but we know, for example, that in the eastern region the land held by Coillte Teoranta is 86,000 hectares compared to 154,000, or twice the hectarate, in State hands in the western part of the country.</P>
    <P>It is also well recognised within the industry that there has been a large amount of private planting in the west and that the expansion being carried out by Coillte Teoranta has mainly occurred in the western and north-western part of the country.  Allied to that is the problem of species.  A lot of pine is produced in this country.  We might possibly look for alternative uses for pine, because much of it is of such a quality that it is only useful in pulpmills.  At present something in the region of 29 per cent of the total timber plantings is pine.  If a breakdown was given of the land planted in the western regions in most cases this would exceed over 50 per cent.  This means the a lot of the production from the forests in the west, in the next ten to 15 years, will be of a qualify that it will go straight to the pulp user.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that, where there is surplus timber available to pulp users, straight from the forest and residues from mills, <Col N="1162" /> there is a tendency to opt for the product coming straight from the forest.  This increases the vulnerability of timber mills to the vicissitudes of the pulp market.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what plans there are to build one or two more main pulp mills &mdash; preferably in the paper sector &mdash; to ensure that an industry that has been nurtured, that is providing a large amount of employment, that is the backbone of a lot of rural areas, that is probably the shining light for the future in some of the western areas, would not be vulnerable due to a lack of action or planning in ensuring that there are adequate outlets for residues from our timber mills.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister what plans there are to examine other uses for timber residues.  For example, it has been suggested that sawdust properly treated can be used in a similar way to peat as an activated carbon compound which is beginning to be used in such things as sewage treatment.  We know there is a growing market in the poultry and horse industries for the use of shavings instead of straw and also for horse gallops, etc.</P>
    <P>We should not forget as a residue the use of bark as a horticultural product. Five years ago most timber mills were dumping their bark which was an environmental hazard rather than an environmental asset.  At present bark will fetch X million in this country, even on the west coast, approximately £10 per tonne which gives it a national value according to my reckoning somewhere in the region of £1 million per annum to the industry.  The need for us to develop indigenous bark industries that would market this product, which is an alternative to peat products in the horticultural industry, based on this raw material is obvious.  If we accept the fact that the volume of bark will double within the next ten years this becomes more important than ever.  I suggest that might be worth looking at; Bord na Móna, considering they have already got market outlets in this particular type of product through the peat industry and also <Col N="1163" /> because of their central location, geographically with the country, might be interested in considering this as a possible diversification.</P>
    <P>I have always felt from my involvement with this industry that it is one that should be treated on an all-Ireland basis if possible. Timber crosses the Border daily. Timber produced by Coillte Teoranta is sold in the North, residues come over and back and effectively as regards the movement of timber there is no Border. It is one area where North-South co-operation could be brought to a new level if we could agree to use our indigenous raw material in this island and also plan our usages of pulp based on the total production and projected production of timber within the Thirty-Two Counties area.  If it was done on that basis we would find that there is not only room for one more pulp user but that there is room for two more pulp users in this country and that the more diversification that takes place in this way, the more we will ensure the stability of our very valuable timber industry, its continued success and growth and the continued contribution to our economy which last year was at about £150 million and which by the year 2000, even at today's money, would be worth about £300 million per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me thank Senator Ó Cuív for bringing this timely motion before the Seanad. Since the foundation of the State there has been a degree of interest in the development of the forestry industry.  It has been on a stop-go development programme since the early years of the State. In recent years I am glad that the whole development of the industry has gained a new momentum, with an accelerated <Col N="1164" /> planting programme and a tremendous degree of interest and indeed investment. With the creation of Coillte Teoranta, the commercial State-sponsored body, there is a new focus on the development of our forestry industry, which I am very pleased about.  In a nutshell, we want to get for the country the maximum value from this industry in terms of finance, job creation, and social and economic development generally.</P>
      <P>The main outlet for the residues and round pulpwood produced by sawmills is provided by pulpwood mills, which use the material in the manufacture of chipboard and particle board, and may also use sawdust as a burner fuel in their kilns. There are already two such mills in this country, that is, Finsa Forest Products in Scarriff, County Clare, and Medite in Clonmel, which produce chipboard and medium density fibreboard in their respective plants.  I understand that there are some technical difficulties at the moment at Finsa, which have resulted in a reduced intake of residues from sawmills, but this, I hope, is a temporary problem that can soon be put right.</P>
      <P>Other outlets for sawmill residues are the horticulture industry, where bark is used as a mulch material, and the export market, particularly in Scandinavia and, as Senator Ó Cuív said, many other outlets including the horse racing industry.  I understand, however, that the market in Scandinavia is oversupplied at the moment and consequently not very attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a third pulpwood plant in this country with the capability of paying better prices for residues and creating market demand would undoubtedly improve matters.  This matter is under discussion at present and would meet the criteria mentioned by Senator Ó Cuív.  That is it would be a new and different product; it would need quality input of raw materials and it would be destined for the export market.  It would need very substantial and significant investment and require a large quantity of raw material.  An international marketplace would have to be identified for <Col N="1165" /> it.  This can only be done after considerable study and research into the development of the industry itself and the potential of the marketplace.  Its development would benefit the primary timber producers, as the mill's major source of supply are, of course, the small roundwood or thinnings and residue from forestry operations, in particular those of Coillte Teoranta, but also those of the rapidly expanding private forestry sector.</P>
    <P>Supplies of small roundwood and sawmill residues are predicted to increase rapidly in the coming years, as more timber is produced, afforestation increases both in the public and private sectors and capacity in the sawmill industry expands.  Development plans outlined in the National Plan envisage an increase in small roundwood supplies from public forestry alone of approximately 50 per cent in the years to 1993, and further increases after that.  In the interests of achieving a better balanced and more integrated forest products industry, the establishment of a new pulpwood using facility in the country, which, as I have said, would also offer an additional outlet for sawmill residues, has been under consideration for some time.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the IDA and the Forest Service of the Department of Energy engaged international consultants, A.D. Little and Co. to study how additional pulpwood supplies might best be used.  The study was completed in 1988 and its basic conclusions were that: the two existing pulp mill plants should be supported and would be stronger through expansion, and there is little scope for the establishment of a third mill in the 1990s.  A chemi-thermo mechanical pulp mill, which could produce material such as folding box board, tissue and mechanical printing papers, is seen as the most likely option.</P>
    <P>The promotion of industry is primarily a matter for the IDA and industrial development agencies, but I am aware that both Medite and Finsa have plans for expansion, and discussions between the IDA, Coillte Teoranta and potential investors in a new pulpwood processing industry here are continuing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> It seems to me, therefore, that outlets for sawmill residues are adequate overall and that future developments will provide an additional demand.  Within this framework, it is, of course, a matter for suppliers and purchasers to come to their own agreements, taking all factors into account, and it must be allowed that occasional difficulties with operations, supplies or markets may arise from time to time, as in any business.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a new pulpwood mill will be a matter of interest to many people, but I must repeat that discussions are as yet at an early stage and there are no final agreements.  The location of the plant will also be of interest to suppliers, and indeed in the case of Coillte Teoranta supplies will be available mostly from the north-west region.  Other factors, such as the availability of substantial power, water and effluent treatment facilities, are also important; but I must emphasise that the final decision on location will be a matter for the investor, who will have to consider all the cost implications involved in setting up and operating a manufacturing process which will be largely export oriented.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy has already mentioned in the Dáil that one of my aims, now that Coillte Teoranta is over its first year and the Operational Programme for Forestry has been submitted to the EC, is to prepare a strategy for the development of the timber industry into the next century.  This will cover both the pulpwood and sawmilling sectors, and in this context the question of residues from sawmills can be considered.</P>
    <P>The potential of the timber industry can be considered against a background of the following: increasing timber production; an increasing timber deficit in both the EC, where imports are second in value only to oil, and in our neighbour the UK in particular; a particularly good growth rate in Irish forests, which yield on average a third more than UK forests and more than twice that of other European forests; the value added to new wood in processing &mdash; I think these figures are significant and in some cases, startling for people who are not familiar <Col N="1167" /> with the industry &mdash; where £1 of forest produce can become £5.50 from a sawmill, £19 from a particle board mill and £27 from a paper mill.  That, indeed is added value from £1 up to £27, so any acceleration in the development of that industry downstream for greater added value is to be welcomed very much indeed.</P>
    <P>These factors indicate the extent of the downstream industry which can be based on forest produce when a sufficient volume of quality material is available.</P>
    <P>The essential purpose of a development strategy is to ensure that the future development of the Irish timber sector reflects the efforts made in and the achievements of, the planting side and is focused on the needs of both the Irish and the international market place.  Forestry <Col N="1168" /> has been given a high priority by this Government and we must ensure an integrated development so that the industry as a whole can more easily prepare itself for the challenges and opportunities of 1992 and beyond.</P>
    <P>I believe that our successes in a few short years in the increased annual planting rate, the spectacular expansion of the private forestry sector, the continuing increase in production and, of course, the establishment of Coillte Teoranta show our commitment and capability in this sector, and our intention is to make the most of this inherent potential for the benefit of all of us.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.35 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 20 June 1990.</P>
