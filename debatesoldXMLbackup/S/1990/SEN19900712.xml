      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe Costello that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to make special provision for grants and subsidies to prevent hardship to people in the North inner city who will find it impossible to implement the new regulations regarding the use of smokeless fuels in the autumn because of their inadequate means.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The business for today is item No. 1, which is the Broadcasting Bill, 1990.  That will continue until 2 p.m.; we will have a sos from 2 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.  At 2.30 p.m. we propose to take, by agreement with Members on all sides of the House, the Health (Nursing Homes) Bill, 1989, until approximately 3.30 p.m. at which time we will recommence the Broadcasting Bill to 6.30 p.m., <Col N="270" /> when we will have a sos to 7 p.m.  We will continue after that to 10 p.m. with the Broadcasting Bill.</P>

      <P>As I indicated earlier in the week, we will be opposing the Order of Business today and I am formally proposing that item No. 1 not be taken today, that we will take items Nos. 2 and 3 instead.  I asked over the last two days that this Bill be deferred.  It is very bad practice in the case of any Bill that it comes straight from the Dáil into this House.  The whole purpose of the second House is that there be time for reflection on the Bill and that it can be looked at in a calm and reasoned way.  That is true of any Bill and it was never more true than in the case of this particular Bill today. No Bill in my memory has had a more acrimonious passage through the Dáil, no Bill has ever gone through such a botched series of procedures or has been so surrounded in recrimination.  Tempers are still high, people are tired.  There is a danger of compounding an already bad situation.  So, I am asking the Government not to take this Bill today.  The sensible thing to do is to postpone it until September when we can all look at it in a calm way.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the constitutionality of this Bill.  An editorial in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> very recently raised some very serious constitutional questions. Again, as legislators, it is our duty to reflect on these questions and we need time to do that.</P>
      <P>Also the text of the amended Bill arrived only half an hour ago.  That is a grave discourtesy to this House.  The Bill arrived in the first post this morning. There is no updated explanatory memorandum with the Bill.  Again, we are being asked, simply to convenience the Government and the Minister, to rush this Bill through in a totally unsatisfactory way.  So, I am saying, a Chathaoirligh, that there is no need for the Bill today. It does not come into effect until October and I am formally proposing that we amend the Order of Business by taking items Nos. 2 and 3 today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to note that this is a very historic day.  It is the 300th anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne, and perhaps that should be noted. It may also be the day on which another notable battle is fought in this House.  I will certainly be supporting Senator Manning in opposing the Order of Business because I think it is discourteous to the House to push this Bill in fresh from the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I would like to extend one thing that Senator Manning indicated.  This is in fact a very different Bill from the one about which we received notice some time ago. I do not think the proper time for reflection is being allowed.  The Bill passed last night in a very different form from that which was originally introduced.  We, who are supposed to be a reflective Chamber bringing expert knowledge and our own professional expertise to bear on the refinement of legislation, are placed in a situation where we could not possibly carry out the duty that is required of us as this particular branch of the Oireachtas.  I make that point strongly and I will certainly be very happy to support Senator Manning in what I think is a wise and appropriate decision to oppose the Order of Business this morning.</P>
      <P>I would like to raise one further point, if I may, and that is that I would like to put item No. 30 &mdash; the judgment of the European Court &mdash; and to point out to the Leader of the House that I would welcome a real update on this; otherwise I will be pushing for item No. 30 to be taken.  The matter has become far more serious in the light of the judgment of the Chief Justice, Mr. Finlay who, from what I have read in the newspapers, has clearly contradicted in yesterday's judgment some of the implications of the judgment he gave in my own case.  So, the position becomes daily more anomalous because of the refusal of the Government to act.</P>

      <P>We will be supporting the proposal to oppose the debate on the Broadcasting Bill this morning.  We do so for the reasons which are outlined.  We have obtained the Bill, effectively, five <Col N="272" /> or ten minutes ago.  We will also do it because what we are seeing here is essentially a damage limitation stroke from Fianna Fáil.  That is basically what it comes to.  We are now trying to limit damage on something which has been very badly thought out.  Certainly, we would need to have a bit of time to reflect, to calm down and to discuss this thing in an easy and thoughtful manner rather than having the whole thing rushed through this morning.</P>

Tá cloiste agam, ó fhoinsí éagsúla, nach bhfuil rudaí ag dul ar aghaidh i gceart.

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtús báire tacú leis an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Foighil.  Tá an-ghníomh déanta aige go dtí seo faoin fheachtas atá ar siúl aige chun córas aistriúcháin dhátheangach a chur ar fáil dúinne agus don lucht éisteachta, agus don phreas istigh anseo. Cé gur cheapamar go raibh cuid mhaith geallta, níl faic déanta, fad agus is féidir linn a fheiceáil fós.  Tá scéalta ag dul timpeall go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann agus go mbeidh moill ann.  Tá sé in am, ní fheadair duitse nó do Cheannaire an Tí, an scéal a thabhairt suas chun dáta dúinn, ar a laghad.  Agus tacaím leis an Seanadóir Ó Foighil maidir leis sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree fully with Senator Manning. There is something profoundly distasteful about this Bill.  It has generated extraordinary scenes in the other House which involved calling the Chair of the other House into question.  It is going to cause serious difficulties in this House.  I know it is not the wish of the decent man who is Leader of this House that this should be done and I profoundly regret the fact <Col N="273" /> it is being forced on him by outsiders who are not Members of this House that he should behave like this.</P>
    <P>The only point on which I disagree with Senator Manning is on the absence of an explanatory memorandum.  The explanatory memorandum for this Bill would be only two sentences.  This Bill is designed to crucify RTE, full stop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to agree with the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Manning, when he said that we should discuss this Bill in a calm and reasoned manner.  It would help us all if everybody in this House who has a vested interest in RTE, whether their granny, uncle, brother or cousin is working for RTE, were to declare if we have any personal interest whatsoever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil are introducing a Bill to which we cannot give proper reflection.  Perhaps for that side of the House proper reflection is ten minutes.  I suspect it is.  Proper reflection for them is simply to put it through on the nod. But it seems to me that, if we are not going to be mere lobby fodder and if we are not going to just rush a Bill through, we should give this Bill at least a month's consideration.  We should give it serious consideration.  It was amended in the Dáil as recently as yesterday.  It is showing total contempt for this House to be putting it before us now.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House might answer one or two questions for me.  First of all, could he tell us when it is proposed, if Second Stage is passed, which I presume it will be, because I think that is what all these people are doing here today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if, in the light of <Col N="275" /> the ongoing controversy, lack of certainty and great difficulty for families and children involved in the Beaumont dispute, and the fact that there are tremendous problems still going on in Beaumont, he proposes to have a special debate on this in the Seanad, or at least a statement from the Minister for Health.  Essentially, the situation is that there is no paediatric neuro-surgeon for children under the age of three since Mr. O'Neill was removed from his position, and it seems that children are being sent to Glasgow for surgery. I would ask the Leader of the House if he considers the situation in Beaumont and the ongoing problems in the Beaumont Hospital to be worthy of discussion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is an outrageous remark.  It is quite clear from the <Col N="276" /> remarks that have been made from these benches that what we are seeking is time to discuss this Bill and, furthermore, time to reflect on the Bill.  The purpose of the Seanad, as I understand it, if for that very purpose: to deal with Bills which have been steamrolled through the Dáil with tempers running high and there is no Bill in recent times that has caused such controversy and such outcry.  The Opposition were totally united in their opposition to the Bill.  Indeed, many Government backbenchers were opposed to it also.  Why is it being rushed through?  Originally there was an element of &ldquo;Save Century&rdquo; about the Bill which apparently put some pressure on the time factor.  What is the rush for?  Why can the Bill not be left until the autumn when we have had time to read the Bill, to read the amendments, and to reflect on it?  I think that the Progressive Democrats have been honest in here.  They said that they would abolish the Seanad.  Fianna Fáil are simply paying lip service to it and are treating it as a joke.  They will not give time to this House to fulfil the functions which it is supposed to carry out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to have more time to reflect on this Bill. RTE is the most important modern organ of communication in this State.  We are supposed to be here as communicators, communicating between each other, exchanging views, debating.  It is a source of great irony to me that something that should be the most important business of the House since I came here should be rushed through so quickly.  I would ask for some time for reflection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, will be opposing the Order of Business.  It was never the intention of this House &mdash; certainly on these benches &mdash; when a Bill should be debated the day that it arrived before us.  The Bill has been changed drastically since it was initiated; indeed, it changed at the eleventh hour before it came to this House.  We have just seen this Bill this morning and we are expected to be discussing on that very day one of the most important Bills to come before the <Col N="277" /> House or to come before the Oireachtas. Indeed, we were expected to discuss it in the space of a few minutes after having seen the Bill.  That is totally unacceptable and it reflects a very serious contempt for the workings of this House.  I do not consider it as a Broadcasting Bill; it is an act of vandalism against RTE.  It is a naked attack on RTE&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in trying to take advantage of your opportunity here, Senator.  You are not in a position to debate the merits or otherwise of the Bill.  We are on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that it is unnecessary for us to debate it here and now.  It is unnecessary that it be rushed because there is an operational date from 1 October.  There will be plenty of time for this House to debate it at greater leisure and with a greater period for reflection.  That is what this House should be doing.  It is supposed to be a House that is able to reflect, to examine thoroughly and to be a check on legislation to ensure that it is proper and good legislation.  The function of the House as such is being undermined.  I must oppose the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I would finally ask the Leader of the House what his intentions are in relation to the progress of the Bill?  How does he envisage that in a short space of time a Bill that caused such controversy, that took such a huge length of time for debate, on which there was such a huge number of amendments, amendments which were not allowed to be discussed, that a guillotine was imposed, there was such an uproar in the other House &mdash; how does he intend to get this Bill through in the short period that remains before the end of this session?  From any logical and reasonable point of view, in the context both of the traditions and the functions of this House, everything demands that this Bill be left for proper examination, investigation and debate in the autumn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that we are genuinely wasting valuable time here this <Col N="278" /> morning.  If these people on the other side of the House are concerned about this Bill they should get on with it and debate it properly rather than wasting time.  We are almost 25 minutes on this at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree at all with Senator Kiely in that regard.  It is because we are so concerned about this Bill that we are spending an unusual amount of time discussing it on the Order of Business this morning.  Because we are still on the Order of Business, I will confine my remarks in relation to the issue to a single comment.  It is an understatement to say that this Broadcasting Bill is extremely controversial.  The whole purpose, as I understand it, of the Upper House is that the Seanad is to be vocational in its approach.  It is to be reflective; it is to be measured in its response.  We are to put the brakes on especially in areas where there is controversy.</P>
      <P>The summer holiday issue is a total irrelevance.  I would like to get my break as much as any other Senator in this House.  But we would be doing a huge disservice to our electorate and to the people of this country if, merely because there was a summer holiday issue, we must, <i>ipso facto</i>, rush through hugely controversial legislation without due consideration. The whole reason for the reflective purpose of the Seanad is to allow public opinion to be considered, to allow public opinion to galvanise its views and to articulate its response on issues.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Government have not, in my view, given a single coherent reason why there is a need for haste in this issue and I am one of those who is all for putting the brakes on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I seldom speak on the Order of Business, but I rise on this occasion to support the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Manning, in his appeal for a lapse of time so that we can have a quiet and orderly discussion on this Bill.  Over the past number of weeks I have not even sat in on the debate in the other House because I believe we <Col N="279" /> should take the legislation as presented to us and deal with it as such.</P>
      <P>The question of this Bill being passed late last night and on our Order Paper this morning is unusual and unique.  In my long experience here the House has always been very fair to whatever Government is in office in taking important legislation.  Practically every year there is a Motion for Early Signature on the Social Welfare Bill, because it is a time situation.  Similarly, the Finance Bill has got to be passed all Stages within 90 days of the Budget.  But in this present situation, where section 2 of the Bill gives a commencement date of 1 October, it would not be unusual for this House to meet in September, as we have on practically every year for the last 20 years, especially in the periods when Professor Dooge was Leader of the House.  I would not object to coming back in the first, second or third week of September, or the first week for the Second Stage and the second week for the Committee and remaining Stages, so that we could consider this legislation in a calm and detached fashion.</P>
      <P>One of my colleagues on the other side, Senator McGowan, asked that we should declare an interest.  Every individual in the State who looks at television must have an interest and it touches on all our lives.  I would ask that we should be able to ensure that, whatever this legislation does, it will enhance the public service, it will enhance the service to the viewers, to the people of this country.  There is really no reason why we should make a more controversial issue of it.  This House has never been political.  I would hope that we should be able to revert to that situation where, even though it has been political in the other House, we can consider this legislation on its merits in a calm and thoughtful manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with my colleagues in objecting to the way this Bill is presented.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House to deny the fact, regardless of the merits of any amendments or any arguments put forward for <Col N="280" /> change in the Bill, that a decision has now been made by the Government not to accept them by virtue of the fact that it would be required to go back to the Dáil and, because the Dáil is adjourning, it would have to be recalled.  Regardless of the arguments and regardless of the merit of amendments put by this, or any other side of the House, a decision has now been made not to accept them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In all about 18 Members have spoken on the Order of Business this morning.  By far the most of them referred to the Broadcasting Bill.  I would have to say that it has been well known in this House that we would be taking it this week.  The Whips were aware of it and many Members on all sides of the House were positively aware it was proposed to take it today.</P>
      <P>I will go back and refer briefly to what I said earlier in the week regarding legislation generally.  The Finance Bill, a Bill of 104 sections, was debated in this House for something like 15 hours, arguably the most important Bill of the year, the Social Welfare Bill had 51 sections we debated it for five hours.  We are giving plenty of time to debate this Bill, a Bill of 20 sections and one limited in what it sets out to do.</P>

      <P>The Bill has been debated in the other House for more than 50 hours and today we are allowing for a debate of ten hours.  The Whips will meet perhaps this morning or else in the afternoon to decide on the other Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the first time a Bill was passed in the Dáil and came quickly to the Seanad.  Senator McDonald referred to the former Senator Dooge, a man I admired greatly at all times.  I had the honour of being Opposition spokesman on health at the time and I can remember that on a Monday a Bill was published and sent to us for major debate on the following Wednesday.  This kind of thing <Col N="281" /> happens to all Governments and we have to accept it.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not come into effect until 1 October.  It is unreal for the Opposition to ask that it be deferred.  We are taking it today and we will debate it until 10 p.m.</P>
    <P>Regarding the other queries, I am sure Senators will understand if I do not mention them because I have covered much of what they said in my comments on the Broadcasting Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also referred to it and made some comments on item 30, I have noted what he said in regard to that particular matter.  Senator Upton spoke about the Broadcasting Bill.  Maidir le Seanadóir Ó Foighil agus Seanadóir Ó Cuív, beidh mé ag caint leo maidir leis an gceist sin tráthnóna inniu, b'fhéidir.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator Ross also referred to the Broadcasting Bill.  Senator McGowan agreed with Senator Manning's request for calm and reason on the Broadcasting Bill.  Senator Ross asked about the Committee Stage, I said that the Whips will meet.  I have no comment to make on the Beaumont <Col N="282" /> dispute.  Senator Farrell's comment was not appropriate.  Senator Hederman referred to the Broadcasting Bill and used the word &ldquo;steamroll&rdquo;.  I do not accept that we are steamrolling the Bill. Senators Jackman, Costello and Dan Kiely referred to the Broadcasting Bill as did Senators Staunton, McDonald and Neville.</P>

I wish to point out that the amendment, as moved by Senator Manning, was not formally seconded but, because there is such a volume of support for the amendment as proposed by Senator Manning I am concluding that it is in order and I am taking the amendment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to move this Bill and to set out for this House the rationale behind our proposals and the end they are intended to achieve.</P>
      <P>To set the scene I will dwell, very briefly, on the broadcasting environment we inherited on assuming office in 1987. The situation was chaotic, to say the least, with 60 to 70 pirate stations operating, flouting all legal regulatory and moral obligations.  Unfettered by the ideological preoccupations of the previous Administration we immediately set out to put in place the regulatory framework to order a sector that was snowballing out of control, and to allow the Irish public to create its own multiplicity of choice in broadcasting which the &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; phenomenon demonstrated they so craved.</P>
      <P>In formulating our policy in this area we were particularly mindful of the dissatisfaction with the monopolistic state run broadcasting services throughout Western Europe and very conscious of the fact that this was probably the last opportunity to influence, in a major way, the development of a strong and vibrant Irish broadcasting industry before the pace of development in international broadcasting completely overwhelmed us.</P>
      <P>It is a central tenet of the Government and Fianna Fáil's broadcasting policy to provide an alternative to the State broadcasting monopoly particularly in the area of news and current affairs.  We are in the era of transnational satellite broadcasting and we may not turn back the clock. Conscious of the need to balance to some extent the ever increasing plethora of external broadcast services it was imperative to provide the general public with alternative sources of Irish generated broadcast news and current affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other important facets of the Government broadcasting policy are: to ensure that Irish broadcasting becomes a growth industry in line with the growth of broadcasting seen in all other European countries; ensuring as far as possible that Irish broadcasting remains the mainstream <Col N="286" /> Irish viewers' and listeners' choice; bringing new investment and higher productivity into Irish broadcasting; creating new secure employment in the sector, and providing a seed bed for the growth of an independent audio-visual industrial business in the country.  In these we are in line with the European trend and indeed in advance of many European countries.</P>
    <P>The broadcasting structures created through the Radio and Television Act, 1988, were, therefore, a response to the domestic and international broadcasting environment.  From this solid base future evolution will be easier and Irish broadcasting will be better able to keep abreast of the frantic pace of development in the sector.</P>
    <P>The 1988 Radio and Television Act opened up the broadcasting sector to new entrants.  The recent Joint National Listenership Research/Market Research Bureau of Ireland figures are ample evidence of the success the emerging radio stations have had in securing listenership. They indicate that on an average weekday over 1 million, or 40 per cent of all listeners are tuning in to one or more of their independent stations.  The figures also show that seven of the local stations surveyed had higher audience figures than 2FM.  Their success is all the more laudable when one considers that many of these stations have only been on the air a matter of months.  They have captured the imagination of their respective listenership in a way in which even the most optimistic of independent radio proponents would not have dreamed possible. I congratulate them on the success their initiative and enterprise has gained for them.</P>
    <P>Now that much has been done to open up the broadcasting sector it is imperative to establish a fair competitive environment in it.  In essence this means that the factors which enable RTE to have an excessively dominant position in a competitive context must be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>A major element which creates a distortion in the market <i>vis-a-vis</i> competing services is RTE's dual funding.  While the <Col N="287" /> primary purpose of RTE's State subvention is to enable it to meet certain public service obligations, the effect of the subvention goes beyond that role.  It enables RTE to sell its advertising time at, in effect, &ldquo;below cost&rdquo; rates and thereby artificially dominate the market.</P>
    <P>So the competing independent services, whose legal mandate in terms of public service obligations is the same as RTE's, lose on two scores.  They do not have the benefit of licence fee income to help meet their public service obligations or to support and sustain the development of their services or to enable them provide a competitive range of programming. At the same time they must compete with the below cost selling of advertising time and the artificially dominant position thereby created by RTE in the advertising market.  And it is not alone the independent broadcasting sector that is affected by this distorted competition; it impacts also on the print media.</P>
    <P>I had a number of avenues open to me to deal with this distortion.  Having put forward some proposals and duly gauged informed and reasoned reaction, I reverted to my original thinking to place some constraints on RTE's role in the advertising market.  The means to this end are set out in section 3 of the Bill.  In short they are: a statutory time limit on advertising on RTE's services of 7.5 per cent of total daily programme transmission time &mdash; as against its current limit of 10 per cent &mdash; and a maximum of five minutes of advertising in any one hour&mdash; as against the current maximum of seven minutes and 30 seconds, a limit on the revenue the Authority may derive annually from advertising, sponsorship or other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasts equal to the amount of the grant paid to it in respect of licence fees in the preceding financial year, that amount having been adjusted by the increase in the customer price index in that preceding year, as published by the Central Statistics Office; and in the period from commencement day until 31 December 1990 a ceiling equal to 120 per cent of <Col N="288" /> the sum that will be payable to RTE in respect of the grant equivalent to licence fees in that same period.</P>
    <P>I expect that these measures will lead to the diversion of around £12 million in advertising revenue in current terms in a full year.  It will be up to the different media to earn their share of this diverted revenue on the merit of their own worth and relative cost attractiveness.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the potential impact of this loss of revenue on the financial viability of RTE, its employment levels and programming standards. Basically, the proposals return RTE to their 1988 level of income.  In that particular year RTE incurred considerable costs in relation to increased broadcasting hours; higher programming standards; staging the Eurovision Song Contest; extensive coverage of the European Championship in West Germany and extensive coverage of the Olympic Games in Seoul; and turned in a surplus of £5.3 million.  In this context talk of doom and gloom for RTE is completely without foundation and does not do justice to the enterprising spirit of the Authority and its staff.</P>
    <P>The new corporate environment this Bill creates at RTE will call for a whole new set of strategic goals as new areas of revenue generation are sought and RTE's position as our prime broadcaster consolidated. Much innovative and pioneering thinking will be called for and, as RTE has proved in the past, I have every confidence that the organisation and staff are equal to the challenge that lies ahead.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill deals with codes of practice relating to advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion.  The code, when drawn up, will apply to all broadcasting services and the objective is to ensure fairness and uniformity of practice across the board. I expect that the code will draw, in part, on RTE's existing code of practice and will, for instance, where necessary, incorporate various international obligations such as those arising under the recently adopted EC Directive on Broadcasting Activities.  The code will also deal <Col N="289" /> with the grey areas of prizes on programmes, cross service promotion, promotion of ancillary commercial activities, etc.</P>
    <P>In section 5, I have introduced an additional safeguard to ensure that RTE maintains its 1989 level of independently produced broadcast material.  While I remain firmly convinced that the measures set out in section 3 will not lead to the level of rationalization envisaged in some quarters, it is important that hasty decisions be avoided.  Independently produced programmes and, in particular, independently home produced programmes have been an integral part of RTE popularity for many years and have contributed a great deal to increased audience numbers.  In 1989 RTE paid £2.9 million to independent production houses and some 3 per cent of its output came from that sector.  I now wish to assure the independent production sector that those levels will continue as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>The EC directive on television broadcasting comes into force on 3 October 1991 and thereby assures the long-term commitment of broadcasters to generous levels of independently produced programming. This commitment will firmly underpin the independent sector in their core business and in time should provide the financial and experience resource to enable them to develop into a major domestic and export industry.  Recent Irish screen successes, in particular the Oscar-winning &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo;, have shown that we have talented people who can take on the huge money-rich American studios and win.  The solid foundation provided by this section and the EC directive can provide a springboard from which those heights may again be assailed.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is a provision which enables the Independent Radio and Television Commission to enter into a contract with the TV 3 operator, additional to the primary contract, whereby that operator can supplement the cable and MMDS modes of transmission with a separate conventional UHF transmission system.  This is a recognition that cable and MMDS, <Col N="290" /> being subscription services, will not be taken by every household in the country and this provision will ensure the availability of TV3 to those who may not want to avail of the multiplicity of services on cable or MMDS.  It also ensures that TV3, when it comes on air, will be in a position to maximise its audience and potential without undue technological constraint.  This, again, underlines the Government's commitment to fairness and equality of opportunity in this sector.</P>
    <P>There have been some uninformed suggestions that the proposal to allow the third television channel to establish its own UHF transmission system rules out the possibility of establishing a Teilifís na Gaeltachta, should a decision to that effect be taken.  This is quite incorrect. On the technical side, while UHF frequencies are in very limited supply, we have in fact retained sufficient of them to enable such a service to be established. Likewise, the proposed capping of RTE's advertising revenue has no bearing on the question of reaching a decision on the establishment of a Teilifís na Gaeltachta service.</P>
    <P>For sometime now RTE have been pressing for authority to appoint their own auditors and section 7 gives them this freedom.  RTE's accounts are audited at the moment by the Comptroller and Auditor General and through no fault of that office or RTE the Authority has come in for criticism in the past because of very late publication of their annual report and accounts.  This freedom should alleviate that problem.</P>
    <P>Section 18B of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 (as inserted by section 4 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976) defines the functions of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and sets out the various categories of complaints with which the commission may deal.  Section 8, sets out an additional category of complaint relating to the assertion of inaccurate facts or information in a broadcast relating to a person such as to constitute an attack on the honour or reputation of that person. This provision is necessary to enable us to transparently comply with the &ldquo;Right <Col N="291" /> of Reply&rdquo; provisions of the EC Directive on Broadcasting Activities and also the Council of Europe's Convention on Transfrontier Television.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 to 15 create a series of new offences and penalties relating to various acts associated with the unauthorised interception of cable services and MMDS services.</P>
    <P>The level of unauthorised connections to cable systems in this country far outstrips that in any other country with cable.  When MMDS comes fully onstream we expect that the problem will arise in that area also.  I have listened carefully to the representations of the industry and am acutely aware of frustration of the long-suffering paying subscriber. In bringing forward this legislation I am happy that the problems will be appropriately addressed.  This legislation will also ensure that the fledgling MMDS operation is not severely undermined by the operation of a &ldquo;black economy&rdquo; in pirate decoders.  To act now will root out this scourge before it gets time to flourish.</P>
    <P>The penalties we propose for the new offences are similar to those applying in respect of the illegal use of wireless telegraphy under the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988, that is a maximum fine of £1,000 and/or three months imprisonment on summary conviction and £20,000 and/or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment. Provision is also made for forfeiture of any equipment used in connection with the offences in question. Apart from the criminal offences being introduced, the Bill also provides for recourse to the civil remedy process. Cable and MMDS operations may be more inclined to use this provision as it can be a much speedier process than that of taking criminal prosecutions.</P>
    <P>We are in an era of rapid technological advances and section 16 is a recognition of this.  The section enables the Minister by positive order to extend the provisions of sections 9 to 15 of the Bill to services transmitted by wireless telegraphy other than cable or MMDS.  The most obvious <Col N="292" /> example here is a premium satellite television service such as a film channel which is sent out in encrypted form.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and 18 are essentially technical amendments to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988. Having gone to such a deal of trouble to modernise wireless telegraphy legislation it is essential that any ambiguities be ironed out.</P>
    <P>Section 17 clarifies, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Minister's licensing powers under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 includes a power to limit the number of licences he may issue for the various classes of wireless telegraphy apparatus.  Such a power is wholly consistent with attaining the most efficient management of frequency spectrum &mdash; the 1926 Act being the Act under which the vast majority of radio communication systems in this country are licensed.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is basically a correction to the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988.  Under that Act the various offences relating to illegal broadcasting can be prosecuted within two years of the offence being committed. However, in drafting we overlooked extending the same period for prosecutions to the basic offences under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 and this provision remedies that deficiency.</P>
    <P>The repeals in section 19 are consequences of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Those are my proposals and I strongly commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House and to assure him that I will not match his speed of delivery in what I have to say.</P>
      <P>We object, as we have made very clear, to the taking of this Bill today.  As a general principle, we would object to any Bill coming straight from the Dáil to the Seanad.  This should happen only in the case of the most pressing urgency, as in the case of a social welfare Bill or a financial Bill, where there is a need for the legislation to be put into immediate effect or in the case of purely technical Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> One of the main reasons, as virtually every Opposition speaker said on the Order of Business this morning, for a second House such as this is to allow time for reflection and reappraisal and no Bill has ever been more in need of reflection or reappraisal than this one.  Instead of that, what we are getting is this Bill being steamrolled &mdash; I know the Leader of the House objected to that word but that is what is happening &mdash; through this House over a very short number of days. Clearly, the Minister is intent on getting it through.  Clearly, as Senator Hederman said this morning, there is no intention of accepting any amendments on this Bill. Otherwise, why the rush, why the push to get it through so quickly?  It is going to be the Bill, as we have it, the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill.  There is going to be no question of any amendments on it.</P>
    <P>This rush is not dictated by a question of getting better broadcasting or of serving the common good.  This is a question of ministerial pride.  The Minister has taken a pasting over the past number of weeks.  His image and prestige have been battered and he, of all people, wants to see this Bill through as quickly as possible so that he can set about rebuilding his own image.  This time, because of ministerial necessity, the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil juggernaut is going to steamroll the Bill through this House as it did through the other House. There is going to be no more &ldquo;Mr. Nice Guy&rdquo; on this Bill.  The guillotine will fall and it will fall again and again until this Bill, as it is here today, is on the Statute Book.  That is no way to do business.  It is no way to do business on any legislation and, most emphatically, it is no way to do business on this legislation.</P>
    <P>This is the worst piece of legislation to come before the Oireachtas in the past decade.  It is being rushed through by the Minister as if he were afraid of being caught out, of his real intentions being rumbled before the legislation is put on the Statute Book.  Anybody looking in at the events of the past few weeks will ask one simple, obvious question.  Why the rush; what is the urgency; what is the <Col N="294" /> hurry?  There is none whatsoever.  Certainly, any sensible person looking at the shambles of what happened in the other House, at the unprecedented rancour which the Bill provoked in the other House, looking at the ill-will which it generated, the deterioration in personal relationships, the distrust which has surrounded this Bill from the start, again would say the only sensible thing to do is to postpone this Bill, to put it on ice even for a month.  We are quite prepared to come back here in the beginning of September to examine this Bill in the atmosphere which we hope would then prevail.</P>
    <P>We all want to let the dust settle, to restore some sense of calm, to allow for some reflection on the Bill.  Should that happen, the Minister would have plenty of time to listen to the people he did not listen to over the past few weeks and to realise that this is an inherently bad Bill, bad in almost every single respect.  It certainly would be in the interest of better legislation and in the interest of broadcasting generally were the Minister, I will not say back down, but simply to change course at this stage and accept that this is the way we should go.  The Minister can still do that.  He can complete Second Stage next week and then postpone the taking of the Committee Stage until September. We have made a formal request to that end but we have been turned down.  The question arises: why the rush?</P>
    <P>I have at this stage to protest that the Minister came in, rushed through his speech and is now leaving the House. This, again, is a very discourteous way to treat this House.  In the past week Minister Reynolds came in, listened very carefully to the debate and treated the House and the legislation in the way in which they deserved to be treated.  We had the Minister coming in and clearly showing his disdain for us so, for that reason, a Chathaoirligh, I think we need a quorum.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 12 Members were not present; House counted and 12 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret doing that.  This <Col N="295" /> is the first time I have had to call for a quorum in my time in the House but it was the only way in which I could protest against the behaviour of the Minister who came in, galloped through his speech, waited for three or four minutes thereafter and then left.  This is not the way to treat the House.  As I said, Minister Reynolds reacted in an extremely professional way last week.  Minister Ahern spent nine hours here on the Industrial Relations Bill.  Minister Brendan Daly did likewise.  We have received courtesy from many Ministers.  What we have got from this Minister is a total lack of courtesy and he is treating the House with contempt.</P>
      <P>Why is this such a bad Bill?  When we look at the birth of this Bill, we find it was born out of a long-festering anger and vindictiveness against RTE.  The Minister let his own mask slip on the night of the last general election when he very clearly blamed RTE for making, in his words, the health cuts a major issue in the election campaign and he told people in RTE that night that RTE would be screwed. The Minister has never denied that.  There are plenty of witnesses.  That was the real attitude of the Minister on this Bill.  So the birth of the Bill is out of vindictiveness. The timing of the birth was an opportunistic attempt to save Century Radio and to make sure that TV3 would have an easy entry.  If the only way that this could be done was by trimming the wings of RTE, then so be it, this was the way it would be done.  What a happy coincidence, if the saving of these companies could be brought about by teaching a bruising lesson to that public service institution which refuses and I hope will continue to refuse, to bow the knee to Fianna Fáil.  It was as crude, as simple, as opportunistic and as gross as all that.</P>
      <P>Worst of all, from the point of view of the Minister, it was a botched job.  It was botched from start to finish and it is this same botch, this Bill as it comes in today, this patchwork quilt of changes, son of botch, which we are being asked to rush through here today.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the progress of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> I said it was borne out of vindictiveness, a long, festering vindictiveness.  This Bill was not properly circulated to all members of the Cabinet.  It was not actually discussed fully in Cabinet.  That is admitted publicly by some of the Ministers who are on record as saying that they were not fully apprised of the details and the consequences of this Bill.  So, we have, first of all, a major measure coming in; the Minister attempts to get it through Cabinet on the nod without full consideration. Whatever else was happening he seemed to have succeeded and the Bill is published.</P>
    <P>What happens then?  The Progressive Democrats, I am sorry to say, immediately run for cover.  The Bill, we are told, is unacceptable, there is no way in which they could support it.  So, we have hurried consultations between the Taoiseach and Minister O'Malley, the Taoiseach in a helicopter, Minister O'Malley in his Mercedes and the Minister is suspended somewhere in between.  A few small changes are made out of this consultation. They are made against the wishes of Minister Burke and maybe the Minister was right, because they were merely cosmetic.  Perhaps he was right to resist these changes but they were made and suddenly we have, from the Government in exile, the Chairman of the Progressive Democrats, going public, telling the nation that now this is a Progressive Democrats Bill.  The Progressive Democrats he says have galloped to the rescue.  Once again, Fianna Fáil have been told to behave themselves, they will not get away with this sort of thing; this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated. So this new sanitised Bill, cleansed of Fianna Fáil imperfections, is the Progressive Democrat's blueprint for the future of Irish broadcasting.  Some blueprint and some neck.</P>
    <P>All the time this is happening, Fianna Fáil backbenchers in the Dáil were sounding off against the Progressive Democrats, saying it was not a Progressive Democrats Bill, the Progressive Democrats had too much influence and were angered most of all by the self-righteousness of the way they saw the Progressive <Col N="297" /> Democrats interfering with the Bill.  All the while the Minister was forced to grin and take it all on the chin.</P>
    <P>Side by side with all of this foreplay and footwork going on between the Coalition partners, we have the Minister's assault on 2FM.  This was quite an extraordinary attempt by the Minister, this attempt to destory in one fell swoop one of the major success stories of Irish public service broadcasting.  The question has to be asked whether the Minister thought he would get away with it.  In some ways his attempt was so audacious that I think he did think he would get away with it.  The thinking behind it, however, even if it was crude, was very perceptive.  By killing off 2FM &mdash; and that clearly was the intention &mdash; and big moneys would be freed to flow to the independent stations.  It was as simple as that.  At one stroke, the brainchild of the Minister, owned for the most part by friends of the Minister, the ailing independents would be liberated.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister is nothing if not bold on this issue.  Subtle he certainly is not because right in the middle of all of this he appeared as the celebrity spot to give the nation, or 10 per cent of it, experience of his taste in rock and roll, Buddy Holly and light and heavy music, on Century Radio, right in the middle of this controversy.  It certainly did not show any subtlety but then the Minister has never been subtle in hiding his favouritism for that station.</P>
    <P>That move failed.  It failed because it was spiked on a tide of public opinion and public revulsion.  The Minister, as has been his wont in this whole episode, was once again left floundering and backtracking and 2FM for the moment &mdash; and I say only for the moment &mdash; was saved from having to become a drudge and a drone station, which was what was intended, a station which could not attract advertising.  I am not saying for one moment that there should not be the type of public service broadcasting provided which the Minister had earmarked for 2FM, but it never was or never should be the mission of 2FM to fill that role.  So, the Minister was foiled in his attempt to destroy 2FM, to destroy <Col N="298" /> its revenue base and to siphon that money into the independent stations and TV3, who would be the main beneficiaries.  It was another major about turn, loss of face for the Minister.  It was a nice try, if you like, on the part of the Minister.  It certainly did not deserve to work and it did not work.</P>
    <P>Since then, we have had change after change in the Bill, all of them dictated by outside groups, all of them conceded with ill grace by the Minister and we end up today with the Bill before us which we got just before we came in here this morning, a Bill which is now a thing of shreds and patches but still sufficiently malevolent to cause lasting damage to Irish broadcasting for very many years to come.  Most of all, we have a Bill which is totally unnecessary.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we have before us today this patchwork of U-turns, this assault on the public interest, this vindictive measure which is as good as being on the Statute Book.  What we are going through in this House today is a total charade and a sham.  The Bill, as we have it here, is the Bill which will become law in a few weeks' time.  The Minister has the numbers, he is in a hurry, he has taken a pasting in the other House and outside it; he now feels he is as good as home and we are expected to play our part in that particular charade.</P>
    <P>Why do I say the Minister has no intention of accepting any amendment from the Seanad?  His own timetable makes that manifestly clear.  This Bill is due to come into effect in October.  The Dáil will rise tomorrow until mid-October.  So, if the Minister were to accept amendments from this House, the Dáil would have to be recalled.  We know, and everybody else knows, that the Minister has not the slightest intention of recalling the Dáil or letting that happen.  So, the Bill, as it now stands, is the Act which will find its way onto the Statute Book.  It is this Act, this charade, which will give this Minister a less than glorious and less than honoured place in Irish broadcasting history, not that that concerns the Minister overmuch.</P>
    <P>Why is this such a bad Bill?  The reasons <Col N="299" /> are clear and simple.  Let us first look at the events which have brought us to where we are today.  In 1987, this Minister brought a Bill to the Dáil in which he proposed that he, and he alone, would decide who the new broadcasters would be and that he would operate public control over them; there would be no independent radio commission.  That was, and still is, the real intention of this Minister. We all remember he brought this proposal to the Dáil.  Let us look at it again because it is worth reflecting on.  He would decide who the new broadcasters would be, he would operate public control over them; there would be no independent radio commission.  We all well remember the public reaction.  The Progressive Democrats, then in opposition, said this would be Radio Fianna Fáil. Then Deputy O'Malley from Dublin West played a very honourable part in attacking this proposal, in helping the other Opposition parties to see what was involved and in helping to mount public opinion against that particular proposal. That proposal was, as it deserved to be, roundly defeated.</P>
    <P>That crude attempt was successfully blocked because that Government were in a minority and had to respond to public opinion.  But, that whole episode showed us the mask, the mask had slipped.  The real intention behind Government broadcasting policy had been clearly revealed. Now, with the Progressive Democrats on board and with their support the Minister is on course once again.  It has not been an easy ride, but so what?  He is going to get there in the end, three years later, but at least he arrives at the destination.</P>
    <P>How did this happen?  How did this change come about within the Government parties?  The lame explanation from the Progressive Democrats is that they took their eye off the ball, that, hey presto, corners were cut when they were not looking.  Then we had the spectacle of Government backbenchers, breaking a long standing agreement and convention in the other House, being removed, to help collapse the debate.  I can assure the other House that there will <Col N="300" /> be no collapsing of debate here.  Then we had some of the same backbenchers popping up on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; to tell the expectant nation of their reservations about the Bill.  However, when it came to voting, these worries and reservations very quickly disappeared.</P>
    <P>Since then the Bill has gone through the other House in as bizarre, grotesque and unorthodox a way as has ever happened in the history of these two Houses of Parliament.  First of all, there was virtually no Second Stage.  The sleight of hand which brought that about is well documented.  Then we had a drastically truncated Committee Stage where the vast bulk of the amendments were guillotined through and those that were not went through with the absence of the entire Opposition parties.  We had the walk-out of the entire Opposition at that stage.  Then we had the surreal Report Stage of the past couple of days, which again equates to nothing which the Dáil had ever known before.  Finally, last night there was a final major cock-up at the end of the Report and Final Stages which &mdash; and it is not for me to comment on the officers of the other House &mdash; according to the Leader of the Labour Party this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; has certainly dented the confidence of Opposition Members of the other House in the impartiality of the Chair there.  That is a matter of public record.  That gives some indication of the way in which that particular Bill went through the other House.</P>
    <P>If anything should alert us to the need to stand back at this stage, it is the history of that past couple of weeks in the other House.  How can the public have any confidence in legislation which went through in that particular way, in legislation which attracted so much ill-will, bad feeling, distrust, in legislation which most of the public believe was designed for one purpose only, that is, to screw RTE and to help Minister's friends? How can the public have any confidence after that particular set of procedures and foul-ups in the other House?  It is the worst handled piece of legislation, I suspect, in the last 60 years in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> It is very clear that the main target of this Bill is RTE.  That has long been clear. This Minister may now regret his outburst after the last election when he made very clear his real feelings towards RTE and all that sail within it.  It was an outburst which confirmed, if that was necessary, his long-standing and long-known antipathy to RTE.  The new controls which the Minister is introducing for RTE are far worse than could have been anticipated by anybody in that station.  They mean that RTE will not be able to get one ounce of benefit from their success in getting 100 per cent audience they will not get one penny more into their budget. So much for fair competition.  The restrictions on the budget they will receive will put them in an impossible situation, worse than a return to the old Civil Service controls of Radio Éireann.  Not alone now will they have to go to the Minister for an extra penny to spend on broadcasting and programmes but they will also be locked in to an earmarked tax, a user charge, not based on ability to pay.  This new charge, and I am quite sure it is deliberate, is a recipe for the slow strangulation of RTE.  They will be locked into a budget which will be cut by over £12 million next year and frozen thereafter.  This will be the end of quality broadcasting.</P>
    <P>On that point, it is interesting to judge the Minister on the basis of his own promises in the other House.  He told the other House that he would give this country a broadcasting system which would have four main elements in it: it would meet public demand; it would be independent; it would have quality; and it would be diverse.  These are the elements of the broadcasting programme policy promised by the Minister: it would meet public demand, be independent, have quality and be diverse.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what he has produced. Regardless of public demand, he sought, first of all, to destroy 2FM and he still seeks to destroy 2FM.  So much for public demand.  As for independence, this legislation will bring RTE to heel by controlling its revenue or, rather, it will seek <Col N="302" /> to bring RTE to heel.  I hope there is enough independence and integrity in that organisation to resist the attempts but the clear intent is to destroy the independence of RTE.  As for quality, the Minister wants to destroy the revenue base of RTE from which they have made programmes of which the whole country could be proud.  Again, it is very clear as to what is going to happen.</P>
    <P>If RTE does not have a strong revenue base, the first things to suffer, apart from staff, any new staff and existing staff, will be quality programmes.  Quality programmes take money.  A national station like RTE must have the discretion and the resources to invest in quality programmes.  If it comes to a choice between bread and butter and keeping the show on the road and quality programmes, clearly quality is going to be the big sufferer.  As for diversity, the Minister has gone back on promises he made to develop community local broadcasting in tandem with commercial radio.  We have not heard a word about that since he made the promise.  The record of the Minister based on his own promises has to speak for itself.</P>
    <P>What can be said about the Minister and Cablelink?  That again is a sorry and scandalous story, a story of wrangles between Government Ministers, of one Minister contradicting another.  The Minister seemingly had no idea of the proper framework for public policy in the way in which he decided to sell off Cablelink. He allowed RTE to hold a competition, but when the results of that competition were in and RTE selected someone they considered would be successful the Minister decided to change the ground rules once again, a further levelling of this now infamous playing pitch, a chopping down of the goalposts or a taking away of the nets or the referee's whistle, or whatever. Then the Minister used crude, political intervention to block RTE's decision and to insist that it would go to his selected candidate.</P>
    <P>This arbitrary intervention of the Minister undermines confidence in the operation of a communication policy.  That has been the hallmark of this Minister <Col N="303" /> right from the beginning.  In the past this Minister made solemn declarations that he had no intention of diverting income from RTE.  We all remember that when Deputy Jim Mitchell, the Fine Gael spokesperson on Communications, raised this question a few months back, when he said he had information that the Minister intended to divert funding from RTE, he was roundly contradicted by the Minister.  He was accused of scare-mongering. He was told he was wrong and that the Minister had no such intentions. When he raised the matter in the Dáil he was ordered from the House because he was accused of accusing the Minister of not telling the full truth.  The Minister said there would be no intention of diverting income from RTE.</P>
    <P>These declarations have crumbled. The Minister brought in a Bill which would, in effect, take 25 per cent of its fee from RTE.</P>
    <P>So much for the Minister's solemn declarations on this matter.  What he is now giving to Irish broadcasting is the worst of all worlds in relation to broadcasting policy.  The commercial station which went into all of this with its eyes open got, after great and strenuous efforts on its part and with certainly no opposition from the Government, a franchise which in the words of the Minister was a scarce natural resource.  Now, because this has not worked out the way it might have, the Minister seeks to change the ground rules which he made with such fuss and fanfare just a short few years ago.  What he is saying &mdash; and it is ironic in view of the Progressive Democrats' stated position on not helping lame ducks in the public sector &mdash; is that the inefficient in the private sector must be supported and the efficient in the public sector will be robbed to support them.  Of all of the ironies of recent years, that surely must compete for a place among the top ten.</P>
    <P>The Minister's policy, in addition, represents a landmark in the attitude towards State companies.  Up to the early eighties it could be said with fairness that many of our State companies did not <Col N="304" /> perform.  They were seen as being inefficient, complacent and lacking initiative. Under Minister Jim Mitchell during the 1980s a concerted and successful effort was made to revolutionise the basis of operation of our State companies.  It always strikes me as odd that my party is often accused of being opposed to State companies when, in fact, it was the actions of Minister Jim Mitchell in the 1980s which made it possible for most of the State companies to survive, be viable and be strong.</P>
    <P>Under Minister Mitchell the State companies were given very definite criteria for performance.  Targets were set. Strong tough minded boards were put into place.  Young energetic management was recruited.  Inducements and sanctions were put in place to enable the public sector perform in a way which would justify its existence.  Most of these companies have responded, and responded dramatically well.  The ESB today is probably a model of its kind of any power utility in Europe.  The ESB is now exporting its expertise right around the world.  Aer Lingus responded positively. Aer Lingus went into profit and began a major programme of expansion to create hundreds of highly paid jobs as part of its response.  The success story of Aer Rianta is well known to us.</P>
    <P>Among all of these companies RTE's change, the metamorphosis of RTE, was one of the most dramatic.  RTE turned around, improved quality, improved domestic output, extended a whole range of new services, met competition head on, brought in a range of new, hungry, enthusiastic people and RTE consistently began to show a profit.  So what happens? Just as Aer Lingus had some of its profitable routes stripped from it to help the ailing Ryanair, so now RTE finds that its efforts are being rewarded by this savage assault on it from this Government.  The rules are changed to suit the friends of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. RTE, which has improved its efficiency, made good profits, reacted so well to the challenge and to the competition, is to be penalised for its success. What this means is that almost certainly <Col N="305" /> RTE will be back in a loss making situation within a year or two.  Then we will have the calls from the Progressive Democrats about the need not to cosset the State sector, about how the lazy State sector must be penalised and must learn to stand on its own two feet, as a result of a policy of which the Progressive Democrats are joint authors which has brought this about.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I must now spend a moment or two looking at the role of the Progressive Democrats in this entire sorry debate.  If the Progressive Democrats ever held the high moral ground in Irish politics &mdash; and I would seriously dispute that proposition &mdash; they have certainly forfeited it on this issue.  The Progressive Democrats, on the evidence of this Bill, are back where they started, back as part of the great Fianna Fáil family.  The Mercs and the perks are more important now to the Progressive Democrats than this issue.  The need, above all, is not to rock the boat.  We can make shaping noises on Articles 2 and 3 on divorce; but when it comes to a real issue, where real votes are involved, then there is silence.</P>
    <P>We have already had the spectacle of the Chairman of the Progressive Democrats claiming credit for their Bill and claiming that the new sanitised Bill was a direct result of their intervention.  It is important to say that this Bill is a joint Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Bill, a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Bill.  It is a Bill for which both parties must accept their full share of responsibility. The Progressive Democrats remind me at times of some Catholics at the end of the Second Vatican Council when there became known a group called the <i>a la carte</i> Catholics, people who would pick one doctrine to follow but not pick another and so make up a sort of melange of doctrines, as people would pick a meal <i>a la carte</i> in a restaurant.  The Progressive Democrats will have to learn that they cannot be <i>a la carte</i> members of this Government, picking a tasty morsel here, rejecting the tough or unpalatable bit somewhere else, saying &ldquo;We'll have the pate; we will not have rice&rdquo;.  They cannot <Col N="306" /> do that.  This is a fixed menu Government. The Progressive Democrats must accept this or lose what little remains of their credibility.</P>
    <P>That reality has taken some time to dawn on that party.  I and, I am sure, many other Members of this House over the past weeks have had accounts of the approaches by people in RTE to members of the Progressive Democrats. The reaction in all cases is more or less the same.  It goes something like &ldquo;Yes, we do feel very uncomfortable about this legislation.  Yes, indeed we share your reservations, we do not like it.  You all know what Minister Ray Burke is like. He is difficult, he is not really one of ours. Yes, we did take our eye off the ball.  All the pressures of Europe... only two Ministers in the Cabinet, they were away ... yes, if we had been there it might well have been different.  We have tried to salvage the Bill.  Yes, we will make a strong case in Government.  You can depend on us, and we will come back to you.&rdquo;  That was roughly the scenario with person after person who approached members of the Progressive Democrats. And we get a deafening silence &mdash; the unreturned phone calls, the washing of hands.  Indeed, there is so much washing of hands that one could welcome back Pontius Pilate here today.  There is a party waiting for him.  He would feel very much at home were he to come back here today.</P>
    <P>There is one very serious aspect of this legislation in which the Government is showing real consistency and that is the impact of this legislation on jobs.  Last month the unemployment figures in this country rose by 7,000.  There was no explanation.  The Government claim to be taken by surprise.  It was the worst piece of news in the past number of years. There was no indication as to why it happened, but it was one of the most dangerous signals to go across the Government's bows for a very long time.  This legislation will simply accelerate that tendency.  The dole queues will grow longer and longer. Hundreds of people will lose their jobs in RTE.  Young people, highly qualified graduates and school leavers who might <Col N="307" /> have been employed over the coming years, will now have to go elsewhere out of this country if they want to pursue a job in journalism and communications. That is the net effect of this legislation. Will these jobs be replaced in the private sector?  There is no way in which that will happen.  Most of the successful new stations are the ones which employ least people, the ones which follow the 98 FM formula.  The ones which are least labour intensive are, on the basis of what has happened so far, the ones that are most likely to succeed.  That lesson has not been lost on the other stations.  It is not an accident or coincidence that the labour intensive Radio South is now dropping many of its chat and current affairs shows.  It is redrawing its schedule and operations on the format of 98FM.  That is the pattern.  Very many bright young people, who would have fitted into the plans of RTE under RTEs present financial structure will now find that they will not be able to get rewarding, creative jobs in the Irish communications industry because of this legislation.</P>
    <P>That is one of the real tragedies of this Bill.  The jobs lost in RTE will not be replaced in the private sector.  All of the evidence so far is that that is the pattern. Indeed, in the case of Century one of its problems stem from the fact that it tries to be a quality station.  In terms of its news coverage it has consistently tried to maintain the right levels of staffing to ensure a fair and quality news service. But that costs money.  That lesson will not be lost on the others who will revert to the successful formula of 98FM which is not labour intensive.</P>
    <P>Central to all of this, of course, is the position of RTE.  Like any&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think the House is due an explanation if we are not going to have the <Col N="308" /> attention of the Minister today.

      <P>I would like to turn to one of the central aspects of this legislation and that is the position of RTE. Like any big, old institution, RTE is around now for over 60 years, from the days of 2RN to Radio Éireann to Radio Telefís Éireann.  It has had its good days and its bad days.  Certainly, RTE is open to criticism on many fronts.  It certainly has had its lazy, complacent years.  It has had its bouts of self importance and arrogance and its self obsession.  It has had to fight hard to shake off its Civil Service legacy; but, having said that, RTE is a quality organisation and it compares more than well with any radio-television service in the world.</P>

Its coverage of the recent World Cup events is only one immediate example of the flexibility of its response. It indicated quality, enthusiasm and expertise in great depth.  Its election coverage over recent years has been of an extraordinarily high quality.  Its ability to rise to the coverage of major national events, from the arrival of the Pope to the arrival of the soccer team two weeks ago, and its ability to include the entire nation as one family on occasions like that has to be one of the most extraordinary contributions of RTE to the development of Irish national life.  More than any other organisation it has created a sense of a great national family.  It has allowed us all to get to know each other.  It has allowed the people to get to know the politicians and the public figures in a way that was never possible before in this country.  Through much of its documentary, investigative programming &mdash; and even its discussions &mdash; it has allowed us as a people to get to know ourselves and our society better than we ever did in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the various television-radio series over the past number of years have been truly outstanding and have made a lasting impact and contribution to scholarship and entertainment and as to how we see ourselves as a people.  It has had its defects, of course.  I was very critical before Christmas of its coverage of Eastern European affairs.  Not because of my criticims, but it certainly has responded very well to give full coverage of events in Eastern Europe.  In the past some of its programming may have smacked of a certain elitism.  There may have been infiltration by people who were politically motivated.  RTE, within itself, has sufficient vigilance to ensure that a fair balance is kept.  This is another point.  RTE have annoyed every Government in recent years.  Sometimes RTE were right; sometimes RTE were wrong.  But that sort of tension is right and proper between Government and the media. There should not be, and there cannot <Col N="310" /> be, that sort of cosy relationship between RTE and the Government parties which the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fail seem to want so badly.  When Government press secretaries phoned to complain about what was said on different programmes they should be listened to courteously, but no more than that.  There should be no question of Governments being deferred to, kowtowed to or of RTE being intimidated by the press secretaries of any Government.</P>
    <P>It is important that one net effect of this legislation is that members of RTE must not feel intimidated.  It is quite clear that many of them do.  They feel that this is the beginning of a sustained assault on the independence of RTE.  They know that if the Government could have got away with more it would have got away with more.  The Government has had to pull back, partly because of the trade unions and partly because of public opinion.  The real face of the Government's intentions was announced by the Minister on the first day of the Fine Gael motion in the other House.</P>
    <P>Politicians may well have legitimate grievances against RTE.  There is a need for greater, speedier and more open accountability.  Complaints made against specific programmes should be handled openly.  They should be made openly and answered openly.  At present many months may elapse before an unsatisfactory answer is given.  RTE has stored up some trouble for itself on that particular front.</P>
    <P>Like any other politician I feel there is something untoward about some of the over-mighty DJs who grace the airwaves in the morning.  The frequent snide, facile, unfair observations from the morning pulpits can often cause great anger, not so much about what is said but because people feel &mdash; and it is important that we say this &mdash; they will not get a fair roll of the dice and that they will not get a chance to have their own point of view put properly from some of these overmighty practitioners on the morning programmes. This creates frustration among politicians.  It creates a sense that fair play should apply both ways &mdash; there should <Col N="311" /> be fair play to politicians and public figures just as there should be fair play from this House to the media generally.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that some of the people who are most prone to indulge in this sort of activity are themselves public figures who can be very touchy and tetchy should any public questions be asked about their own finances, their own views or their own affairs.  RTE does need, not to censor but at least to be somewhat more sensitive on the question of fair play.  There is nothing more frustrating than to have a general comment made from somebody who is in a position of great power knowing that there is no way in which that can be answered fairly and that the dice are in the hands of the person in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also blame RTE for its extraordinary poor public relations over the years.  RTE has made very little attempt in a meaningful way to put its own case to politicians of all and any party over the past number of years.  It has made no real attempt to listen to what public figures of all parties are saying about the role and the mission of RTE in Irish life.  I am certain, had the proper sort of two-way communication been in place &mdash; the fault here is RTE's, first middle and last &mdash; that some of the misunderstandings which find their way into the present Bill probably would never have arisen.  I hope that the appointment of a very distinguished person who formally worked in this House for one of the political parties will go some way towards rectifying the failure of RTE over the years to talk to and to listen to public representatives in a calm, reasoned way, out of the glare of publicity, so that at least people know what they are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, RTE is a station which is one of the great jewels in our national crown.  Any attack on RTE is an attack on all of us.  Let us look at the <Col N="312" /> impact of what is happening on RTE. If we go back to the Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley review of RTE, which was carried out in 1985 at a time of low levels of profitability in RTE, it is fair to say that the management and staff after that report accepted the need for change and have very considerably strengthened the organisation in the intervening years. RTE has become financially stable and has increased the amount of programming substantially in that period. Home produced television programming is now in excess of 2,500 hours per year, up over 50 per cent on the levels for 1985. All of this has been achieved without any increase in the licence fee.  Employment in a wide variety of cultures and skills, both inside and outside the organisation, has been generated from this increased activity.  It must be said that RTE responded positively to the challenge, a challenge set by the present Taoiseach at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis in 1989.  The Taoiseach, speaking of the State sector said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Their future depends entirely on their ability to perform efficiently and, where appropriate, profitably.  The test for survival will be competent performance. For those who meet it, the future can be bright and rewarding.</P>
    <P>Most fair people would feel that RTE have measured up well to this test and would feel fairly badly betrayed by the Bill.</P>
    <P>RTE has been successful in the competitive marketplace, as evidenced by its high radio and television ratings.  Is RTE now about to be penalised because it has successfully met the guidelines set by the Taoiseach?  The proposed capping of RTE's commercial revenue robs RTE of its new marketing dynamic.  It will weaken the organisation as a major provider of popular and cultural programming for the Irish nation.  The estimated loss of advertising revenue of at least £12 million per annum will mean the shedding of up to 500 jobs in RTE. Such a revenue loss will also lead to a reduction in the quality and quantity of home produced programming, with a <Col N="313" /> lower quality of programming and a more fragmented audience.  All the evidence suggests that broadcasters from outside the State will benefit.  This is a serious issue for this country which has not been addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The cutback in RTE revenue could have a further negative effect on the independent audio visual sector, which has attracted increasing support from RTE in recent years.  Both the Association of Advertisers in Ireland, the AAI and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland, IAPI, have expressed extreme concern about the effects of the proposed legislation on job losses in the Irish advertising industry and the diversion of advertising resources to British based broadcasters.</P>
    <P>All of these negative effects run directly counter to the Minister's broadcasting objectives as stated in the course of the Dáil debate on 7 June last.  These were: to ensure that Irish broadcasting becomes a growth industry in line with the growth of broadcasting seen in all other European countries; to ensure that Irish broadcasting remains the mainstream Irish viewers' and listeners' choice; to create new, secure employment in the sector; to provide a seed bed for the growth of an independent audiovisual industrial business in the country. These were the objectives of the Minister. In almost every single one of them, what he is now proposing runs counter to what he there set out as an objective.</P>
    <P>They are some of the effects on RTE. As I mentioned a moment ago, virtually all the major, independent bodies have had a great deal to say about the effects of the legislation generally.  The Marketing Society of Ireland, in a memorandum submitted to all Members of this and the other House, has set out its objectives, which I will briefly run over:</P>
    <P>The Marketing Society, which incorporates the former Market Research Society of Ireland, is recognised as the final authority on matters concerning marketing and market research in Ireland.  The society devised the official guidelines for radio research and has <Col N="314" /> been called to arbitrate on many key marketing issues over the years. Because of its practical involvement in broadcasting and advertising research the society is well placed to evaluate the likely outcome of certain key elements in the proposed Broadcasting Bill.</P>
    <P>While the Society agrees wholeheartedly with the objectives as stated in the Minister's speech in the Dáil on 7 June, some of the aims intended to serve these objectives seem, in our professional opinion, unlikely to achieve their intentions.</P>
    <P>Firstly, the effectiveness of the Minister's intended orders, in particular, the &ldquo;capping&rdquo; of RTE advertising levels, may well lead to quite a different outcome than that intended by his objectives.  It is important that the mechanics of marketing and advertising practice should be clearly understood before assessing its impact.  It is quite a complex business but the essential facts would appear to be: (1) if the amount of advertising on RTE is limited, there are two immediate effects;</P>
    <P>(a) the cost of advertising rises, as RTE must ensure that it sells all of its time to maximise its permitted revenue;</P>
    <P>(b) advertisers who cannot obtain time on RTE will look to other relevant media instead.</P>
    <P>(2) Any price rise will tend to squeeze the smaller advertiser out of the market in favour of the big budget international marketing company; this can have a detrimental effect on the growing sector of new, small Irish companies: this would appear to be contrary to the Minister's stated objectives.</P>
    <P>(3)  An advertiser who cannot obtain time on RTE but has the funds to advertise, is much more likely to seek an alternative broadcast medium.  The largest share of this is for television and an advertiser who has a TV commercial available (often produced outside this country and therefore bearing no direct <Col N="315" /> cost to the Irish marketing company) will select the next best TV alternative.</P>
    <P>The only serious alternative is UTV. Two out of three sets in the Republic can receive UTV programmes and this rises to 85 per cent in Dublin.  The likely effect of &ldquo;capping&rdquo; therefore is to drive money out of the economy and into Northern Ireland.  There is no guarantee that it will recirculate among the other Irish media.</P>
    <P>(4)  The availability of TV3 still appears to be at least a year away; after that TV3 will have to build a reputation for its programmes and prove that it has a large enough viewership to justify advertisers spending money with the station.  This could take many years to develop, in the meantime UTV will have benefited from the &ldquo;capping&rdquo; and will fight hard to maintain the opportunity handed to it.</P>
    <P>(5) The reduction in RTE earnings and the shift of advertising money from the State to Northern Ireland will have serious consequences for employment in RTE, marketing companies, market research organisations and advertising agencies.  This would seem to be in direct contravention to the Minister's objectives.</P>
    <P>The society would like to draw attention to the EC Directive on TV Advertising which recommends an average of nine minutes per hour for TV advertising, with a maximum of 12 minutes in any one hour.  This is significantly higher than the limits the Minister seeks to impose.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill does seem to present an open gate to a Minister to introduce orders limiting the freedom of broadcasters to operate.  The <i>Irish Law Times</i> has already devoted its most recent editorial to outlining why it thinks this action may be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>That is the view of the independent society, a nominating body for the Industrial and Commercial Panel of this House.  The members of the marketing society who are second to none in expertise and who come from all parties see <Col N="316" /> enormous dangers in this Bill which is being rushed through here today.  They have put their views on paper to all Members of the House.  The Minister has not even referred to any of these matters.</P>
    <P>The Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland, a non-political body, make their point about the consequences of this Bill.  They say as did the Marketing Society, that jobs will be lost.</P>
    <P>Job losses are the inevitable consequence of this legislation.  RTE, film production companies making programme material or commercials, film facility and support service companies, scriptwriters, technicians, actors, musicians and other suppliers to the film, video and sound industry will all face job losses or reduced opportunities.</P>
    <P>There is also a real prospect of job losses in other manufacturing or distribution firms, many of them Irish companies, whose marketing efforts will be hindered by not being able to afford, or to get, advertising time on RTE TV and Radio in the absence of an Irish based national TV or proven national radio alternative.</P>
    <P>Nor is there any indication that the independent stations will be able to absorb many, or any, of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I make the point I made earlier this morning, that there is no evidence that the independent stations are interested in employing people.  The ones which are most successful are those which are least labour intensive.</P>
    <P>According to the Institute of Advertising Practitioners the intended diversion of advertising revenue is unlikely.  I will not dwell on that point.  They argue that costs will certainly rise as a result of all of this.  These are serious concerns which come from the Association of Advertising Practitioners.  There is also a submission from the Association of Advertisers in Ireland which I will not put on the record as all Members have received it but I will read the last sentence <Col N="317" /> in the letter we all received; &ldquo;our association hopes that good sense will ultimately prevail on this issue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We saw this morning, and we have seen over the past few days, that there is no question of good sense prevailing.  Judging by the timetable the Minister has set for this Bill and by the way he has brought it into the House today, clearly he is not listening to any of these outside groups who have a reasonable point of view to make, nor is he listening to what SIPTU is saying in all of this.</P>
    <P>What is the motivation of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats?  From all we have seen so far we must come to the conclusion, however much they have attempted to mask it that this is an attempt to protect powerful friends and to get at RTE.  The issue addressed by this Bill is important but it is not urgent. The only urgency which attached to the initial attempts was the immediate difficulties of Century Radio.  If it was considered that Century Radio should be helped and that some of the factors which attended its birth might have been addressed, there was a very simple way to do it.  The Government should have brought in a rescue operation which would provide money, if that is what was intended, a short-term loan or whatever to rescue Century Radio &mdash; although I cannot see why a private sector organisation like that could not get whatever funding it needed from the private sector. However, if there was an imperative need to rescue Century Radio, it could have been done in a simple way and the Minister might very well have got plenty of support for that.  That was not the case and now we are landed in this mess which has been going on now for the past number of weeks.</P>
    <P>I have said all I need to say on this Bill. I have indicated why I think it is a bad Bill.  The Minister was very foolish not to take on board the suggestion of my colleague in the other House, Deputy Jim Mitchell, that there was need for a commission which would sit for a short fixed time to look at some of the major questions raised on broadcasting policy <Col N="318" /> at present.  This commission would have reported back and there might well have been a wider measure of agreement as to what needs to be done to chart the future of Irish broadcasting.  Instead we got this patchwork Bill which was born out of vindictiveness towards RTE and which is an attack on the whole concept of a profitable public sector which is against the interests of sound broadcasting policy.  It is a Bill which creates a web of suspicion about the motives of the Minister and the Government.  Even if the Minister's motives were as pure as the driven snow, there are very few people outside who would believe that is the case in the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is the worst legislation which has come before either House in the last ten years.  The fact that it is being rushed through by the Minister would seem to indicate very clearly that he wants to get it out of the way before any more awkward or embarrassing questions can be asked.  Why is the Minister not listening to the legal doubts which have been expressed about the constitutionality of the Bill?  Will we go through a process of the Bill being challenged in the Supreme Court and the Minister having to come back to both Houses with amending legislation because the Bill has been struck down as being unconstitutional?  I do not know.</P>
    <P>It is a sad day.  The way this legislation was handled in the other House has brought that House of the Oireachtas into disrepute.  The way the Government party are rushing it through this House, with no time for reflection, is bringing the Government party, not the House, into disrepute.  It is undermining one of the main functions of this House.  Clearly, the Minister has no intention of accepting any amendments.  His own timetable makes that perfectly clear.  He has no intention of accepting the offer we made which was to finish Second Stage now and come back in September to look at Committee Stage and see if it still is in the best interests of Irish broadcasting. Consequently, we have no option but to oppose the Bill in every way possible and to fight every last word and line of it to <Col N="319" /> ensure that when it goes on the Statute Book, it will do so only after the strongest of resistance has been shown to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>After that very fine contribution by Senator Manning, I want to make a few points in relation to the Bill. It is only right that we should put on record that this Minister, in his term as Minister for Communications, has regularised the airwaves.  Chaos had been allowed to reign through the early and mid-eighties in the broadcasting area with up to 70 unlicensed stations operating. The Coalition Government of 1982-87 were incapable of dealing with this issue.  They could not get agreement. &ldquo;Lack of political will,&rdquo; would be the proper way to describe it.  From that point of view, our Minister is to be congratulated.</P>
      <P>The Minister brought in the Radio and Television Act, 1988 and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988 which restored order to the airwaves and created a framework for the development of independent broadcasting stations. At that time we all envisaged, and people close to the industry knew, that this was the start of legislation that would be coming before the Houses of the Oireachtas over the next number of years.  I do not think this Bill is the last one we will see in relation to broadcasting. I expect we will have another Bill, or maybe two, within the next number of years in relation to a levelling of the playing field in the marketplace. That is what it is all about as far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that it is welcome by the newspaper industry.  The editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning supports the Bill, the central thrust of which is the restriction of the level of advertising carried by RTE so as to provide the other sections of the broadcasting and print media in the private sector with a fair competitive position in the advertising market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that it is a small island market in relation to advertising.  It is very restrictive and it is extremely vulnerable when we have so many sectors of <Col N="320" /> the communications world looking for a share of it.  I said in my Second Stage speech in 1988 that there were many areas which needed to be looked at in relation to the viability of local radio. At that time, we knew everyone in the country was looking for a local radio station. The research that I carried out in Australia, America and the UK, showed that it would not be viable.  We have seen the operation of local radio in most areas over the last 18 months.  Unfortunately, Westmeath, the county I come from and in which I reside in still has not got its own local radio station.  I look forward to it when it comes onstream with Laois and Offaly.  Most parts of the country have that luxury at present and are enjoying that facility.</P>
    <P>One million listeners at some stage every day tune in to local radio and that represents 40 per cent of the possible listening market.  That is very encouraging. I am gladly surprised that percentage has been attained in such a short space of time.  If we supply what the people want to listen to or want to view, the market will increase and, as a result, the market share of advertising will increase.</P>
    <P>It must be said in all honesty that the Minister has brought a lot of order to the airwaves and for that alone he has to be commended.  That cannot be said often enough because people in very privileged positions have used and abused their positions for various reasons.  Senator Manning covered that very fairly indeed in his eloquent contribution.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning made the point that the Minister went on Century Radio and presented his choice of music at a very sensitive time.  Senator Manning should have gone on to say that his party leader also went on radio and gave his choice of music.  That is just to set the record straight.  I did not have the pleasure of listening to Senator Manning's leader on the air but I did have the pleasure of listening to the Minister's choice of music.  I was glad to see that it had a 40 per cent Irish content.  He supports the local Irish content from an Irish artiste's point of view.  It is Irish artistes's point of <Col N="321" /> view that I watch and I have a special interest in protecting that industry.  They can be tremendous ambassadors for Ireland and have proved to be.  Over the last number of years, we have had tremendous successes.</P>
    <P>2FM has been mentioned and it was suggested that the Bill was brought in especially to snooker 2FM.  2FM have had tremendous success.  We are very proud of them and the great success they have had.  Senator Manning mentioned the word entertainment once.  At the end of the day it is the entertainment value that matters.  No-one can tell any listener, or group of listeners, to listen to a particular station all day every day, every week of every year, because it is not the way it works.  Good programming will survive and will be successful.  If a station do not give the people what they want, at the end of the day they will not be successful.  It is from that point of view that Century Radio have a major problem. The exeprtise is available in Century Radio.  They are listening to too many yuppie market people in relation to what they should be supplying to the market.  It is an excellent opportunity for alternative radio and I look forward to them changing their policy in relation to the market they are trying to supply, the one which has the biggest growth potential.</P>
    <P>I must commend RTE for the unwritten rule they have of playing 25 per cent Irish music continually.  Both Radio 1 and 2FM have continuously supported the music industry down the years.  It may not be the sort of music that I like to hear but at least they are supporting an industry in which jobs are being created on a daily basis.  From that point of view, 2FM have to be commended along with Radio 1.  I cannot say the same for Century Radio and I displayed my displeasure to one of their directors.  I look forward to the day that they too will carry their share of responsibility.  They were given the jewel of the airwaves, the shop window where people can display their wares and, most important, they could create employment.</P>
    <P>Local radio have a listenership of 40 per cent every day.  That is a fantastic <Col N="322" /> achievement.  No doubt this Bill will be regulated in some future legislation and amendments will be brought in to change the playing field.  It must be said that not in their wildest dreams did anyone in 1988 think that in 1990 we would be talking about a 40 per cent listenership.  It is a tremendous success especially when all counties have not been awarded the local radio franchise.  We can look forward to the day in the not too distant future when 50 per cent of listeners will tune into local radio.  It also shows that this is the type of programming the people in some areas like Mayo and Clare really want.  While RTE have been a tremendous success story down the years, I do not think they even touched 70 per cent of the market.</P>
    <P>I cited Mayo and Clare because those areas present the ideal format for rural listeners.  I always had a gut feeling about what the people wanted from the experience I gained over the years, and I could not understand some of the programming which was beamed from RTE with less than 2 per cent listenership for evening audiences.  If anyone was running a business or a sweet shop on the corner &mdash; to coin the phrase of a senior Minister &mdash; in that way they would not survive very long.  If commercial radio has a 40 per cent and growing listenership, it shows the enormous market that is available but which has not been tapped by any of the three national radio stations.</P>
    <P>As we all know, RTE supply 37 per cent home produced programmes; they do that because they are popular.  The longest running programmes on television are home produced and the longest running radio programme is a home produced programme on local Irish music.  I hope the independent film industry, which is just starting to mushroom, will be looked at over the next number of years.  What the Australian film industry, particularly the television film industry, over the last number of years has done for Australia in terms of creating jobs and promoting tourism generally, has been unbelievable.</P>
    <P>We buy 40 per cent of our shows from Australia, while as we all know, America <Col N="323" /> controls over 80 per cent of the film industry. From that point of view, I would be more than sympathetic to the section relating to the independent film industry. It is a tremendous area for job creation. RTE now give £3 million a year to independent film producers and companies for 3 per cent of their market.  It is not a small amount, 3 per cent of 37 per cent of their broadcasting in relation to the home produced product.  There is a tremendous opportunity for growth and job creation in this area but the greatest opportunity is for tourism.</P>
    <P>The beauty of the scenery and the fantastic opportunities that exist here should be highlighted in home produced films and shows.  This must be one of our priorities when we come to future planning for tourism.  &ldquo;Hawaii Five-O&rdquo; was started purely to promote that part of the world.  Within three years of the TV series &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; being shown on television, tourism in Dallas doubled, and within the three year period of &ldquo;Hawaii Five-O&rdquo; being shown, tourism there increased eight-fold times.</P>
    <P>The world of the film industry, which meets in Cannes and Los Angeles every year at different times, is a very small one.  A couple of hundred people control what is shown on television.  That is one area where so much growth can be generated that we will have to keep a constant eye on it.</P>
    <P>A big problem for many new radio stations is the requirement to have a 20 per cent current affairs and news content. The length of time is not the problem.  It is the enormous costs involved supplying news and current affairs programmes, and it is from that point of view that Century have a problem.  In the long term, every other radio station will have a problem.  At some time in the future, under the IRTC, we should look at the possibility of starting alternative news and current affairs medium which would be paid for by everyone who would be obliged to take it including RTE.  The stations would pay their fair share based on the TAM ratings.  The supply of an <Col N="324" /> alternative new system for news and current affairs will be a major problem.</P>
    <P>We all know that alternatives are very healthy and from that point of view the suggestion might be considered at some future stage in future legislation.  I have visited a fair number of the local radio stations around Ireland and they all have a very high standard.  The buildings they are in are a credit to most of them.  They regard it as a very serious business.  Many of these people have expertise in the world of commerce and they are looking at it purely from a business point of view. If they have shortcomings it is that they lack expertise in the market they are supplying in relation to programming but that will work itself out over a number of months rather than of years.</P>
    <P>I met many of the directors of these companies and told them that the road they were on would not be successful. Months later they said I was right and that they should have gone for the adult market.  What is the point of supplying pop music to young people who are in school?  It baffles me at times to see what these so called yuppies are doing.  I cannot understand it.  They will know it but they will have paid a high price by that time.</P>
    <P>When you get a licence to start promoting it is very easy.  It is something new, beautiful, something exciting is happening. But when something fails and one has to go out and re-market it, it requires three times the effort, it is three times more costly and it is a hell of a difficult job.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator Manning's tremendous contribution, but the one thing I do not agree with him on is the Government's record from 1987 in relation to jobs.  It has to be commended in my book.  We have had bad figures for the last month &mdash; he picked that out in isolation.  There are more people employed now than in any time in the last ten years.  That should be put on the record of the House.  This Government have a tremendous record in relation to attempting to create jobs.  In 1987 I asked the then Minister for Finance, Deputy <Col N="325" /> John Bruton, why was it that at that time Fine Gael and the Labour Party had a disastrous record in regard to the construction industry.  The great efforts of the Fianna Fáil Party since they took over Government in 1987, and in coalition since 1989, and the commitment that is being made by them to job creation is tremendous.  Most reasonable people acknowledge and respect that.  That has been one of the strong planks of Fianna Fáil down through the years.</P>
    <P>There is one section of the Bill which disturbs me and I would like clarification on it.  That is in relation to &ldquo;promos&rdquo; on RTE.  Years ago one went to the cinemas and saw a trailer on the screen of what was coming next week.  That was the big way to promote future attractions.  I want it clarified that trailers, and the promotion of programmes, will not be regarded as advertising. If one cannot advertise what is coming up it is very unfair, because one must look at competitors.  RTE's competitors are UTV.  Two out of every three homes in Ireland now receive UTV. Therefore, they are our immediate competitors. Then we have BBC 1 and BBC 2. We have Sky and Super for people who are fortunate enough to get it.  We must look at the opposition, because if the £12 million which we are told RTE will lose will benefit people outside the country then it is not going to be a success.  So, we must be given an even opportunity. Everyone knows that current events and special programmes such as the World Cup team homecoming must be &ldquo;promoted&rdquo; a half on hour before the event. RTE were advising during every break that they were suspending programmes for the evening because of the great event.  That is a reasonable request.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, advertising the <i>RTE Guide</i> on television is an advertisement in my book.  Advertising the <i>RTE Guide,</i> advertising concerts or advertising the sales of records or videos is legitimate advertising.  &ldquo;Promo&rdquo; on television in relation to what is coming up and being run by RTE is definitely not advertising.  I want that clarified, but it has not been clarified so far to my satisfaction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> RTE have provided a great public broadcasting service over the last 64 years.  We all can remember the advent of the first radio.  I can remember our first radio in 1956.  The first news on the morning we got the radio was of Ronnie Delaney winning a gold medal for Ireland.  That was the first good news I heard coming over the airwaves in broadcasting. The Pope's visit was magnificently shown on our screens and it was acclaimed by stations all over the world. We had the World Cup and RTE were able to capture the imagination and relay it throughout Ireland practically unannounced, because it happended hourly and momentum increased hourly.  Tremendous coverage is given by RTE to the Gaelic Athletic Association, and they must be complimented on that.  They have increased the popularity of the game no end and they have brought it into homes every Sunday and Sunday night from every corner of the country.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that RTE have risen to the occasion, can rise to the occasion and are a terrific service in general.  But monopolies of any kind are an unhealthy thing and should be dealt with by us in the Legislature.  The politicians and the parliamentarians run this country; no one else runs this country.  Every reasonable decent citizen of this island would agree that it is their democratic right to elect people like us to make decisions in their interest.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that a lot of opinions were foisted on people in the last two or three months when this legislation was being introduced.  At the end of a very fair and good television show one evening, a very favourite broadcaster of mine came on the screen and said: &ldquo;was that not a tremendous game, but remember it was public service broadcasting that brought it to you&rdquo;.  That was why he got the job in the first place &mdash; in order to be a good public service broadcaster.  These unreasonable remarks are probably the cause of some of the frustration generated from time to time among us politicians in our views and attitudes to RTE.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that RTE have failed in public relations between both Houses <Col N="327" /> of the Oireachtas and their establishment. Last week we had a meeting with various trades unions in RTE.  I must say that it was the first such meeting I have had in my eight years as a Member of this House.  It was a refreshing experience, I hope we continue it on an ongoing basis and make a lot of progress. But, trying to generate heat and throwing in the old carrot that jobs must go first, and putting pressure on the politicians is a very unfair way of doing it and a very unhealthy way from their point of view. There is the old saying &ldquo;There is never a wrong time to do the right thing&rdquo;.  I do not think any politician ever came into Leinster House in my time but was always trying to do the right thing for the people at the right time.  I appeal to RTE, and to other broadcasting stations such as Century Radio and so on, to improve their PR with the Members of the Oireachtas, because legislation comes from here and nowhere else.  They would need to bear that in mind in the future.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the white elephant that exists in RTE at the moment called Atlantic 252.  In the first place this idea sounded reasonable, but it has not been a success.  It has been so badly received by the enormous market available, in the UK in particular, that I think they should have a look at the situation.  From the point of view of supplying a market which is starved &mdash; in the UK, in particular &mdash; they could possibly have the biggest success of 1991 if they go about it in a way that market research has now shown is available.  There is a massive market in the UK among the adult listening audience for music of all types.  In England the authorities there have come to the conclusion that they are going to consider supplying this market.  We could get in ahead of them.  Since this channel goes over most of Europe, such a service would be a tremendous ambassador for the country as well as generating a lot of revenue for Atlantic 252.  I would appeal to them to have another look at the situation, because I doubt if .25 per cent of listeners in Ireland are listening to it. That is how removed they are from the <Col N="328" /> possible listening public.  That is an area where great progress can be made.  It is also an area they can capture in advance of anyone else, because once a channel is established and people are happy with what they are hearing they will stick with it.</P>
    <P>There are many more points I want to make which I hope to take up on Committee Stage, but I know there is a large number of speakers wishing to come in on the various Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that the Minister had increased from four and a half minutes to five minutes the advertising time on RTE.  We all know the amount of advertising shown on other TV channels.  There is nothing as frustrating or as annoying, just when you are coming to a highlight in a programme, than to have the ads come up once more.  Too many ads can kill the popularity of a channel; not enough ads can leave a channel starved for funds.  Five minutes is a reasonable amount of time.  RTE would be happier with six minutes, and why not?  But the one thing to bear in mind, that RTE and all other stations should bear in mind, is that legislation can be updated from time to time.  I would like to think that, if this legislation is not successful, if there are parts of it that have to be amended, the Minister will be coming back after two years to amend the legislation in an effort to improve it and to create a fair distribution of the wealth within the advertising market.</P>
    <P>The paper media are very happy that this legislation is going through.  Naturally, the people who are being hit by it are not happy.  If this £12 million is going out of the country, if UTV or Sky or Super start capturing a part of the market, I think that we as legislators have to come back in here and look at the situation again.</P>
    <P>The market share should be kept in this country if at all possible.  I know that the market share is going to grow and grow as these local radio stations settle down and that, if a station in a certain part of the country is not a financial proposition, it will join up with a sister station, as has happened already.  That is going <Col N="329" /> to be the trend.  Eventually, we will see possibly ten stations around the country along with two or three national channels.</P>
    <P>However, it will come down to the programming.  At the end of the day whoever has the programming will capture the listeners and whoever has not the programming will be doomed.  That is a good and healthy thing because at the end of the day it is the people who will decide who will have the success and who will have the failures.  I will contribute further on the Committee Stage, so I will conclude now.</P>

      <P>I was a bit amused by a couple of Senator Cassidy's comments. If the legislation is not successful&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of it, I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of what Fianna Fáil are trying to do, successful means closing down RTE.  Presumably, if this does not succeed in closing down RTE, they will bring in legislation to do that next time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only people in this country who do not believe that the objective of this legislation is to crucify RTE are those people in Fianna Fáil who have kept their eyes closed and their ears firmly shut.  I am not aware of anybody in the country, with the exception of Independent Newspapers since they have a vested interest in trying to get involved in broadcasting themselves, who can be relied upon to say anything and have an ideological position on this as hardline as any members of the present Government. One has to assume that &ldquo;successful&rdquo; means taming RTE's news and current affairs so they do not keep telling us the truth about Fianna Fáil.  That is the objective of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an interesting, slightly Stalinist tone, to Senator Cassidy's suggestion that we should have an alternative centre of news and current affairs which everybody would have to cover.  Pravda <Col N="330" /> and Tass are moving away from the idea of compulsory broadcasting of a compulsorily combined form of compulsory news.  Senator Cassidy wants us, apparently, to have everybody, including RTE, broadcast something like that.</P>
    <P>I suppose Senator Cassidy was being helpful because in his little and genuine attempt at being constructive, he suggested that RTE's PR was a little sloppy. It is one of the great faults of Fianna Fáil that they confuse PR with rational argument and have done so for many years.  They believe that the image is the message and that, if it is packaged properly, dressed up properly and sent out properly, then you do not have to bother about the content.  Their great problem is that they thought they had this Bill going through the Houses on the grounds that it was going to rescue independent broadcasting from this malevolent State enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning should admit this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing with Senator Manning.  Senator Manning did not introduce this legislation, he is not responsible for it and I share many of his views on it.  It is as well, since nobody else has done it, to have a look at the Minister's speech because it contains such a succession of astonishingly barefaced distortions of the truth that they defy description.  He starts off on the first page of his script &mdash; and indeed one has to read the script because he read it with such haste and pace and such obvious contempt for this House that one would have had to have it in front of one to be able to understand what he was saying &mdash; by saying that the previous Fianna Fáil Government &ldquo;unfettered by the ideological preoccupations of the previous Administration&rdquo;.  Now I am no great admirer of the previous Administration &mdash; the Garret FitzGerald Coalition &mdash; but for this Government to give lectures about ideological fetters having ideologically introduced ideologically based broadcasting legislation based on the ideological assumption that RTE was not <Col N="331" /> meeting the needs of the market as ideologically defined by the ideologues who dictate Fianna Fáil's economic policy, is a bit cheap.</P>
      <P>The legislation was supposed to be introduced because there were market needs that this monopolistic State enterprise, RTE, was unwilling or incapable of meeting.  RTE has recognised, long before Fianna Fáil discovered local broadcasting, that there was a demand for local broadcasting.  There was a suggestion that because it was a State organisation, there was some sort of ideological resistance to local broadcasting, which is what we all thought we were going to get with new broadcasting legislation. There was an interesting and proper discussion about how local broadcasting should be constructed, whether it should be independent of RTE or should be related to RTE, the degree of community control, the degree of involvement of commercial interest and so on. What we got instead was an ideologically based attempt to set up a national broadcasting station based on the ideological assumption that our friends could be relied upon.  Anybody in the commercial sector could be relied upon not to be as harsh as RTE in matters of news and current affairs.  All of this was based on the ideological assumption that RTE was inefficient, sloppy, wasteful and that a good, trusting, commerically oriented national radio station and a soon-to-be commercial, trusting, national television service, would show up RTE.</P>
      <P>This was not based on a rational analysis. This was based on ideology, on the assumption that because it was State owned it was therefore inefficient, rigid, inflexible and unresponsive.  What happened instead was that the competition flopped and flopped gloriously.  It is only ideological blindness that recognises that the reason it flopped was because RTE did a helluva lot better job than Century Radio have been doing and because many local broadcasters underestimated the intelligence of their audiences and, therefore, did not get the audience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no surprise that most of the local <Col N="332" /> radio stations that are doing very well are the ones that have not underestimated the intelligence of their audiences and deal with news, current affairs and other issues.  They have not tried to reproduce United States wall-to-wall pop music, which is a worth-while niche for the broadcasting market; it is not the only or necessarily the most important or predominant niche in the broadcasting market.  That is why it has been successful.</P>
    <P>To do that one has to spend money, and many of the cheapskates that got into this business either underestimated or deliberately ignored the costs of producing the sort of programmes that people want.  So we have ideology involved again, and it is brass neck of the Minister to suggest that ideology was other people's problems and that he was somehow above all this.  Let me say that ideology is a lot better basis for decision-making than the malicious vindictiveness of the kind that has been shown towards RTE by the Government.</P>
    <P>In the second page of his speech the Minister told us: it was imperative to provide the general public with alternative sources of Irish generated broadcast news and current affairs. &ldquo;Alternative sources&rdquo; is a great phrase; it sounds great &mdash;&ldquo;independent&rdquo;, &ldquo;alternative&rdquo;, &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;.  They are all Margaret Thatcher words.  They are great words altogether.  They sound very positive and open.  What he actually meant was somebody who could be relied upon not to be as harsh on Fianna Fáil as RTE have been.  He made no secret about that. To anybody in this House who had a conversation with the present Minister over the past two years it was quite clear that he was intent on sorting out news and current affairs in RTE.  He even told that to me &mdash; and I am hardly his closest confidant.  If he told me, I can imagine what he said to some of the people over there about RTE.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on then in his script to play around with statistics.  He talked about the Joint National Listenership Research/Market Research Bureau of Ireland figures, which &ldquo;indicate that on <Col N="333" /> an average week day over one million &mdash; or 40 per cent &mdash; of all listeners are tuning into one or more of their independent stations&rdquo;.  That is a lovely figure because it means that 40 per cent of the population at some stage or other during the week listen to an independent station.  It does not suggest that 40 per cent of the national broadcasting audience is listening to those stations, because the truth is that 71 per cent of the population listen overwhelmingly to either RTE Radio 1 or 2FM.</P>
    <P>This is the great monopoly that is not responding to popular needs.  If RTE have to compete with a whole range of television channels then the facts are that in multi-channel land in Dublin they have consistently held close to 50 per cent of the audience at all times, and that percentage is increasing.  In my misfortunate benighted city, which has the misfortune to have 26 television channels, the position is somewhat the same.  About 50 per cent of the population watch RTE; the other 50 per cent are divided between about 45 per cent who watch the other four British-based top quality channels and the other 5 per cent watch Sky Movies, which they pay for; and the remaining perhaps 19 channels share the other 1 per cent.  That is competition. There are 26 channels and RTE have faced that.  To distort figures in the style that the Minister has done is to show the bankruptcy of his argument, that he is playing around with numbers to justify a philosophical policy position which is actually without a rational base.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us: &ldquo;Seven of the local stations surveyed had a higher audience figure than 2 FM&rdquo;.  Is that not great? A local radio station, which is trying to serve the whole spread of the population from children up to old people, gets a bigger share of the audience than a national radio station which is designed and specifically intended to cater for a particular sector of age groups.  Are they not great?  It is an achievement.  I am very happy that there are local radio stations. In a few of them, like the radio station in Clare, there are people I knew very well from their work in RTE in Cork who <Col N="334" /> have had a hand in it; and it is to their credit that it has been successful.  But let us not play with figures and distort figures.  2FM is a radio station nationally based to cater for a specific audience.  It does that very well.  It does it so well that the Minister wanted to close it down too, which apparently is the response of the present Minister to anything successful that RTE does &mdash; to try to stop it.  It does it very well, not because of anything to do with subsidising advertising, but because it actually is good at doing that job &mdash; and I think Senator Cassidy might agree with that.  The Minister should not play with figures, but then he has to because he has no arguments to sustain his position.</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to talk about RTE's licence fee, a &ldquo;State subvention&rdquo;. Is it not a State subvention; it is a licence fee which people pay.  But, of course, it is a classic example of this Minister's determination to distort everything to sustain an unsustainable argument that he confuses a licence fee with a State grant.  It is a licence fee that people pay.  It is a good idea and it works very well.  Many other countries do it too. He says that it enables it &ldquo;to meet certain public service obligations&rdquo;.  This is one of the great words that is thrown around, &ldquo;public service&rdquo;.  Vincent Browne, when he writes an editorial in <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> defines &ldquo;public service&rdquo; as the orchestra, the Irish language, and a few more things, but the new thrusting, gloriously independent private entrepreneurs of private broadcasting have decided that news and current affairs are a public service.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House that in RTE news and current affairs are among the programmes that get the largest viewing and listening audiences.  I do not understand how anybody can get away with suggesting that public service broadcasting of the kind which can command audiences of three-quarters of a million or a million, as they do in this country, is public service.  The problem is that the great private entrepreneurs do not want that market.  They would like to be left out of it completely.  They would like to <Col N="335" /> hand it over to RTE.  Their problem is that they pretended to be something that they did not want to be.  The local stations accepted that news and current affairs were the things that people wanted to hear about locally on local news services, the same way as they buy local newspapers to read about local news.  The same people like local news on local radio stations.</P>
    <P>The national people, whether they be TV3 or Century Radio or some of the other whingers on the margins of local broadcasting, wanted to put up a cheapskate pop radio station ignoring three-quarters of the market.  It is not the idea of a music service that I object to; it is the idea that people would be allowed to pick a particular segment of the market which happens to be the one which requires the least investment in labour and in staff and say &ldquo;That is our radio service and that is all we are doing&rdquo;.  So they decided that they would call news and current affairs &ldquo;public service&rdquo;. News and current affairs are not public service.  Newspapers are not public service news organisations; they are commercial bodies.  It is possible, if one wants to and is prepared to, to run news and current affairs commercially.  It is doubtful if it is possible to run them in a broadcasting system because of the capital investment involved, particularly if one has a whole lot of it spread around the country.  There is a limit to the amount of news and current affairs that it is possible to viably run.</P>
    <P>All of a sudden news and current affairs became a big millstone around the neck of these otherwise brave, thrusting and very courageous independent broadcasters. Nobody bothered to get an independent assessment of the degree to which the licence fee contributes to RTE's news and current affairs coverage or the degree to which advertising pays for it.  They just decided that was the case because, to quote the Minister, &ldquo;it suited their ideological position&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would have been very useful to find out the way RTE's costs are broken down.  What does the licence pay for?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> What does advertising pay for?  What programmes are subsidised?  I suspect that some of the high quality, high capital intensive programmes, particularly drama and so on, consume a good part of the licence fee.  We do not know.  The one thing they decided in the independent sector, as they call themselves &mdash; although they will be increasingly the dependent sector with the hand out for any money the Government will give them, that they will take from RTE, which is an extraordinary position for the so called independent sector to be in &mdash; was that they wanted all this money and decided to call news and current affairs &ldquo;public service&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>News and current affairs is what broadcasting should be about the same as entertainment and music.  If you cannot do the job you should get out of the market and let somebody else who is prepared to do it, do it.  Instead they whinge, look for money, look for subsidies and do all the things they accuse RTE of doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister, having accepted this mysterious new definition of &ldquo;public service&rdquo;, spoke about RTE and the State subvention &mdash; this new phrase for the licence fee &mdash; which enables RTE to sell advertising time.  He said:</P>
    <P>It enables RTE to sell its advertising time at in effect &ldquo;below cost&rdquo; rates and thereby artificially dominate the market.</P>
    <P>He does, at least, do us the honour of putting below cost in inverted commas which means that perhaps he does not even mean it himself.  He puts in the phrase &ldquo;thereby artificially dominate the market&rdquo;, this is quite intriguing.  If nobody is listening to your programmes it does not matter what price you charge for advertising, nobody will buy it.  The Minister has created this logical <i>non-sequitur</i> where he is suggesting that because RTE are selling advertising cheap they are, therefore, dominating the market.  The market for what?</P>
    <P>Is he suggesting that 2FM which has a far bigger share of the audience than Century, are dominating the market because it is selling advertising cheap?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> First, nobody has ever proved this and second, RTE deny it.  They insist that the costing of 2FM is based on proper accountancy measures, on a proper capital charge for the contribution 2FM makes to the total capital costs, the total running costs, etc, and it still makes a profit.  2FM and RTE keep saying that over and over again and the Minister stands up and says, no, it is not true, and we are all supposed to believe him.  I do not believe it and I will not believe it until somebody does the rational, sensible thing and finds out the position.  Nobody, has found out.  Instead, we have this assault on RTE, because of an assumed position which nobody can prove.</P>
    <P>If this was said by a backbench Member we would not mind but this is Government policy; this is the policy of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  It is based on <i>non-sequiturs,</i> it is based on assumptions, it based on statements that are meant to be facts but for which there is no independent evidence.  It shows just how bankrupt the whole idea is.</P>
    <P>There is so much more in the Minister's speech that could be looked at.  I love the coy phrase &ldquo;I expect that these measures&rdquo;&mdash; this has to do with limiting RTE's advertising intake &mdash;&ldquo;will lead to the diversion of around £12 million in advertising revenue&rdquo;.  He cannot even say where.  This is the Minister who was able to tell us precisely how RTE were subsidising advertising without bothering to show how he could prove it.  This is the Minister who knew what RTE were doing but he cannot even speculate about the diversion of £12 million.  We know why, and he knows exactly where it is going.  Most of it is going out of the country to UTV, HTV and, to a lesser extent, Channel 4.  Talk about ideology when you are prepared to sacrifice the total broadcasting advertising revenue of a State organisation and send it out of the country so that you can bring the station to heel.</P>
    <P>The Minister then goes on to produce his well known, classical, argument about what RTE did in 1988 and how they made a profit.  He listed the considerable costs <Col N="338" /> incurred by RTE as increased broadcasting hours &mdash; does he think they should not have increased broadcasting hours? &mdash; higher programming standards &mdash; does he disapprove of that?  &mdash; staging the Eurovision Song Contest, extensive coverage of the European Championships in West Germany and extensive coverage of the Olympic Games in Seoul.  Has it escaped the Minister's notice that, when RTE stage events that are popular they sell more advertising?  He said: &ldquo;No matter how much extra you stage you cannot sell any more advertising&rdquo;.  Perhaps in 1988 &mdash; though he does not tell us &mdash; RTE generated a surplus because they staged programmes that drew audiences that generated extra advertising revenue.  The Minister will not let that happen now.  He said they had a surplus of £5.3 million in 1988 and that that proved his point.  It proves precisely the opposite &mdash; that RTE can generate revenue by doing a good job and he will stop them.  The bankruptcy of his argument is underlined.</P>
    <P>I will come back later to what the Minister said about Teilifís na Gaeltachta because I am intrigued by what he said. In June 1989 the Taoiseach in an interview with Cathal Mac Coille on RTE &mdash; presumably RTE are being blamed for this now rather than the Taoiseach &mdash; announced that the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeltachta was now a top priority of the Government.  Now the Minister says the decision still has to be taken.  What do you do and how do you respond to a Government that talk like that about their broadcasting policy?  You can only respond with a considerable degree of contempt for the abandonment of rational argument in the interests of doing a job on an organisation that Fianna Fáil have long wanted to do.</P>
    <P>It is important to list RTE's achievements. In the areas of drama, music, current affairs, news and sport there have been extraordinary achievements in the face of considerable competition all through my adult life.  I love this new Government version of the <i>cordon sanitaire</i> around Ireland where all the other television channels do not exist, all the <Col N="339" /> other radio stations do not exist and RTE have a monopoly.  RTE had no guarantee in three-quarters of the country.  They had to go out and win it.</P>
    <P>When RTE were established, even in Dublin, they had to win their television viewing audience from the channels people had got accustomed to.  All along the east coast, through the northern part of the midlands and the north-west there was an established television viewing audience before RTE were set up, and RTE had to win that audience.  They did that.  RTE's achievements have been considerable and in the process, they have managed to entertain us which, as Senator Cassidy pointed out, is an important function.  Everything they do ought to be entertaining because it is possible to have serious discussions about serious issues in two ways &mdash; either they bore us or they are reasonably entertaining. There are two different ways of doing things.  RTE have stimulated us, they have informed us on many issues, including Fianna Fáil, they have taught us to question what goes on in our society and they have educated us.  They have done that with varying degrees of success, but they have done it.  It is perfectly possible to list RTE's failings but I will not do so. The harm the Government are doing to RTE is so great that I will keep my criticism of RTE to myself.</P>
    <P>It is worth while, in a serious discussion to wonder about why people are so insistent on getting this Bill through.  It is manifestly unpopular, with the exception of the vested interest of the Tony O'Reilly newspapers, which have professed themselves to be in favour of it, but if you read all the things they are in favour of, I am not sure Fianna Fáil would be too enthusiastic about keeping that company on many issues.  It is unpopular with the public; quite clearly, it is unpopular with the broadcasters; it is unpopular with the trade unions and may well yet scupper the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which will be quite a considerable achievement by the Minister.  It is unpopular with the people in the advertising profession and in the marketing <Col N="340" /> profession.  Senator Manning read the reservations of those two bodies on to the record and it is unpopular for the simple fact that both of those bodies recognise the fact that most of the lost revenue will not stay in the State and it will be lost to those two professions.  That, of course, does not matter.  The objective of the Bill is not to divert money to other broadcasters, the objective of the Bill is to shaft RTE.  Let that be made perfectly clear from the beginning.</P>
    <P>In order to understand why the Government are prepared to risk their own popularity, prepared to risk the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> prepared to ignore the advice of many qualified professionals, it is necessary to look a little more closely at Fianna Fáil and, indeed, to look at the Progressive Democrats who, as far as their Dáil manifestation is concerned, are no more than a rump of Fianna Fáil, as is demonstrated in this Bill.  In fact, they are at one with Fianna Fáil, and one of the long-standing objectives of Fianna Fáil, which is to sort out RTE.</P>
    <P>In the words of Professor Joe Lee, in his history of Ireland this century, a lot of this has to do with being an exercise in begrudgery of success.  You have to go back further and look at the history of Fianna Fáil both in their environmental and cultural vandalism over the past 60 years.  Fianna Fáil took to themselves the Irish language and have succeeded in killing that because of the extraordinary way they have of doing things and their apparently profound inability to understand sensitive issues such as culture and deal with them properly.  They presided over the destruction of Georgian Dublin while their friends and its buddies got rich, including perhaps some people close to this Government.  They have watched their own newspaper, the <i>Irish Press</i> decline and fall because of their inability to respond to the changes in Irish society. They have managed to do all that.  At the same time they have presided over environmental vandalism, as evidenced by the carry-on of their councillors in Dublin County Council, by the pollution <Col N="341" /> of large parts of our country by the planning blight that has destroyed much of our country.  Fianna Fáil's capacity for vandalism knows no limits and it is in that context that a Bill like this has to be seen.</P>
    <P>At their core, there is in Fianna Fáil a suspicion of things like imagination, creativity, accountability and, indeed, a considerably increasing contempt for the truth which they conceal by their obsession with secrecy, privacy and with all discussions about serious issues taking place within the party rooms rather than in public where the people can make their own assessment of them.  It is manifest in this House on a frequent basis by the outbursts from the other side, in hostility to thought, hostility to intellectuals, in hostility to academics which can cause some of the Members over there to be far more eloquent than any other issue in this House, the profound hostility to what they call the intellectuals on the Independent benches.</P>
    <P>One of the characteristics of Fianna Fáil over the past 20 years is that they have lost their way.  They are in an extraordinary position where they are attached with increasing rhetorical flourishes to nationalism but are actually intellectually, morally and spiritually colonised. They are incapable of independent thought but get all their ideas from elsewhere and have lost all sense. The whole idea of a broadcasting service, which was a mixture of a licence fee and advertising, was an original idea but Fianna Fáil gave up original thinking about 25 years ago and now all they can do is copy other people.  That is a definition of colonisation as well as I know it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made no secret of his hostility to RTE.  He even told me about it and I am not one of his closest confidants.  The Bill, in the context of Fianna Fáil's hostility to RTE, is a classic example of Fianna Fáil market economics because Fianna Fáil market economics is simple.  It says that market economics is good, when it is good for you, i.e. Fianna Fáil and good for your <Col N="342" /> buddies and, therefore, it is a very good idea.  They have the same commitment to State enterprise, that it is a good idea when it is good for you and good for your buddies.  The underlying ideological issue is that it does not really matter, if either of them penalise our buddies we deal with them.  Therefore, when land speculation was making their buddies rich, they would not deal with it.  They are still destroying large sections of our country with the irresponsible carry-on of their section 4 motions.  They have nods and winks around Dublin County Council, again based on the fact that where market economics works to the advantage of their&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When their buddies actually discover they have no risks and there is a return guarantee, then they want to share the action so Fianna Fáil start talking about privatisation.  They sell off not one of the State companies that are not working well but they sell the one insurance company that is remarkably profitable and then they try to crucify RTE so that their buddies can get rich somewhere else.

      <P>The Senator's buddies are happy.  Interest rates are up and <Col N="344" /> inflation is down, which makes everybody with money very happy.  The Senator is quite right, it leaves 250,000 people unemployed but they do not count.  When the Government decided to deal with RTE, it was the culmination of a period of considerable difficulty for Fianna Fáil. I do not think you can separate the present decisions, the extraordinary railroading through of massively unpopular legislation, which cannot do the Government any good anywhere.  It has to be seen in terms of what has happened to Fianna Fáil.  The fact is that since 1973 there has been only one majority Fianna Fáil Government.  By the time this Government leave office there will have been a 20-year period without one majority Fianna Fáil Government.  In that period, RTE have had a period of considerable development and influence.</P>
      <P>It is worth while examining the interrelationship between the development of RTE and the decline of Fianna Fáil because it has been one of Fianna Fáil's great complaints that RTE give them a hard time.  They choose, therefore, to believe that that hard time they get from RTE is the cause of their decline whereas, in fact, the reason they get a hard time from RTE is because they are actually very bad and deserve it.  They blame RTE but the reason for the decline is because they are increasingly irrelevant and increasingly out of touch with the way the country is developing.  RTE reflect the mood of the country and, therefore, they are blamed.  That is a classic example of shooting the messenger if one does not like the message.</P>

      <P>It is an ageing vote.  It is a vote which is increasingly separate from the rest of the country.  One of the reasons they lose is because the rest of the country is so hostile to Fianna Fáil at this stage, because the rest of the country can see what a disaster of a party they have become.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue is that this difficulty for Fianna Fáil with their own rhetoric, lack of ideology, lack of a philosophy and the contradiction between the values, lifestyle and attitudes of their members and those which they claim to stand for, have been well exposed by the coincidental contemporaneous development of RTE. In that development they have &mdash; I want to repeat this once more &mdash; chosen to <Col N="346" /> shoot the messenger because they do not like the message.  Being a party that used to have a considerable political subtleness &mdash; they are losing their touch on that issue and on others &mdash; they decided, of course, they would not attack RTE.  They decided to introduce competition, a good thing, a very positive and healthy thing.</P>
    <P>Competition is one of these fine things that is very good for certain enemies and very bad for certain friends which is why no Irish Government have ever bothered to make the Irish banks compete, because that is where their friends are. They can try to induce RTE into competition because they do not like them. We have the least competitive banking system in the country and we are trying to get the most competitive broadcasting system in the country.  The priorities are confused and the values are confused.  It has all got to do with ideology.  Former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, in 1978 talked about competition.  The Minister for Communications, who has earned the nickname &ldquo;Rambo&rdquo;, decided he would sort out RTE once and for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw that remark. What do we get?  We get the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988 which, we were told, would give us wonderful choice, wonderful stimulation and many wonderful things.  Most of what was supposed to happen fell flat on its face. Century Radio are on the point of collapse, and TV3, which was supposed to be on the air six months ago, have not materialised yet.  What is going on?  This country is, perhaps, too small to support this multiplicity of broadcasting.  This country is too limited to support it.  We have three million people.  RTE have a licence fee revenue of crudely £50 million.  We have a population of three million, which is where both revenue from advertising and licence fees will come. The United Kingdom have a population of about 60 million and, to put it crudely, the revenue of the BBC is about £1 billion. I assume the revenue of ITV is about <Col N="347" /> £1 billion.  They can run four television channels on that revenue.  We are proposing to run three on somewhere like £120 million.</P>
      <P>It was a daft idea from the beginning to run a separate television service.  It is still a daft idea.  We will get out of this, because of the determination of the Government to bring RTE to heel, three bad television channels rather than two very good ones that we have at present. RTE will be hamstrung by a lack of revenue and the other channel will not be able to generate enough revenue to run a decent service.  That is what will happen. That is done, not because the country is able to do so or because the country needs it, but because the Government wanted from the beginning to bring RTE to heel.  They do not care what happens to the quality of broadcasting, they do not care what happens to a whole range of good quality programmes.  As long as RTE's news and current affairs content can be reduced, diluted or made less significant, they will be quite happy because they are determined they will not ever be subject again, if they can avoid it, to the sort of scrutiny that cost them the last election.</P>
      <P>I have heard members of Fianna Fáil blame RTE for telling the people about the health cutbacks, that the people had not any real concern about these things until RTE started talking about them.  By God, they say, if that happened once, it will never happen again.  The problem has been for the last two years that it did not work.  Instead of losing to all these new competitors, RTE turned out to be successful.  Aer Lingus had the same problem.  Instead of losing to Ryanair who have been successful, they were shafted.  RTE were supposed to lose too. They did not so the Government shafted RTE.</P>
      <P>This will go on and on.  Competition is great as long as one's side is winning. Once competition does not work one picks on the crowd one does not like and deal with them.  In Aer Lingus' case it was ideology; in this case it goes even deeper than ideology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> We are left with the ludicrous situation where, in order to fulfil a 20-year long ambition of sorting out RTE the Government, first of all, tried to use the argument of market competition and hoped that would achieve their objective of getting RTE to stop being fair about Fianna Fáil.  When that failed, they decided they would have to do something else.  One solution would, of course, have been to give some sort of underlying funding to help out the initial stages of the broadcasting system.  Another would have been to look at RTE and insist that, in areas like 2FM, they should operate on a free standing basis.  That is not unreasonable. Another solution would be to look at the relative contribution of licence fees to various areas of RTE's activity.  They did not do any of that.  They just picked a figure out of the air and decided they would take a quarter of RTE's licence fee revenue away from them, just like that.  It was not for any reasons that anybody could gain, not because it was a good figure, not because there was any basis for it, it was just big enough to get away with it.  They took the maximum figure they could extract out of RTE without too much of a howl.  RTE howled but the Government are happy that nobody else will howl.  I hope the trade unions prove them wrong.  They did that, ostensibly, to rescue the private sector but, in fact, because this was the best opportunity they had in 20 years to deal with RTE.</P>
    <P>This is where I come back to the lack of principles in Fianna Fáil today.  They are prepared to do that even if the decision sends £12 to £15 million of television advertising revenue out of the State.  It is the most extraordinary exercise in levelling a playing pitch that I have ever heard, that one would send half the players off to play on another pitch altogether and leave one's own team short of members, not to push the analogy too far.</P>

      <P>I would appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to look at the terms &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Where a subvention is unreasonably withheld from a person who qualifies, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would be effective.  Could the Minister find some way that would satisfy those Senators who have deep reservations about this legislation &mdash; I am one of them &mdash; because of our long experience in health boards?  It is not my style to put the gun to the head of a Minister of any Government on matters of health because health should be above politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Honan's recommendation to have an intermediary word in the section rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, seeing that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; could cause a charge on the Exchequer.  I have grave misgivings as have many of the Senators who signed the amendment, about the lack of emphasis involved in &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  As I said on Tuesday evening, it would be a sad situation if a case, having been investigated and proved to be bona fide, a subvention was withheld because the inclusion of &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 7 would allow the health board to opt out of their responsibility.  I support Senator Honan but I appreciate that at this stage the Minister can do very little.  However I would hope that in response to the pleas of many Senators he will accept an amendment on Report Stage.  He may be able to offer some hope to us now in that regard.  The operative word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is weak.  The people we are concerned about are vulnerable.  Therefore I hope the Minister will consider an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

It is important that there should be no ambiguity or opportunities to opt out.  Like Senator Ryan I hope there would not be in the Bill any clause that would allow a health board not to comply fully with their obligations.</P>
      <P>I very genuinely congratulate Senator Honan for the non-partisan approach she is taking to this important question, and it is an important question.  Basically, I believe the Minister, in conjunction with the draftspersons, could arrive at some formula to deal with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reassure Senators that section 7 of the Bill dealing with subventions is not about <Col N="351" /> saving money.  The Minister for Health in the Dáil and I in this House have given a commitment that there will be no diminution in the amount of funding for nursing home subvention as a result of this Bill.  On the contrary, there will be additional funding made available to implement this Bill.  At least £500,000 of the £5 million made available by the Government this year to develop services for the elderly has been set aside to implement this Bill in anticipation that it will be passed by this House.  That commitment has already been made as far back as the Book of Estimates last year and the budget in January.  The new subvention rate will be higher than the existing rate.</P>
      <P>What this section does is allow health boards to target these additional resources at people whose level of dependency and income is such that they require nursing care which they cannot afford.  The health board will be able to pay a subvention to any home registered by a health board.  At present they can pay the subvention only to a small number of homes approved by the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>I have not heard any Senator defend the present unsatisfactory position.  I would ask Senators to reflect on the suggestion that there should be a statutory obligation on health boards to pay a nursing home subvention.  Health boards have a statutory obligation to provide care and maintenance for any person who cannot provide that care and maintenance for themselves under section 54 of the Health Act, 1953.  This Bill does not affect that statutory obligation in any way.  In fact, it clarifies the health board's power to meet that obligation by arranging for the care of dependent persons in nursing homes.  Health boards must retain the flexibility to meet the needs of dependent persons in other ways in their own hospitals or homes or by making services available in people's homes.  The health board should not be obliged to meet the needs of dependent people in one particular way rather than another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> I understand the concern of some Senators that health boards, having assessed a patient as suitable for a subvention in a nursing home, may delay the payment of the subvention without offering alternative care in the meantime. The Minister for Health has already given a commitment in the Dáil that the code of practice which is being prepared to ensure consistency in the implementation of the legislation will lay down the maximum period of time which any person who has been assessed as suitable for a subvention will have to wait for payment of that subvention.  I believe that this concern will be adequately addressed in the code of practice and I would ask Senators to support this section of this important Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says that this Bill is not about saving money and if he is satisfied that there is sufficient money available to meet such a case as this, where does the problem arise?  This &ldquo;shall&rdquo; refers only to the case where the person enters or is already in the nursing home.  It has no bearing on what might happen to the person before that.  I do not see what the problem is if it is not about saving money.  If the Minister says there is sufficient money available and additional moneys are being provided, there should not be a problem.  What we are asking is that if the person enters or is in a nursing home the health board shall pay to the nursing home.  If the person does not go into the nursing home, the health board will not be expected to pay.  I cannot see what is the problem about the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, money is not the problem.  What is vital to the proper care and maintenance of a dependent person is the necessary flexibility to the health authorities and the health boards to exercise discretion as to how that person should be looked after. If we were to put them into a cul-de-sac, where there is only one option available, that they &ldquo;shall&rdquo; pay subvention to a nursing home for them, it could be tantamount to debarring the health board <Col N="353" /> or the medical practitioners or those in charge of the medical well-being of the person from taking other options.  It may need flexibility in order to ensure that these options are available for maximisation of the care that will be available for the individual person.</P>

      <P>I am not accusing the Minister of State of shortcutting funds from the Department. I am well aware of the commitment of the Department of Health and of the present Minister to funding and of the increase in funding.  I have sufficient confidence in the Minister.  There are long-serving members of health boards in the House at the moment and we know there are delays in subvention payments.  I am aware of the commitment of the Minister for Health and the Minister of State to provide extra finance for the elderly. Senator John Ryan, Senator O'Reilly and myself are concerned about this.  The three of us made the same points on Second Stage in lengthy contributions, that the health boards should pay the subventions if requested even by a dependent person who has just arrived in a health board hospital or nursing home. That is all we are asking for.  We do not want amendments.  All we are asking is that subventions be paid without delay.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the extraordinary commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, to the provision of extra finance to this section of our people.  I am asking that there should not be further delays for people who have been delayed already.  There will be an increase in the number of persons involved when the legislation is passed because there will be new nursing homes.</P>

      <P>I appreciate and accept the concern of the Minister of State about the Bill.  I also accept that the health board, in their wisdom, may decide on a way of looking after the person other than in a nursing home.  Where the health board is of opinion that the person is in <Col N="354" /> need of maintenance in a nursing home but is unable to pay all or part of the cost, the Bill then uses the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I accept the Minister's bona fides but when a word is written into law the word is part of the law.  When the Bill becomes law the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; will be the operative part of the section.  Having decided on the need, we display weakness by using the term &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  That is what I am concerned about.</P>

      <P>Everybody is concerned with this problem.  We must understand the difficulty in relation to the Department of Health <i>vis-a-vis</i> the health boards.  In the Bill, it is the circumstances of the individual person that will determine the subvention.  The use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would remove the right of the health board to have a say in the activities of a nursing home.  That is the reason the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is included.  An individual in a nursing home could be entitled to a subvention and it is the nursing home that would get the payment in those circumstances. There could be a situation where a nursing home would not have adequate facilities or would not be doing its job properly.  It is important that where a subvention is being given to a person in a nursing home the responsible authority would have control over the health board concerned.</P>

      <P>The bona fides of the Minister are not in doubt.  As Senator Ryan said, it is not a question of whether we take the Minister's word, as Senator Honan suggested, and believe that there is extra funding and so on.  What is important is what is in the Bill.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to license nursing homes and to have them up to standard. If the nursing home is not up to standard the person in question can be put into another nursing home.  What we are asking is that having decided that the person is entitled to care and having decided to put him into care, at that stage the health board &ldquo;shall&rdquo; pay the subvention.  Everything we have heard here is correct, I see no reason why the <Col N="355" /> word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; cannot be substituted for &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Just a few comments on the section.  When I say &ldquo;on the section&rdquo;, I really mean on the amendment and the reasons why it is not there because I think this is crucially important.  I know the Minister is a decent and intelligent man. I have said this on previous occasions and I believe it to be true.  I do not think he has got the room for manoeuvre to accept this amendment.  Let us be political realists.  If this amendment is accepted the Bill will have to go back to the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that that is the problem.  The management of Government business is indicated consistently and I see Senator Farrell nodding his head.  He is sitting in the front seat, so he probably knows something that perhaps the Minister has been deprived of in information terms.</P>
      <P>I have been contacted yet again today by people whose political persuasion I simply do not know, nor do I care.  They are involved in this area and they are concerned about it, for very good reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I can comment simply on the ruling of the Cathaoirleach that the amendment is out of order which, of course, we all accept; we have to accept it; it is part of the tradition and regulations of this House, but acceptance of that ruling has certain consequences for what the Minister says.  If we accept, as we are obliged to do, that allowing this amendment is impossible because it would create a charge on the Exchequer &mdash; that means an increase &mdash; then the Minister's statement that this section will allow the spending of extra money &mdash; or, at least, to stabilise money &mdash; must be incorrect. What is represented in this section as it stands has been determined by a ruling of the Cathaoirleach to be in effect a reduction.  That is the only logical conclusion you can come to.  With regard to <Col N="356" /> creating a charge, the layman, not having the benefit of the special techniques of the Cathaoirleach, would say it was sustaining rather than creating a charge.</P>
    <P>I come to my final point.  As a result of the Minister's phrasing, we can now, clearly have a situation where a patient who is determined to be in need of nursing home care, and who is also determined not to have sufficient income to be able to support that, may not get it.  As a result of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; the Bill clearly envisages the possibility that a person who needs nursing home care and cannot afford it may not get it.  I would like to ask the Minister very specifically if he would agree with me on this point.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not agree that it is possible to interpret this section in the following manner and I will specify it again: is it possible that it could be determined that somebody was in need of nursing home care, could not afford it but still would not get it because the health board would not provide it?  I am not suggesting this is going to be a widespread practice but it most clearly is indicated by the present wording of the Bill. I would be very sorry to see the Minister stand over that because that is clearly the situation.  In other words people may not get the subvention as a result of the obdurate refusal of the Government, unfortunately, to accept this amendment which has the support of the entire House &mdash; although perhaps not Senator Farrell, he is waving his hands about; I think disclaiming that.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to be testing the Chair's patience but I do not think Senator McKenna's case stands up because if the Bill is supposed to improve the nursing home situation, I do not think there will be any question of any stage of the health board giving a subvention to a person who is going into a nursing home that is not already licensed by the health board.  This wording is a weakness in the legislation.  In ten years time if &ldquo;may&rdquo; is still in the Bill, I will still say the Bill is weak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify the situation as best I can.  First, the Cathaoirleach in ruling this amendment out of order does not reduce the funds available for nursing home care or geriatric care.  It maintains the <i>status quo</i> that the prerogative for creating an expenditure on the Exchequer rests with the Government of the day.  Secondly, if we change the word from &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; it would allow for a situation where a person could admit themselves to a nursing home and the health board would be liable to pay a subvention.  We cannot allow that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we put a legal imposition on the health boards, they must abide by the law and they have no option but to pay the subvention.  If a person is assessed in the normal way and is adjudicated to require nursing home care, and if that person is not able to support themselves, then under the law and various Acts the onus rests with the health board to provide the care for them.  If the person is duly assessed and adjudicated to need nursing home care and is admitted to a private nursing home and has not sufficient resources, again under the law and as a <Col N="358" /> result of this Bill, the onus will be on the health board to subvent that person.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Honan's point &mdash; and I will readily admit that in the past health boards were not as quick to make decisions on subventions as they should &mdash; we are looking at that matter now and we will liaise with the health boards, with whom we have been in negotiation.  We are drawing up a code of practice and we will have that enshrined in the code of practice to ensure the subventions are paid quickly.</P>
    <P>I have all the amendments before me and I am hoping to bring forward on Report Stage a fairly substantive amendment that I think will cover the points Senator Honan made, as well as a number of other points.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 30 and 31, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Fees shall relate to the number of beds available.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I submitted this amendment in view of the fact that it was also recommended by the working party that fees should be in proportion to the number of beds in the nursing home.  If it is accepted and appreciated that a particular nursing home has provided a first class service, the fee should be proportionate to the availability of beds and staff <i>vis-a-vis</i> a much bigger home.  There could be two high quality nursing homes, one with 20 beds and a <i>pro rata</i> staff and another with 100 beds.  In recognition of what the smaller nursing home has done there should be <i>pro rata</i> fees.  It is a small item but it is recognition of, perhaps, a proprietor bringing a nursing home up to the standard the Minister requires.</P>

      <P>In page 12, subsection (2) (c), line 23, after &ldquo;home&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided an opportunity has been given for the person to comply with the regulations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In our handling of this legislation from the word go we have attempted to adopt a reasoned approach.  Fundamentally, the first concern of this Bill is with the care of the people in nursing homes &mdash; the inmates for want of a better term &mdash; the kind of facilities provided for them, their lifestyle, diet and the nursing staff.  I mentioned all these on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>What we are attempting to do in this amendment is to be fair to nursing home owners.  Basically, it is to write it into the legislation that an opportunity will be given to the person to comply with the regulations.  It is designed to make it clear that a nursing home owner will have the opportunity, on being found less than completely satisfactory, to put their house in order.  The amendment has no greater intention than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not want anyone in the House to misunderstand the amendment.  There <Col N="360" /> is no question of us suggesting to the House or to the Minister that there should be any laxity or less than the maintenance of excellent standards.  I am impressed with the importance of that coming through consistently in this debate.  There is no question of wanting to diminish that.  What we are trying to do is to achieve fair play or to ensure that fair play is seen to be achieved.  We do not see this as posing great difficulties, unless the Minister can enlighten us otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>A health board would not seek a nursing home management order unless the regulations had been contravened seriously.  Such an order would be a serious step for a health board to take and could only be granted with the consent of the owner or the District Court.  A nursing home management order is not the course a health board may take if the regulations have been contravened.  It would be usual, and has been the practice of the health boards to date, to discuss the situation with the owner.  The management order would only be used where other measures had failed and where there was an immediate threat to the well-being of the patient being cared for and the proprietor was unable and unwilling to do anything about it.  A board, prior to seeking the order, would have given the nursing home owner an opportunity to remedy the situation.  The purpose of this subsection is to allow more than one order to be made, if necessary.  Any further order would, of course, have to comply with the procedures laid down in the section. I trust this clarifies the matter. Consequently, I will not be able to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister be more specific?  Will it be clear in the future that a health board, when they discover negligence, will issue a warning? I think it is important.  I said on Second Stage that we must be extraordinarly vigilant. I am very concerned about the inspection system of the homes.  Is the <Col N="361" /> Minister giving an absolute guarantee to the House that there will be a proper warning system and a proper advice system for the management?  Is that the case?</P>

      <P>Absolutely.  When a complaint comes to the notice of the health board, either through the local social worker or the public health nurse, senior officials of the health board are brought in.  Usually it is a superintendent public health nurse or a senior social worker, or people like that, such a person would investigate the matter and bring back a report to the director of community care.  If the director of community care, on reading the report, finds that it warrants his or her visit, along with a team of officials, they will give due notice and will visit the nursing home.  They will give clear directions as to what is to be done.  They will specify the time by which it is to be carried out.  They will go back and put that in writing.  If it is not done within the specified prescribed period then they will take legal action.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 14, before section 16, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;(1)  A dependent person as defined in the Act, or person acting on the dependent person's behalf shall have the right to make complaint relating to his care or standard of facilities <Col N="362" /> in a Nursing Home, as defined in the Act, to the Health Board for that area.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Health Board shall investigate such complaint, advise the complainant of the outcome, and may attach any conditions in respect of registration as is necessary to avoid a repeat occurrence of any such complaint.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>I consider this to be an extremely important amendment to the legislation.  It would be extremely wrong that we should have a nursing home where a person who is unlucky enough to need to live in the institution, because of old age, family circumstances or whatever, could not make a complaint.  It is important that that person should have access to an appeals procedure and the right to make a formal complaint.  This is something we grant to all other sections of the community in other situations.  Why not make sure that right is statutorily established for old people in nursing homes?  I am convinced we should maintain the great Irish tradition &mdash; and I dealt with this more comprehensively on Second Stage &mdash; of care for our old people.  It is a wonderful characteristic of our Irish culture. It is engrained in us and it is something of which we can be proud.  With that in view, I urge the Minister to take on board this amendment.  It will provide a procedure to allow old people to make a complaint.  That is important.</P>
    <P>The second subsection provides that the health board shall investigate such complaint and advise the complainant of the outcome.  I am a primary teacher by profession.  When a complaint is made against a teacher in a school the inspectors of the Department of Education investigate that complaint and they prepare a report on it.  They subsequently convey their findings to both the complainant and the person involved.  What I am saying is that it is important that the complaints are investigated, that the outcome is conveyed to the persons concerned and that it is very clear to the nursing home owner that such procedures exist and that complaints will be <Col N="363" /> investigated properly.  That sort of sanction has to exist.  It is a human institution. It would be naive of us to assume that one could run a nursing home otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is important that the complaints are investigated, that they are seen to be followed up and that a report is sent back to the person making the complaint.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment. We did not put down amendments lightly to this legislation.  None of them was put down without due consideration for the care for the old and, indeed, as much as possible to accommodate the nursing home owners.  However, our ultimate responsibility must be to the old persons in the institution.</P>

      <P>I fully support Senator O'Reilly's amendment to section 16. Senator Conroy did not like the word &ldquo;aged&rdquo; being used last Tuesday.  I urge the Minister that a system be accepted whereby when a home is registered under the aegis of the health board and when a particular patient has a complaint that there should be a complaints system.  The complaint should be conveyed to the health board and investigated, both for the sake of the owner of the home and for the patient.  That is a sensible way of dealing with complaints rather than having frightening stories and complaints going outside the home, which are wrong and hurtful to the patient and to the home.  I strongly recommend that this amendment be adopted by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that this amendment has been put down.  It was one of the points which I mentioned on Second Stage.  I think that the area of complaints is extremely important.  It is a very sensitive area.  We have to accept that old people who are dependent are, understandably, very frightened and very vulnerable.  They feel to a large extent that their rights have been taken away from them, maybe simply because of their incapacity and are not able to assert themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know, sadly, that there are people in nursing homes who have been <Col N="364" /> there for a very long time.  Some of them do not have any relatives to whose notice they can bring a complaint in order to have something done on their behalf.  We are talking about a situation where they are frightened that if they try to initiate any complaint it would probably be extremely difficult for them in the first place.  If they do not have a relative to take up the issue for them it would be quite difficult for them to do it on their own.  Even if they did succeed in initiating some sort of a complaint they are, understandably, concerned and frightened that they will be, as a result, discriminated against.</P>
    <P>I remember being in hospital in Glasgow many years ago in a four-bedded ward.  There was a very elderly lady opposite me who was treated abominably by the night nurse.  When this came to our attention, we offered to do something on her behalf.  She simply refused to allow the other three patients in the ward bring the matter to the attention of the matron because she felt that on the following night the situation would be even worse than it had been.  However, we took the matter up on her behalf and she was not discriminated against, but she had three agile people in the ward who were able to fight on her behalf.  It was certainly an example to me that old people are prepared to put up with the most outrageous treatment and bullying by staff, and do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>This amendment would go some way to alleviating that.  I suggested earlier that we should bring about a situation where making complaints was not seen as such a big deal, but something relatively easy. I could only think of the sort of system that operates in hotels abroad where they have a suggestion box.  If that system operated in nursing homes old people would not feel they were going to create problems for themselves and it would be relatively easy for them to place a slip in a suggestion box.  When such a complaint would go before the health board, they could decide whether it was a serious issue.  It probably is not a practical suggestion, but we need to do something which <Col N="365" /> will encourage people to complain if they have a grievance.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to the very sincere contributions on this amendment and I have looked at the amendment in detail.  This amendment, in itself, is not appropriate for inclusion in the Bill.  However, I would like to advise Senators that article 8 of the draft regulations sets out a very clear complaints procedure.  Sub-articles (1), (2) and (3) of this article incorporate many of the points which have been made here by various Senators.  They state:</P>
      <P>Article 8.</P>
      <P>(1)  The registrar, proprietor and the person in charge shall investigate any complaint about conditions in the nursing home by a patient, or the person acting on the patient's behalf;</P>
      <P>(2)  Complaints should be made in writing and a copy of the complaint and details of the outcome recorded in a complaint record;</P>
      <P>(3)  A patient in a nursing home, or a person acting on the patient's behalf, may make a complaint concerning a nursing home to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board by which the nursing home has been registered and the health board shall investigate the complaint and record the outcome.</P>
      <P>I concur with what Senator O'Reilly has said.  I appreciate the time and attention that has been given by various Senators and parties in putting down amendments. I appreciate very much the passionate, diligent and sincere contributions that have been made throughout the debate on this very important Bill.  I have had discussions with my officials and, in turn, have had discussions with the Attorney General's Office and the draftsman.  I am not able to accept this amendment, because it is slightly loosely worded.

      <P>In response to various suggestions which have been <Col N="367" /> made by Senators throughout the debate, we have looked at amendments to the Bill.  In amendment No. 1 I am proposing to insert this new provision after subparagraph (1).  Senators will note from the section we are proposing to amend &mdash; section 6 (1) &mdash; that it starts off with the words, &ldquo;the Minister shall&rdquo; and in subparagraph (ii) &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo;. We have various additions to that under the various subheads and this new provision will come in there.  It takes account of what has been requested here.  The most important point is that complaints being made are legitimate complaints and are being made in writing.  We have found in other legislation, at international level in the United Kingdom and in the United States, in particular, that some people use opportunities to make nuisance complaints. This creates major problems for administration and for medical people. We want to ensure that somebody is not complaining because, for example, of some decision which was made by an individual who is institutionalised concerning, for instance, a will they were making or an indication that they wanted to dispose of their assets, or where somebody might be sulking and making nuisance complaints.  We must ensure that a patient is not victimised by some third party in an anonymous way.  We want to be absolutely certain that when complaints are made they are bona fide and genuine, that they can be sustained and investigated, and that the proper care and attention is given at all times.  That is of paramount importance for all patients who are institutionalised, whether in private nursing homes &mdash; which will be regulated once this Bill is passed &mdash; or in public, geriatric or nursing homes which are under the care and control of the Minister for Health and the health boards.  I hope the House will agree to this first amendment.</P>

      <P>The amendment will have the support of my party.  I welcome it.  I am delighted that the Minister saw fit to take on board the amendment of our party which I see as improving the <Col N="368" /> legislation.  I am delighted that we have been in a position, through our amendments, to improve this legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House with points I have made but one cannot sufficiently emphasise that our ultimate concern is the welfare, the care and the proper provision for our old people in these institutions.  In so far as the amendment achieves an advancement, it is to be welcomed.  I take the Minister's point wholeheartedly in relation to the nuisance issue.  One has to allow for all sorts of human variations and particularly difficult individuals.  We could not have willy-nilly complaints every half hour.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment. We spent a lot of time worrying about sections of the Bill.  Those amendments ensure, above all else, that the patient, the person in the nursing home, will be looked after.  That is very important. I welcome that it has to be in writing. That too is important.  Otherwise there would be people phoning and making nuisance calls, as the Minister said.  This amendment should allay all fears and guarantee us an extra good Bill.  I congratulate the Minister and his Department for bringing forward those amendments.</P>

      <P>Like Senators Farrell and O'Reilly, I would like to compliment the Minister.  He has taken on board our concerns in connection with patients in need of attention in registered nursing homes. A system will now be implemented that will cover genuine cases.  We do not want complaints &ldquo;willy-nilly&rdquo;; we want genuine complaints in writing.  I appreciate what the Minister said, and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>We are all concerned about the care of people who are in need of institutional care in first class homes.  While we did not discuss the Bill until today, we have done well.  The Minister has had time to think about what we have been saying and perhaps if the same thing was done with other Bills we might not have the same problems.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister warmly for these amendments.  The nice thing about health legislation going through this House is that we do not have party politics.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the nrusing homes or the hospitals, which are on the other side of the complaints, might be informed of them.  I am also grateful for the time and consideration the Minister has given in deciding to bring in amendments.  It is our responsibility as elected people to this House and to the health boards, to see that our elderly are cared for.  This is very important legislation.  The time we have given to it is, in justice, due to it.  I thank the Minister sincerely for these amendments, which certainly improve this legislation.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, some <Col N="370" /> eminent figure wrote at length about the near identity between tragedy and farce. There is an element of tragedy and an element of farce in this legislaion.  It is farcical for the reasons which I outlined at some length before lunch.  It is farcical because, quite clearly, it no lonegr has anything to do with the unforseen difficulties of commercial broadcasting.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; is worth emphasis here.  All the other words have connotations of superiority &mdash;&ldquo;independent&rdquo; quite clearly juxtaposed against &ldquo;dependent&rdquo;; &ldquo;free&rdquo; quite clearly juxtaposed against &ldquo;unfree&rdquo; and a whole lot of words like that have come to be almost accepted. &ldquo;State run&rdquo; has been distorted into implying at least, if not clearly stating, that because it is &ldquo;State run&rdquo; it is, therefore, bureaucratised and incapable of response.  The truth is that the broadcasting media, with the exception of RTE, are commercial.  They are run on the basis that they will, to a greater or lesser extent, make money for those who put money into them.  That is not of itself a bad thing.  One cannot make organistations commercial just by saying, &ldquo;you must make money&rdquo;.  It is a mystery to me how people who expound the doctrine or the idology of the market place, as do Fianna Fáil to an increasing extent, do not ever seem to be able to follow through the logic of the marketplace.  The ligic of the marketplace is quite simple. It is that if people are successful, then they are rewarded and if they are not successful, they close down.  That is the logic which, in the eyes of those who support market economics, is the justification for the market.  People who cannot provide goods or services that the market wants to purchase at the price at which they can be produced do not succeed and, therefore, the market operates its own process of selection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many of us that is both ruthless and inhuman and also a less than efficient and complete way of determining choices but for those who believe in it that is the way it should be done.  What we have walked into on this Bill &mdash; and this is why it is farcical &mdash; is an attempt being <Col N="371" /> masqueraded as an attempt to restore competition but which is really in the view of those who best unedestand the market in the area of advertising, the practitioners of advertising, a transfer of resources from one national broadcasting organisation to a number of foreign broadcasting organisation.  That point is entirely lost and was not adverted to in the Minister's speech.  Senator Cassidy assures us that if £12 million is to leak out of the country, then there is the posibility of amending legislation being introduced because that should not happen. I am glad that he Senator knows something the rest of do not know.  That is the crux of the matter.  Senator Cassidy is probably more optimistic than I am.</P>
    <P>It depends on what one sees as the motivation behind the Bill.  The motivation behind the Bill is to shaft RTE.  It is the settling of a score of 20 years vintage with RTE for all the hurts they are alleged to have done.  RTE were blamed in the seventies for the defeat of the referendum on the abolition of PR and the attempt to replace it by the straight vote system, because RTE did an analysis of what would happen and it turned out that Fianna Fáil would get 93 seats out of 148.  That had the profound effect on Irish public opinion and Fianna Fáil have blamed RTE, Brian Farrell and David Thornley ever since that.  There were a succession of such incidents, some of which I mentioned earlier.  This is the settling of the score.  That is why it does not matter whether £12 million flows out of the country.  What matters is that it flows out of RTE and that RTE should not have access to it.</P>
    <P>If RTE manage to create programmes which attract increasing audiences which in turn would attract increasing advertising revenue, they have been told they cannot have it.  Whatever happens to RTE's viewing figures, their advertising revenue cannot go up.  It can go down. If one manages to undermine the quality of their programmes, the coverage of issues, the vitality, imagination and creativity of their programmes, all the words like &ldquo;thought&rdquo;,&ldquo;imagination&rdquo;, &ldquo;creativity&rdquo;, <Col N="372" />&ldquo;challenge&rdquo;, and &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; that Fianna Fáil dislike, then their audience numbers will drop.  It will into necessarily go anywhere else, not to even more commercial, less trusting an less chalenging television services; it will just drop.  The obejctives will have been acheived which is that the primary source of information on news and current affairs, which has been relied on by Irish people for the best part of 30 years, will become less authorities, less accessible and less widely viewed.  That is the underlying fundamental objective of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The spurious reasons given in the Minister's speech are unconvincing.  If the problem was below-cost selling of advertising, it is perfectly feasible to deal with that.  If the problem was the famous uneven playing pitch &mdash; I cannot find the playing pitch any more because RTE have been booted off it &mdash; then that could be dealt with in many other ways.  The point that needs to be said over and over again to the Government is that nobody, except themselves and Independent Newspapers Limited approve of this legislation.  Nobody except themselves and Tony O'Reilly approve of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We know why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is company that I know Fianna Fáil in their good days would not wish to be in but they and Toney O'Reilly are in favour of this.  The Independent Newspapers group have a long standing and stated interest in getting invovled in broadcasting and, of course, this will help.  It is an indication of the naivety and lack of a sense of commercial reality on the part of the newspapers that they believe that advertising agencies funds will be diverted from television to newspapers. They will not.  Agencies have a basket of the kind of advertising they wish to spend money on.  They hae budgets for different areas.  It is quite simple. If major food chains cannot advetise on RTE because the advertising on RTE is chapped they will go outside the country. The reasoning I identified and talked about earlier is the presumption that <Col N="373" /> advertiseing somehow or other created the audience.  It is the quality of the programmes that creates the audience.  From the very beginning the alternative national radio service did not have the quality programmes to attract an audience. That was the problem then and that is the problem now.  They cannot get the audience to justify advertsing on the scale that they need to make ends meet. That is not RTE's fault.  If there is a problem for commercial stations, <i>vis-a-vis</i> RTE, it is that the combination of licence fee and advertsing enables RTE to make better programmes than a commercial service can do on its own.</P>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that the combination of advertising and licence fees, not a Government grant, that enables RTE to make quality programmes should be regarded as suspect: RTE succeed in making good programmes, there is something wrong with that.  It is dressed up in trivialities about under-selling advertising. Under-selling advertising does not get an audience.  What gets and audience is the quality of the programmes made. Therefore, the only way one can divert revenue away from RTE is by reducing their audience.  The only way one can reduce their audience is by reducing the quality of their programmes, the number of hours their programmes or the range of subjects they cover.  One does that by taking money from them.  All the other arguments are dressed up to get away from that fact.  The objective of this legislation is to reduce the proportion of the population of the State who watch RTE television and listen to RTE radio.  Anything else makes no logical sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a happy coincidence for the Government that they can use the ideological fashionable phrases about independence and competition to enable them get their own back on RTE.  It is a profound tragedy.  It is farcical because it is so poorly argued.  It is tragic because of what it will do to public service broadcasting. Public service broadcasting is broadcasting which operates to serve the public, which believes that its job is to <Col N="374" /> provide a service for the public, to provide information, knowledge, entertainment and education for the public.  It works very well.</P>
    <P>One of the problems the Government discovered is that they cannot get RTE to go away by ignoring them.  In the period from 1987-89, for instance, they decided they would maintain a haughty superiority to &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; and Ministers would not go on that programme. They discovered that did not work and the public were actually interested in finding out what Ministers had to say.  They paid the price of their haughtiness in the 1989 elections.  Now they go on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; but they want to reduce the audiences so that people will not ask any more awkward questions.  That is the objective of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I will leave it to others to argue the constitutionality of many of the questions raised in the legislation because others know more about the legalities than I do. I do not think a constitutional challenge is the way to resolve this.  This ought to be resolved in the normal process of parliamentary democracy.  It should have been dealt with at a reasonable pace with reasonable time intervals between Second Stage and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is fascinating the way the Finance Bill, for instance, is dealt with where there are lobbies that are important to the Government parties involved.  The budget provisions which form the basis of the Finance Bill, are announced in January and then there is a two months hiatus while every sector, particularly of a business and financial nature, lobbies the Government.  As a result of the lobbying the Government produce a Finance Bill which often is different from the announcements made in the budget.</P>
    <P>In this case, we have a rushing through of cobbled together legislation with cobbled together amendments.  The one advantage of the amendments, changes and lack of diffuse philosophy is that it makes clear what the Bill is about.  This Bill should have been introduced and debated properly on Second Stage without dubious stratagems.  It should then <Col N="375" /> have been left until the Minister, the Government and public opinion digested the basic contents.  Then we should have had a proper and detailed Committee Stage in the Dáil without haste, and then we should have had a pause before Report Stage.  That is the way to deal with a fundamental change in the way public service broadcasting is operated. Instead we have this unseemly and quite extraordinary haste.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an tAire sa mhéid a dúirt sé faoi teilifís na Gaeltachta.  Seó é a dúirt sé:</P>
    <P>There have been some uninformed suggestions that the proposal to allow the third television channel to establish its own UHF transmission system rules out the possibility of establishing a Teilifísna Gaeltachta should a decision to that effect be taken.  This is quite incorrect.  From the technical side while UHF frequencies are in very limited supply we have, in fact, retained sufficient of them to enable such a service to be established.</P>
    <P>Bheadh sé suimiúil dá dtabharfadh an tAire dúinn pé atá faoi cé mhéad bealaí UHF atá ar fáil sa tír seo faoi na comharthaí idirnáisiúnta faoina riaraítear na ceisteanna seo, agus conas atá ceann faoi leith ar fáil.  De réir cuid mhaith den eolas atá ar fáil, tá dhá bhealach UHF tógtha suas faoi láthair le cúrsaí teilifíse.  Tá ceann amháin coimeádtha ag Telecom agus tá an ceathrú ceann le tabhairt do TV3.  Má tá bealach UHF ar fáil fós tríidir teilifís na Gaeltachta a chur ar fáil don tír &mdash; agus seo ceist theincniúil nár chóir go mbeadh aon argóint againn fuithi &mdash; bheadh sé suimiúil a fháil amach cá bhfuil sé agus conas mar atá sé ann.  Tá a lán go bhféadfaí a rá faoin mBille seo agus gur chóir a rá, os rud é go mb'fhéidir gur ócáid stairiúil é seo, gurb é seo an chéad chéim i mbáaú RTÉ, mar a bhíodh sé, agus ina athruú mar sheirbhís phoiblí.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go mbeadh sé oiriúnach, pé rud atá déanta ag RTÉ a lua, an t-éacht atá déanta acu, na rudaí móra atá curtha i gcrích acu i gcúrsaí ceoil, cúrsaí reatha, nuachta, spóirt agus drámaíochta. <Col N="376" /> D'éirigh leo ábhar machnaimh a chur ar fáil, cláir eolais a chraoladh le sinne a spreagadh le machnamh a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí a ndearnmar talamh slán díobh roimhe sin.  Chabhraigh RTÉ le cúrsaí oideachais, ní oideachas foirmeálta, ach oideachas an ghnáthdhuine maidir le cúrsaí polaitíochta, creidimh, cultúir, agus rudaí eile.  Níl a fhios agam cén Ghaeilge atá ar entertainment, ach bíonn gá le píosa spóirt sa chóras craolacháin.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfaí a lán rudaí a rá faoi RTÉ agus an dóigh ar theip orthu, ach ní hé seo an áit leis na rudaí sin a lua.  Caithfear i gcónaí an cheist a chur os comhair an Tí: má d'éirigh chomh maith sin le RTÉ le 30 bliain anuas, má tá an lucht féachana agus an lucht éisteachta chomh mór sin acu &mdash; is fíricí iad seo mar a chruthaíonn na staitisticí &mdash; cén fáth, mar sin, go bhfuil Bille mar seo os comhair an Tí?  Cén fáth go bhfuiltear ag brú an phíosa reachtaíochta seo trí dhá Theach an Oireachtais chomh tapaidh is atá sé á bhrú ag an Rialtas agus go speisialta ag an Aire seo? Is cosúil go bhfuil daoine eile sa Rialtas nach n-aontaíonn leis.  Tá scéalta á gcur timpeall ar na nuachtáin faoi Airí Rialtais ag rá nach bhfuil siad sásta nach bhfuil na Progressive Democrats sásta, agus nach bhfuil ag teastáil ón Aire ach go mbeidh an píosa reachtaíochta seo curtha tríd an Oireachtas roimh an samhradh. Níl a fhios agam cén fáth.  Níl éinne sa Rialtas, agus an tAire go speisialta, sásta éisteacht leis na ceardchumainn; níl siad sáasta éisteacht leis na heagraíochtaí proifisiúnta faoi chúrsaí fógraíochta agus margaíochta, eagraíochtaí atá ag moladh dóibh gan leanstan ar aghaidh leis an mBille seo.</P>
    <P>Níl éinne sásta éisteacht leo siúd, nó dul chun cainte leo.  Beidh an píosa reachtaíochta seo curtha trí dhá Theach an Oireachtais gan plé ceart ar an mbaol atá ann go rachaidh níos ná £10 milliún amach as an tír chun jabanna a chruthú i dtíortha agus i stáit eile, Tuaisceart Éireann, nó b'fhéidir sa Bhreatain féin.  Ní thuigim, agus ní thuigeann an tír, cén fáth go bhfuil a leithéid ar siúl.  Tá ionannas dainséarach idir an fhealsúnacht sa Bhille seo agus gnáthfhealsúnacht Fhianna Fáil. An teanga atá á labhairt agam faoi láthair, ba cheann de bhunfhiúntais Fhianna <Col N="377" /> Fáil í, mar a thug duine éigin i bhFianna Fáil uirthi, nuair a bhí ceisteanna chomhrialtais faoi chaibidil: fundamental values nó bunfhiúntais.</P>
    <P>Is í Ghaeilge ceann de na bunfhiúntais siúd agus tá sí beagnach maraithe ag Fianna Fáil.  Ní thuigim cén fáth, pé rud a mbíonn aitheantas dár gcuid féin ann, cén fáth go mbíonn Fianna Fáil amhrasach faoi, go mbíonn siad ina choinne. Chlac siad leis an Ghaeilge aus d'éirigh leo an Ghaeilge a mharú.  Tá siad ag rá anois go bhfuil siad chun jab mór dearfach a dhéanamh ar son chúrsaí craolacháin agus is é an rud is mó a thiocfaidh as ná damáiste bunúsach a bheith déanta acu don chóras craolacháin náisiúnta.  Ní thuigim cén fáth go dteastaíonn uathu a leithéid a dhéanamh ach amháin chun a bheith ag iarraidh a chinntiú nach mbeidh an brú céanna orthu bheith freagrach as a gcuid gníomharthaí, as pé rud a dhéanann siad, a bheith freagrach go poiblí as na socruithe a dhéanann siad faoin tír seo.</P>
    <P>Tá siad ag iarraidh an gnáthdhuine a mhealladh ó bheith ag éisteacht nó bheaith ag féchaint ar chúsaí nuachta agus chúrsaí reatha sa chaoi is go gcabhrófar le Fianna Fáil.  Is é an rud atá soiléir ná nach ceist fhógraíochta amháin, nach teacht isteach an chórais chraolacháin atá i gceist, mar ní hé an praghas a íocfar nó a íoctar ar fhógraíocht a shocraíonn méid an lucht féachana nó an lucht éisteachta Is é caighdeán na gclár a shorcraíonn méid an lucht éisteachta nó an lucht féachana Is é a thiocfaidh as an reachtaíocht seo ná go mbedih ar RTÉ caíghdeán na gclár a ísliú, go dtitfidh an tóin as cuid mhaith de na cláir agus an oiread sin fógraíochta caillte acu.  Ní bhedidh siad ábalta bheith ag brath ar bhreis ioncaim ó fhógraíocht má tá orthu cláir mhára a chur os ár gcomhair cosúil le Corn an Domhain, agus an lucht féachana a bhí acu.</P>
    <P>Bhí RTÉ ábalta cui mhaith fógraoichta a dhíol, agus bhí lucht féachana an-mhór ann, thart ar dhá mhilliún duine, an lucht féachana is mó dá raibh riamh acu.  Má tharlaíonn a leithéid taobh istigh de dhó nó thrí de bhlianta, agus an capping ar ioncam fógraíochta atá socraithe ag an Aire, ní bhedidh siad ábalta aon rud a dhéanamh as.  Beidh siad ceangailte leis <Col N="378" /> an ionceam atá socraithe roimh ré agus ní bhedidh ar a gcumas aon rud a ghnóthú as.</P>
    <P>Mar sin ní gá agus nil sé fírinneach bheith ag caint faoi cheisteanna teacht isteach.  Is é atá taobh thiar de seo ná RTE a bhriseadh, agus aon neamhspleáchas atá acu a bhriseadh, agus níl mórán acu mar tá siad an iomarca, faoli láthair, faoi thionchar, ní amháin an Rialtais seo, ach gach Rialtais.  Agus tá i bhfad níos mó cumhachta ag, b'fhéidir, preasrúnaí pé Rialtais atá i gceannas ná mar be chóir a bheith maidir le stáisium craolacháin. Bíonn an iomarca tionchair acu ar RTÉ agus beidh níos mó ann as seo amach.  Sin an bhunaidhm agus an bhunfhealsúnacht atá taobh thiar den reachtaíocht.</P>
    <P>Bheadh sé go breá dá gcloisfimis fíorsmaointe Sheanadóirí Fhianna Fáil faoin reachtaíocht seo. Cad a chepann siad faoi?  Conas mar a cheapann siad nach bhfuil an fhirinne sna tuairimí atá nochtaithe ag an tionscal fógraiochta, go rachaidh an chuid is mó den £12 mhilliun atá luaite ag an Aire amach as an Stát?  Cén fáth nach gceapann Seanadóirí Fhianna Fáil agus Seanadóirí na Progressive Democrats go bhfuil an t-airgead sinchun imeacht amach as an tír?  Cén fáth nach bhfuil an ceart ag na daoine proifisiúnta agus go bhfuil an ceart ag an Aire?  Ba chóir do na Seanadóirí sin an tAire a chosaint agus a mhíniú dúinn cén fáth nach bhfuil an ceart againne, mar nil sé ráite ag an Aire go bhfuil sé sásta go bhfanfaidh an t-airgead sin taobh istigh den stát.</P>
    <P>Má cheapann Seanadóirí Fhianna Fáil nach bhfuil an ceart agam nó ag an tionscal fógraíochta, be chóir doibh a mhíniú dúinn cén fáth nach bhfuil an ceart againn.  Conas a bhedih RTÉ in ann leanstan leis an gcaighdeán céanna clár a bhíodh agus atá acu má bhíonn laghdú mór ar an teacht isteach atá acu?  Conas mar is féidir le RTÉ leanstan ar aghaidh le cláir Ghaeilge aguú laghdu mór ar an teacht isteach?  Conas mar a bheidh RTÉ ábalta, má iarrtar orthu, cabhrú le bunú sheirbhís teilifíse Gaeltachta má bhíonn laghdú mór ar an teacht isteach airgid? Ní bheidh siad in ann rud ar bith mar sin <Col N="379" /> a chur le chéile mar nach mbedih an t-airgead ann chuige sin.  Agus titfidh an tóir as caighdeán chlair RTÉ.  Caithfear bheith cinnte gurb é plean an Rialtais, plean Fhianna Fáil agus na Progressive Democrats le chéile, ná cighdeán na gcláar ar RTÉ a ísliú, a ísliú ar mhaithe leo féin trí bhru a chur ar chóras craolacháin a bhfuil caighdeán ard nuachta agus cúrsaí reacht acu.

    <P>Sin an fáith go bhfuil sé náireach go bhfuil a leithféid seo de ceachtaíocht ag dul tríd and Teach seo mar gur ionsaí bunúsach é ar cheann de na comhlachtaí Stáit is mó, is éifeachtaí sa tír.  Tá a lán rudaí faoi RTÉ, dála gach eagraíochta móire, nach bhfuil chomh maith agus ba chóir, ach is eagraíocht é ar éirigh go hanmhaith leis agus gan ach fíorbheagán de theacht istech acu i gcomparáid le heagraíochtaí craolacháin eile.  Tá éirithe go maith leo ar an ábhar go bhfuil siad ábalta meon an ghnáthdhuine a thuiscine agus cláir a chur ar fáil a oireann do mheon an ghnáthdhuine, cláir a chur ar fáil a bhfuil caighdeán níos airde acu ná an chuid is mó de na cláir a thagann ón iasacht.  Agus cláir dá gcuid féin is mó a bhíonn sa Top Ten de na TAM ratings at RTE, os rud é gur cláir iad a oireann do mhuintir na tíre seo.</P>
    <P>Titfidh an tóin as sin, ní daoinghnó, ach os rud é go bhfuil sé socraithe ag an Rialtas, agus go háirithe ag an Aire seo go dtarláidh a leithéid chun cabhrú le Fianna Fáil, le cairde Fhianna Fáil, agus leis na daoine taobh thiar d'Fhianna Fáil nach n-ainmnitear, nó nach bhfeictear go rómhinic ach a bhíonn i gcónaí ag cuidiú le Fianna Fáil le linn fheachtas toghchánaíochta. Sin bunfhealsúnacht na reachtaíochta, cabrú le cairde Fhianna Fáil cos ar bhlog a dhéanamh ar RTÉ agus Fiana Fáil a shábháil ó dhianascrúdú an phobail trí chóras craolacháin den chaighdeán atá againn faoi láthair.  Ba chóir go mbeadh náire ar dhá pháirtí an Rialtais a leithéid seo a chur os ár gcomhair.</P>

      <P>I had hoped, following what Senator Manning said earlier, that <Col N="380" /> we would dbate this Bill in a calm and reasoned manner.  Though we have been calm to date, there has been much more emphasis on envective than on reason in the contributions we have heard from the benches opposite.  We have not had the shambles that they unfortunately had in the other House, but I can only describe the activities of those in Oppositon as anti-democratic.  I also regret that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Senator Manning, saw fit to divert a considerable part of his speech to an attack on the Progressive Democrats and what he sees as our pat in this Bill and in the Coalation Government.</P>
      <P>There is a supreme irony in hearing an eulogy of a former Minister from Senator Manning's party who, when they were in Government, allowed a situation to develop and continue where the law was flouted in a scandalous manner.  This was conveniently forgotten by Senator Manning.</P>
      <P>He referred to the moral ground that the Progressive Democrats may or may not have held.  No moral ground was held in that circumstance. It is just as ironic that, on one hand, he blames us, the Progressive Democrats, for making our feelings known on the initial aspects of the proposed Bill, which he now calls one of shreds and patches, yet he can only blame us again when he finds that the Minister had listened to what the Progressive Democrats, and others, have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Bill presented to us today is different from that which initial proposals signalled because there were two aspects of those proposals with which I, and many of my colleagues, were unhappy.  This applied to people on both sides of this House.  I am also glad that the views expressed were taken into account. As we all know 2FM is a popular and successful station and I am a great believer in &ldquo;if it works, don't mend it&rdquo;. I am confident that in its present form it will continue to be successful.  I must admit that I did not relish the fact that it would be a station which had only public service broadcasting, as defined by <Col N="381" /> Senator brednan Ryan.  2FM continues to be enormously successful.  It is capable of existing in its own right and taking on competition.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the initial proposals was that of proposed diversion of licence fee moneys to an independent, ailing radio station.  I was amazed to find that there were that I can only term as snide, unthinking remarks from the other side, I am not sure from whom, which seemed to indicate that someone does not realise that this proposal was not developed.  I also take grave exception to the innuendo about friends of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil being in some way &ldquo;looked after.&rdquo;  This is a rather fatuous and irrelevant remark. I found it rather illogical that the previous speaker talked, on the one hand, of advertising revenue being diverted outside the State and yet in some way that the same revenue would look after these so-called &ldquo;friends&rdquo;.  I fail to see the logic in that.</P>
    <P>I believe that those who sought licences to compete on the open market did so with full knowledge and consent.  That does not mean that we accept that they can be disadvantaged because of another station's monopoly position.  There have been references to &ldquo;levelling of the playing pitch.&rdquo;  We should not over-compensate in this regard.  I am glad the Minister has made some amendments to the Bill in relation to advertising time, the later implementation of the Bill and the linking of revenues to the consumer price index.  I hope that these changes will ameliorate the situation as envisaged by members of RTE and the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that this debate would stick to reason, rather than invective or innuendo.  The Opposition seem to be of the view that if they state an opinion it must be true but they should stick to facts.  It does not add to a healthy debate to hear every latent prejudice spun out <i>ad nuaseum</i> by one who calls himself an intellectual.  Unfortunately, that is his opinion but it is the equivalent of saying <i>l'État, C'est moi.</i></P>
    <P>I do not take personal offence at any remarks made by a member of the <Col N="382" /> Oppositon but as a member of a party which is in coalition with a larger party, I will always argue my case where I differ; I do not need to be preached at and I will agree and disagree as I see fit.  It amazes me, with some emphasis on talking about logic, that thre should be such use of illogical arguments in this House over a long period of time.  As I said, I do not like getting involved in personal attacks so I will not pick up Senator Ryan on a number of agruments he made, but the final irony was that he used two arguments to illustrate different conclusions which were totally illogical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to take up a point made by Senator Keogh in her demand for logic.  I suppose there is a lot to be said for demands for logic but sadly, or happily, politics are not about logic.  Logic has a certain bearing on it but there is much more to politics than logic.</P>
      <P>This is the most controversial Bill to come before us for a long ime.  It would be a contender for the title of the most controversial Bill ever.  Its passage through the Dáil has been difficult and painful.  It has threatened many of the assumptions which underpin the smooth functioning of the Dáil.  We had a chaotic end to the whole business last night, the authority of the Ceann Comhairle being put in jeopardy.  People have been talking this morning of the desirability of the impending recess so that people will have a chance to cool down and recover from the trauma of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been badly thought out and the Minister's attitude has been confused. This Bill is being introduced because of the Government's belief that RTE were responsible that they lost the last election.  If derived from the Minister getting into a fit of rage, rather like the Queen in &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; when she shouted &ldquo;off with their heads, off with their heads&rdquo;.  That seems to be the primary drive behind the thinking in the Bill.  There is also a final unusual way of doing RTE in &mdash; by putting a cap on them, and presumably the cap will, in due course, be pulled down over their <Col N="383" /> heads and they will be allowed to slowly but surely suffocate.  It is a change from the old methods of doing away with things but it looks as though the research and development department of the Fianna Fáil Party have been at work on new ways of sorting things out.  The Bill is also anti-enterprise and anti-the State sector.</P>
    <P>There are four or five main reasons for the Labour Party opposing the Bill.  First it will damage and impede public service broadcasting and increse the extent to which the Government will be able to control broadcasting; second it will result in serious job losses in RTE; third, it will turn the advertising market on its head, create ridiculous prices and a fall in advertising standards; fourth, it will put the final seal on any question that there might be an Irish television channel for the Gaeltacht and, indeed, for anybody else who would like to benefit from an Irish television channel.  It is likely that the Bill will be the subject of a constitutional action, and it is anti-the State sector; and finally it does nothing for the development of community radio.</P>
    <P>The Bill will increase the degree to which the Government will be able to control broadcasting, because it is an effective repeal of the Broadcasting Act, 1960 and, ultimately, in all these matters, money talks.  That is a great source of concern to the Labour Party.  Our commitment to public service broadcasting is comparable to the best not just in this country but worldwide.  We have had a long standing commitment to public service broadcasting, and that did not arise in the last few weeks when it became popular to have such commitments.  It has derived over a long period and it has been adequately articulated by many of our spokesmen, particularly Deputies Toddy O'Sullivan, Michael D. Higgins and the party leader, Michael Spring.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us will have a serious impact on restricting and ultimately, destroying the public service broadcasting function which RTE fulfil.  The various wonderful programmes which have been produced by RTE over the years will, effectively, be phased out and, <Col N="384" /> in due course, will cease to exist because there will be no money available to allow these programmes to be made.  We will see the end of programmes such as the Irish music programmes that Ciarán Mac mathuúna pioneered and developed over the years, the Thomas Davis Lecturers; the work of the RTE players&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see an end of the orchéstra and programmes such as &ldquo;Sundary Miscellany&rdquo;.  Any programme that will not generate money and an audience will simply be forced out of existence. RTE will be pulled down to levels of considerations which only relate to obtaining market share, and significant elements of market share.  The many international awards which RTE have won over the years and their excellent coverage of international events, will all fade or be put in jeopardy.  It will not be possible to consider such factors when the forces which are now being unleashed and directed at RTE, work their way through the system.  Productions like &ldquo;Strumpet City&rdquo; will not be made and many other wonderful services which RTE have provided over the years will be seriously restricted.  Ultimately, RTE will be forced to compete for an audience.</P>
      <P>In addition, there will be serious job losses in RTE.  Out of a total workforce of about 2,000, we can expect to see in the order of 350 to 400 nobs lost at the station.  There will be job losses in various other industries and services which are available to RTE and among contract staff who derive their livelihood from doing contract work for RTE.  There will also be job losses for those who provide goods and services for RTE generally. We are talking in terms of 400 job losses. This is not my estimate but that of the people who know the business in RTE. Twenty per cent, or one in every five people who work in RTE can expect not to be working there in the next year or two when the provisions of this Bill work their way through the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be job losses in the record <Col N="385" /> industry, a record industry which has benefited greatly from population music programmes in RTE.  RTE have given a great boost and encouragement to the development of the music industry over the years.  There are Senators here who know a lot more about that than I do. Senators Cassidy and Mooney know this industry inside out.  The extent to which that industry has grown and developed over the years is due to a large extent to RTE, in the way it popularised that type of music and many Irish artists.  Indeed, it ultimately laid the foundation for the success of many great pop stars from this country.  They got an introduction to the business at home, saw how the game was played and then moved on to make the grade internationally.</P>
    <P>The ceiling to be put on the amount of advertising which RTE can take will create a false and distorted market.  RTE advertising rates will increase and they will become incompetitive.  That will lead to people advertising in other countries.  This is an anti-job creation programme, moving jobs which Irish people might benefit from to organisations such as Sky, Independent Television and so on.</P>
    <P>RTE stand to lose £10 million to £20 million in advertising revenue.  People say this will work its way into various other sectors of the economy, but in reality advertising simply follows the audience. That is the basics of advertising.  Nobody wants to advertise where there is minimal circulation.  Inevitably advertising which RTE will not be able to carry because of the ceiling will go to other channels which are viewed and listened to in Ireland. That, of course, will mean a further incentive for those channels to compete in Ireland and, ultimately to take more jobs out of this country.</P>
    <P>The Bill will affect Irish language programmes on telivision and, indeed, it finally puts the tin hat on any prospect of an Irish language TV channel being estblished.  RTE certainly will not be able to do this now because they will not have the money or the resources.  I do not see anybody else doing it because, of course, there is no market for such a <Col N="386" /> channel; this type of channel can only be established if there is a commitment to public service broadcasting and if the resources are available.</P>
    <P>It is funny, odd and paradoxical in the extreme that Fianna Fáil, in the old days, if I remember rightly, put forward two great reasons for an Irish language channel &mdash; the unification of Ireland and the restoration of the national language.  We will leave aside the reunification of ireland but I cannot see how anybody can pursue the idea of the restoration of Irish without an Irish language channel to maintain what remains of the Gaeltacht. After all these years of attrition, ultimately it is being let fade away.  It is almost like what they used to say on Radio Éireann years ago, &ldquo;Is dona linn an briseadh sin&rdquo;.  Now as far as the Irish language is concerned, it seems that all Fianna Fáil are going to do is say &ldquo;lá breá&rdquo;, and that is it.  That is a great pity and a great change.  I will listen with interest to see what Fianna Fáil have to say about that.  I will listen with interest to see what the great warrior cats, the great defenders of the Irish language over the years those people who sneered, leered and jeered at people whose commitment to the Irish language was not adequate have to say.  I will listen with interest to see how they will defend what they are doiing and what their plans are to establish an Irish language television channel.  Certainly, that is the end of that. The Gaeltacht and all the rest will have to take their chances as they are bombraded with programmes transmitted by channels from outside the country.</P>
    <P>Slowly, constantly but surely this Bill will erode what remains of that culture, tradition and language.  It will be left to wither by Fianna Fáil, whose second great aim was the restoration of the Irish langauge.  It is certainly funny, paradoxical and difficult to understand that all this is happening when the Taoiseach is the Minister for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>It appears that this Bill will ultimately be the source of a constitutional case in the courts.  There seems to be reasonably good legal opinion for that, presumably unbiased legal opinion, coming from the <Col N="387" /> people who write editorials in the <i>Irish Law Tiems</i> and so on.  However, we will have to await developments.  There is a possibility of getting rid of that risk by removing the section which seems to be in conflict with the Constitution.  It will be interesting to see if this Bill will be referred by the President to the Supreme Court to ensure that it is constitutional.</P>
    <P>If there are problems, I find it difficult to udnerstand why we are in such a hurry with this Bill.  If we were to take it at face value it would be impossible to understand it but if we look for deeper political resons, then it is simple enought to provide an explanation.  We are talking about a damage limitation job by Fianna Fáil. I am pleased to see Senator Conroy, who is a wise old brid at this trade, shaking his head very wisely and sagely in agreement with me, I presume.  Sentor Cassidy is smiling as well as if he acknowledges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not have a monopoly on waffle around here but in the waffle league I would be well down the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically the Bill is a damge limitation job and that is the primary anxiety and concern.  It is also entirely anti-State sector.  RTE have been criticised for being fat cats and many other old tired slogans by the people who are opposed to the State sector and State industry. Then RTE got their act togehter and over the past four or five years increased their profits from less than £1 million in 1985 to almost £6 million in 1989.  That is excellent progress.  They have done that while increasing their total otput of television programmes by some 37 per cent and their home productions by one-third. After doing that the Minsiter descends <Col N="388" /> on them like a tonne of bricks and decides to clamp down on whatever capacity they have for public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>There are also knock-on effects from this.  It is an indication of the extent of the Minister's rage and anxiety to pursue his objective of finishing off RTE.  That is being done while serious concern is now being expressed as to the effect this Bill will have on the possibility of a new programme for national recovery.  The extent to which this Coalition Government are prepared to put the prospect of a new national recovery programme in jeopardy to obtain their objectives is an indication of how anxious they are to finish off RTE.</P>
    <P>RTE have made progress and obtained those outputs in the face fo stiff competition from overseas channels.  That competition has amplified over the last few years with a series of commercial channels coming onto the Irish market. Despite all that progress, instead of being allowed to continue to do the job, these restrictions have been placed on them.</P>
    <P>Another great function served by RTE over the years was that they provided a means by which many of the people who now have key roles in and are major contributors to local radio learned their trade.  For example, people like Caimin Jones who works with Clare FM, which is doing exceptionally well, learned the business in RTE.  The same applies to Gavin Duffy in Gael Linn and there are probably many more.  That is an important function of RTE but if this Bill is passed I do not see RTE continuing to fulfil it.</P>
    <P>My final reason for objecting to the Bill is that it does nothing for community radio.  Our party are anxious that community radio shoud be encouraged and developed.  The extent to which community radio exists is minimal.  There are grave reservations about allowing community radio develop and this is particularly disappointing.  The Crumlin radio group have tried to develop to serve Crumlin and adjacent areas and have done all the necessary background planning. They have organised finance and the people there have done courses in <Col N="389" /> broadcasting.  They are ready to go and are quite capable of going but they will not be given the go-ahead because of the impact the development of a community radio in areas such as Crumlin might have on various aspects of the advertising market.</P>
    <P>This is a badly thought out Bill.  It has suffered greatly from the fundamental drive behind it, which is one of getting at RTE,derived ultimately from people in Fianna Fáil getting into a fit of rage, which reached its zenith on the night of the counts of the last general election.  It is the old story &mdash; the Greeks were into it once upon a time &mdash; of beating up the messenger and so on.</P>

      <P>Cronies out in RTE?  I think Senator Byrne is mixed up.  In many ways I wish we had.  A function of RTE is to be objective and many of us in the Labour party &mdash; no more than those in other parties &mdash; have felt from time to time that we did not get a fair crack of the whip but we are not prepared to take that out on RTE.  Nobody at the receiving end of press coverage is always satisfied.  My attitude is that the press have a job to do and so be it; let them do it.  I have no wish to take on the job, while acting as a politician, of imaginary editor of some newspaper, radio programme or news report.  That is for journalists who invariably cannot always please everybody, indeed, probably most of the time will not be able to please everybody.  That is their function.  If they please everybody basically, they will only be writing about good weather.  I reject entirely the implications in the suggestion from Senator Byrne that we have cronies in RTE and the implication that their behaviour does not conform to the highest professional standards.</P>

These things are above and beyond immediate party political considerations.  We are talking of a very important aspect of Irish life, fundamental to freedom in this country, and I do not think that the kind of carry-on we are seeing here over the last month in the Oireachtas is anything other than reprehensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first, to congratulate the Minister for having the courage to do his duty and do what was necessary in bringing in a Broadcasting Bill, a very much overdue Bill, in a situation which had gone almost totally out of control.  The Minister is also to be congratulated in ending the monopoly and ensuring freedom of television and greater freedom of the radio waves.  I find the hysteria which has greeted this Bill extraordinary, especially from the far side of the House.  I would have thought <Col N="391" /> they would have been joining us in rejoicing at the fact that, compared with other countries, we were freeing the radio waves, freeing the television waves. We have seen in eastern Europe the complete monopoly of television and broadcasting and we have seen it in other countries in western Europe.  It was high time we had this Bill brought before the House.  It is necessary legislation and the Minister is to be congratulated on it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Upton that it is a very important matter and should be discussed in a manner devoid of the sort of hysteria which we have witnessed today and which, I believe, has also occurred in the other House.  These are very important matters which we should be discussing in detail.  In many ways I also agree with Senator Upton that you have to take what comes in relation to newspaper and media reports.  You may feel they are unkind, unjust or untrue but you have to take the rough with the smooth.  I am not one of those who necessarily agrees that the television or media have been anti this party.  If they have been, it has certainly been remarkable for how little effect they have had in that over 60 years we have still been the largest party in the State with the largest number of voters, election after election, voting for this party.</P>
      <P>I am not altogether convinced of that; but, listening to what has happened today, listening to normally sensible people like the Leader of the Opposition, in this House like the Leader of the Labour Party on the opposite side, reading some of the comments that were made in the other House, one begins to wonder &mdash; particularly as I listened to Senator Ryan &mdash; if there was a degree of bias, because it is very hard to explain the utter and complete hysteria which seems to have gripped particularly some sections of the Opposition since this very sensible, reasonable Bill was brought in. It seems to suggest that perhaps there is some degree of preference for certain parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think they are to some extent mistaken <Col N="392" /> in that.  RTE in their efforts to be fair have endeavoured, for example, on political programmes to see that there is one member from each party, a very reasonable and fair measure.  I say that despite the fact that it means that inevitably we will have in this party &mdash; the largest party, often larger than the other parties put together &mdash; only one speaker on a given programme and all the other parties, even if they only have a matter of tens of thousands of votes or only two or three seats or even no seats in the Dáil or Seanad, have equal representation, so that in a panel discussion you can have one Fianna Fáil representative and four, five or six from other parties.  I still think it is the fair and right thing to do, but there appears to be an astonishing degree of sensitivity &mdash; let us put it no more than that &mdash; among certain speakers, at any rate, from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to me that there is a degree of uneasiness, that there is a guilty conscience somewhere lurking about the place, because while they might have had their criticisms of this Bill they would have been on a more sensible and rational basis.  Instead we have heard the sort of comments where even the very reasonable Leader of the Opposition went as far as saying that any attack on RTE was an attack on us all.  I am sure in a more sensible, rational moment he would not have made such a sweeping statement.  I will not deal with the many hysterical comments of Sentor Ryan, but on a more sensible basis even in the case of Senator Upton one finds some of his comments surprising.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting has transformed our lives.  Our parents will talk of the sort of radios which they had back in the twenties and the thirties.  Of course, there is tremendous emotional element to it, particularly perhaps in relation to the football and Gaelic hurling matches of the time, when people would often gather together around a neighbour's radio.  It was a very beneficial and good influence. Similarly, television in the post-war years has had an enormous impact, and I think basically a very beneficial impact.  Now we are moving on into yet a new era, with <Col N="393" /> satellite television as part of the total revolution in general communications in entertainment and in news media gathering, the instant report often coming from the place where some serious or entertaining event is happening.  Millions of us all over the world have enjoyed the World Cup during this last few weeks, a totally revolutionary thing which 20 or 30 years ago was absolutely inconceivable.</P>
    <P>Television is a power for a tremendous amount of entertainment, a power for joy and also, of course, a power for good; and many of the programmes which one sees on the screen are informative, useful and so on.  Communications, of course, can equally well be a power for evil.  We have all seen the television documentaries of the Hitler era and the use that was made by Hitler and Goebbels of communications of that time, communications which, may I add, were rigidly State-controlled by a State monopoly.</P>
    <P>I would have imagined that most democrats would have very much supported the idea that there should be democracy and freedom on the airwaves rather than a monopoly, no matter how excellent that monopoly may be.  Let us be clear about this, Radio Telefís Éireann is probably among the very best radio and television services in the world.  I, as indeed have many other Senators, have travelled throughout many parts of this globe and seen many different television services.  There is no doubt that our own service in Ireland is absolutely superb technically and in the quality of its presentation. We should be very proud indeed of these achievements.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that we have to just leave it like that, rigid, and that it has to stay for all time as a single State monopoly.  There must be altenatives, there should be alternatives, and I have no doubt that within those alternatives Radio Telefís Éireann will compete very successfully and effectively.  We are in a new era.  Any one of us now with satellite dishes or whatever can have television from many channels.  That is the reality <Col N="394" /> of it.  We have got to face up to it on a commerical intenational basis and also look at the entire business of advertising. It is changing before our eyes.  Within a matter of another six, 12 or 18 months there will be further enormous changes in the distribution of advertising between the various television channels.  Before we get too carried away with that, however, one might just mention that advertising is tending to go back towards the newspapers.  The major advertisers are finding that in many instances they get a greater return for their pound, dollar or whatever they spend by using newspaper advertising than by television advertising. It is not just perhaps as simplistic as some people might imagine.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear some of the begruding statements &mdash; indeed almost scandalous statements &mdash; that were made by Senator Ryan.  It is a great pity.  Perhaps in the heat of the moment he was saying them; but it is one of the things that holds this country back, this feeling that anyone who makes any sort of success is going to be traduced no matter how good his efforts ae instead of saying, is it not great that these developments are taking place in whatever field they may be?</P>
    <P>It is excellent that this Government are making it very clear that they have, as a major plank in their policy &mdash; and that we have a Minister who has the courage and determination to carry it through &mdash; an alternative to the State broadcasting monopoly.  I am delighted to see this occurring.  It is long overdue and it is something we in this country should be very glad of.  The State monopolies which have existed elsewhere do those countries little credit.  These are not necessarily just the totalitarian countries or Eastern European countries; they are also some of the so-called democracies.  You have an unseemly scramble as one Government succeeds another to totally change the output, the newscasts, etc. of the television services.  We, thank goodness, have never had that here.  The fact that we will now have an alternative further diminishes any possibility of that.  It was a bad situation and one which I would have thought most members of the <Col N="395" /> Opposition, when they think about it, would basically tend to agree with it.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1988 opened up the whole broadcasting sector.  We could spend some time on this but I would like to make a comment of congratulation on the independent stations.  It was high time that some sort of reasonable balance should exist.  You should not have a ludicrous and very inappropriate situation of having pirate broadcasting stations.  A very bad precedent was being set.  It went on for far too long.  We on this side had some responsibility for not stepping on it much earlier.  We have heard much talk from the Opposition and the Coalition and so on, but the reality is that we had a Government for many years who just did nothing about the problem &mdash; deplored it occasionally but did nothing. I am delighted that we have a Minister who had the determination and courage to come into this Parliament and do something about it and to bear the storm of hysterical protest that has come around his head for doing his duty.  I am sure in years to come people will wonder at the hysteria and will probably say: &ldquo;Well, thank goodness there was a Minister there who had the courage to carry this very necessary Bill through.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some of the hysteria has circled around the whole question of advertising.  As I said in regard to advertising, the whole market is changing anyway.  Let us get this into a little bit of reality, let us look at the facts rather than the fallacies or the fantasies which we are being regaled with.  The suggestion is that RTE will have 7.5 per cent of total daily programmes or five minutes in the hour &mdash; that is one minute in every 12 for advertising. Quite honestly, if I have a criticism of the Minister, I think that that is just a little too generous.  One of the disadvantages of television is these constant interruptions of advertising.  However, the Minister is being generous in giving that one minute in every 12.</P>
    <P>Secondly, people are talking about what RTE will or will not be able to do. We, the citizens of this country, pay a <Col N="396" /> licence fee to be allowed watch television. I happen to think that that is a most undemocratic and bad situation. However, it exists.  All of that money at present has been going to the broadcasting and television services.  It amounts to something in the region of £47 to £48 million per annum.  That is a pretty substantial sum, in round figures approximately £50 million per annum. The Minister is now proposing to allow RTE to earn an equal sum on advertising.</P>
    <P>Again, if I have a slight criticism of this Bill, when the hysteria is taken aside, it is, quite frankly, to be giving a State service £50 million, whether you like it or not, out of people's pockets simply to be allowed watch something I feel should be a constitutional right to view anyway. On top of that you are assigning another £50 million out of advertising revenues. We are talking of a sum of £100,000,000 a year for a State with a population of three million.  I must say I just wonder at times when I listen to that.  There are many television stations throughout the world who would be very happy to be given £100 million per year or to be given £33 per citizen in their countries.  It is total hysteria that we have heard in relation to that.</P>
    <P>On a slightly more technical matter, some of the speakers have referred to Teilifís na Galetachta and the possibility or otherwise of such a service.  That is a very interesting and very important topic in itself.  Colleagues such as Senator Ó Foighil have given great thought to this, discussed it in great detail and made many very important comments in the Seanad. So also has Senator Ó Cuív.  We had a debate and discussion here in the Seanad. There are various arguments for and against.  I have a slight hesitation on the idea that there should be one channel reserved as a Gaeltacht channel.  I am very concerned.  I think Sean Phadráig Ó Conaire would have reservations at times at this whole idea that because you are a Gaelic speaker you have these Gaeltachts &mdash; the sort of attitude and mentality that has grown up over the last 70 years in this State in relation to the Gaeltacht.  Many Irish people, I think, at times do not <Col N="397" /> realise that Irish is, after all, one of the three classical languages of Europe.  They are of course, Latin, Greek and Gaelic. But if Irish is to have its true place it must be an integrated living part of all our daily lives and all our communications and not just be shunted off to a station which would be just purely a Gaelic station.</P>
    <P>But there are arguments on the opposite side.  Let us just look at them and assume it is a good thing and that the best way of dealing with Gaelic on television would be to have a sole channel. The practical fact, of course, is that that is still very much open.  I could not understand my good colleague, Senator Upton.  He is a very able and intelligent man, but I am sure he just did not look at the facts.  The simple situation is that in this country, available for television, we have basically two high frequency potentials &mdash; one is very high frequency, VHF, which is taken up at present by Radio Telefís Éireann, and the other is ultra high frequency, UHF.  The UHF channels are very scarce.  We are fortunate in that we have four such channels allocated to this State.  RTE is using, in addition to VHF, part of one of the UHF channels.  The second UHF channel will go to TV3.  That leaves a third network which could, if it were necessary and thought best, be devoted either in part or entirely to Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  From a technical point of view it is absolutely available and it still leaves a fourth UHF channel available to use.  Some people mentioned deflector systems.  As I understand it, there are various technical difficulties there.</P>
    <P>All in all, we have a Bill which was overdue, a Bill which is sensible, a Bill I suppose &mdash; and maybe we were at fault here &mdash; we should have realised that some people would naturally attack on the basis that people have had a monopoly for many years, have been used to a certain way for many years and it is inevitable perhaps that they should have some objection to a change.  Then there are people who just on principle are against change.  But the degree of absolutely nonsensical hysteria which has gripped certain sections of the Opposition is just <Col N="398" /> quite extraordinary.  I am very glad that this Bill is going through.  I am glad to see it going through now.  If ever a Bill was overdue in relation to broadcasting, this Bill is such and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>Is le díomá a éirím anseo inniu chun mo chuid cainte a dhéanamh i dtaobh an Bhille seo atá os ár gcomhair. Ba mhaith liom, i dtosach báire, s mhíniú don Aire atá i láthair, agus a bhfuil fáilte roimhe, nach le haon dímheas air féin ná ar dhuine ar bith sa Teach seo nó sa Teach eile, a bhfuilim chun mo chuid cainte uilig a dhéanamh, trí Ghaeilge.  Is trua liom nach bhfuil an deis ag an Aire agus ag daoine mar é, an méid atá le rá agamsa a thuiscint go huile is go hiomlán toisc nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil acu. Níl aon locht agamsa orthu mar gheall air sin, ná ar dhuine ar bith nach bhfuil saoráid cainte aici nó aige i nGaeilge.  Ar an dtaobh eile de, ní dóigh liom go mba chóir go mbeadh locht á fháil ormsa, ag an Aire ná ag duine ar bith, eile sa Teach, ar chúis go labhróinn i nGaeilge ar ábhar atá chomh tábhachtach sin don tír.  Is cúis mhór bróin dom an neamhshuim atá á dhéanamh den Ghaeilge i gceist chumarsáide atá chomh tábhachtach sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is iomaí uair a chuala mé, ó theacht isteach sa Seanad dom, gur ag cur mo chuid ama amú atáim, a bheith ag labhairt i nGeilge.  Deir go leor daoine go bhfuil an-mheas acu ar a mbíonn le rá agam, ach fós féin, is ceist chumarsáide atá faoi chaibidil againn anseo agus is é is bunbhrí le cumarsáid ná comhthuiscint. Ní foláir ná go mbeadh tusa, a Chathaoirligh, an tAire agus mo chomhbhádóirí in ann mé a thuiscint; is mithid do lucht an Phreasa a bheith in ann mé a thuiscint freisin.  Ní cóir go n-aireoinn mar dhuine atá ag teacht isteach ón bhfuacht, mar a déarfá, agus nuair a thagaim i láthair anseo, go mbeifí ag rá fúm: &ldquo;Éist leis féin arís lena chuid Gaeilge&rdquo;.  Ní maith liom go mbeadh an cineál sin clú orm ach níl neart agam air agus tá súil agam go bhfuil sé sin intuigthe.  Ba bhreá liomsa a bheith thíos ag Seomra na Gaeilge a bhéas á oscailt go hoifigiúil ag an Taoiseach.  ag <Col N="399" /> 4.30 p.m. Bhí an-bhaint agam le soláthar na seirbhíse seo.</P>
    <P>Ag trácht arís dom ar an mBille is den riachtanas é go mbeadh deis chumarsáide againn, is cuma an i mBéarla nó i nGaeilge í; ní mór do dhaoine a gcearta cumarsáide a bhaint amach.  Cuireann sé ionadh orm an Seanadóir Conroy a chlos ag rá go bhfuil an tseirbhís is fearr ar domhan againn in RTE.  Más amhlaidh an scéal, cad chuige ár n-iarrachtaí chun é a dhíbhunú?</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir freisin, agus é ag labhairt mar shaoránach a dhíolann as a cheadúnas teilifíse, go mbíonn méid áirithe mífhoighde air nuair a bhíonn air breathnú ar fhógraíocht: deir sé go gcuireann siad isteach ar rithim a chuid smaointe agus é ag breathnú ar chlár.  Ba mhaith liom áfach, an cheist seo a chur ar an Seanadóor: &ldquo;An bhfuil cead againne breathnú ar chláir teilifíse inár dteanga féin?&rdquo; Cá bhfuil siad? Más stáisiún teilifíse náisiúnta é, cad chuige nach ndéantar freastal orainne?  An ndéantar éagóir orainn toisc go bhfuilimid ar na gclaíocha, toisc gur mionlach sinn?  Ba chóir, mar sin, go mbeadh tuiscint ghineáralta ann ar na fadhbanna móra cultúrtha agus cumarsáide atá ag RTE maidir le aidhmeanna an Stáit seo a chomhlíonadh.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Conroy rud eile a chuir iontas mór orm.  Dúirt sé nach bhfaca sé Bille ariamh a bhí chomh ciallmhar agus chomh reasúnta leis an mBille seo.  B'shin iad na focail a d'usáid sé: &ldquo;sensible and reasonable&rdquo;.  Ní mór, dá réir sin, go bhfuil muintir uilig na tíre, seachas cúpla duine sa Rialtas, tar éis dul le fán.  Nach bhfuil an tír uilig ag rá nach bhfuil sé ciallmhar, nó reasúnta?  Nach shin é is bunús leis an raic agus leis an rírá atá tar éis a bheith sa Teach eile le seachtain nó le coicís anuas?  Nach iontach fós é go mbeadh an Seanadóir den tuairim go bhfuil sé réasúnta agus go bhfuil sé ciallmhar?  D'úsáid sé téarmaíocht eile a chuir iontas orm.  Is é a dúirt sé ná &ldquo;It has transformed the lives of the people.  It has transformed our lives&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Tá an ceart ag an Seanadóir nuair a deir sé go bhfuil athrú bunúsch déanta <Col N="400" /> ag RTE ar shaol, ar chultúr agus ar mheon mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Is cinnte go bhfuil &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; déanta aige ach ní chun maitheas na tíre seo a dearnadh é, ach a mhalairt.  Míneoidh mé ag dul ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Conroy go mb'fhéidir go mbeadh UHF le fáil.  Ní fear teicneolaíochta mé ach de réir mar a thuigimse an scéal, níl ann ach trí bhealach do UHF faoi láthair; ceann ag RTE, ceann curtha in áireamh do RTE3&mdash;má bhíonn sé riamh ann, agus ní chreidim go mbeidh &mdash; agus tá an tríú ceann tógtha ag Telecom Éireann.  Muna bhfuil an scéal amhlaidh, ba bhreá liom é sin a chlos ón Aire.  Má tá siad tógtha, mar a deirim, cá bhfuil na cinn eile?  Is é atá á rá aige i mbeagán focal ná nach bhfuil a leithéid ann, agus táimse ag rá an rud céanna.</P>
    <P>Labhair mé ar an ábhar seo cheana i dtaobh teilifís na Gaeltchta, agus dearbhaím arís go bhfuil an tairne deiridh á chur ag an Rialtas i gcónra na Gaeltachta, leis an mBille seo, agus go mbeidh an tórramh ann.  Ní hé atá i gceist agam ná go bhfuil bás leis an nGaeilge; tórramh an Gheilge labhartha sa Ghaeltacht atá tagtha chugainn agus is é an Bille seo atá á thionlacan.  Mura bhfuil sé sin amhlaidh níor chuala mé éinne anseo á chrúthú chun mo shástachta.</P>
    <P>Nuair a dhearcaim ar an mBille seo mar Theachta Gaeltcha tugaim faoi deara gurb iontach go deo an cineál íomhá atá ag an mBille, ag an teilifís agus ag RTE nuair atáthar dá scrúdú trí shúile muintir na príomh-cathrach.  Níor airigh mé ná níor chuala mé fós duine ar bith de cheachtar den dá Theach ag tabhairt léargais nó míniú simplí ar an dtionchar a bheas ag an mBille seo ar dhaoine nach de bhunadh Bhaile Atha Cliath iad.  Tá Seanadóirí agus Teachtaí dála againn anseo nach as Baile Atha Cliath dóibh ach shílfeá le bheith ag éisteacht leis an gcaint anseo nach raibh sé i gceist aird a thabhairt ach ar smaointe a éiríonn ón bpríomh-chathair.  Is cinnte go bhfuil an tromlach de dhaonra na tíre seo lonnaithe sa phríomh-chathair agus go bhfuil ceantair an iarthair bánaithe de thoradh an pholasaí <Col N="401" /> díláru; lárú i gcathair Bhaile Atha Cliath atá ann dá dheasca.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom díriú ar na fadhbanna millteacha atá á gcruthú ag an mBille seo do mhuintir na tuaithe, do mhuintir an iarthair, ach go háirithe, agus thairis sin, do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Déantar anchuid cainte na laethanta seo faoi réigiúnú, agus i dtaobh Airí a ainmniú do na réigiúin.  Má bhreathnaítear ar chomhdhéanamh RTE, feictear go bhfuil córas réigiúnaithe bunaithe ann cheana féin.  Is iad na réigiúin atá i gceist ná Dún Dealgan Sligeach-Dún na nGall, Gaillimh, Luimneach, Ciarraí-Corcaigh agus Port Láirge.  Sin mar a thuigimse le réigiúin. Bhí sé i gceist i gcónaí go dtabharfdh RTE cothrom na Féinne do na réigiúin agus gné rí-thábhachtach ab ea é seo ar ndóigh.  Bhí an-dóchas ag Iodáileach, Pascali, go dtiocfadh ré an réigiúnachais lenár linn agus go dtárlódh sé go lánsásúil, go slachtmhar agus go críochnúil agus go mbedh an uile rud ag eascair as na réigiuin agus ag dul ar ais chuig na mórchathracha.</P>
    <P>Cén tionchar a bheas ag an mBille seo? Sa chéad áit, i gcás 2FM, a bhí ag freastal ar an tír iomlán mar stáisiún popamhráin, bhí sé i gceist go ndénfaí athruithe air ionas nach mbeadh meas ná éileamh air. Tá a fhios againn uilig gur tháinig athrú intinne ar an Aire sa cheist seo agus gur fhág sé gan athrú é.  Ba dheas agus ba mhaith an toradh é sin.  Táimse, áfach, ag breathnú siar agus as sin ó Ghaillimh soir go Baile Átha Cliath agus tabharfaidh mé samplaí beaga tábhachtacha don Teach chun mo phointí a léiriú.</P>
    <P>Tagraím do chlár álainn, iontach, dúchasach i mBéarla, dár teideal &ldquo;Looking West&rdquo; arna chur i láthair ag Jim Fahy. Bhí an-mheas ag muintir an iarthair ar an gclár seo agus bhí éisteacht leathan aige. Cuireadh deireadh le &ldquo;Looking West&rdquo; de bharr bru a tháinig ón taobh seo tíre i dtaobh rud éigin eile &mdash; and we all start looking east again.  Dá gcuirfinn ceist ar dhuine ar bith sa Teach seo faoi chlár Jim Fahy, &ldquo;Looking West&rdquo; chun a fháil amach an raibh meas acu air, agus dá bhfaighin freagra diúltach ar mo cheist, dhéarfainn leis an duine úd nár thuig sáe dada i dtaobh cumarsáide.  Clár dúchasach <Col N="402" /> a bhí againn ansin do mhuintir an iarthair ach nuair a tháinig brú ó RTE faoi rudaí eile, fuair &ldquo;Looking West&rdquo; an pileár.  Ba é an clár ab fhearr é agus an clár a n-éisteodh formhór de ghnáthmhuintir na tuaithe leis.</P>
    <P>Nílim anseo inniu chun cur leis na rudaí go léir atá á rá ag éinne faoin mBille seo ach is é an locht is mó atá agamsa air ná go bhfuil sé ag imeacht ón dúchas i gcónaí.  It is not really of the soil.  Tá sé ag imeacht ón duchas agus ag tabhairt aghaidh ar Bhaile Atha Cliath, agus táimid sáite arís sa &ldquo;trap&rdquo; céanna ina rabhamar blianta ó shin.</P>
    <P>Bhí clár breá dhátheangach ar RTE&mdash;&ldquo;Sunil Thart&rdquo; le Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill. Arís bhí se thar cion, agus dhátheangach. Bhí an-suim ag daoine ann agus bhí sé ag líonadh bearna an-mhór, ach arís tá sceal faighte ag an Nuala céanna nach mbeidh &ldquo;Sunil Thart&rdquo; ann níos mó &mdash; tá deireadh leis.  Ceann eile, &ldquo;Iris&rdquo;.  Táimid ag caint faoi na rudaí a dhéantar, agus tá in ann a bheith á dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge ar RTE mar atá sé anois.  Is é an fáth go bhfuilim ag déanamh an phointe seo ná, más mar sin atá an scéal anois, cén chaoi a mbeidh sé mura mbíonn teilifís Ghaeltachta ann.  Tá a fhios ag chuile dhuine sa Teach seo céard a bhí ar bun ag &ldquo;Iris&rdquo; agus céard é an meas a bhí ag daoine air mar chuir siad cláir shuimiúla os comhair an phobail.  Tá scáal faighte ag an té a bhí ag cur an chláir sin i láthair, Máiréad Ní Nuadháin, nach mbeidh si ann níos mó i Meán Fómhair. Mar sin, tá &ldquo;Looking West&rdquo; imithe, tá &ldquo;Iris&rdquo; imithe agus fós táimid ag caint faoi Bhille a chur tríd an Teach seo atá ag dul a chur tairne eile i gcónra na Gaeilge.  Tá mé ag caint go firinneach faoin meon atá taobh thiar den Bhille seo i leith na réigiun.  Nior chuala mé fós sa Teach seo duine ar bith ó cheachtar den dá thaobh ag caint faoin chur isteach agus an dochar atá á dhéanamh faoi láthair, agus a éireoidh níos measa, ag an mBille seo.  Ag deireadh thiar, dá olcas an chaoi atá orainn, ní bheidh an dé féin fanta ionainn nuair a bheidh an Bille seo ag feidhmiú.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin pointe eile a bhaineann leis sin a mhíniú don Teach, cé chomh buailte is atáimid maidir leis an <Col N="403" /> mBille seo, ó thaobh na réigiún de.  Mar shampla, an bhliain seo caite chaith lucht gnó san iarthar, i nGaillimh, Sligeach agus Dún na nGall, idir £250,000 agus £300,000 ar fhógraíocht ar an meáin chumarsáide, ar an raidió agus ar an teilifís. B'fhéidir go n-abródh daoine gur beag an tsuim airgid é £300,000 sa bhuiséad uilig agus sa teacht isteach uilig atá le fáil, ó thaobh fógraiochta de, is é sin ag an stáisiún go léir.  Is é mo bharúil anois, agus mo thuiscint ar an scéal, go bhfuil deireadh leis sin, nó, mura bhfuil deireadh leis, go mbeidh deireadh leis nuair a bheidh an Bille seo dulta tríd agus achtaithe.  Bhí rud ann ar a dtugtaí ráta áitiúil, nó local rate, agus, de réir RTE, bhi 5,000 fógra ar Raidió 1 agus 2 agus ar theilifís.  B'iontach an t-éacht é sin, dar liomsa, ag na daoine in RTE an cineál sin gnó a chur ar fáil don stáisiún i mBaile Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>Cuirimis sa chomhthéeacs ceart an eagraíiocht a bhíi ag déeanamh sin.  Bhí dhá aidhm ann, agus bhí an dá aidhm á gcomhlíonadh acu i gceart, go huile agus go hiomlán.  Bhí teacht isteach RTE á mhéadú, ar thaobh amháin, rud a bhí ceart agus cóir, rud a bhí le moladh, ach, ní ba thábhachtaí ná sin fós, bhí sé ag tabhairt deise don fhear nó don bhean nó do lucht gnó in iarthar na tíre iarracht a dhéanamh bheith féiniúlach in áit a mbeadh sé deacair bheith amhlaidh.  Dar ndóigh, bhí cúnamh mór le fáil acu ó RTE de bharr go raibh an ráta áitiúil i gceist.  Mar shampla, tuigeann sibh go léir an ráta áitiúil a bhí ann, £1.20 le haghaidh spota ar an raidió agus an ráta náisiúnta thart ar £6 no £7.  Ach anois, céard a tharloidh?  Tá cuing chomb mór agus chomh daingean ag an mBille seo ar fhógraíocht nach mbeidh an lucht gnó san iarthar, atá ag iarraidh seirbhíse, gnó, cumarsáide agus slí maireachtála a chur ar fáil dóibh féin agus do na mílte duine atá fanta fós san iarthar, in ann feasta é seo a chur ag obair.  Tá siad laghdaithe go mór ó thaobh ama de, agus tá sé ráite ag RTE nach mbeidh dóthain airgid le fáil acu ar fhógraíocht.  Níl dóthain acu mar atá sé.  Táthar a rá, os rud é nach mbeidh dóthain le fáil acu nach bhfuil <Col N="404" /> seans faoin spéir go mbeidh an ráta áitiúil ag fear an iarthair níos mó.  Sin an rud atá siad ag rá.  B'fhéidir nach gcreideann sibh iad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Cén fáth, mar sin, go bhfuil tusa ag rá liomsa go bhfaighidh mé freagra.  Tá sé socraithe agaibh é a chur tríd.  Nior thug sibh am dúinn agus nílim ag dul a labhairt faoi seo, a bheag nó a mhór.  Níl aon mhaith bheith ag labhairt faoi, ach os rud é go bhfuil sé ardaithe agaibh anois labhróidh mé air go dtí maidin amárach le tusa a choinneáil ciúin agus tostach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí me ar theann mo dhíchill le míniú a thabhairt don Teach seo cé chomh dona, buailte is atá muintir an iarthair de dheasca an Bhille seo atá os ár gcomhair. B'fhéidir go ndéarfaidh daoine liomsa, &ldquo;bheul, tá tú an-pharóisteach, tá tú ag smaoineamh agus ag caint faoin áit thiar&rdquo;.  Nílim mar sin.  Ach caithfidh mé labhairt ar rud a fheicimse atá ag déanamh dochair d'áit amháin sa tír, áit a bhí i gceart agus a bhí gan dochar go dtí gur tháinig an Bille seo isteach.  Deirtear linn go raibh na five-second slides seo le dul <Col N="405" /> isteach freisin ar ráta speisialta ar Network 2.  Ni bheidh sé sin ann níos mó. Cén chaoi, mar sin, a bhféadfadh duine ar bith a rá liomsa nach bhfuil an Bille seo chun dochar a dhéanamh?  Conas a d'fhéadfadh an Seanadóir Conroy a rá liomsa anseo go bhfuil sé ciallmhar agus réasúnta?  Taímse ag rá leis an Senadóir go bhfuil sé as bealach ar fad.  A fhaid is a bhaineann sé le muintir an iarthair, níl sé ciallmhar ná reasúnta.  Táimid ag mileadh acmhainn a bhí againn chun sinn féin a choimeád beo agus os comhair an tsaoil agus os comhair mhuintir na hÉireann.  Is eol dom, mar shampla, go mbíodh oiread is milliún duine ag breathnú ar an fhógraíocht a bhí á dhéanamh ón iarthar; 850,000 ag éisteacht leis an raidió, agus suas le milliún ag breathnú ar theilifís.  Beidh deireadh leis an ngné seo ar fad.  Ar dearnadh aon staidéar nó taighde ar an gceist seo?  An ligfear le sruth é gan smaoineamh ar bith ar an toradh a bheas leis?</P>
    <P>Cé aige anois a bheidh an fhógraíocht ar RTE?  Is ag na bainc, na &ldquo;Building Societies&rdquo;, lucht Superquinn agus Dunnes a bheidh sé.</P>

      <P>Sin iad na dreamanna anois a mbeidh an cumhacht ar fhógraíocht na tíre seo.  Is é mo phríomhshuim sa Bhille seo ná go bhfuil cosmhuintir na tíre, go háirithe in iarthar na hÉireann, fágtha ar leataobh. Bhíodh ráta áitiúil acu agus anois ní bheidh deis ná acmhainn acu an caillteanas a bheas anuas orthu de thoradh na ciorruithe seo, a chúiteamh. Má cheapann an Senadóir Conroy go bhfuil sé sin ciallmhar agus réasunta, ní <Col N="406" /> fhéadfainn aontú leis a bheag nó a mhór sa cheist sin.</P>
      <P>Ní bheidh an tionchar cinniúnach ag an mBille ar mhuintir na gcathrach; tig leo a lwas féin a chosaint.  Má chuidíonn an Bille seo, áfach, chun cosmhuintir na tíre a lagú, tá sé de dhualgas orainn é sin a chur in iúl don Aire agus iarracht a dhéanamh aon bhaol don mhuintir seo a choimeád uathu.  Is cosúil nach bhfuiltear chun an deis sin a thabhairt dúinn agus go bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Teach cloí leis an mBille sa riocht inar glacadh leis aréir. Más amhlaidh, fógraim nach bhfuil deireadh ráite agus neartaionn sé an cás atá á dhéanamh agam ar son Raidió na Gaeltachta agus teilifís na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Ag trácht i dtús báire ar Raidió na Gaeltachta, cén barántas nó cen cinnteacht atá againn nach gcuirfear isteach ar an tseirbhís úd amach anseo?  Níl aon chinnteacht againn ina thaobh ach má leantar leis na nósmhaireacht atá le sonrú anseo, is cinnte, má bhíonn ganntanas airgid ann, gurb iad na réigiúin is mó a bheas ag fulaingt.  Bainfear seirbhisí as na réigiúin ar mhaithe le hiad a lonnú i mBaile Átha Cliath agus déanfar neamart de an hiarrachtaí atá déanta go dtí seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chaith mé fein blianta fada ar chomhairle Raidió na Gaeltachta agus tá dlúthuisicint agam ar na ffadhbanna, idir airgeadais agus eile, a bhí ag an stáisiún agus atá fós acu.  Is iomaí cruinniú a chaith mé fein agus mo chomhleacaithe ag plé na ceiste seo.  Dhéanamar impí, achrann, troid agus éileamh ar RTE chun go gcuirfidís airgead ar fáil do Raidió na Gaeltachta lena fheabhsú, lena dhaingniú, lena fhorbairt.  Nuair a bhí brabús á dhéanamh ag RTE, ba throid in aghaidh an easa a bhí againn; bhímis ag iarraidh bheith nua-aimseartha le stiúideonna agus gléasanna eile.  Ba throid mhór é i gcónaí, geallúint a fháil ó RTE go mbeadh an cúpla pingin ar fáil le díol astu.  Cad a tharlóidh anois má éirionn ganntanas airgid in RTE?  Dearbhaím go dtarlóidh an rud céanna do Raidió na Gaeltachta agus a tharla do &ldquo;Looking West&rdquo; agus do na cláir eile a luaigh mé tamall ó shin.  Fágfar ar an ngannchuid iad mar go bhfuil leas an Bhille seo dírithe <Col N="407" /> go huile agus go hiomlán ar Bhaile Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>Tá Bille ag gabháil tríd an Dáil gan caint inti faoin nGaeltacht, faoi Raidió na Gaeltachta ná faoi rud ar bith eile a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht.  Is aisteach liom, ar an ábhar sin, go mbeadh raidió áitiúil faoi chaibidil againn sa Bhille seo nuair is é Raidió na Gaeltachta an t-eiseamlár is fearr de raidió áitiúil atá againn sa tír seo.  Má leantar leis an dearcadh diúltach seo i leith raidió agus teilifís na Gaeltachta, ní bhuanófar Raidió na Gaeltachta ach déanfar é a nascadh isteach cosúil le 2FM nó Raidió 2.  Ní thiocfaidh fás ná forás air.  Ní bheidh an sárchaighdeán craolacháin aige murach é a bheith neamhspleách, agus ag freastal gan chuidiú ar phobal na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Sin a bhí ann ó thaobh Raidió na Gaeltachta de, sin a bhí ann nuair a bhí an raidió sin á chur ar bun.  Tuigeadh go maith nach bhféadfadh Raidió na Gaeltachta a bheith foirfe gan bheith neamhspleách, agus tugdh cead a chinn dóibh. D'éirigh that cionn leo mar bhí siad neamhspleách, bhí siad leo féin.  Ach cá bhfios dúinn anois.  Níl aon chinnteacht ann go bhfágfar sa riocht céanna iad a bhfuil siad ann faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Má bhíonn gearradh siar ann de dheasca an Bhille seo, bí cinnte de nach mbeidh aon phingin bhreise le fáil ag Raidió na Gaeltachta le forbairt a dhéanamh, faoi mar atá forbairt á déanamh ar na meáin chumarsáide eile agus na stáisiúin raidio eile.  Mar sin, caithfear é seo a chur i gcomhthéacs an Bhille seo agus tá sé fíorthábhachtach go dtabharfar aire, ní amháin do raidió áitiúil ach do Raidió na Gaeltachta agus do gach raidió eile chomh maith céanna.  Ní fhéadfadh daoine a rá, &ldquo;nil aon chall do Raidió na Gaeltachta fógraíocht a lorg.  Níl siad ag fáil aon airgead a fógraiocht, mar sin, tá sé éasca acu siúd leanúint ar aghaidh mar tá an Stát ag íoc an bhille ag deireadh an lae&rdquo;.  Tá sé sin fíor, ach nuair a chuirtear san áireamh, ar thaobh amháin, an buntáiste atá ann don Stát ón airgead atá á chaitheamh ar Raidió na Gaeltachta, is éasca dúinn a thuiscint go bhfuil an <Col N="408" /> t-airgead sin á chaitheamh ar mhaithe leis an tír ar chuile bhealach a bhféadfaí é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé le feiceáil le blianta beaga &mdash; agus seo pointe a chuirim an-bhéim air, ó thaobh úsáid na Gaeilge, ó thaobh neart agus buanseasmhacht na teanga de, go bhfuil neamart á dhéanamh i gcúrsai Gaeilge agus i gcúrsí theilifís Ghaeltachta. Ní féidir glacadh leis sin.  Mar shampla, céard atá ag dul a tharlú do TheleGael faoin mBille seo? B'fhéidir nach eol do chuid de na Chomhaltaí cad is TeleGael ann nó céard iad na haidhmeanna atá acu.  Ba mhaith liom a mhíniú arís an rud a d'fhéadfadh tarlú de bharr an tAcht seo a bheith rite agus i bhfeidhm, go bhféadfadh sé an-dochar a dhéanamh d'iarracht mhór mhacánta atá déanta le cláir as Gaeilge a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Bunaíodh an comhlacht TeleGael tuairim is trí bliana ó shin, comhlacht beag sa Spidéal i gContae na Gaillimhe le cabhair ó Udarás na Gaeltachta agus, roinnt de na hoibrithe a bhí ag obair san Údarás ag an am, chuadar isteach ann.  Chuir siadsan córas ar fáil le go bhféadfaí go leor clár a dhéanamh i nGaeilge, agus trí Ghaeilge.  Tá scaireanna ag RTE agusÚdarás na Gaeltachta sa chomhlacht seo agus tá sé mar aidhm acu cláir a dhéanamh go neamhspleách agus an gnó a chur chun cinn.  Ach an oiread leis na rudaí atá á rá agam faoi na cláir atá i mbaol anois, tá chuile chosúlacht ar an scéal go mbeidh an comhlacht seo TeleGael i gcontúirt a chaillte freisin.  Mar sin, ní bás amháin atái ndán duinn san iarthar ach sochraid de go leor rudaí, a dhéanfaidh dochar agus díiobháil don teanga.</P>
    <P>Tá TeleGael ag fáil cúnaimh ó RTE, ó thaobh chúrsaí airgid de, le cláir áirithe a dhéanamh.  Anois tá ráite leo nach bhfuil aon chinnteacht ann go mbeidh an t-airgead sin le fáil amach anseo.  Níl sé cinnte freisin an mbeidh an £100,000 atá geallta d'obair na bliana seo ar fáil.  Tá sé chomh dona sin anois go bhfuil an príomhdhuine atá fostaithe ag TeleGael, a tháinig abhaile ó Shasana tar éis dul i dtaithí ar an ngnó sa tír sin, ag cuartújab eile.  Lead as Contae na Gaillimhe é, ní fear Gaeltachta é; a tháinig sé lena bhean agus a chlann, lonnaigh sé sa Spidéal agus chuir <Col N="409" /> sé chuile shórt a bhí aige, an expertise go léir a bhí foghlamtha aige i Sasana, ag obair ar son na Gaeilge, ar son teilifís na Gaeltachta agus chláir Ghaeilge le RTE. Seo iad na rudaí beaga nach bhfuil léirithe sa Bhille seo.  Seo iad na rudaí beaga a chuireann imní ar mo leithéidse.</P>
    <P>Nílimse ag caint faoi 200 nó 300 jab a chaillfidh RTE.  Táimse ag caint faoi lead amháin thiar i nGaeltacht Chonamara atá ag iarraidh imeacht as an tír arís agus a fhágfaidh an áit sin gan treoir, mar nach gcreideann sé go bhfuil áit sa tír seo dó. Cén freagra atá ag an Aire agus ag an Seanadóir Conroy air sin?  Tá sé scannalach. Seo muid ag iarraidh ár míle dícheall a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge, don tír ar fad, ní don Ghaeltacht amháin, mar ba mhaith linn rud éigin a chruthú dúinn féin.  Dá bharr sin, tá an fear seo ag iarraidh imeacht.  Níl aon chinnteacht ann go bhfuil an t-airgead le fáil ag an chomhlacht níos mó.  D'fhág sé post buan i Sasanna, tá sé ag dul ar ais chun an post sin a fháil arís.  Chomh luath agus a imeoidh seisean imeoidh chuile shórt.  Imeoidh TeleGael, áit a bhfuil £1 mhilliún beagnach curtha ag obair ann.  Ní fheicfidh tú aon rud sa mhíniú atá ag an Aire ar an Bhille seo faoi céard atá i ndán do na rudaí seo.  Tá liosta mór fada ann, ag tosú le &ldquo;Looking West&rdquo; síos anuas faoi RTE, Raidió na Gaeltachta, TeleGael, agus anois féin tá aithne agam ar fear a bhí ag obair do RTE, a bhunaigh comhlacht dá chuid féin agus a cheannaigh luach £80,000 de threalamh le cláir príobháideacha a dhéanamh san iarthar, agus céard atá tarlaithe don £80,000 anois?  Thosaigh sé ar dhá chlár a dhéanamh do RTE; agus é leathbhealach tríd fuair sé scéala nach raibh aon chinnteacht ann go nglacfaí leo.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite ag an Aire sa doiciméad a chuir sé os ár gcomhair go mbeadh &ldquo;independently produced broadcast material&rdquo; chun tosaigh agus go mbeifí ag baint úsáide as sin.  Tá mise ag caint anois ar chásanna sonraitheacha; níl mé ag caint amach as mo chloigeann; tá siad sin ráite agus scríofa agam, cásanna a léiríonn nach bhfuil neamhspleáchas ann a bheag nó a mhór.  Tá sé sin cruthaithe agam.  Céard eile is féidir liom a dhéanamh lena chur ina luí ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas gur droch-Bhille é seo amach <Col N="410" /> is amach, fad agus a bhaineann sé le hiarthar na hÉireann.  Níl mé ag dul a rá tada faoi Bhaile Átha Cliath ná na háiteanna eile, ach caithfidh mé cás a dhéanamh faoin dochar atá á dhéanamh aige maidir le hiarthar na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Céard a tharlóidh de bharr an Bhille seo, bíodh go bhfuil sé ráite ag an Aire go mbeidh daoine ag cur cláir neamhspleácha le chéile.  Údarás na Gaeltachta, mar shampla, chuir siadsan cúrsa breá ar bun an bhliain seo caite &mdash; tá mé ag ceapadh gur sheisear déag a bhí ar an gcúrsa sin, as Dún na nGall, Maigh Eo, Gaillimh, Ciarraí, agus áiteanna eile sa Ghaeltacht.  Tugadh le chéile iad agus cuireadh traenáil orthu.  Tugadh daoine a bhí an-oilte agus eolach isteach le traenáil a thabhairt do na daoine sin.  Chaith siad sé mhí nó bliain ag traenáil, ag déanamh clár i nGaeilge, faoi Ghaeilge, faoi rudaí, ní sa Ghaeltacht amháin, ach in áiteanna eile chomh maith céanna.  Nuair a bhí sin uilig déanta, chuireadar a raibh foghlamtha acu le chéile agus chonaic muid é.  Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil bunús an-maith ansin, go mbeadh léiritheoirí neamhspleácha ansin.</P>
    <P>Cén mhaith anois é sin mura bhfuil deis acu é sin a chur ag obair?  Cén mhaith d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a bheith ag traenáil daoine do theilifís Gaeilge Gaeltachta nuair nach bhfuil tada á dhéanamh faoi.  Is aisteach liom, mar sin, go bhféadfadh Bille chomh tábhachtach sin teacht os comhair na Dála agus an tSeanaid agus gan fiú teilifís na Gaeltachta bheith luaite nó caint ar bith faoi ann.  Ní rud é gur easpa eolais a bhí i gceist.  Is cuimhin liomsa mí na Samhna 1988 gur chuir an Taoiseach scéala chugainn ar Údarás na Gaeltachta agus is é an teachtaireacht a bhí aige dúinn gur mhian leis go gcuirfí staidéar ar bun agus go gcuirfí in iúl céard iad na roghanna a bheadh ann le teilifís na Gaeltachta a chur ar bun, céard iad na costais a bheadh lena leithéid, cén mhaith agus cén fáth go mba chóir é a bheith ann.</P>
    <P>Anois tá mé ag rá gurbh é an Taoiseach a chuir é sin chugainn.  Níor mhaith liom a rá gurbh é Aire na Gaeltachta a rinne é mar i mo leabharsa níl a leithéid de dhuine ann mar Aire na Gaeltachta. Cuireann sé sin an-díomá orm, go <Col N="411" /> mbeadh muid ag feidhmiú sa chóras stáit seo, faoi bhunreachtúlacht, go mbeadh Aire na Gaeltachta luaite againn, go bhfuil a leithéid ann agus gan é bheith ann.  Má tá duine ar bith ag iarraidh cruthúnais nach bhfuil Aire na Gaeltachta againn ní gá dó ach breathnú ar an doiciméad beag sin atá ag gach Teachta Dála agus Seanadóir &mdash; Tithe an Oireachtais, eolaí uimhreacha inmheánacha gutháin.  Má théann tú go dtí an tríú leathanach ann, tá sé go léir luaite ansin, ceithre cinn déag de Ranna Rialtais, chuile cheann acu, fiú amháin Justice, Communications, Aireacht atá anseo, agus Tourism, Transport, Education, Health, Environment, Social Welfare, Energy, Labour, Marine, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Tánaiste, agus Taoiseach. Roinn na Gaeltachta &mdash; níl sé ann.  Tá sé ráite sa doiciméad seo nach bhfuil aon Roinn na Gaeltachta ag an Rialtas.  Mar dhuine a bhfuil gnáthchónaí air sa Ghaeltacht, atá ag maireachtáil trí mheán na Gaeilge, mé féin is mo chlann is a bhfuil agam, an iontas ar bith é go dtagaimse isteach anseo agus go mbímse ar buile nuair a fheicimse rudaí den chineál sin? Sin admháil ag an Rialtas féin nach bhfuil aon Aire na Gaeltachta ná aon Roinn na Gaeltachta ann.  Tá sé sin ráite agam go mion minic, agus tá tábhachtach i gcomhthéacs an ruda seo, go bhféadfadh an Taoiseach, Cathal Ó hEochaidh, an scéal a luaigh mé a chur chugainn in Udarás na Gaeltachta, a bhfuil sé in ainm is bheith in a Aire air; níor thug sé cuairt riamh orainn, níor sheas sé riamh laistigh de dhoras Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá Roinn na Gaeltachta thíos ansin cúpla céad slat ón Dáil &mdash; níor sheas sé riamh ann fós &mdash; agus tá daoine ag rá go bhfuil Aire na Gaeltachta againn, agus cuireann an Rialtas eolaire mar sin amach chugainn lena chruthú dóibh féin nach bhfuil sé ann.</P>
    <P>Is magadh ceart í an Ghaeilge, faoi mar a bhí agus atá ag Fianna Fáil le blianta anuas.  Chreid mise uair amháin gurbh iad Fianna Fáil slanaitheoirí na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta ach is iad is mó atá ciontach as milleadh agus marú na Gaeilge.  Bhí sé de chúram orthu an <Col N="412" /> Ghaeilge a chosaint anuas tríd na blianta nuair a bhí Achtanna den chinéal seo dá reachtáil.</P>
    <P>Ag filleadh ar an scéal eile dom, do sheol an Taoiseach iarratas chugainn ar son tuarascála agus cuireadh an tuarascáil sin ar fáil; tuarascáil bhreá, thoirteach a bhí ann.  Míníodh an gá a bhí le seirbhís teilifíse Gaeltachta sa tuarascáil sin; bhí idir stair na ceiste agus cúinsí an lae inniu ann.  Chosnaigh an tuarascáil breis is £20,000.  Ullmhaíodh an tuarascáil don Taoiseach nach raibh ina Aire Gaeltachta cé gur dhearbhaigh sé go raibh an post sin aige&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In omós don Chathaoir, tá sé bainteach leis an mBille.  Táimid ag caint faoi Bhille atá ag plé le cumarsáid, le forbairt, le raidió agus le teilifís.  Baineann Raidió na Gaeltachta agus teilifís na Gaeltachta le RTE agus tá sé de dhualgas ar an Aire an ghné seo den cheist a phlé.  Tá sé ar intinn agamsa a léiriú go bhfuil neamart déanta ag an mBille seo sa Ghaeltacht agus go millfidh agus go maróidh sé an Ghaeltacht.  Ní fhéadfainn an deis seo a ligean tharam gan é sin a chur abhaile.  Tagann Raidió na Gaeltachta faoi údarás RTE agus is leis an Aire Cumarsáide agus Údarás RTE a luíonn an chumhacht nuair atá bunadh stáisiún teilifíse i gceist.  Is é mo phointe, a Chathaoirligh, nach bhfuil focal ráite faoin drochthionchar a bheas ag an mBille seo ar an nGaeilge agus ar an nGaeltacht.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil an dualgas ormsa é a dhéanamh agus tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire teacht ar athrú intinne sa cheist seo, agus an Bille seo a tharraingt siar ar fad, le go mbeidh aitheantas tugtha don Ghaeilge ann sar a dtagann sé an ais dúinn, má thagann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla ar chomh-chéim agus is ceist chumarsáide atá faoi chaibidil anseo againn.  Ní thig liom é a rá sách minic, &ldquo;communications&rdquo;. Is é sin an teideal atá ag an Aire agus céard atá níos tábhachtaí ó thaobh cumarsáide de do mhuintir na Gaeltachta <Col N="413" /> agus na Gaeilge ná Raidió na Gaeltachta agus teilifís na Gaeltachta?</P>
    <P>Nuair a deir an tAire in a óráid ar an mBille:</P>
    <P>There have been some uninformed suggestions that the proposal to allow the third television channel to establish its own UHF transmission system rules out the possibility of establishing a Teilifís na Gaeltachta should a decision to that effect be taken.</P>
    <P>Is é an clásal deiridh &mdash;&ldquo;should a decision to that effect be taken&rdquo;&mdash; a chuireann imní ormsa.  Sin iad focail an Aire féin ach ba é an Taoiseach a dúirt go mbeadh seirbhís teilifíse Gaeltachta ann, agus dhearbhaigh sé faoi dhó é, go poiblí, ar Raidió Éireann.  Má dhúirt, cén fáth a bhfuil an ráiteas sin i gcáipéis an Aire atá os ar gcomhair inniu?  An amhlaidh go raibh an Taoiseach ag caint as bealach? An raibh cead aige é sin a rá?  An raibh an cumhacht aige é sin a rá?  Cé tá ag iarraidh dallamullóg a chur orainne nó ar an bpobal?  Bhain an Taoiseach úsáid as na meáin chumarsáide i mí an Mheithimh 1989, taréis an olltoghcháin, chun a rá go mbeadh teilifís Ghaeltachta ann.  Dealraíonn sé go bhfuil scéal eile á fháil againn anois ón Aire.  Tá faitíos agus imní orm, mar a dúirt mé cheana, mar gheall ar an dochar a dhéanfaidh an Bille seo d'iarthar na tíre.  Níl aon amhras orm ná go ndéanfaidh sé dochar nuair a chuirim san áireamh an ráiteas a leigh mé amach. Deir an tAire freisin:</P>
    <P>On the technical side, while UHF frequencies are in very limited supply, we have in fact retained sufficient of them to enable such a service to be established.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go n-inseodh an tAire dom go sollúnta agus go fírinneach go mbeidh UHF ar fáil le haghaidh teilifís na Gaeltachta.  Muna bhfuil ach trí cinn de UHF ann, ní heol dom conas is féidir ceann a chur ar fáil do theilifís na Gaeltachta agus is cosúil go bhfuil dallamullóg á chur ormsa ina dtaobh.  Má tá siad ann, áfach, ba chóir go mbeadh ceann ar fáil ag RTE agus ceann do RTE3 más ann a <Col N="414" /> bheidh sé, agus go gcuirfí an tríú ceann ar fáil do stáisiún na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is é mo phointe ná go raibh an Taoiseach féin chomh cinnte sin de gur chuir sé £50,000 ar fáil chun seirbhís teilifíse Gaeilge a bhunadh; ní dúirt sé seirbhís teilifíse Gaeltachta.  Nach aisteach go mbíonn fonn orainn uilig airgead Stáit a chaitheamh, is cuma cén rannóg Stáit a bhíonn á chur ar fáil, ach go bhfuil an t-airgead seo ceadaithe le tuairim is dhá bhliain agus nach bhfuil pingin de caite fós?  Cén fáth nach bhfuil?  Mar, nuair a deirtear go mbeidh teilifís Ghaeltachta ann, níl ansin ach cur i gcéill.  Dá mbeadh Aire Gaeltachta fiúntach againn, a chuirfeadh ceangal air féin seirbhís teilifíse Ghaeltachta a sholáthar nó a déarfadh liom go bhfeadfaí an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh ar bhunadh a leithéid de sheirbhís nó ar chur chun cinn na Gaeilge tríd an Achta seo, mheasfainn go raibh rud éigin déanta.  Bheadh slat tomhais nó léiriú againn ar dháiríreacht an Aire maidir le ceist seo na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Meabhraimid dúinn féin na gnéithe a bhí sa tuarascáil thuasluaite.  Leagadh amach go soileír ann an bealach ar chóir dul i mbun bunadh sheirbhís teilifís Gaeltachta; bhí ceist an chostais cuimsitheach ann; fuarathas comhairle ó shaineolaithe le linn a ullmhaithe; mhol RTE go mbunófaí an staísiún teilifíse agus go mbeadh lán-tacaíocht chuige le fáil uathu.  I ndeireadh na dála, taréis do bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta an tuarascáil a chur le chéile, fágadh an bord céanna gan chóip den tuarascáil.  Is trua liom go bhfuil an Seanadóir Conroy imithe anois, taréis a dúirt sé i dtaobh cúinsí ar iarthar na hEorpa; d'fhéadfainn cúpla samplaí cuí eile a thabhairt dó.  B'éigean dúinn mar bhaill de bhord Údaras na Gaeltachta troid a dhéanamh chun cóip den tuarascáil a fháil, agus ar deireadh, tar éis é a thabhairt do chuile dhuine, tugadh dúinn é.</P>
    <P>Tá cuid amháin fíorthábhachtach den Bhille seo a bhaineann le ceist na teanga, an teanga a bhfuil sé de cheart againn agus de dhualgas orainn é a úsáid agus a neartú agus a choimeád beo.  Tríd an chuid seo den Bhille, faighimís léirstint ar dháiríreacht an Taoisigh mar Aire <Col N="415" /> Gaeltachta, ar dháiríreacht an Aire Cumarsáide agus ar dhearcadh Roinn na Gaeltachta freisin.  Is dóigh liomsa gurb é seo an t-aon ardán ar ar chóir an cheist seo a phlé agus déanfaidh mé í a ardú agus a phlé pé bealach is féidir liom.  Muna dtugtar aird ar na héilimh atá ann chun leasú a chur ar an mBille seo, agus chun teilifís Ghaeltachta a chur ar bun, tá an cath caillte agus beidh deireadh leis an nGaeilge mar theanga labhartha i measc mion phobail na nGaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nach gcreideann Seanadóirí é sin agus gur dóigh libh go bhfuilim ag déanamh áibhéile.  Má chreideann, níl neart agamsa air.  Ní fhéidir liom ach mo phíosa a rá ina thaobh agus ní bheidh an deis agam chuige arís.  Nuair a bheas an Bille seo rite, ní bheidh ann ansin ach &ldquo;mair, a chapaill, agus gheobhair féar&rdquo;. Deirtear go mbeidh scéal ann sa bhfómhar faoi theilifís Ghaeilge nó Ghaeltachta. Ní cóir go mbeadh aon éiginnteacht ina taobh má tá sé ráite ag Taoiseach na tíre mar Aire Gaeltachta go mbeidh a leithéid ann.  Cén fáth nach bhfuil sí ann má tá sé ráite aige go mbeidh?  D'éiligh sé staidéar taighdeach; cuireadh ceann breá tiubh ar fáil dó agus neart leathanacha ann.  Cad a tharla dó? Ní dearnadh aon ní leis agus taímid fós ag feitheamh ar chinneadh.  Seoladh go Roinn na Gaeltachta é agus as sin go dtí an Roinn Cumarsáide, agus deirtear gur fhill sé ar Roinn na Gaeltachta arís cé gur dóigh liomsa go bhfuil sé fós sa Roinn Cumarsáide.  Ní fios cá bhfuil sé, ach tá rud amháin cinnte ina thaobh.  Ní heol do mhuintir na hÉireann go bhfuil a dTaoiseach chun an gealltanas a thug sé go poiblí tar éis an olltoghcháin maidir le teilifís na Gaeltachta, a chomhlíonadh. Sin againn arís é: toghcháin agus gealltanais, ach nuair is ceist slánú na Gaeilge atá romhainn, níl againn ach deafhocla ar an ábhar agus gan aon bheart de réir ár mbriathra.</P>
    <P>Níl an tAire ná daoine eile ag baint usáide as a gcuid cumhachta chun réiteach na ceiste seo.  Dá mbeadh an chumhacht chuí aige agus dá mbeadh an toil ann chun í a usáid, níl aon chúis ann nach gcomhlíonfaí an gealltanas.  Nuair a bhí <Col N="416" /> ceist Raidió na Gaeltachta á plé, bhí ceist airgid ann; is amhlaidh anois le ceist theilifís na Gaeltachta.  Má tá an Taoiseach chomh mór sin ar son na Gaeilge cén fáth nach mbaineann sé usáid as an £2 mhilliún atá ar intinn aige a bhaint ó RTE, chun teilifís na Gaeltachta a bhunadh? Cén fáth go bhfaigheadh Century nó dream ar bith eile é?  An amhlaidh go gceaptar nach bhfuil ach mionlach ag éileamh seirbhís teilifís Ghaeilge agus mar sin nach fiú é?  Más mionlach féin sinn, nach bhfuilimid ar chomh thábhacht ar a laghad le Century nó le haon dream eile atá in ainm is a bheith ag fáil an airgid sin?</P>
    <P>Bhí locht mór againne ar chur i láthair na ceiste maidir le bunadh theilifís na Gaeltachta faoin Bhille seo.  Is é a dúradh ná nach mbeadh na hacmhainní ag an Stát chun í a airgeadú.  Chas an Stát thart ansin agus táthar ar tí £12 mhilliún nó a bhreis air sin a bhaint de RTE, a bheadh acu chun an áis seo a chur i bhfeidhm don Stát.  Magadh agus cur i gcéill atá againn ansin faoin nGaeilge, faoin bpobal le Gaeilge acu, agus faoi oidhreacht na tíre. Nuair a bhí an Bille á sciúirseáil tríd an Dáil, níorbh fhiú don Aire leasú a dhéanamh chun é seo a chur isteach ann.  B'fhiú dó leasú a dhéanamh chun leath noiméad a chur isteach agus rudaí eile den tsórt ach níl aon chaint faoi chúnamh a thabhairt do theilifís na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá ráiteas faighte againn ón Aire Stáit &mdash; agus ní ón Aire &mdash; i Roinn na Gaeltachta. Is dóigh liom go gceapann sé go bhfuil sé ina Aire ar Roinn na Gaeltachta ach níl aon ghuth aige sa Chaibinéad ná níl caoi aige chun airgead a dhíriú i dtreo aidhmeanna den chineál sin.  Ach más rud é gur féidir le hAire teacht amach le Bille mar seo agus a rá nach mbeidh aon airgead le fáil le haghaidh teilifís na Gaeltachta faoi láthair, ach ag an am céanna go bhfuil sé in ann a rá go mbeidh £12 mhilliún ar fáil lena thabhairt don earnáil phríobháideach, ar bhealach amháin nó bhealach eile, tá sé, dar liomsa, ag ligean síos chuspóir Bhunreacht na hÉireann, a thugann aitheantas don Ghaeilge agus do lucht na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil daoine ar <Col N="417" /> buile liom anseo, go bhfuil daoine ag rá go bhfuil mé seafóideach ag caint liom mar seo.  Níl neart agam air sin.  Dúirt mé anseo cheana é, agus tá mé á rá anseo arís anocht, ní raibh crisis riamh chomh mór i ndán don Ghaeilge is atá ann ag an nóiméad seo, agus is é an rud atá ag dul a mharú na Gaeilge ná an Bille seo agus an riocht ina bhfuil sé.  Cuireann daoine ceist orm cén chaoi, cén fáth, cén difríocht a dhéanann sé seo.  Déanann sé andifríocht. Mar shampla, bhí mé ag caint le fear as Sardinia an lá cheana, fear atá ina Chathaoirleach ar Chomhairle na hEorpa, agus bhíomar ag caint faoi na mionteangacha, na teangacha neamhfhorleathana, agus tharla cur is cúiteamh faoin Iodáil.  Bhí mé ag déanamh plé a chúnamh faoi Bhille mar seo ó thaobh cumarsáide de agus dúirt mé leis: tá sibhse ceart go leor san Iodáil, tá teanga agaibh.  Ach, a deir sé liom, tá deich gcinn de mhionteangacha ann san Iodáil, agus seo an rud suimiúil a dúirt sé faoi na teangacha sin.  Leis na blianta anuas, ón chúigiú haois déag, ar feadh cúig chéad bliain, rinneadh chuile iarracht na teangacha beaga sina mharú agus theip ar rialtas i ndiaidh rialtais deireadh a chur leo, ach, a deir sé, tá níos mó déanta ag teilifís na hIodáile le deireadh a chur le labhairt na dteangacha beaga seo, le iad a mharú, ná mar a bhí airm, rithe agus rialtais, in ann a dhéanamh le 500 bliain.</P>
    <P>Nach aisteach é sin, agus tá an scéal ceannann céanna sa Ghaeltacht an lá atá inniu ann.  Sin an fáth go bhfuilim ag caint an oiread sin faoin iarthar, faoin Ghaeilge, mar níor léiríodh in aon Teach, sa Dáíl ná sa Seanad anseo, an dochar a dhéanfar agus an chaoi a bhfuil an Bille seo ag dul tríd chomh sciobtha sin.  Ba chóir, dá mbeadh rudaí i gceart, go mbeadh deis ag an Aire machnamh a dhéanamh ar na pointí atá á ardú agamsa faoin Ghaeilge agus faoi theilifís na Gaeltachta. Ach níl sé ag iarraidh deise.  Teastaíonn uaidh an Bille a chur tríd.  Beidh sé ina dhlí ar an chéad lá de Dheireadh Fómhair, agus beidh deireadh leis an Ghaeilge lenár linn féin.  Tá an ghlúin seo sna Gaeltachtaí ceart go leor.  Tá siad ag labhairt Gaeilge agus tá go leor Gaeilge á labhairt fós, ach is í an chéad ghlúin <Col N="418" /> eile a bhfuil mise ag caint faoi.  Mura mbíonn teilifís na Gaeltachta le fáil ag an chéad ghlúin eile Gaeltachta, agus mura bhfuil an tír seo nó an Rialtas seo in ann é sin a dhéanamh, agus mura bhfuil siad sásta aitheantas a thabhairt sa Bhille go bhfuil gá leis, tá an Ghaeilge imithe.</P>
    <P>Ní duine mise atá in éadóchas ach tá sé feicthe agam le 40 bliain i mo chónaí sa Ghaeltacht an chaoi a bhfuil an Ghaeilge á lagú.  Tá díoma mór orm nár luadh sa Bhille seo atá os ár gcomhair go gcuirfí teilifís na Gaeltachta ar bun.  Sin an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire.  Tá glactha ag an Taoiseach féin leis an gcinneadh go mbeidh teilifís na Gaeltachta ann.  Maidir le hargóintí faoi airgead, níl a thuilleadh argóintí agam faoi sin.  Nuair a fheicimse Bille atá ag dul a bhaint £12 mhilliún ó RTE, suim a chuirfeadh Raidió na Gaeltachta agus teilifís na Gaeltachta ar bhonn daingean, feicim deireadh na Gaeilge.  An ghlúin atá anois ann, an ghlúin óg atá idir dhá bhliain agus cúig bliana d'aois, leanaí óga, garpháistí liom féin, a tógadh le Gaeilge, nár labhraíodh aon Bhéarla leo, tá Béarla acu, leanaí óga nach bhfuil ar scoil fós.</P>
    <P>Ní bhfuair siad an Béarla óna dtuismitheoirí, fuair siad ón teilifís é.  Faoin am a mbeidh na gasúir sin deich mbliana d'aois beidh an Ghaeilge imithe ar fad uathu.  Is trua liom é seo a rá ach caithfidh mé é a rá.  B'fhéidir gur cuma le Seanadóirí faoi sin.  B'fhéidir gur cuma leis an Aire agus leis an Taoiseach faoi, ach ní cuma liomsa faoi.  Tá na mílte duine ann sa tír seo agus ní cuma leo faoi, agus ní imeoidh sí agus ní chaillfear an cath gan troid a dhéanamh.  Déanfar troid, agus treiseoidh an Bille seo daoine leis an troid sin a dhéanamh.  B'fheidir go gcuirfí an cheist: cén fáth go bhfuil tú ag caint faoi theilifís Ghaeltachta a chur ar bun má chreideann tú nach mbeidh aon Ghaeilge ann ag an chéad ghlúin eile sa Ghaeltacht? Cén fáth go gcuirfeá airgead amú?</P>
    <P>Tá dhá fháth ann: uimhir a haon, tá na milliúin phunt á chur amú anois, gan fáth ar bith, ó thaobh leas agus chultúr na tíre de; uimhir a dó, táimid ag cailliúint an méid a bhí againn, agus nuair a bheidh sé imithe, ní thiocfaidh rud ar bith ar ais. <Col N="419" /> Ní féidir go dtiocfaidh sé ar ais.  Tá sé ansoiléir domsa, de réir an Bhille seo, gur sin an meon atá ann, gur sin meon an Stáit, meon an Státchórais, na Státseirbhíse, an Aire, agus an Rialtais.  Tá sé léirithe anseo agamsa gur sin an rud atá beartaithe acu.  An bhfuil siad dáiríre faoi rud ar bith, an bhfuil siad dáiríre faoin Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo?  Nílimse éadóchasach faoin Ghaeilge, ar bhealaí eile. Mar shampla, tá go leor scoileanna Gaeilge á mbunú ar fud na tíre &mdash; naíscoileanna Gaeilge, meánscoileanna Gaeilge, agus tá go leor daoine sa Teach seo agus i go leor áiteanna eile a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge, agus tá sí ag teacht ar aghaidh, ach tá tobar na Gaeilge fós sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Dá bhféadfaimis teilifís na Gaeltachta a bhunú anois, agus an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo sa Ghaeltacht ar feadh 50 bliain eile, bheadh seans aici dul i neart. Nach fiú dúinn mar Stát, mar Rialtas, an iarracht seo a dhéanamh?  D'fhoilsigh fear ó Shasana leabhar le déanaí, fear a rinne staidéar cliniciúil, neamhspléach ar labhairt na teanga sna Gaeltachtaí, agus séard atá scríofa aige taréis an-staidéar a dhéanamh ná nach mbeidh fanta sna Gaeltachtaí tar éis roinnt bheag blianta eile ach cúpla póca anseo agus ansiúd ag labhairt Gaeilge, mar beidh an chuid eile imithe.  Dúirt sé gurb é an easpa Gaeilge ar na meáin chumarsáide an chúis atá leis sin.</P>
    <P>Má deir duine liomsa nach cóir dom bheith anseo inniu ag iarraidh é sin a chosaint, go bhfuil sé chomh maith dom fanacht sa bhaile agus gan teacht ar ais anseo arís ar chor ar bith, is é an freagra ná go bhfuil mé ag iarraidh cearta na teanga a chosaint, ní don Teach seo, ní don Teach eile, ní dúinn féin ach do pháistí na Gaeltachta atá ag breathnú ar an mbosca sin de ló is d'oíche.  Níl aon neart acu air.  Níl aon neart ag a dtuismitheoirí air.  Sin é an saol mar atá sé anois.</P>
    <P>Tá dualgas orainn féin iarracht a dhéanamh leis an sruth seo a stopadh agus a chur ar ceal, agus níl aon bhealach lena dhéanamh ach trí theilifís na Gaeltachta. Má chuireann tú ceist ar aon oideachasóir sa tír seo nó in aon tír eile, <Col N="420" /> déarfaidh siad leat gurb é an meán cumarsáide is treise agus is mó a théann i bhfeidhm ar intinn daoine óga ná an teilifís. Sin an fáth go bhfuil mé anso ag iarraidh an Bille a chur den talamh, dá bhféadfainn é, agus go n-iarrfainn ar an Aire dul ar ais agus é a scríobh arís agus go gcuirfeadh sé isteach an coinníoll go mbunófaí teilifís Ghaeilge nó Ghaeltachta. Níl mise ag dul a throid faoi cé acu, teilifís Ghaeilge nó Ghaeltachta a bheidh ann.  Bíodh sé bunaithe, mar atá Raidió na Gaeltachta, sa Ghaeltacht, ach bíodh sé ann don tír ar fad.  Bíodh sé amhlaidh, sa chaoi is go mbeadh sé neamhspleách, go bhféadfadh chuile dhuine éisteacht leis, Gaeilgeoirí na tíre agus muintir na Gaeltachta &mdash; i dteannta a chéile is ea is láidre.</P>
    <P>Dá ndéanfaí é sin ní bheinnse ag rá anseo gur tórramh na Gaeilge atá á chomóradh agus á thionlacan anseo againn anocht.  Tá sé ceart go leor ag an Aire Stáit a rá &ldquo;beidhmid ag déanamh cinnidh faoi seo Meán Fómhair seo chugainn.  Tá sé ag an Roinn Cumarsáide faoi láthair&rdquo;. Tá an Roinn Cumarsáide ag rá go bhfuil sé ag Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Tá an Taoiseach ag rá go mbeidh sé ann, agus tá an tAire Cumarsáide ag rá linn anseo, &ldquo;should a decision to that effect be taken&rdquo;.  Tá an rud sin go léir ag teacht ar shála a chéile in intinn na ndaoine faoi seo.  Níl an soiléiriú cuí déanta ag an Rialtas faoi seo ar chor ar bith.  Níl na smaointe cearta dulta isteach sa Bhille.</P>
    <P>Ní bheadh locht agamsa go pearsanta ar chúnamh éigin a thabhairt do Century agus daoine eile mar sin, ach tá locht agam agus an míle locht agam air má fhágtar amach teilifís Ghaeilge don tír seo agus don Ghaeltacht, rud atá déanta. Ach go dtí go bhfeicfidh mise é scríofa agus soiléirithe, agus go dtí go bhfeicfidh mise an Taoiseach sa Teach seo ag rá liomsa nó le duine ar bith eile go bhfuil sé ag dul a chomhlíonadh an ghealltanais a thug sé, ní chreidfidh mé go bhfuil se le tarlú.  Níl aon rud sa Bhille sin a thugann uchtach dom go ndéanfaí a leithéid.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ródhéanach anois mar tá an Bille seo ag dul tríd, ach beidh lucht na Gaeilge agus muintir na Gaeltachta go láidir in aghaidh chur i bhfeidhm an Bhille seo, <Col N="421" /> mar níl ann ach cur i gcéill fad agus a bhaineann sé leo siúd.  Tá an tAire, leis an mBille seo, in ann £2 mhilliún a bhaint de RTE agus ní bheidh aon airgead ag RTE le cuidiú le seirbhís mar theilifís na Gaeltachta a chothú.</P>

      <P>Fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit.  Níl a fhios agam an amhlaidh gur éirigh an tAire a bhí anseo roimhe seo tuirseach de mo chuid Gaeilge nó de mo chuid cainte nó cén fáth nár tháinig sé ar ais chugainn?  Mar a dúirt me cheana, ní le drochmheas a chaitheamh ar dhuine ar bith atáim ag labhairt as Gaeilge ach chun prionsabal tábhachtach ó thaobh na Gaeilge de a léiriú.  Tá meas agam ar an té gan Gaeilge chomh maith leis an té a bhfuil sí aici nó aige ach tá pointe sroichte agam a fhágann go gcaithfidh mé é seo a rá i nGaeilge.  Déanaim leithscéal leis an Aire Stáit nó le héinne eile nach dtuigeann me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá trácht sa Bhille ar RTE3 agus cuireann sé seo amhras orm sa mhéid is nach dóigh liom go mbeidh tír bheagh mar an tír s'againne in ann an tríú bealach teilifíse a iompar.  Mar is eol daoibh, tá RTE1 agus Network 2 againn cheana féin agus tá sé i gceist sa Bhille go mbeadh Bealach 3 againn.  Tá údar le mo chuid amhrais, agus míneoidh mé mo chás le sampla ón Nua-Shéalainn.  Tá an tír sin ar chomhdhaonra agus ar chomhfhairsingeacht le hÉire agus dob' fhéidir comparáid mhaith a dhéanamh idir theilifís na tíre sin, TVNZ, mar a thugtar air, agus ár gcóras feín.  Bhí dhá bhealach ag an tír sin, mar atá againne anois, iad araon faoi cheannas iomlán an Rialtais ann.  Ba é an Rialtas a bhí freagrach as iad a riaradh agus a airgeadú.  Nach aisteach gurb amhlaidh go baileach atá sé sa tír seo, nó gur mar a bhí, go dtí aréir?  Shíl siad an tríú bealach teilifíse a bhunadh sa Nua-Shéalainn, tamall ó shin agus é a fhágail ag an bhfiontar príobháideach, díreach mar atá fúinne a dhéanamh sa tír seo.  Nach aisteach freisin go raibh na haidhmeanna céanna acu agus atá againn sa Bhille seo. Ach theip orthu agus ba é an toradh a <Col N="422" /> bhí leis ná go bhfuil an tríú bealach a bhunaigh siad imithe den saol, beagnach. Cuirimis cúinsí an dá thír i gcomparáid lena chéile: bhí an dá bhealach ag an tír seo, RTE1 agus Network 2; ag an Nua-Shéalainn, tá 1 agus 2, an dá cheann faoin Stát go hiomlán.  Táimidne anois ag iarraidh iad a bhriseadh suas anseo. Chomh maith leis sin shocraigh siadsan ar an tríú Bhealach 3, a oscailt faoin earnáil phríobháideach agus ní raibh leath na ndeacrachtaí acu is a bhí anseo.</P>
    <P>Mar shampla, sa Nua-Shéalainn, níl ann ach an dá sheirbhís.  Níl aon BBC1, BBC2, UTV nó Channel 4 nó na satellites acu.  Níl aon choimhlint ann.  Ní raibh le déanamh acu mar sin ach díriú ar theilifís a trí ina dtír féin, agus anois, tar éis a bheith ar an saol tamall an-ghearr, tá deireadh leo.  Chaill siad £20 milliún an bhliain seo caite.  Bhí siadsan ag obair ar an choincheap chéanna is atáimidne sa tír seo, ach táimidne níos measa ar go leor bealaí.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, táimidne ag dul i ngleic le BBC1 agus 2, le UTV, le Channel 4 agus na satellites ar fad, agus, chomh maith leis sin, táimid ag cur laincise ar stáisiún an Stáit mar a rinneamar leis an mBille seo.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin arís, táimid ag baint an chúigiú cuid den teacht isteach díobh agus á thabhairt do dhaoine príobháideacha le muid a bhualadh, le muid a dhéanamh níos measa.  Ag an am céanna, táimid ag dul amach ag troid in aghaidh BBC 1 agus 2 agus an stáisiún eile.  Theip orthu sa Nua-Shéalainn le bealach a trí gan aon rud mar sin sa tslí, agus seo muidne sa tír seo ag iarraidh dul chun cinn a dhéanamh le Bealach a Trí a bhunú le dul inár n-aghaidh, le Bealach 1 agus 2 a lagú go mór lena thabhairt don earnáil phríobháideach le dul inár n-aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Deir daoine gur comórtas atá anseo. Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil comhairle faighte ag an Aire agus go bhfuil a fhios aige faoi staid mhuintir na Nua-Shéalainne, go bhfuil comhairleoir ceart ag an Aire a déarfadh leis, &ldquo;In ainm Dé ná bac le teilifís a trí.  Níl an tír seo in ann í a iompar&rdquo;.  Ba leor ar tharla sa Nua-Shéalainn an méid sin a léiriú dúinn.  Is é an pointe atá á dhéanamh agam anseo ná gur trua go bhfuil sé i gceist fós Bealach <Col N="423" /> 3 a oscailt.  Tá imní orm.  Tiocfaidh ciall cheannaithe chuig an Aire agus an Rialtas sar i bhfad nuair a fheiceann siad an brú a thiocfaidh orthu, nuair a fheiceann siad an chaoi a bhfuil an raidió áitiúil, mar shampla.</P>
    <P>I gcathair na Gaillimhe féin, tá siad ar an dé deiridh freisin.  Níl siad in ann an comórtas sin a choinneáil suas.  Tá muintir an Chláir go hiontach ar fad, an-raidió go deo acu.  Tá níos mó ag ag éisteacht leo siúd, thart faoi chathair na Gaillimhe agus amach i nGaeltacht Chois Fharraige ná mar atá ag éisteacht le Radio West i nGaillimh.  Tá Radio mid-West, Maigh Eo, an-mhaith ar fad.  Seo daoine anois nach bhfuil ag brath ar airgead ón Rialtas nó ó dhuine ar bith eile.  Chuadar amach go proifisiúnta, chuir siad a nguailleacha leis an job agus rinne siad é.  Ach an rud a tharlóidh anseo faoin Bhille seo, táimid ag dul a chur Teilifís 3 ar bun agus níl an tír seo in acmhuinn é a iompar.</P>
    <P>Nuair a tharlóidh an trioblóid agus nuair a bheidh siad i dtrioblóid, beidh siad ar ais faoin reachtaíocht seo ag iarraidh cúnaimh.  Cá bhfágfaidh sé sin RTE1 agus Network a Dó, agus cá bhfágfaidh sé sin an RTE Authority?  Níl sé inoibrithe.  Mar sin, má tá ciall ag an Aire agus é sásta éisteacht linn agus an t-ábhar seo ar fad a phlé, tá mé cinnte go mbeimid in ann a chinntiú agus a chur ina luí air nach fiú RTE3 a chur ar bun, a bheag nó a mhór.  Tá dóthain sa tír againn le haghaidh RTE1 agus Network 2.  Tiocfainn le cúnamh de chineál éigin a thabhairt do na cinn eile, dá mba ghá, cineál an-teoranta, ach bheadh sé mar bhunús agam go gcaithfidís dul amach agus soláthar dóibh féin ar an mbealach go mb'éigean do RTE a dhéanamh i dtús a ré.  Bhí mé féin ar chomhairle Raidió na Gaeltachta agus is minic a chuamar, caipín inár lámha againn, ag iarraidh cúpla pingin ó sparán RTE le seirbhís mhaith fhoirfe, rudaí nua a chur ar bun ar Raidió na Gaeltachta agus cuireadh ó dhoras muid.  Ní raibh aon airgead ann. Anois tá airgead ag an Rialtas, tá £12 mhilliún acu le scaipeadh.  Is é an toradh a bheidh ar na hathruithe seo ná Raidió <Col N="424" /> na Gaeltachta, Bealach 3 agus iad uilig a lagú atá i gceist anseo.</P>
    <P>Tá mé anseo lena chur in iúl don Stát agus don Rialtas an dualgas atá orthu, maidir leis an reachtaíocht seo, freastal ar an Ghaeilge agus ar mhuintir na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  Níl aon suim bhunúsach eile agam sa cheist seo mar go bhfuil a fhios agam go bhfuil na daoine a bhfuil spéis faoi leith acu sna cúrsaí seo, agus atá ag plé leis seo, in ann aire a thabhairt dóibh féin.  Níl aon chall dóibh bheith ag plé le rudaí ar nós cúnamh a fháil ón Stát. Le go mbeadh, mar shampla, an teilifís seo, Bealach 1, Bealach 2, agus Bealach 3, 2FM, Raidió a hAon agus a Dó éifeachtach, ní mór, mar a dúirt mé, go mbeidh an t-éileamh ann.  Níl aon mhaith rud a bheith ann mura bhfuil éileamh air. Bhí an-éileamh go deo ar Raidió 2FM, ach bhí an tAire ag iarraidh an t-éileamh sin a mharú.  Dúradh leis é agus chonaic sé é agus d'athraigh sé a intinn faoi.  Rud maith a bhí ansin.  Bíonn meas agam i gcónaí ar an té ar tig leis a intinn a athrú, agus baineann sé seo leis an bpolaitíocht chomh maith le rud ar bith eile.</P>
    <P>Tá saor intinn ag chuile dhuine agus nuair a léiriodh don Aire an toradh a bheadh lena chinneadh, d'athraigh sé a intinn.  Fuair sé tréanmholadh ón dTeach ar maidin as ucht dul i ngleic leis an bhfadhb a bhí ann ach is é an trua é nár moladh dó dul i ngleic leis tríd an Bille a thabhairt abhaile leis agus ceann eile a thabhairt ar ais ina áit.  Bhí éileamh ar 2FM agus déanadh iarracht deireadh a chuir leis; sin mar a dhéantar soláthar ar éileamh.  Caithfidh sé a bheith neamhspleách agus meon neamhspleách a bheith taobh thiar dó freisin.  Tá RTE ag iarraidh neamhspléachais anois ach níl an meon cuí ann toisc an Chomhairle a bheith ann.  De réir mar a bheas airgead á bhaint de chun é a dhéanamh níos éifeachtaí, is ea is mó a bheas sé faoi cheannas Stáit.  Tá an neamhspleáchas a bhí acu á lagú agus á ídiú.</P>
    <P>Ní foláir caighdeán ard craolacháin a bheith ann chun éisteoirí a mhealladh, agus ní thiocfaidh an dea-cháilíocht muna mbíonn an t-airgead ann chun í a fhorbairt. Tá pé farasbarr a bhí acu bainte díobh anois ionas go bhfuil siad beo bocht <Col N="425" /> agus táthar ag súil go leanfaidh siad orthu leis an seirbhís fiú nuair a bhainfear £12 mhilliún díobh.  &ldquo;Sin é bhur mbuíochas&rdquo;, atá á rá aige leo.  De bharr bhur ndícheall a dhéanamh chun RTE 1 agus Network 2 a thabhairt chun foirfe, bainfidh mé díobh anois bhur deis chun forbartha.&rdquo; Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin ceart ná cóir ná go mbeidh dea-thoradh leis.  Ní oibreoidh sé agus feáchfar chuige nach n-oibreoidh sé.  Is cuimhin liom fógra a fheiceáil ar an bpáipéar tuairim is trí seachtain ó shin a bhaineann leis an Bhille le Commissioned Television programmes. Chun an breágadóireacht atá ar siúl anseo a léiriú, léifidh mé é seo daoibh:</P>

      <P>An rud atá á rá agam ná gur bréagadóireacht atá ar siúl.  Deirtear ar thaobh amháin go mbeidh airgead ar fáil agus, ar an dtaobh eile, is eol dom go bhfuil fógraí á fháil ag daoine eile a deir nach mbeidh a thuilleadh airgid le fáil acu ó RTE le haghaidh obair theilifíse neamhspléach.  Tá deireadh curtha ag an Rialtas leis.  Nuair atá Bille mar seo os ár gcomhair, bhí an rud ceart á dheanamh ag an Aire nuair a thosaigh sé á tharraingt siar, agus is trua nár chuir bachbenchers Fhianna Fáil faoi ndear dó breis tarraingt siar a dhéanamh.  Bille níos simplí, níos macánta a bheadh uainn sula bhféadfaí glacadh leis.  Tá an Bille ina chíréib, gan chiall; tá se tagtha isteach anseo inniu agus táthar ag iarraidh é a rith tríd an Teach ionas go mbeidh sé ina dhlí ar an gcéad lá de Dheireadh Fómhair.  Deirim libh go mbuailfear isteach an tairne deiridh ar chónra na Gaeilge ar an lá sin. Chruthaigh mé é seo inniu le mo chuid cainte agus chuirfinn faoi ndear duine ar bith mé a bhréagnú.</P>
      <P>D'fhéadfaí caoi a chur ar an mBille. Bhí an deis ag an Rialtas; pléadh ceist theilifís Ghaeltachta trí nó ceithre seachtain ó shin agus bhíothas den tuairim gur rud fónta a bheadh ann.  Tagann Bille os ár gcomhair gan focal ann faoi agus glacfar leis.  Níor ghá ach líne amháin a bheith ann a déarfadh &ldquo;Teilifís na Gaeltachta will be established&rdquo;.  Níor ghá ach sin, mar d'ordaigh an Taoiseach é.  Má chreideann sibh sa Taoiseach, ba chóir an méid sin a bheith ann, ach níl.  Sin é an fáth go bhfuilim míshásta leis.  Tá a fhios agam go n-aontaíonn na Seanadóirí uilig liom in a gcroíthe istigh agus nuair a mhachnaíonn siad ar mo chuid focal beidh a fhios acu go bhfuil mé ag insint na fírinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, cén fáth nach n-úsáideann Seanadóirí an cumhacht atá acu agus a iarraidh ar an Aire an dearmad a rinne sé a cheartú ionas go dtabharfar an t-ómós agus an cúnamh is cuí don teanga agus do lucht na Gaeilge sa tír ar fad? B'fhéidir nach bhfuil an priority sin ag gach duine agus ní chaithim anuas orthu faoi sin.  Ach ní féidir liom Bille a <Col N="427" /> ghlacadh a chuireann deireadh leis an Ghaeilge mar theanga labhartha.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom mír a fheiceáil sa Bhille a léireodh domsa go bhfuil an Rialtas seo i ndáiríre faoi cheist na Gaeilge agus chuile shórt a bhaineas leis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill to the House and I welcome the debate.  It gives us all an opportunity to hear what the Opposition have to say on the thorny question of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>The first thing I wish to say in respect of comments from the Opposition is that the Government have brought this legislation to this House: one could say that they have bitten the bullet on the broadcasting issue in this country.  It is something that was necessary.  I remember a couple of years ago when there was a chaotic situation here with something like 70 pirate stations operating illegally, flaunting the airwaves and paying no revenue to the State.  While that was going on the then Coalition Government, from 1973 to 1977, did nothing to regulate the broadcasting system.  This Government have taken it on themselves to regulate this area, as they have done in other sectors.  They had to make a lot of unsavoury decisions over the last number of years.  When the economy of this country was going down the drain they had to put their house in order.  They had to introduce health and educational cuts; the list was endless.  But, suddenly, when a piece of worthwhile legislation is being introduced, there is turmoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never seen so many television reporters, cameras or radio announcers outside this House in my life as I have since this Bill was introduced.  One could ask why they were not there during the passage of the Finance Bill or when old age pensioners were getting an increase <Col N="428" /> in their allowance or when the unemployed were being given an extra bonus and so on.  That was all sidelined when things were being put in proper perspective. But when they thought that their cosy, cushy jobs could be pushed in any direction, suddenly there were all sorts of cries.  The cries are coming from the other side of the House.  I am surprised at that, because they know that broadcasting has to be regulated in some form or other.  As I said, when they were in Government they ducked and dodged the situation.</P>
    <P>There was a consensus on the original Bill introduced.  The people indicated that they wanted a choice of broadcasting, and the support for the pirate stations was a manifestation at the time of the desire of people to have an alternative to RTE.  This was introduced under the 1988 Act.  Arising from that we now have the new stations being set up around the country.  Senator Ó Foighil indicated in his speech that the people of the west, who may have been crying with RTE that they had to subsidise the airwaves, are now saying that they cannot afford these new charges.  I can say without fear of contradiction that the people of the west have an opportunity now to have their own local stations and they can advertise locally at a discount rate.  The Broadcasting Act, 1988, was a step in the right direction.  We are coming on air in Kerry this week, and I congratulate them.  I am sure the people of Kerry will be delighted about this because I do not think it would be proper for them to have to advertise their wares to the eastern side of the country when they would only need them to be advertised locally.</P>
    <P>RTE have been established for a long time and they have given a very good service to the people of Ireland. However, times move on and modernisation takes place.  RTE will have to move with the times also.  One would have to look at the dual funding arrangements at the moment from which RTE are benefiting.  There is the licence fee, which amounts to about £45 million per annum, and there is substantial revenue from advertising, which amounts to £55 <Col N="429" /> million or over.  It is because of these inbuilt moneys and so forth that they are in a position at any one time to move in the heavy weaponry and kill off any new independent stations.  It reminds me of the time when the big chains of supermarkets were moving in and were putting the small fellow completely off the scene.</P>
    <P>RTE seem to be very concerned that they are going to lose something in the region of £10 million or £12 million out of a £100 million budget.  Suddenly, their attitude is changing, they are beginning to scream and holler and all they can see on the horizon is massive unemployment, massive job losses and massive this, that and the other.  With their experience of the airwaves down through the years and watching all the manufacturers in this country who were faced with similar type problems, did the various managements in this country suddenly say: we have lost an order here, we will have to start laying off people immediately because we want to save the cushy jobs of the people up the ranks?  One would have to wonder about that.  These are business people we are talking about.  They have a board of management, the collar and tie jobs, the backroom boys, as they are called, in nice cushy positions.  They have the experience of the past few years of doing business with other countries, buying and selling programmes.</P>
    <P>There is a new market out there if RTE are so concerned about unemployment. There is a new market and they have the resources to get out and find it.  Just think of some of the more popular TV programmes in this country.  &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; and &ldquo;Home and Away&rdquo; are foreign programmes and are very popular. These programmes are getting huge audiences here.  Why can RTE not sell &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; abroad?  Why can they not go to Australia and sell it there, because it is a worth-while programme?  Why can they not get the extra revenue from that? They could go to the UK with it or the other countries.  We are watching German programmes.  Why can they not get &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; interpreted and have Miley speaking German or French, and sell it to French or German stations?  In <Col N="430" /> that way they could get extra revenue and stop crying about job losses and so on.</P>
    <P>What I am most concerned about is this.  I can see the authorities coming in here with the axe and taking it a step further.  I can see them hitting the smaller sections of the community.  I can see them hitting at our heritage, more than likely the cultural programmes, the ceoltas programmes and so on.  The people who are going to shout loudest will be cut off.  All these people will say they cannot get their programmes on the air and RTE will say &ldquo;Blame Burke and blame Fianna Fáil because they introduced it&rdquo;.  That is exactly what will happen and what they will say.  I say to these people: you have a challenge, you are business people, your budget is being cut by maybe £12 million a year, get out there and make up the shortfall on the open market, you have the resources and you have the experience.</P>
    <P>There is something I wanted to say for a good number of years and have not been able to say it.  I have been involved in the entertainment business in this country and in other countries for the past 25 years and I have seen very good young artists.  I remember about 15 years ago trying to get these young people interviews on RTE television and radio RTE were not interested, but if it were a Michael Jackson, Prince or whatever they were very interested indeed.  They neglected our local entertainers.  That is why the Broadcasting Act, 1988, is giving a new opportunity, particularly in the local arena, for these people to make new recordings and get on the airwaves.  It is high time that the Irish people were looked after.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with RTE last week when they had a kind of a work to rule about what is happening &mdash; they said it was a dispute because of this Bill going through the Dáil.  This was one of the excuses given.  That proved to me that these people were acting in a very irresponsible way.  If it were the ESB&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>If this was the view of, say, the ESB, if something went wrong, all they would do is to go around and start pulling switches and say &ldquo;We will make them suffer&rdquo; and, against that, crying &ldquo;Blame Ray Burke, blame the Government&rdquo; or Bord Telecom, for that matter.  I remember when the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were being divided between An Post and Bord Telecom. There were loud screams that there would be fierce unemployment and all the rest of it.  Bord Telecom went in and did their job.  It was a great job and they must be highly complimented.  Now they have one of the best telecommunications systems in the world.  They had a job of work to do.  They did not start whinging or crying.  They just went out and did it. They made fantastic inroads into their business.  RTE should take a look at them.</P>
      <P>The major element which creates a distortion in the market <i>vis-a-vis</i> competing services and RTE is dual funding. While the primary purpose of RTE's State subvention is to enable them to meet certain public service obligations, the effect of the subvention goes beyond that.  It enables RTE to sell their advertising time in effect below cost, thereby creating an artificial domination over the market.  The competing independent stations, whose legal mandate in terms of public service obligation is exactly the same as RTE, are prohibited from that type of funding.  The argument would then have to be made: is that fair play? That is what this Bill is all about, fair play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licence fee that is paid to the Exchequer each year is paid to RTE in the form of a grant by the Department of Communications.  The Minister's description of this is that it is a grant <Col N="432" /> subvention and his explanation is therefore quite correct.  The recent Joint National Listenership Research/Market Research Bureau of Ireland figures are ample evidence of the success of emerging radio stations.  It appears that in an average week over one million of all listeners are now tuning in to one or more of the other independent stations.  The independent stations have to be congratulated on their initiative.  It is a fantastic step forward.</P>

I tried to say many things about RTE over the years but was unable to &mdash; things about unemployment in my area, emigration from my area, the lack of jobs in the area etc.  We were not even listened to, but at least now we will be listened to because we will have our own airwaves.</P>

      <P>This Bill underlines the Government's commitment to fairness, equality and opportunity for all sectors. In particular, section 6 enables the independent radio and television stations to enter into contracts with TV3.  This is another worth-while venture.  I have heard it criticised and people saying, &ldquo;Why <Col N="433" /> TV3?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why have RTE2?&rdquo;.  I will refer to Kerry again.</P>
      <P>We and the people of the west are a deprived race.  Until lately we had RTE1; we barely got RTE2, and very bad reception at that.  All of a sudden we had all these satellites and RTE had to pick themselves up because they were in a competitive market then.  The west carried RTE for a long time, I can tell you, because the eastern side were able to receive all the channels for a good number of years.  The west kept them alive and kept the revenue coming in. Now, we are going to see some fairness and equality and I am glad of that.</P>
      <P>I want to thank RTE for coming down in the recent past and improving the signals in the hills of Kerry.  I am sure all the people in the west of Ireland would appreciate another station since they were denied the other stations like the BBC1, BBC2, UTV and all the rest of them.  In particular I am sure the RTE authorities would have to appreciate and be thankful for section 9 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am fully satisfied that the Minister and his Department have gone into this Bill in depth.  I am quite sure they have seen all the pitfalls it contains and that it is covered well.  I think all in the communications business are protected in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take any private enterprise in this country.  Say, for argument's sake, somebody lost a portion of their business.  Are they going to start crying or are they going to get out there in the market place and find a new market?  As I said earlier, I think the challenge is there for RTE. They can get out and sell our home made programmes abroad and bring in the lost revenue.  I say to RTE: do not cut off our cultural and smaller programmes which are enjoyed by many people &mdash; our language programmes, our Ceóltas programmes, our documentary programmes.  Many people are associated with those programmes, people who are on small contracts with RTE and so on.  I know exactly where the axe will fall, and they are going to make a public outcry about it.  I say if they are honest enough and decent enough people, let <Col N="434" /> them get out there into the market place and bring up the shortfall.  If it happened in any business in this country, in the Smurfit group or in any other group, there would be a call to get rid of the people at the top.  I will refer back to what the Government did when they were forced into their cost cutting programme to try to save the future of the country.  They cut right from the top, from the engineers and the white collar section all the way down.  They did not just go in and take all the workers off the roads in the county councils and so on. They distributed the cuts evenly across the way.  When RTE are getting the knife out to do the cutting I am quite sure, if they look into their hearts, they are going to be fair and reasonable about this.  A sum of £10 million out of a budget of £100 million is a small amount of money.  If it gives the people in this country an opportunity to have a variety of programmes, I feel that that is what should be done.  All my life I have found that competition is the life of trade.  I think the Irish people want a choice, that they will not be forced into listening to one programme, that they can turn on their radio or television to whatever they want.</P>
    <P>There is a saying: if you cannot stick the heat of the kitchen, get out of it.  If they cannot run their authority in a proper fashion and streamline it to deal with the new satellite programmes coming on air, then I think they should retire or resign, get out of the business and let people in there who will do the business for them.  We have plenty of people in the country quite capable of doing that.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why RTE and the Opposition Members of this House are putting up such a determined fight to try to scuttle and upset this legislation that has been badly needed for a number of years.  The Government should be congratulated for bringing the 1988 Bill.  I am delighted that they have the guts and the determination to bring in this legislation.  The last Government during the four years they were in power ran away from their responsibilities by not bringing in legislation and allowing over 70 illegal pirate <Col N="435" /> stations run riot in the country.  At least Minister Burke had the determination and courage to introduce that Bill at the time and now he has the determination as well to introduce this legislation.  I feel confident that this is a move in the right direction.  There are many other things this Government have done in the last number of years.  Even though they were unsavoury and did not look right at the time, if you go back over the track record of this Government since they came into power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course, we never ran away from unsavoury policies.  Of course, they were unsavoury.  I did not want to see job losses in Kerry County Council.  I wanted more jobs in Kerry County Council.  But if you want the country to slide away from us completely and the national debt to go from £12 billion up to £25 billion under a Coalition Government, if we wanted to go in and say &ldquo;Hurrah, hurrah, keep it going, lads, and we will make it £50 billion&rdquo; we could have done that.  But we had a responsibility not alone to ourselves but to the future generations of this country.  If they were unsavoury policies, at least we faced up to them like men and we did not run away from them.  I think this Bill deserves the support not alone of the members on this side of the House but, if you are men enough of the other side of the House as well.</P>

      <P>We certainly heard something this evening when we heard Fianna Fáil boasting and proud of the <Col N="436" /> many unsavoury things they have done in the last few years.  I would like to start by asking: what is the purpose of this Seanad?  What do this Government and you, Minister, see as the purpose of this Seanad?  I understood that the purpose of having a second House was that the Upper Chamber could examine and revise Bills.  Having given them due consideration in an unheated atmosphere, they could reflect on them in a mature way, consider them and then make whatever amendments were necessary.  This has always been the purpose of a second chamber.  It seems to me that that is particularly important when public opinion is so clearly divided on an issue, as is the case with this Broadcasting Bill. I think that nobody will deny that it has been a highly controversial piece of legislation and that there has been a huge public outcry and unprecedented protests. I do not think that the screaming to which Senator Kiely referred has only come from RTE.  Understandably, RTE are unhappy when they realise the motives of the Minister in trying to do them down.  What is different in this case is that the opposition to the Bill has been right across the board, right across all parts of this country.  It has incensed and united the entire Opposition &mdash; and that is something fairly remarkable &mdash; and there were also clearly Government backbenchers who were very unhappy with the legislation when it was introduced.</P>
      <P>I was amused this afternoon to hear the Progressive Democrats Senator, Helen Keogh, referring to the antidemocratic tactics of the Opposition in the Dáil. That is a huge irony, because I think we are all fairly clear that the anti-democratic tactics which are being used are clearly being used by the Fianna Fáil Party to steamroll this Bill through.  They have guillotined the Bill in the Dáil and they would do the same here except that they do not want to have that accusation. Instead, we are going through this charade, I suppose we could call it, of giving the impression that in fact there is mature discussion of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a fundamentally important Bill <Col N="437" /> for the future of Irish society.  I think the way the Minister rushed in here this morning read his script at a gallop, rushed out again, and his whole demeanour during the debate has shown the utter contempt &mdash; I am not referring to the Minister present; I am referring to the Minister for Communications &mdash; and disdain which he clearly shows for this House.  That is something which I greatly resent.</P>
    <P>I endeavoured to ask the Minister a question this morning &mdash; if I knew then that I would have to wait until 8 o'clock to ask the question officially I might have tried even a little harder &mdash; but, of course, the Cathaoirleach refused to allow me to continue or to allow the Minister to reply. I wanted to ask if he was going to allow any amendments to the Bill.  We all know that the answer to that question clearly is, &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  That is why I call this a farce and a charade.</P>
    <P>We come here to discuss Bills.  No matter how serious a flaw there is in the Bill, no matter how worth while an amendments is suggested and no matter how well constructed or well argued it is on Committee Stage we know that no amendment will be allowed because the Minister is determined to get this legislation through as quickly as possible and to try to quell the opposition to it.  I find that extremely frustrating and there is a degree of futility in the whole exercise.</P>
    <P>This is the way dictatorship operates. A dictator does not operate democratically, he simply comes in, says what has to be done and like it or lump it, citizens have to accept it.  We are here, apparently, putting some sort of veneer of respectability on the passage of the legislation, but we all know it is only a charade which is taking place.  I would like to ask the Minister what urgency there is about this legislation.</P>

      <P>I do not mind, even if it is 1,004; it makes no difference to my case that it is abundantly clear that no amendment will be accepted because the Minister is determined that this legislation will go through.  There have been appeals.  If I am proved wrong, I will be the first to apologise.  I hope the Senator is right and that I was wrong.  Sadly, I believe that is not the case.</P>
      <P>There originally appeared to be some urgency when there was a question of trying to save Century Radio, but since that aspect of the Bill was been changed I cannot see now what the unseemly rush is.  I am only repeating what has been said by the Leader of Fine Gael, and other speakers.  It would be the prudent thing, in view of the seriousness of this legislation, to give a time for, perhaps, tempers to cool down, for everybody to take a long and mature look at it during the summer months and to come back here in the autumn to debate the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A highly respected Member of the Seanad, the late Senator Alexis FitzGerald was, I understand respected by all sides of this House for the enormous contribution he made.  I regret that I did <Col N="439" /> not have the opportunity to serve in this House with him.  I read some essays in his memory recently and I would like to quote from them.  He said:</P>
    <P>It is the better Ministers who are prepared to yield to amendments.  The weaker ones, people who do not really comprehend what they are introducing, are afraid to agree to amendments.</P>
    <P>In this case, I do not think any of us would call the Minister for Communications weak and I do not think we could say that he does not really comprehend what he is introducing.  The Minister knows all too well what he is introducing.  Why will he not accept amendments?  What is he afraid of?  I believe we all know.  Quite frankly, he is afraid of public opinion; he is afraid that if he lets this Bill lie until the autumn public opposition will mount and there will be a great deal of downside for the Government.  The best thing is to try to lose as little face as possible, get it through fast and sweep it under the carpet if they feel guilty about it.</P>
    <P>I found it ironic, on reading through some of the Dáil debates, to see that on 29 June the Minister for Communications was appreciative of some comments which were made by his colleagues with regard to his flexibility and willingness to make changes.  The Minister said, according to the Dáil Official Report, on 29 June:</P>
    <P>It is essential in a democracy that Government listen and are flexible to points of view put forward by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>That is very ironic in view of the situation we have here today.  The Government, apparently, pay lip service to the idea of having an Upper Chamber but they treat it with contempt.  That is what we are experiencing at the moment.  I feel that the Progressive Democrats are, perhaps, a little more honest in that they have said they feel the Seanad should be abolished. They have given a frank opinion on that. It is not something I agree with, but if <Col N="440" /> this kind of charade continues I suppose that will be the outcome.</P>
    <P>With regard to more specific items in the Broadcasting Bill, the primary function of radio and television as a communications media is to entertain, inform and to educate amongst other things.  The largest audiences can roughly be divided into, (1) the mass market, (2), local community interests, and (3), minority interest groups.  It is important that all these sectors are catered for.</P>
    <P>I believe that to promote professional excellence in all fields of endeavour competition is vital.  Other speakers have referred to how this worked very successfully in the case of Aer Lingus.  One could give a number of other examples. I, therefore welcome the advent of community radio.  Indeed, like other speakers, I would like to see more done for it. I also welcome the advent of national independent radio and TV.  To have a vibrant, independent sector is a good thing and something which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>As a small nation our aspirations must necessarily be tempered by the financial resources which we have at our disposal. The obvious sources of funding are advertising revenue, licence fees, revenue from sales of home produced programmes abroad and, perhaps, tax on other mass forms of entertainment like video rentals, and so on which could augment funds from licence fees.</P>
    <P>The mass markets and community markets are, presumably, the areas which are of primary interest to advertisers. It is, therefore, logical that radio and television, whether State or private, catering for these demands should and can be funded exclusively from advertising revenue.  This is not the case where we have radio and TV catering for what I call the minority interests. Minority interests are the Irish language, for which Senator Pól Ó Foighil made such an impassioned case earlier on, music, other than pop music, drama, current affairs, education, information and so on.  These have to be funded by a combination of advertising and licence fees.  I believe, along with many other <Col N="441" /> speakers on this side of the House, that these areas have been very well served by public broadcasting by Radio Éireann and by RTE as it is now.</P>
    <P>The commercial stations would not be interested in these areas because they are not viable, are not income generated and, so, they will steer away from them.  One of the good things &mdash; we hear a great deal about the quality of life in Ireland and it is something we all appreciate &mdash; has been the standard of broadcasting of our television and radio stations.  Senator Kiely spoke at some length about the need to have a range of options.</P>
    <P>I know when one goes to the Continent or, more particularly, to the United States, one can go into one's hotel bedroom and receive anything up to 40 channels, all equally bad, I feel that is what will happen here.  The standard of our broadcasting will go down.  We need to ensure, by whatever means we can, the future of quality broadcasting in Ireland. RTE need both the licence fee and the revenue from advertising if they are to be able to invest in the kind of quality programmes we have come to appreciate. I feel certain, with the passage of this Bill, that RTE will be obliged either to reduce quality or fail financially.  They simply will not be able to keep up the standard of programmes given the curtailment of their financial resources.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely also exhorted RTE to go out and canvass the markets abroad and to be entrepreneurial.  Many of us feel that RTE were formally something of a bureaucratic institution.  We know that they were in a loss making situation. However, when challenged, they turned themselves around and are now a financially solid operation.  They responded creatively to that challenge.  They increased the number of hours of broadcasting, they have very good ratings. They increased the home produced programmes by 40 per cent.  They have done precisely what they were asked to do but now we intend to go out and crucify them because they have been successful.  This <Col N="442" /> is not very encouraging for other semi-State companies; it would be very worrying for them.  It is now intended to penalise their success by capping their advertising and reducing their advertising time to five minutes per hour.  That will represent a reduction in their income of between £10 and £12 million.  This will have the effect of destroying their revenue base.  The licence fee will not be allowed to increase.  That will remain static.  While I believe they will do everything they can to face the challenge, and although they have been streamlined considerably, RTE cannot go on endlessly without a reduction in the quality of their service.  We will find shorter hours, there will be fewer RTE made drama and documentaries, fewer home produced programmes, and we will find ourselves watching night after night the Dallas type programmes which I despise.  We should expect our national broadcasting company to come up with something better.</P>
    <P>How will the RTE Symphony Orchestra be able to keep going?  Will they be hammered as a result of this?  The most disheartening thing about the whole Bill is the way initiative in RTE will be stifled. This must be very demoralising for the staff.  If the staff in RTE protested, something Senator Kiely seemed to resent, I do not think that is to their detriment.  If they did anything else we would be critical of them.  It is up to them to go out and fight their corner as best they can. The same applies to those in RTE who are worried that there will be job losses. We cannot expect them to take that sitting down and not do everything they can to reverse the situation.  There will be very little incentive left in RTE.  They probably feel, no matter what they do at this stage, that they are doomed.  In the view of the general ideology of Fianna Fáil, which normally is to encourage enterprise and entrepreneurial spirit, this aspect of the Bill seems to be very antienterprise.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of independent commercial radio but I do not think it should be at the cost of the demise of our public service broadcasting.  People have mentioned that in the UK the BBC only have <Col N="443" /> licence fees and that ITV only have advertising revenue.  They want to know why the same thing cannot happen here. Quite clearly the population differences have a bearing on this.  We are talking about £20 million in licence fees there. Obviously it is unrealistic to make a comparison between that level of revenue and what the position is here.  People have spoken of RTE having a monopoly.  RTE have to compete with a number of other stations, UTV, BBC1, BBC2, Channel 4, Sky, etc.  It is not realistic to say, therefore, that RTE are in a monopoly situation.</P>
    <P>I presume we will continue to rely on RTE to project the cultural identity of this country &mdash; that is extremely important as Ireland takes its place in the EC &mdash; and that they will project it beyond even the EC to other parts of the world. The issue, therefore, is one of promotion. I am speaking of the promotion of our national culture.  That is something extremely important in regard to national identity.  We also depend on RTE to develop the export potential of our native industry in home produced programmes of international quality.  That is extremely important for our image abroad.  It is a subject that has been touched on by other speakers.</P>
    <P>It was mooted in the Dáil that there should be a broadcasting policy review council which would monitor standards and endeavour to maintain good taste. While I support the idea of editorial freedom, I believe there should be some specific reference in the Bill to the responsibilities this freedom entails.  The moral and social fabric of our society is the prime concern of all of us and is important for the welfare and the happiness of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The cost in both human and financial terms, indeed, of abandoning standards of social behaviour is very obvious in those countries where an amoral philosophy prevails.  We have seen in this country a worrying increase in things such as drug addiction, pregnancies outside marriage, teenage drinking and a range of other problems.  These are areas which <Col N="444" /> parents are understandably concerned about.  It is important that we do not allow our broadcasting to undermine our youth, I am not proposing any excessive restrictions but the trend to trivialise and destroy fundamental values for entertainment value, while offering nothing else in their place, is of great concern.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Minister will have control of the licence fee and of the total revenue of RTE and is at the moment penalising RTE.  It is hard in that context to see how RTE can remain independent and impartial in regard to the Government of the day and how they can be objective.  I suspect the outcome of this Bill will be that we will end up with the worst of both worlds, with both public and private broadcasting services in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in my view, is an attack on RTE which I believe to be one of the fundamental organs of this State.  I urge the Minister again to reconsider this matter.  The Bill should not be rushed through.  Its potential for reasserting national values and maintaining and improving our already high standards of broadcasting is too important an opportunity to miss for the sake of some obscure deadline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not questioning the reason the Minister was not here, I am glad he is back.  Listening to the debate over the past few hours I am amazed at the element of shock, surprise and horror expressed by Fianna Fáil Senators and, in particular, a PD Senator and their wild accusations that this side of the House are being exceptionally confrontational, aggressive and out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very serious issue.  I can honestly say that this side of the House are <Col N="445" /> not just expressing our own fears and our views; we cannot be totally off-course when the country at large is crying out, not because of hype or because they are inflamed in some rather unconstitutional way but because they really are alarmed and shocked at this legislation.  They are alarmed at the whole sad passage of the Bill through the Dáil and now that it has been presented to us here.</P>
    <P>This Broadcasting Bill is a threat to democracy.  Senators on the other side of the House will find my remarks difficult to accept.  This controversy began when the Taoiseach, who was disappointed and bewildered at losing the election, blamed RTE.  It is common knowledge, it is not something we are picking up from the street, we cannot all be wrong, there are investigative journalists, there is an organ of communication, people think, even though at times the Government would prefer that they did not.  When the RTE programme &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; were looking at the health cuts apparently the Taoiseach was not happy at the presentation of his comments, when he said that he was not aware that the health cuts were so severe and were affecting the people.  I am informed by an RTE employee &mdash; I have no reason to doubt his sincerity or to suggest that he was lying to me because I do not think he would have anything to gain from it &mdash; that a senior Government Minister stated &mdash; I will not use the exact quotation, I will substitute a word because decorum prevents me &mdash; that they would square RTE.  At that time RTE were blamed by the Government for the drop in the opinion polls.  I do not know why Senators on the other side seem to think this is something that has been fabricated the past few days.  That is why I am so concerned.</P>
    <P>There are Third World countries, perhaps not always Third World countries, socialist countries in the past with dictatorial regimes, where Presidents have sought to cut down organs of communication. I interpret this Broadcasting Bill in the first form as put before the Dáil as doing the same thing.  Though some amendments have been made they <Col N="446" /> have done little to improve what I consider a most insidious and invidious piece of legislation.  It is interesting that, while various motions have been proposed in the Seanad and the Dáil, lauding and applauding the new wave of democracy from the frontiers of Russia right across Europe, we in Ireland seem to be going in the opposite direction.  Generally we can be very casual and very blasé in relation to the rights and the freedoms we enjoy but the general public are aware of the insidious effect of interference with an organ of communication.</P>
    <P>Television over the past few decades has done much to inform people that there is a world outside, that there is Europe, that there are global problems, that there are Third World problems, that at the end of the day we are no longer an island but are part of Europe.  An example over the past few days has been the GATT talks; luckily some of our fears in that regard have subsided to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>I regard the efforts by the Government in this Bill to control and to stifle legitimate criticism and objective reporting as most ominous.  I said we are rather blasé as a nation about our rights and rather casual about our constitutional rights and our rights under the United Nations Charter of Human Rights.  One of them, which is relevant to this debate, is freedom of expression.  I intepret that as freedom of expression on the airwaves.  The Bill, as presented originally to the Dáil, in relation to the make-up of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the RTE Authority with Fianna Fáil majority representation, is a most important aspect, in relation to the question of political involvement in broadcasting.  It is one of the areas that has not been discussed and debated because of the other aspects of the Bill which overshadow it.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have seen through the arrogance of the Government and they have rallied spontaneously to the defence of our public broadcasting system.  It has not just incensed the workers of RTE, it has incensed the country, every single interest group and it has even incensed <Col N="447" /> the newspapers.  Despite the fact that it is a <i>fait accompli,</i> that it will pass through the Seanad, I do not think this controversy will die during the summer months. Of course at that stage it will be too late; we will all live to rue the day.  It may be many months, it may be even years before we will feel the full effects.  It is a pity the Bill was not completely withdrawn; there is still time for the Minister to withdraw it.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the specifics, the commercial and financial implications of the Bill.  There is the impact, first of all, on RTE of the reduced advertising time and the cap on revenue.  The structure of the RTE advertisement sales allocation and placement of advertising is very complicated. I was not fully aware of the complexity.  In one way the controversial nature of the Bill has caused people to become more aware of the structures within RTE, something we have taken for granted.  The structures are obviously achieving maximum revenue when audience levels are high.  It is commercial business.  The present hourly authorised levels of advertising are six minutes, 10 per cent on average and the maximum level, seven minutes at 12.5 per cent.  The proposals will reduce the overall level by 25 per cent and at peak viewing time by 33? per cent.</P>
    <P>As an example, on one of the major programmes with a very high TAM rating, the revenue derived from each &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; will be reduced by £28,000 approximately.  Obviously that will have an influence on the quality of the programme from now on.  With the proposed time reductions and the reduction in the advertising per hour there is doubt whether RTE can reach the cap levels in the short term.  If the linkage is to be maintained, obviously, it should relate to more flexible air time proposals.</P>
    <P>What RTE, particularly, will be looking for over the next two years with regard to phasing would be that the impact of this Bill would be reviewed after two years.</P>
    <P>The structure of RTE advertising is <Col N="448" /> such that they do not force advertisers to buy advertising time.  Advertising is carried on both radio and television because advertisers want to advertise their wares.  Good programmes make for good audiences and good advertising. You can take that cycle whatever way you like.  If you have good revenue that, obviously, gives you scope and potential for good programme making.  If you have good programmes, you are obviously going to have good audiences.  No matter what way you take that cycle it refers back to revenue.</P>
    <P>I also wish to look at the video and film companies.  They will be caught on two fronts.  First, there will be the loss of advertisements being made for television, and, secondly, their product will not be bought by RTE due to lack of finance.  Going back to the loss to advertising agencies, commission comes to £8 million, with £1 million to each of the three leading companies advertising with RTE, and <i>pro rata</i> to the other companies depending on the amount of advertising. We are really talking about quite sizeable amounts.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at Senator Kiely's reference to the fact that £10 million to £12 million is just a drop in the ocean of the overall budget.  I believe that £10 million to £12 million is a tremendous amount of money to RTE &mdash; or to any organisation &mdash; they have been scrimping and saving in local authorities.  I am amazed that he trivialises £12 million as if it were just a drop in the ocean.  I am sure if Kerry County Council had £12 million cut from their budget Senator Kiely would be in here screaming and looking to the Government to reinstate that £12 million as fast as possible.  He must be a very wealthy man if he can speak so flippantly of £12 million and say it does not matter one way or another.</P>
    <P>The advertisers themselves at the very least, would incur expense and inconvenience in finding other means of marketing their wares if they cannot advertise on RTE.  At worst, they will find their product sales down and new product launches difficult because of less effective media presentation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> Another specific relates to sponsorship. It is interesting that the whole country lauded RTE for its excellent coverage of the World Cup.  We could not but notice Bord Gáis advertising, day in day out.  They paid £100,000 for that spot.  It certainly was money well spent from their point of view.  They took a chance.  They could not know in advance that the World Cup was going to become such a singularly successful event for Ireland.  We are talking about a State company which showed flair and innovation.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another sponsorship, that is the weather forecasts by Bord Telecom.  They too showed initiative and made the weather forecasts far more attractive than they had been.  They are far more relevant to the ordinary man and woman in the street.  I am afraid, within the sponsorship area, that this sponsorship will get the hatchet.  That income was very relevant and important to RTE.  There was a double gain, both for the State companies and, obviously, for the audience.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that much more has not been made of job losses.  People seem to think &mdash; and the impression is given &mdash; that the idea of job losses is something that might happen and that it is just a case of crying wolf, we might as well cry &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; now because we are going to lose all of these jobs.  During the week we saw the successful settlement of the Waterford Crystal dispute.  It was interesting to note the similarity between RTE and Waterford Crystal in the sense that they have approximately the same number of employees; this puts it in the context of a business.  They are employing over 2,000 people.  The loss of the so-called trivial £12 million can only be accommodated by a reduction in the numbers of people employed.</P>
    <P>I would again refer to Senator Kiely who said over and over again that he was worried about the loss of jobs for the county council workers in his beloved Kerry.  He must have had some input into the fact that there may not have been county council jobs lost in Kerry, but county council workers certainly lost <Col N="450" /> their jobs in Limerick.  These jobs were essential.  When we are talking about RTE we are talking about a reduction in the number of people employed.  That is a fact.  I am sure everybody will be monitoring the staff numbers between now and next year and over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>The normal commercial way of dealing with this type of loss would be to achieve two-thirds by cuts &mdash; £8 million in salaries and one-third, or £4 million, in general expenditure.  I am not an accountant or an economist &mdash; but I believe that actually leads to the loss of 400 jobs.  Even if half the jobs were saved, and if the saving was £6 million in general expenditure, that would still leave 300 jobs being lost.  Unless RTE have plans for compulsory redundancy, accommodating the reduction of these numbers, I do not see how these jobs can be saved.  To maintain the competitive thrust which has enabled RTE to improve programming, to cut costs and to clear all their debts, it is essential that there would be a review, after two years, of the whole commercial aspect.</P>
    <P>It is interesting &mdash; and extraordinary in a sense too &mdash; that RTE in making a profit have been penalised.  I find this rather ironic.  A new commandment introduced in the last few weeks seems to be: &ldquo;do not make a profit at all costs, because profits mean trouble, particularly for State companies, and if you do we will cut you off next year&rdquo;.  Where is the incentive to bother if you are to be penalised for being successful?  Why not phase out the licence revenue altogether and tell RTE to operate as a commercial venture.  It is interesting that they have a record of not owing one penny to the Exchequer.  That is extraordinary and mindboggling.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to regional coverage and to make a plea to the Minister, whatever happens in the future, that RTE in Limerick will not be adversely affected. Over the last 12 months this coverage has really improved enormously because of the personnel there.  This improvement happily has been married with the boom in the city.  There has been plenty of scope <Col N="451" /> for coverage.  Many people have suddenly found Limerick on the map.  Once upon a time Limerick was the Confraternity city and there was all sorts of scare-mongering of Reds under the bed, there was no great effort to welcome foreigners, and all sorts of extraordinary biased and prejudiced comments in relation to Limerick.</P>
    <P>I have to applaud RTE &mdash; and RTE Limerick in particular &mdash; for creating a far more positive picture for the city, and for the mid-west in particular.  I applaud the efforts of regional coverage of RTE Limerick.  Next Friday night RTE are launching their regional coverage.  I would be very sad to think that they are launching something which might be closed shortly after it opens.  I would hope that regional representation of coverage will not be hit by any cutbacks.  I know how strongly Senator Honan feels about regional coverage.  She would not like the mid-west to be left to flounder, as it has been doing in the past, through lack of RTE coverage.  It is a service in an area where the private sector coverage survive, and do not want to be involved.  I would liken it to Iarnród Éireann, or CIE, who have offered a service in the past to remote areas where commercial transport companies would not bother travelling to see that Mrs. So-and-so six or seven miles down a cul-de-sac would get to where she wants to go.  There are still many isolated areas in Limerick, Clare and so on.  Everybody likes to see his own &ldquo;cabbage patch&rdquo; covered by RTE.  That coverage is very much appreciated by people living in remote areas.  After all, they have President Gorbachev in their front parlours.  They also have coverage of what is happening locally, which is far more relevant to their lives than many world events.  That service is a vital organ of communication in these isolated communities.</P>
    <P>I would again urge the Minister to take the concept of decentralisation to heart. Again, citing the Limerick area, I am alarmed that the Progressive Democrats Minister for Industry and Commerce seems to want to axe the whole concept <Col N="452" /> of decentralisation in relation to his attitude to SFADCo.  I am drawing the parallels because regionalisation does not seem to be important any more.  At a time when Europe is telling us that we must have regionalisation, we seem to be going backwards.  The regional aspects of RTE are going to cost money, although not a huge amount.  I am afraid those regional areas will be vulnerable.</P>
    <P>In the Limerick area, RTE provide employment for up to 12 people.  If one multiplies that by the six other regions we are talking of about 70 jobs.  Seventy people may not seem a huge number but they are extraordinarly important in their own areas.  Those 70 people provide a service to the remote areas.  They have their noses to the ground.  They cover everything.  They are not specialists in one specific area.  They are covering everything within those regions.  If the costs in six regions were to be multiplied by £150,000 &mdash; which apparently is the approximate cost for running a regional service &mdash; we are talking about approximately £1 million.  That is a very important £1 million, or should be to Senator Kiely.  Let us hope that the £12 million that he is so casual about will be left intact, and the £1 million will not be taken from it.  If we are to think in terms of the Limerick region we are talking about the service there in 12 months carrying 300 news packages.  The past 12 months has been exceptionally successful. I would plead with the Minister to decentralise the service.  It seems that where there is competition, it is not accepted.  I will go back again to the Progressive Democrats Minister for the area, who when there was competition between SFADCo and the IDA did not seem to like it.  Now, where there is an element of competition within the Broadcasting Bill it seems to cause problems.</P>
    <P>What other areas are going to be affected?  Many speakers have referred to them.  We have had proposals for an Irish language channel.  Of course, Seanadóir Ó Foighil gave us much food for thought with his interesting contribution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> We are all now aware of the demise of the Irish language, and the efforts that he is making to revive it.  We all applaud his efforts to keep the Irish language alive and well within Seanad Éireann.  Many Senators across the House will make the effort too.  The need for an Irish language channel is increasing, not just in the Gaeltacht areas but throughout the length and breadth of the country.  We should make a concerted effort in this House and all 60 Senators should contribute at least 15 minutes in Irish, as was done during the debate on the establishment of Telefís na Gaeltachta.  I am sure all Senators could make an effort to keep the Irish language alive.  They should do so now by looking for an Irish language channel.  The operating cost would be between £6 million and £8 million.  That sum may be part of Senator Kiely's £12 million, which he so flippantly dismissed as being of no importance.</P>
    <P>Our National Symphony Orchestra, which costs £2 million, is something I would hate to see go, especially now that we have the National Concert Hall.  It is extraordinary that there is still a tremendous lack of planning.  We build our concert hall and we are delighted with it in our capital city, both from an aesthetic viewpoint in relation to the building itself and the aesthetics of music.  I hope that our National Symphony Orchestra is not in jeopardy.  We also have our national choral society.  The members of the National Symphony Orchestra are not just there for love of music; it is their bread and butter.  I am sure they are there primarily for love of music, but they have to live.  I am sure they are shivering in fear and trepidation lest their future might be in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>With reference to the RTE Players, they are bringing tremendous entertainment to people living alone and to people in hospital.  Some patients tune into RTE Radio 1 and look forward to the tremendously high standard of drama that RTE produce.  They produce Irish plays and not necessarily Chekov.</P>
    <P>I hope that programmes like &ldquo;Looking West&rdquo; with Jim Fahy are not in jeopardy. Think of the audience he has, think of <Col N="454" /> the culture that has been preserved in the more remote parts of our country, think of the taped conversations and recordings he has made of the most extraordinarily interesting people.  That brings radio back to the individual.  I hope that in a united Europe &mdash; politically, economically and otherwise &mdash; we will not lose sight of our Irishness and our values. To me they are encapsulated in many of the programmes that Senators today enumerated.  We could think of Ciarán Mac Mathúna, a Limerick man who certainly does not think parochially.  His programme on Sunday morning has done much for the cultural aspects of the country.  I will refer to Senator Paschal Mooney, to whom I tune in very often. He has done a tremendous amount to link up with our emigrants, not in Britain alone, but throughout the world.  He is compulsive listening for many of us.  I even know when his programmes are on, tune in, and often comment on what I would like to hear.  I hope I will be able to continue to listen to Senator Paschal Mooney's harmonious and eloquent tones.  He is less confrontational when he is on the airwaves than in the House.  He has a pleasant entertaining side which we see, too, in this House, but which we particularly hear on radio.  I hope he will not be cut out as a result of the loss of £12 million that Senator Kiely dismissed so quickly a few moments ago.</P>
    <P>We also have the Thomas Davis lectures. There is something for everybody on RTE Radio culturally, from an historical and archaeological viewpoint. There are the most extraordinary programmes. There are programmes relating to medical coverage and there are some excellent programmes on Sunday. We have a marvellous RTE, whether it is radio or television.  People who come here on holidays find it extraordinary that such a small country, with a small population and on such a small budget, can entertain so widely and in such quality.</P>
    <P>May I make a reference to costs? Millions and millions of pounds are spent by BBC on their news coverage.  I have the costs and will refer to them again. Their &ldquo;Newsnight&rdquo; budget alone is <Col N="455" /> greater than the full budget of RTE for news.  I can tune into RTE news or BBC news, but I certainly opt for RTE.  We do not fully appreciate what we have.</P>
    <P>If you look through our specialist correspondents, the name on everybody's lips at the moment is Orla Guerin.  She started off in the <i>Limerick Post,</i> the local paper in Limerick.  It is a free newspaper and is put through all the letter boxes. Her reporting was excellent.  We knew that she was not going to stay very long before she found her way to more important channels of communication.  Now she is our Eastern European correspondent. She is excellent.  I can see Orla Guerin coming back.  I do not think she will have to come back to the <i>Limerick Post,</i> but I think she will be snapped up immediately by international media coverage, who will see her potential as a broadcaster and as an excellent correspondent.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to a past student of mine, Ann Daly, whose rise to fame was associated very much with being in El Salvador at the time of the murder of Archbishop Romero.  She is on RTE very regularly.  She has given us enormous enjoyment, although I suppose I would not call it &ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo; in relation to her coverage of Third World countries. She gave us a most extraordinary appraisal last week of the disaster in Iran. Will these excellent communicators have to be sent on their way and snapped up by other stations maybe here, or ITV, or Welsh TV, the BBC or whatever?  You are talking about European networks because these girls have foreign languages. That is why they are where they are.  I worry about their future.</P>
    <P>What about the specialist correspondents? Will we find that, for instance, in the mid-west the particular RTE employee there will have to be a jack-of-all-trades?  Will he have to cover agricultural issues?  Will he have to cover all the areas which have news coverage? Will the specialist correspondents have to go?  The budget for news coverage for the BBC is £120 million.  It covers salaries and production costs.  The budget for <Col N="456" /> RTE is £5 million.  The budget for &ldquo;Newsnight&rdquo; on BBC is £6 million, for just one programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking if the quality of news coverage will suffer?  Will our excellent correspondents be lured to more lucrative territories?  May I refer to charitable organisations which have special concessions at present from RTE for their advertisements?  People in this country have a special feel for those who are less well off than themselves.  I am thinking particularly of coverage in relation, for instance, to famine in Ethiopia or to famine and poverty in Sudan. The advertisements that are carried are related to local charities but they are also related to non-Government organisations who certainly could not advertise as frequently as they do unless they had reduced costs from RTE.  I know the Minister recommended yesterday that the extra 30 seconds allocated could be given to charities.  A recommendation is fine but will the Minister be able to make that statutory?  I do not expect he will. We are again going against the tide of public opinion, where the people respond so well &mdash; and always have &mdash; to the needs of the less well off.  Perhaps they will not be as aware of the need for funding if those advertisements are not as frequent as they have been.  There was a comment that newspapers find advertising far more lucrative than television coverage.  I would question that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably true, but I am not sure.  The actual starkness of the advertisements in relation to Third World crises &mdash; and in relation to all charities, it does not have to be Third World &mdash; really switches on a consumer society. We are all consumers.  We have other things to do with our money, but we are reminded over and over again by the harrowing pictures and by the continual <Col N="457" /> appeals that we get at 6.25 p.m. on Sundays and at other times, too.  The slots are filled by well known personnel who get across to the general public the crisis and poverty in particular parts of this country and, I suppose, more so in Third World countries.  I hope that those advertisements will not diminish as a result of cutbacks.  That is a very important consideration.</P>
      <P>As the mother of a teenage daughter who is permanently clued in on a &ldquo;Walkman&rdquo; to 2FM, I know that all that matters to her is 2FM.  It is the most listened to radio station in the country.  Opinion polls have shown that.  The public are very pleased.  I do not know why the Minister sought to restructure it.  I do not know why he targeted this station. I would use the word &ldquo;manipulation&rdquo;. Perhaps he feels that most of our young people have gone, and that there is no longer an audience for 2FM.  It is not just young people who tune in.  By Gerry Ryan's coverage we know that he is a second runner in relation to huge TAM ratings on radio.  It disturbs me that something that is so successful has to have restructuring.  Whether we do or do not like pop music &mdash; I like it to a degree but I certainly would not go around with a &ldquo;Walkman&rdquo; day in and day out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Paschal Mooney and he gives us a certain element of pop music, which is sufficient in RTE1.  I listen to 2FM for their hourly news coverage, which sometimes gives news that we do not get on RTE1.  I would also listen to some pop music, but I can honestly say that the young poulation of this country listen to 2FM all the time.  They are the spenders and the people who will tune in and will increase TAM ratings.  They are the people towards whom the advertisers on 2FM are gearing themselves.  It is all to do with money at the end of the day. The advertisers would not be going on 2FM if they were not getting value for money.  They are geared towards the young wage earners who have no family responsibility as yet and who have huge spending power.  They will buy the jeans, tapes and the consumer products which are the flavour of the month.  I am afraid <Col N="458" /> that any restructuring of 2FM will lose more revenue.  So why does the Minister think in terms of restructuring it?</P>
    <P>RTE has been a shining light as a semi-State company.  It should be praised for its success and enterprise.  I must refer to the ambivalent attitude of the partners in Government &mdash; the Progressive Democrats. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is from the Limerick East constituency.  Obviously I read his comments on the local newspaper as well as hearing him on the regional coverage on local radio.  He makes no secret of his &mdash; I do not know whether to use the word &mdash; hostility or the word, antipathy.  State enterprises seem to be anathema to him. RTE have improved sufficiently, which is something that the Minister is always looking for and always seeking.  Surely when RTE have improved their profits and competitiveness they should be applauded, rather then denigrated.  I find the ambivalence disturbing.</P>
    <P>As regards Century it is extraordinary that in the whole debate it tends to be the forgotten Cinderella. The survival plan to rescue Century has turned sour. Hopefully Century will not be allowed to collapse.  All that was needed was an injection of capital and it could have been given, as was suggested by Fine Gael, in the form of a temporary borrowing from the proceeds of licence fees, even up to 5 per cent of the annual total of the £45 million which would be £2.25 million. This could have been made available, free of interest, to alternative radio to ensure that it would not collapse.  All they needed was a once off payment to help them get over their teething problems.  I ask the question: where goes Century now?</P>
    <P>The Minister may be sorry he did not set up an independent review body.  It is not just now an option for the Minister, it is &mdash; I hope the words do not contradict each other &mdash; an imperative option. &ldquo;Option&rdquo; surely is the wrong word.  If the Minister set up an independent review body it would indicate his willingness to undo, although at this stage I feel it is impossible to do so, the damage done <Col N="459" /> to date.  It would surely be the vehicle through which we &mdash; Government, Opposition, RTE and the general public &mdash; could be assured that broadcasting would be an independent organ of communication, free from political infiltration, a concept we cherish very much in our democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepts the diversion of £12 million as a projected loss, but he does not call it a loss.  He uses the rather euphemistic term, &ldquo;the diversion&rdquo;.  He states that it will be up to the different media &ldquo;to earn their share of this diverted revenue on the merit of their own worth and relative cost attractiveness&rdquo;.  I find those extraordinary words when RTE have merited, and shown, their worth. Why is it something that has to be done now when it has already been done?  He selects 1988 when there was a heavy load on RTE, and he cites the programmes that cost them quite a bit.  He referred to the broadcasting hours, higher programming standards, the fact that we staged the Eurovision Song Contest, the fact that there was extensive coverage of the European Championship in West Germany and extensive coverage of the Olympic Games in Seoul.  He says that at that time the station, though it incurred considerable costs, turned in a surplus of £5.3 million.  He then spoke about a new corporate environment created by the Bill.  They are buzz words.  I do not like the word &ldquo;corporate&rdquo;.  It is a very vague term.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that RTE should develop a whole new set of strategic goals.  It is reminiscent of typical IDA language &mdash; job projections and what not.  I hate those words because they are ambiguous.  They are generalisations. They are theoretical and they are conceptual. We are not interested in that type of language because it cloaks the reality that all those pious aspirations actually cost money.  This is the problem all the time.  We are beginning to see through that type of mid-Atlantic terminology and buzzwords.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that this legislation will consolidate RTE's position as our <Col N="460" /> prime broadcaster.  He is looking for innovative pioneering thinking.  There is no need for him to look for that because it was innovative pioneering thinking that brought RTE to the level at which they are today.  Of course, we can always be more innovative and pioneering, but they are the qualities that RTE are being penalised for having.  He states that he has confidence in the organisation and staff and that they are equal to the challenge. They are sublime sentiments.  I call them theoretical rather than practical. The Minister is turning a blind eye to the necessity for continued capital to do this.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this Bill.  It has become a burning issue and will be remembered in the same way as the euphoric response of the Irish people to the World Cup will be remembered. Every time the people remember the World Cup coverage, they will also think of the Broadcasting Bill.  If the Minister could find it in his heart to begin again on the well worn analogy of the level playing pitch, he would have the full support and sympathy of the people for his commitment towards maintaining RTE as it should be, an organ of communication, not a medium that can be manipulated, which is what was being sought in relation to the drafting of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, though not the Bill he brings with him.  I remember last week we were discussing a different Bill, the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, which the Minister introduced under his other portfolio and, on that occasion, I welcomed the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister was not here to hear the complimentary remarks I made in his direction.  It is strange that the Minister should be complimented for the production of good legislation in the area of justice and bad legislation in the area of communications.  Maybe there is a lesson there in that the same Minister should not be responsible for the Department of Justice and the Department of Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a dastardly Bill.  It is not so much a Broadcasting Bill as it is an act <Col N="461" /> of vandalism against RTE.  It is a major attack on free, independent broadcasting under a different guise.  It undermines the role that has been pursued by RTE in their public broadcasting function.  It is, for the first time, placing a major question mark over RTE's viability, as a public broadcasting service.  I regard it as nothing less than scandalous that RTE should be treated in this fashion.  In terms of the presentation of the legislation, the suddenness of how it came about in the first instance and how it was dealt with is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>When we are dealing with something as important as the national broadcasting service and the extension of broadcasting that is no way to do business.  I am afraid I do not see it as something that is not organised, confused or ill-directed but rather as very carefully prepared legislation in terms of both the philosophy behind it and the direct intent of the specifics in it.  I do not regard it as something that appeared out of the blue in terms of the activities and philosophies of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats since coming to Government. There is a Government policy in the context of privatisation which has come to the fore in recent months.  We have seen an example of that in Aer Lingus where Ryanair were given a specific section of Aer Lingus to ensure that they would be able to conduct their own independent commercial activities.  They were given a monopoly of a section of Aer Lingus air routes.  This was changing the playing fields to suit a private company which could only happen in a country like Ireland.  That is the perception of how a free market operates.</P>
    <P>There is an element of privatisation in relation to semi-State bodies.  It has been extended to another area such as Irish Life.  Cablelink has already been hived off to Bord Telecom and the intention is to hive off Bord Telecom to the highest bidder as well.  We heard recently that public transport is due for fragmentation, again to be sold to the highest bidder.</P>
    <P>There is a vendetta against RTE in this respect.  It is not something new.  RTE has been a scapegoat for many years now <Col N="462" /> in the Fianna Fáil perception of public broadcasting.  RTE does not toe the line. RTE has exercised its independence to an inordinate degree and because of that it has misbehaved.  It has not followed the traditional Fianna Fáil ethos of subservience. Consequently, it will be punished for that.  It was quite clearly indicated under the Lemass Government what should be the role of a public broadcasting service.  It should be one of subservience, not one of independent broadcasting.</P>

      <P>The education of public opinion being however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or mortality or the authority of the State.</P>

      <P>Do not forget &ldquo;including criticism of Government policy&rdquo;.  Part of the function of the broadcasting media is to be able to criticise not just the Government but the Opposition and other sectors. It must have the freedom to do so and be independent; otherwise we would live in a State we had too much experience of some decades ago.  We saw what happened in totalitarian states, whether they be of the right or the left.  I hold no brief for either and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We must take cognisance of that fact that there is nothing worse than a totalitarian state where freedom of information is constrained.  We have seen examples of that.  It happened in some of the largest countries in the world. It is an easy role to fall into.  Our Constitution specifically provides that in terms of the organs of public opinion, the radio, the press, etc. reserve the right of liberty of expression, and that includes criticism of Government policy.  That is extremely important.</P>
      <P>The Government of the day introduced section 31 into the Broadcasting Act as they were quite entitled to do and indeed they were duty bound to do so under the Constitution, when there was a threat to public order, morality or the authority of the State, but that was done for the good of the people.  That was done because there was a threat to the State, to public order and to public morality.  It was not done because of the specific perception of the functions of RTE by a specific political party.  That is a horse of a different colour.  One is talking on the one hand about the interests of the country and, on the other, about the interests of a political party.  While RTE has the function of communicating and providing information, it must be free to do so without undue constraints.  It must not be influenced or controlled by political factors.</P>
      <P>I will give an example in that context. The <i>Irish Press</i> was established in 1931 for what at that time seemed a very good reason.  Fianna Fáil were a very radical organisation and had very fine policies, for example, their social policy in relation to the distribution of wealth and equity in our society, in that day and age and it was very difficult for them to get the then organs of the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that it is his function to establish choice and competition in the area of broadcasting and in the media generally.  He says this is an international trend.  Of course competition is good.  We all know that.  He says that it is his duty to level the playing field and ensure that fair competition is allowed.  The theory sounds good but in the background to the theory, there are a lot of other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE was taken on to some extent by the pirates in the eighties, a number of whom were very successful in the areas on which they focused.  They showed up the vulnerability of RTE in terms of popular music and popular programmes, <Col N="465" /> this is the catalyst behind this development. The Coalition in the mid-eighties wrangled over the type of broadcasting that would be introduced.  They were committed to the principle but they wrangled over it because the Labour Party wanted strict community broadcasting.  It caused problems within the parties at the time.  The pirates have been used us the excuse to impose limits on RTE.  Since Deputy Burke became Minister for Communications, limitations were introduced in the context of the Independent Radio and Television Commission which was set up to organise the introduction of commercial radio and television.  Its membership was chock-a-block with Fianna Fáil supporters.  More recently we have seen attempts by the Minister to nobble the RTE Authority, and all of that has been to introduce commercial radio which would be more favourably disposed to that party than RTE.  That is where we come to Century Radio.</P>
    <P>Century was the high flier.  Century was the great new consortium that was going to take on RTE and prove it could all be done commercially.  Now you had a satisfactory form of broadcasting that was favourable to the Government, and you were onto a winner.  The national franchise went to Oliver Barry's consortium. There were big names and big money in Century and it was expected to go from strength to strength.  Unfortunately the opposite happened.  It was a disaster. Century was badly organised, badly funded and badly capitalised.  It did not research the market properly.  It did not identify what its strengths were or where RTE's weaknesses lay.  It tried to do too much too quickly and fell between two stools.  Consequently, Century had an enormous debt after its brief period in operation.  Century is going to the wall in terms of its inability to operate independently. In other words, it has been a commercial failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to any of the independent stations.  It is desirable that the independent stations should be successful.  Anything I say in respect of what has been happening is not a criticism of the policy to extend broadcasting licences.  I am not saying that at all.  I am talking about this legislation which has been introduced for a reason which is not quite proper in the context of a particular broadcasting station. Century came a cropper because it did not identify its audience and did not get its act together.  Perhaps it is improving now; good and well if it is.</P>
      <P>That is the background to this legislation. This legislation would not have been presented in this manner with such haste if that problem had not arisen. Initially, this legislation was introduced to save Century.  It was going a step further because the Government perceived that RTE could be sorted out by the simple open market commercialism of independent radio.  This did not work. RTE have got stronger and the station I referred to never got off the ground. Then we had to go one step further. Something had to be done to weaken the opposition and prop up the ailing competition in the independent world.</P>
      <P>Now we come to the crazy, illogical package that the Minister came up with. This package first had to nobble 2FM by introducing different areas of operation it had to enter, and which everybody knew were not popular.  It had to operate in areas way beyond music and what we would regard as standard entertainment, such as education, the Irish language, agriculture and all sorts of areas where it would not compete with a station like Century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government had to do something to limit RTE's ability to advertise, so they had to cap advertising and they had to do something about the licence fee.  They had to deal with RTE in as broad a way as possible.  That was the Minister's original intention &mdash; first, a handout to Century to support that ailing station and, second, <Col N="467" /> ensure that future competition would not be so strong that Century would be unable to meet the challenge.  A nice combination.  It was a package to nobble RTE.  I cannot put it in any other terms. That was the intention behind this Bill. If the full force of those drastic proposals had been implemented, RTE, as a public broadcasting operation, would have been undermined so seriously that we could not rely on them to do the job they have been doing for the last 60 years.</P>
    <P>What we have then is an attempt by the Minister to get the private sector, which has proved unsuccessful, airborne once again by giving them State subsidies from the successful public sector.  While we must have an open market in relation to the public sector, we are going to give subsidies to the private sector.  That is the anomaly in the policies of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean an amendment in relation to the levy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What was proposed in that was something quite different.  That amendment proposed to levy all broadcasting media, including RTE, Century Radio and every aspect of the broadcasting media, so that we would then have a pool of money which could be used for public broadcasting functions. For example, that money could be used in the context of Raidió na Gaeltachta, which I doubt we will ever have now. This Bill reduces the amount of money to be allocated to RTE and, therefore, it will be impossible for RTE to expand in terms of fulfilling their broadcasting responsibility.  The levy proposed by the Labour Party would ensure that sufficient money was produced by all broadcasting <Col N="468" /> sectors and this, in turn, would ensure that public broadcasting was fully catered for.</P>
      <P>In relation to 2FM, this was the most successful of all the stations.  It was established to take on the pirates.  It was thought up in the seventies and, eventually, launched in the eighties.  RTE then realised there was a market they were not catering for.  Radio 2FM became commercially successful and popular. The Minister's intention is to make that station non-viable which is closest to the independent stations in terms of attracting the same age group, in terms of popularity and in terms of providing entertainment of a different fashion to what RTE 1 provide.  That station was directly competing with the new stations, was the most successful and was perceived as taking most of the advertising and listenership from the independent stations.  The Minister proposes to reduce their attractiveness and encumber them with a new social and public service responsibility that was not imposed on any of the independent stations.  Therefore, the likelihood is that they will become a lame duck in commercial terms and their ability to compete will be weakened. This will allow the Minister's favourites to have a clear run in the marketplace. That is what the Minister seems to mean by levelling the playing field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that he will hive off 2FM from RTE 1 and make them stand alone.  According to the Minister, they will not be entitled to any licence funding, the element of news time on the station will be increased and there will have to be more emphasis on the public service ethos.  While the Bill is not as drastic as was originally proposed, the intention is to ensure that 2FM become non-viable and are weakened to the extent that they will be unable to compete in the open market with the other commercial stations. The 2FM station, in terms of entertainment, have always been loyal to Irish artists.  In comparison with any of the commercial stations they have played <Col N="469" /> Irish artists' records more often than any of the other stations.  They have been a valuable source of income and employment to that industry and we must not disregard that.  There are no such requirements on any of the commercial stations. 2FM have operated loyally and patriotically. Irish music of international quality has been played on 2FM.  This music has been neglected by some of the other commercial stations and there is no justification for that.  That is one of the main reasons 2FM should be assured of their proper place, their ability to stand up in the open market without being weakened in the context of broadcasting and the market they represent.  They have served us well and it would be a shame if they were to be undermined in any way.</P>
    <P>It was the Minister's intention to take some of the licence fee and advertising revenue from RTE and to disburse it among the commercial stations.  He saw the licence fee and advertising revenue as dual funding but to say that dual funding is unique is not true.  The BBC are the only station in Europe funded by their licence fee.  Dual funding among public service broadcasting stations throughout Europe is quite common.  That is normal practice.  The principle of the public licence fee, which is paid by the taxpayer, being transferred to what essentially is a private enterprise and into the pocket of a private entrepreneur, could not be stomached.  The purpose of the licence fee is to provide a public service and that money should not be disbursed to an operation like Century Radio which have not been successful and do not have to provide a public service as RTE have to do.  To think that that money could be transferred into the pockets of the directors of Century Radio, an ailing station, is simply deplorable.  They do not have to fulfil a contract of public broadcasting as RTE have.  To take money from the public to give to a private operation of that kind cannot be countenanced in any circumstances.  The money was to be handed over without any strings attached <Col N="470" /> to the area of public service broadcasting. There was no suggestion of ownership being transferred, that there would be public shares taken by the State or that there would be any attempt to control, or to take an element of control, of the independent stations.  No, it was simply a subsidy that was being given to an entrepreneur who had made a mess of the operation.  That was the intention and the Minister recognised that in his contributions. He withdrew that intention from his original Bill.  Of course, the Bill before us is vastly different from the original Bill.  The Minister recognised that it would not be proper for the public to support the private inefficiencies following the popular outcry about the Bill but he should have thought of that earlier. He did not think it was proper that the State should embark on new areas of State funding.  He did not think it would do anything for the independence of the independent stations, that it would interfere with the concept of independence if they were subsidised out of the RTE licence or the subvention that was equivalent to the RTE licence.  On the discrimination between print and broadcasting, the subvention was to be distributed to the broadcasting media and not to the print media and that would have created anomalies.</P>
    <P>For all of those reasons the Minister had to admit that he had made a mistake and he has withdrawn that provision. Why did he introduce the idea in the first place?  That is what makes this such a shambles of a Bill.  The first Bill the Minister introduced bears virtually no resemblance, except in one area, to the Bill we have before us.  The Minister admitted that a lot of hasty decisions were made that were not properly thought out.  He eliminated some, but not all, of them.</P>
    <P>Section 3, formerly section 2, attempts to cap advertising broadcasts by the Authority. The Minister has argued that his reason for including this in the Bill is that RTE have an unfair advantage, that they are charging below-cost advertising and <Col N="471" /> he wants to limit that.  There are major questions of a constitutional nature about how the Minister can attempt to limit the right of RTE to advertise and attach a costing to it.  The Bill may be subject to a constitutional challenge, if it becomes law.</P>
    <P>This is the third plank in the Minister's approach to supporting ailing independent stations and, indeed, to supporting some of the Minister's own supporters in that area.  It is the most damaging plank because it substantially weakens RTE.  It reduces the level of daily advertising from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent, from seven-and-a-half-minutes, which is at present allocated to RTE, to five minutes.  That is a 33.33 per cent reduction.  That compares poorly with the EC standards of 12 minutes which is far in excess of what RTE presently have, and of what the Minister now intends. He intends to limit it to five minutes while the EC maximum is 12 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The present level of daily transmission in the EC is 15 per cent, whereas the present level in RTE is 10 per cent, and the Minister intends reducing it to 7.5 per cent.  That is roughly half the EC level and for the Minister to introduce a statutory limit and then to have further capping arrangements, in sections 2, 3, and 4, is imposing severe restrictions of a competitive nature on RTE.  That is at the heart of this legislation.  The Minister is ensuring that RTE's popularity, which <Col N="472" /> automatically would result in success in advertising, is limited and restricted far below the average levels in other EC countries.  That is totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Minister intends, of course, that the outstanding advertising will go to other Irish media, particularly to the commercial sector, about which the Minister seems to be concerned.  In effect, according to the Minister's figures &mdash; perhaps it will not work out now because the Bill will not come into operation until 1 October &mdash; RTE will lose £6 million in advertising revenue in the second half of this year and £12 million over the full year.  That would be a substantial loss in RTE's advertising revenue and of course, that would have an impact right across the board in many other areas.  According to RTE statistics they are breaking even at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire payroll for RTE in 1990 is expected to be in the region of £51 million and £44 million for operational costs.  When they include VAT the total will be £102,439,000.  Broadcasting revenue for 1991 is expected to be in excess of that, by just over £500,000.  As it stands RTE are barely making ends meet and anything further they get will be through their own commercial enterprises.  It is not a question of RTE having &ldquo;fat&rdquo; that can be taken from them and usefully diverted to other purposes.  RTE face job losses which will affect the production of programmes &mdash; something RTE have become good at &mdash; part production of drama and of films.  We have all seen in recent years the success of RTE in this area.  We have always been anxious to capitalise further on this area but if no capital is available, we simply cannot do that.  We are talking about very considerable amounts of money.  The film and drama industry, once it comes on an audio-visual level, is extremely expensive. RTE estimate that this legislation will result in up to 500 direct job losses and we can assume that there would be many consequent job losses in ancillary activities that RTE would have pumped <Col N="473" /> money into for the purposes of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced an amendment to section 5 for the purpose of ensuring that RTE will continue in the coming year to use programme material made here and in other European countries. This will also ensure that a reasonable proportion of RTE's programme material and television service is devoted to original programme material produced in the State or in other members states of the European Community by persons other than the Authority, their subsidiaries or other broadcasting organisations and that, as far as practicable, the proportion shall not be less than that broadcast by the Authority in 1989.  How can that possibly be done if funding is capped and RTE are unable to operate within the resources limit they had in 1989?  While it is desirable that the emphasis should be on using home-based productions so far as possible, how will RTE be able to finance or pay for home based activities?  If they do not have the resources they had a year ago they will not be able to do the work that it was intended they would do.  While the intention is good, the ability to operate as in the past will be very limited.</P>
    <P>The Minister expects that the money will be used within the context of the other broadcasting media and that the advertising will go there but, in fact, advertising moves from one form of broadcasting to another.  Therefore, what will be lost by RTE, as a television broadcaster, will not necessarily go to either the print media or the existing commercial radio stations.  The likelihood is that they would look for a similar advertising channel but there is none in existence.  TV3 have not come into existence and there is no sign of their coming into existence in the near future.  We do not know when it will be operating effectively or when it will establish the reputation that it can compete for advertising with RTE.  That will not happen overnight.  People who have money to spend on advertising will <Col N="474" /> not buy a pig in a poke, they will spend their money where they see it will give them a good return.  That will take some time as well.</P>
    <P>What will happen in the interim?  RTE can only advertise for a limited period during transmission.  Therefore, advertising will go to stations outside the country that can beam into this country, stations like UTV and BBC.  Already, UTV have the capacity to beam in to two thirds of the country as a whole, and into up to 85 to 90 per cent of the Dublin area. The money that will be floating around from the capping of advertising revenue in RTE, will simply not go back into the commercial sector.  The Minister has not properly addressed that area and, certainly, I would like to hear his views on how he will ensure that money diverted from RTE &mdash; the whole thrust of the Bill is to divert money that at present goes into RTE's coffers and is used for the purpose of public State broadcasting &mdash; will go into the commercial broadcasting area.  How will he prevent, for example, UTV, Sky, BBC and other channels that beam into this jurisdiction availing of that revenue?  I predict that much of the money will flow to the competitors of RTE and other commercial stations.  Has the Minister any information that would put the matter in a different light?</P>
    <P>Also, in relation to the capping of advertising, the Minister must face up to the constitutional issue.  The constitutional issue is a major issue and unless the legislation conforms with the Constitution we will find that the whole controversy we have been through, the serious undermining that is taking place, and the serious concern that is being expressed about the Bill by the public in general and by the broadcasting sector in particular, will have been in vain.  We will find that the legislation will go through both Houses and then face a challenge in the courts.</P>
    <P>I read earlier the relevant Article of the Constitution and what it states in <Col N="475" /> relation to public broadcasting.  It does not give the authority to any Minister to undermine that broadcasting operation. The following quotation is from the editorial in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> of July 1990, volume 8, No. 7 in relation to Article 40:</P>
    <P>This Article does not permit legislative provision seeking to make broadcasting the preserve of the State. Under the freedom of expression provision there is an open market to publish or broadcast... there is no distinction in Article 40 between the right to broadcast and the right to publish and accordingly the assumption that the Minister for Communications has the right to dictate who should broadcast is incorrect.</P>
    <P>It goes on:</P>
    <P>If the Oireachtas passes legislation giving the Government, in effect, the right to decide what can be broadcast and the conditions of same, such legislation may be unconstitutional unless it is within Article 40.6.1º.</P>
    <P>If the Broadcasting Bill, 1990 has the effect of restricting the amount of advertising which RTE or any other station can seek, the Bill is restricting or interfering with the right given by Article 40.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome <Col N="476" /> the Minister to the House &mdash; I have not had the pleasure of addressing him before &mdash; and to introduce the motion on the Adjournment, which is:</P>
      <P>the need for the Minister for Social Welfare to make special provisions for grants and subsidies to prevent hardship to people in the north inner city who will find it impossible to implement the new regulations regarding the use of smokeless fuels in the autumn because of their inadequate means.</P>
      <P>The background to this motion is well known to all of us.  It is the issue of smog which has been bedevilling this city year after year.  On a regular basis in the autumn, winter and sometimes in the spring, we have been in breach of EC smog limits in the city.  There have been years of neglect.  This problem should have been addressed two decades ago but it has become a major health and environmental problem in recent years, and the situation has been getting worse in the last few years.</P>
      <P>Eventually Dublin Corporation were empowered to commence a process of conversion to cleaner fuels and started a pilot programme in Ballyfermot.  They began a systematic process of working with householders and community groups advising on alternative fuels.  They provided grants for the installation of new appliances and the conversion of old appliances to burn smokeless fuels.  A sum of £4 million was made available for that purpose.  The intention was that the scheme be introduced on an experimental basis in that community and then extended to a number of other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That strategy has now been abandoned entirely in favour of what might be called a crisis programme which is to begin on 1 September this year when the sale of bituminous coal will be banned in the city of Dublin.  By decree of the Department of the Environment we now have a ban on the sale of coal beginning in just over six weeks time.  It is almost upon us.  I <Col N="477" /> consider it has been a panic move and not properly thought out, and all of a sudden we have this crash approach.  We have been dealing with it on a gradual basis up to now and suddenly we find that, by decree, we are to abolish smog in the city overnight.  This is an impossible timescale.  There is a great deal of confusion about what is happening in terms of the supply of coal, the providers of coal, the bellmen who go around Dublin, and the loss of jobs.  CDL, who have a vested interest, have estimated that 2,000 jobs will be lost, but certainly there will be a substantial loss of jobs in the area. This is likely to happen overnight when we implement the ban on the sale of bituminous coal.</P>
    <P>The problem I am referring to relates to the north inner city but, of course, it is a problem in most areas of the city.  In the north inner city we have probably the worst area of disadvantage and deprivation in the entire country.  In this area there is a huge public housing sector, large flat complexes, all together and very high levels of unemployment.  We have probably the highest level of social welfare recipients anywhere in Dublin, or in the country.</P>
    <P>The response from the Minister for Social Welfare is to give a special allowance of £3 per week over and above the existing allowance to social welfare recipients who are entitled to it and to people who are in receipt of health board payments.  That is too little, it is too late and it is for too short a time.  It only covers six months of the year.  In the context of our Irish climate, six months is very short for a fuel allowance that is supposed to be the sole means of bridging this gap from a bituminous fuel burning society to a smokeless fuel society.</P>
    <P>Smokeless fuel is so expensive that people will not buy it unless there are proper incentives.  In the context of the legislation which bans the sale of bituminous coal, I envisage a ring of depots operating illegally outside the city boundaries &mdash; in a sort of black market &mdash; where <Col N="478" /> bituminous fuel may be available.  I know there are fairly severe penalties for selling bituminous fuel, ranging from £1,000 to £10,000 or two years in jail, but there are no penalties on &mdash; and the ban does not cover this &mdash; the burning of bituminous coal.  While there is a ban on the sale of bituminous coal within the restricted area, there is not a ban on the burning of such coal within the restricted area.</P>
    <P>It boggles the mind to see how this scheme will operate.  This is an ill-thought out and ill-conceived plan to ban the sale of coal and not to ban burning of coal &mdash; not that we want inspectors going around checking people's houses like the glimmermen of old.  The area I live in is not very far from Swords or from Bray and people can easily bring in coal from depots that may well be operating illegally outside the city suburbs.  I would like to see the Minister addressing that problem because I do not think there has been an adequate fuel allowance to help these people to take this drastic step from burning bituminous fuel to burning smokeless fuel.</P>
    <P>The other area, which is not specifically the concern of the Minister for Social Welfare but of the Minister for the Environment, is grants for conversion of central heating in old houses from solid bituminous-based central heating to alternative forms, and, indeed, for houses built prior to 1987 so that they will be able to avail of the new smokeless fuels.  I understand that Dublin Corporation are making no grants available for conversion of heating systems, except in new corporation homes.  We know how many of those are being built at present so that does not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department of the Environment have no intention of making grants available for any conversion, so it will be very difficult for houses to transfer to smokeless fuel.  We saw steps taken by the corporation in Ballyfermot and the intention was to proceed with conversions along that line, but no more such schemes are envisaged.  I <Col N="479" /> know, in a little flat complex beside me in Mary's Mansions, where a small block of flats is being refurbished and being converted at the same time.  That is the only such work that is taking place in the inner city.  There are no plans, there is no money for any further conversions or indeed for any further refurbishment of such flats.  Virtually all of the people employed in those flats and other flats in the area cannot avail of the gas conversions that are available through Bord Gáis because of the cost.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a very large number of social welfare recipients here, a large number of unemployed people and I imagine the vast majority of the population in the areas I am referring to would be in that category.  The allowance is inadequate to cover the need and the time allowed is inadequate.  It has been too hastily introduced and people have not been given time to prepare for it. There is no reduction in the price of smokeless fuel to encourage people to avail of it.  There is no reduction in the VAT on smokeless fuel to encourage people to buy it.</P>
    <P>There is a ban on the sale but there is no ban on the burning of bituminous coal. I believe we will find abuses in the restricted area.  There are no grants available for conversion.  How are we going to deal with future problems if we do not take all relevant considerations into account? People simply cannot afford to pay for conversion themselves in the areas I am referring to.  The level of allowance is too low and the Minister should introduce a higher level, certainly in areas where there are specific problems.  The figure of £3 should at least be increased to £6. We are talking in the short term about encouraging people to use smokeless fuels.  There is no sense in having legislation unless we give people an incentive. We must ensure the incentive is sufficiently strong to encourage people to act in this matter as the Minister and all of us would like.  For our own sake and <Col N="480" /> for the health of children, particularly those in that area who suffer a very high lead content level &mdash; surveys have shown it is very high compared to the national level &mdash; it is urgent that we address the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reduce the price of smokeless fuel.  That would be another very desirable approach.  We must make sure the corporation, whether through the Department of the Environment or otherwise, are provided with funding to ensure that the systems that need to be converted can be converted.  A package is required, a further allowance, a reduction in the cost of smokeless fuel. In the long-term, unless we provide for the conversion of existing appliances and existing systems, we will get nowhere with the legislation.  I urge the Minister to take that short-term view in the interim to ensure there is sufficient funding for smokeless fuels and, in the long-term, ensure that grants are made available for the systems to be converted so that the problem will be eliminated in the future.  I am sharing my time with Senator Upton.</P>

      <P>May I also thank the Minister for coming in at this late hour in the evening.  It is the end of what, I am sure, has been a long day for him, I appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Senator Costello, in urging the Minister to increase the amount of additional money to people for fuel vouchers.  We are facing a major problem here in trying to implement this type of ban all with the stroke of a pen.  My view is that it originated essentially from a panic reaction. It is not illegal to burn coal, it will not be illegal to stockpile coal, it will not be illegal to travel out to places like Rathcoole and Newcastle, to purchase the coal and bring it in.  I could go further and suggest there will be a financial incentive for people to make the journey to purchase a large supply of coal to take them over the winter season.  In many ways there will be a financial incentive for <Col N="481" /> people to circumvent what is proposed in regard to the banning of coal.</P>
    <P>As Senator Costello said, there will be ample opportunities for those traders who want to behave illegally in relation to the sale of coal.  I am not satisfied there will be adequate capacity to police the regulations.  In addition to that, I have encountered a great communications problem in relation to this whole scheme. People are very confused and muddled, first, in relation to the law.  Secondly, I believe people are very confused and puzzled as to the effects of the differing types of smokeless fuels on their heating systems.  Many people are quite simply very worried that these smokeless fuels will burn out their heating systems and will damage and destroy solid fuel systems of heating, simply because the systems are not designed to cope with the type of heat which is generated by some of these low smoke fuels.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, people are confused as to how these extra fuel subsidies will work.  I am hearing a lot about it from people in the Drimnagh and Crumlin areas who are most concerned about the matter.  They feel particularly badly done by in relation to all this because all the preliminary work had been done to give the go-ahead to allow these people to get dual conversion grants.  They were under the impression that that would happen but at the last minute the plug was pulled on them.  People in Drimnagh and Crumlin feel particularly aggrieved they were not given the same treatment as the people in the Ballyfermot D area, the lower end of Ballyfermot, who were in similar circumstances.  The people in Ballyfermot were allowed to have the grants but the people in Crumlin and Drimnagh were not.  It is a big bone of contention there and many people are very upset and disappointed by it.</P>
    <P>Many people have held off making conversions to their central heating systems and so on in anticipation of those grants. They are still not fully sure what the situation is in relation to fuel conversion <Col N="482" /> grants.  I urge that those grants be given and if they are not to be given, that fact should be made perfectly clear to the public in these areas.  They do not want to find two or three months later that they made a mistake and that they would have got a grant if they waited.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of confusion in relation to the incentives the Dublin Gas Company are giving.  The Dublin Gas Company are not the responsibility of the Minister but certainly I strongly urge the company to ensure that the leaflets and the information they give are as clear as possible.  I encountered a case today of an elderly man in Crumlin, aged 77 years, who was upset because of the scheme Dublin Gas were offering.  He was not sure what it was.  He was confused and reached conclusions which were not valid.  When he subsequently discovered he would not be getting the offer he thought he was getting he was very upset. That is not desirable either for Dublin Gas or for the public.  I urge that a proper adequate comprehensive information system is set in place.</P>
    <P>There issues are particularly acute for elderly people, many of whom are in difficult circumstances.  As they grow older they are unable to cope with solid fuel systems and they are very anxious to carry out conversion work to their existing system.  I would urge the Minister to give a special consideration to elderly people who are suffering from some type of bone disorder which limits their mobility and their capacity to haul around these fuels in the way they would have 20 or 30 years earlier in their life.</P>

      <P>Senators will recognise that I am not the Minister responsible for grants for conversions or for any of the other matters the two Senators tended to dwell on.  In relation to the ESB, I have made arrangements that the ESB allowance, which applies to elderly people, can be converted into a gas allowance for those who may be converting to natural gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> That is being taken up currently by a number of pensioners and they welcome it very much.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello said the £3 allowance is too little.  If we are talking about the extra cost of going from coal to union briquettes the extra cost there is £2.95 per week and the £3, obviously, covers that.  Briquettes are only £2.22 extra and the £3 covers them.  If they are going to Coalite that will be a little bit over the £3 and it is a question of the price that works out at afterwards.  On any reasonable basis the £3 is very good to meet the increased cost for the people we are trying to provide for.</P>
    <P>With regard to the period being to short, the period is related directly to the heating period over the winter which is related to the temperature over quite a number of years.  This is the period from mid-October through to mid-April. There is a factual meteorological basis on which the whole scheme is based and that is the basis of the scheme for the elderly and the same basis was used in this case.</P>
    <P>With regard to confusion and concern about people being puzzled, and the Department being too late in getting information to people, the health boards are involved to some extent, but I want to make it clear that the vast majority of these people are quite familiar with this, as Senator Costello said earlier, and they will be paid automatically.  In fact, many of them already, in the books issued to them for the coming winter for their pensions, have that extra money added.  It is there in the book, they have it in their hands already.  Will the Senator please not accuse me of not making preparations in time?</P>
    <P>I was given a sum of money and I was asked to do something about this.  I believe my Department have done it very efficiently.  There will be a small percentage who will come under the health boards, and the supplementary welfare allowance, and some other cases may arise afterwards.  Those are some of the <Col N="484" /> points been made by Senators.  Many of the pensioners have got the allowance already in their books.  I will not go through the whole list of people we cover because we cover a very wide range of people.</P>
    <P>As part of the National Environment Action Plan, the Minister for the Environment has banned the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal in certain built up areas of Dublin with effect, as the Senator said, from September next.  The areas covered by the ban include the whole of Dublin City and Dún Laoghaire, the built up areas of the county and adjacent areas.</P>
    <P>I have already made a special provision to assist in meeting the additional cost on households arising from the need to use smokeless fuels so that these costs would be kept to a minimum for low income groups.  In addition to the 1990 allocation of £28 million for the national fuel scheme the Government have allocated a further £3 million for the Dublin area in the current year.  This means that an additional £6.3 million is being allocated by the Government over the coming heating season.  The season goes from October through to April.  The Government provided £6.3 million extra for Dublin to assist low income groups in meeting the additional costs which may arise from the ban on bituminous coal.</P>
    <P>From these additional resources I am introducing a special extra fuel allowance of £3 per week for low income households. This additional allowance will apply for the period of the heating season under the national fuel scheme, that is, from mid-October to mid-April.  It is additional to the £5 per week which many of those concerned already receive.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that it has always been the policy of this Government to target resources towards those in greatest need.  These are the people whom the Senators mentioned particularly tonight.  This can be seen, for example, in the special additional increases provided in recent years to <Col N="485" /> those on the lowest levels of payment, such as unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.  At the same time, the position of families of low paid workers has been significantly improved through a combination of increases in the tax exemption limits, including a special child related tax exemption and major improvements of up to £77 per week for larger families in the family income supplement scheme.  I announced those improvements last night.</P>
    <P>I have taken a similar approach in relation to the new smokeless fuel allowance. Clearly there is a need to assist those currently in receipt of the weekly fuel allowance of £5 under the national fuel scheme.  It was quite obvious that they would need assistance.  This includes recipients of all long-term social welfare and health board pensions and other payments who are unable to provide for their own heating needs and who live alone or only with dependents or other people who also qualify for the allowance.  Under the new special scheme, which I am now introducing, this payment will be increased by £3 to £8 per week.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other households which are not normally regarded as being long-term dependent on social welfare but which nonetheless, have been receiving social welfare payments for what might be regarded as a considerable time. In order to assist such households I have decided to pay the new allowance also to those who have been receiving short-term unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or disability benefit for as little as three months.  Anyone who has been receiving these for three months will be included, like the people who have been receiving benefits for a long time.  I am also conscious of the need to assist families of low paid workers.  I have decided, therefore, to extend the new allowance to all recipients of family income supplement who meet the other qualifying conditions for a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> As Senators will appreciate, we have approached this issue in a very practical way.  Clearly, the serious problem of smog in Dublin which we have experienced in recent years can only be solved by a complete ban on the burning of bituminous coal.  We recognise that this will result in additional heating costs for certain households.  We have identified categories of households which need assistance to meet these extra costs, long-term recipients of social welfare and health board payments, people getting short-term payments for over three months and low paid workers with families who meet the other qualifying conditions under the national fuel scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the arrangements I have made 81,000 households in Dublin will receive an extra £3 per week at a cost of £6.3 million for the coming heating season. This is a substantial and practical response to the difficulties which would otherwise arise for the less well off in our community as a result of the urgent and very necessary measures being taken by the Minister for the Environment to improve the quality of the air we breathe.</P>
    <P>I know Senators appreciate that it is an urgent problem, that it has a major impact on the health of the community and that those who live in the inner city, and in other densely populated areas of Dublin, will benefit considerably in their living environment by the ban on bituminous coal.  The use to which I am putting the money provided by the Government is the best practical use that could be made of it.  We are covering everybody who is on the fuel scheme and, in addition, we are providing for a category who have never been provided for before, people who have been only three months on unemployment benefit and who are only three months or more on disability benefit.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that the administrative difficulties involved are considerable. We can certainly overcome those because of the extent to which we are organised and we have gone down to <Col N="487" /> three months on that basis.  That is a very reasonable approach.  We have included also those who are on family income supplement. It will be added automatically to the payments of all those groups.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of all the groups, old age pensioners, retirement pensioners, widows pensioners, blind pensioners, invalidity pensioners, deserted wives, deserted husbands, unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives, single womens' allowances, those on long <Col N="488" /> term unemployed assistance and, of course, those on short term unemployment assistance over three months and the same with supplementary welfare. We are making very reasonable provision. It is very practical and I hope the Senators, having had that aspect of the matter clarified, will be satisfied that it is a step taken urgently to meet an immediate need, that it is comprehensive and that it represents the right way to go at this time.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 12 noon on Tuesday, 17 July 1990.</P>
