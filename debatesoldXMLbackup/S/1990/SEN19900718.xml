      <P>The Minister is welcome to the House to hear what we have to say.  I am sure he will find that most of it will be against the contents of the Bill. He would, in fact, have been more welcome in the House when we were dealing with the previous Bill, &mdash; the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1990 &mdash; under which he sought to abolish the death penalty but, unfortunately, we saw very little of him during that debate.  I am glad he is here today and I hope he will take on board the criticisms which I have no doubt will come from this side of the House.  Certainly, criticism will come from me, and the Labour Party, in relation to this unsavoury Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday we had the unfortunate, indeed scandalous occurrence, of the entire proceedings of this week being subjected to the guillotine.  It is unprecedented that no new business can be dealt with and that the proceedings of the House today, in the context of discussing the Broadcasting Bill, will be terminated, irrespective of what Stage we have reached.  In view of the number of speakers waiting, and considering the large <Col N="710" /> number of amendments, the introduction of the guillotine will cause many problems. It will be extremely difficult for us to tease out the full implications of the Bill as, indeed, was the case in the Dáil last week when the guillotine was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to discuss the Order of Business.  I was merely informing the Minister of the context in which we are discussing this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill, as I see it, is twofold. It is part of the Government's policy of privatisation.  I do not see it as something that has come out of the blue but rather part of a strategy by the Government. The whole concept of privatisation will be discussed tomorrow when we debate the Insurance Bill which involves the transfer of a major national asset valued between £0.5 billion and £1 billion.  We will be discussing selling that asset off to the private sector, one of our most successful ventures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Chair's protection.  I was pointing out that privatisation is part of an overall strategy. We have a peculiarly Irish entrepreneurial way of going about it.  We are opening up the airways to the commercial sector by nobbling the successful operator in the public sector, namely, RTE. That is something that would only happen here; we are going about it backways. That is my first approach to this legislation and Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second approach is that this is a simple straightforward vendetta against RTE.  It is a naked attack on RTE for control.  It is well known that the Minister's party have been constantly critical of RTE in the context of RTE operating their public service function and duties in an impartial fashion.  I suggest the Minister is nobbling RTE to ensure they operate only and within the parameters the Government set.  That is not acceptable. In the Bill, and in the lead up to it, a number of factors came to light.  First, we saw the Minister's attack on 2FM, the station which has been the most successful competitor in commercial radio and which has taken over from the pirates.  Yet, the Minister is seeking to undermine their effectiveness and competitiveness by ensuring that they must <Col N="712" /> operate in areas and at levels of production not in accordance with the successful formula they developed over the years.  It is probably the most popular station with young people and it is also a very valuable station in that 25 per cent of the music played is recorded by Irish artistes.  In that way the station has been supporting employment and has given a boost to our entertainment industry. None of the independent stations has undertaken anything of the same nature by way of supporting that industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister's second attack on RTE has been in regard to the licence fee.  His intention was that part of the licence fee revenue would be transferred to commercial stations; in other words, public money would be handed over to the private sector with no strings attached. There would be no shares held by the State, there would be no control; rather it would be simply a golden handshake in order to support the ailing independents. The Minister discovered that all of these proposals were met with very considerable hostility in and outside the broadcasting industry, leading him to withdraw two of the three prongs of his attack on RTE.</P>
    <P>We are left with this Bill and the Minister's proposals with regard to capping RTE's advertising revenue.  The proposal is that there will be a reduction from the present 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent of daily advertising time and a reduction from six to five minutes in the hourly advertising time.  That compares very unfavourably with present levels in the EC which are 15 per cent and nine minutes respectively.  Indeed, it compares equally unfavourably with the position obtaining in commercial stations &mdash; 15 per cent &mdash; as against the present RTE 10 per cent which will now be reduced to 7.5 per cent.  Therefore, it will be seen that RTE's competitive element is being halved in the context of advertising. That could hardly be regarded as levelling the playing pitch.  Rather, it means very substantial favouritism to the independent stations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> The second part of the Minister's proposals in regard to advertising and limiting the ability of RTE to raise money by that method is to limit RTE's total advertising revenue to an amount equivalent to the level of the previous year's licence fee revenue.  It is the Minister who makes a grant-in-aid in respect of the licence fee.  Therefore, it will be clearly seen that the Minister for Communications will have total control over RTE's revenue by fixing the level of grant and he will also be able to determine the amount RTE will earn by way of advertising in any given year.  Therefore, he will have done two things: he will have capped their avertising revenue in percentage terms and in minutes and also built in another capping arrangement to ensure he will have total control over the amount RTE can earn by way of advertising at any given time.</P>
    <P>The effects of those proposals will be catastrophic for RTE and indeed for broadcasting overall.  It is estimated that in any one year it will amount to a loss of revenue to RTE in the region of £12 million and some estimates put the figure considerably higher at, say, £20 million. The figure of £12 million is said to be the entire income of RTE1.  Therefore, the Minister is taking away one limb of support of RTE's public service broadcasting ability.  RTE1 are an extremely successful station and also the oldest one.  In one fell swoop major damage will be caused to RTE's ability to collect revenue and thereby fulfil their function as a public broadcasting service.  Naturally that will have an impact on the service provided over a whole range of programmes, their ability to carry out their mandate, duties and responsibilities to all citizens.  We must also remember that RTE have a mandate in respect of minority interests, whether they be the Gaeltachtaí, education, agriculture, drama; anything in the overall national interest forms part of RTE's public broadcasting service mandate.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind that the employment generated in ancillary industries in broadcasting is enormous, with a very large number of people dependent <Col N="714" /> on RTE's prosperity and their ability to contract out work, the fall-out from RTE directly and distinctly separate from RTE's direct employment.  It is estimated that there may be anything from 500 to 600 job losses in RTE resulting from this provision.  I have already noticed reports in the newspapers over the past two or three days that RTE's Director General, Mr. Vincent Finn, is requesting staff to take early retirement, is seeking an immediate 200 early retirements, amounting to 10 per cent of their overall personnel.  That will be the immediate effect of this provision as foreseen by the RTE Authority in job losses, a very substantial reduction in their staffing levels.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Minister's proposals, their effect on RTE and on broadcasting generally will be counterproductive. The Minister said there would be more revenue spread among the other independent media which would be to the benefit of all but it is more likely that advertising costs will rise.  Obviously RTE will have a reduced advertising time overall, leading to costs being raised in order to maximise income.  It is estimated by the Association of Advertisers in Ireland Limited that advertising costs will rise by 30 per cent to 40 per cent in the first year, a substantial rise.  If that is the immediate effect, naturally advertisers will look elsewhere for a market.  But where will they look?  I predict they will look to other stations and media in the marketplace.  Certainly the available marketplace with regard to television advertising is outside this State at present, in Ulster or across the water in Britain.  Their programmes are beamed regularly into this country.  Therefore, the likelihood will be that rather than sponsoring local Irish advertisers in broadcasting they will sponsor external advertisers.</P>
    <P>I have here a letter from The Marketing Society which incorporates the former Market Research Society of Ireland and is recognised as the final authority on matters concerning marketing and market research in Ireland.  I will <Col N="715" /> quote from what they have to say in the course of this letter:</P>
    <P>Any price rise will tend to squeeze the smaller advertiser out of the market in favour of the big budget international marketing company; this can have a detrimental effect on the growing sector of new, small Irish companies; this would appear to be contrary to the Minister's stated objectives.</P>
    <P>An advertiser who cannot obtain time on RTE but has the funds to advertise is much more likely to seek an alternative broadcast medium.  The largest share of this is for television and an advertiser who has a TV commercial available (often produced outside this country and therefore bearing no direct cost to the Irish marketing company) will select the next best TV alternative.</P>
    <P>The only serious alternative is UTV. Two out of three sets in the Republic can receive UTV programmes and this rises to 85% in Dublin.  The likely effect of &ldquo;capping&rdquo; therefore is to drive money out of the economy and into Northern Ireland.  There is no guarantee that it will re-circulate among the other Irish media.</P>
    <P>The availability of TV3 still appears to be at least a year away; after that TV3 will have to build a reputation for its programmes and prove that it has a large enough viewership to justify advertisers spending money with the station.  This could take many years to develop, in the meantime UTV will have benefited from the &ldquo;capping&rdquo; and will fight hard to maintain the opportunity handed to it.</P>
    <P>That, in a nutshell, is the view of the experts in this area in relation to marketing research in Ireland.  It will not be, ultimately, to the benefit of the more prosperous independents, not to talk of the ailing independent Century.  It will drive money out of the country because we do not have equivalent advertising stations here, particularly in the context of television.  Indeed, UTV also has more <Col N="716" /> scope for increasing its advertising potential to the detriment of RTE because it has more advertising time allocated, seven minutes per hour, whereas RTE is now being capped to five minutes.  It will also probably be to the detriment of the broadcasting industry here.</P>
    <P>The next item I would like to address is the constitutional issue on which I said a few words the last day.  This aspect requires greater development and, in the final analysis, I think we will find that this is the real challenge to this Bill.  I do not expect we will be able to prevent the passage of this Bill in the Seanad even though there is total opposition to it from the Opposition benches.  The Constitution makes very specific provision in relation to freedom of expression.  I quoted Article 40 the last day but I would like to put it on the record again in addition to a short editorial from the <i>Irish Law Times</i> because I understand that if a matter of this nature is regarded as unconstitutional the President would look into the debates that have taken place to see what arguments were put. Article 40.6.1ºi of the Constitution is as follows:</P>
    <P>The right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.</P>
    <P>The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>What is being offered there in the Constitution is freedom of expression, the right to speak, to broadcast freely.  The editorial comment on that is as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> This Article does not permit legislative provisions seeking to make broadcasting the preserve of the State. Under the freedom of expression provision there is an open market to publish or broadcast.  For practical reasons of crowding the airwaves, the Minister for Communications issues licences to broadcast.  However, there is no distinction in Article 40 between the right to broadcast and the right to publish and accordingly the assumption that the Minister for Communications has the right to dictate who should broadcast, is incorrect.</P>
    <P>The Constitution of Ireland is the source of law in Ireland and as such Article 40 confers no right on the Government to decide who can and who cannot broadcast.  There is a general &ldquo;right to broadcast&rdquo; and therefore such right creates a free market...</P>
    <P>If the Oireachtas passes legislation giving the Government, in effect, the right to decide what can be broadcast and the conditions of same&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, I must remind you that it is not the practice to allow lengthy quotations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is extremely relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure you can paraphrase it.  That is the normal procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the professional legal opinion in relation to constitutionality which, when this Bill leaves this House, will be the most important matter in relation to the Bill.  If you will bear with me for a moment I will go through it quickly.</P>
      <P>If the Oireachtas passes legislation giving the Government, in effect, the right to decide what can be broadcast and the conditions of same, such legislation may be unconstitutional unless it is within Article 40.6.1º.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Broadcasting Bill, 1990 has the effect of restricting the amount of <Col N="718" /> advertising which RTE or any other station can seek, the Bill is restricting or interfering with the right given by Article 40.  In the view of this Journal a case can be argued that part of the Bill may be unconstitutional.  Accordingly, under Article 40 there is a free market to broadcast and those engaged in same should be free to solicit advertising as part of that right....</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that, subject to &lsquo;long stop&rsquo; requirements relating to public order, blasphemy and obscenity, broadcasting stations are as entitled to make their own decisions as to programme content and the soliciting of advertising as a newspaper editor can in relation to what is to fill his or her newspaper.  The statutory controls appear to say otherwise.  If eventually scrutinised by the Supreme Court they may be found unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Society benefits from a free press: it is now time to peel away the restraints on RTE and other broadcasting authorities. We have no more a need for a State controlled broadcasting service than we do for a State controlled newspaper service.  The State's proper role is to protect us from political and moral subversion, not to dictate the terms of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Essentially what is being said here is that there is a freedom of expression which includes the right to broadcast freely and that implies the right to seek advertising without restriction.  What the Minister is imposing here is the capping of advertising, therefore, the introduction of restrictions.  The only area where the Minister should be operating legislation is in protecting us from political and moral subversion or to license and regulate the airwaves, not to restrict advertising or the market.  That will be a major part of the challenge to this legislation.  I certainly would like the President to seek the advice of the Council of State in relation to the constitutionality of this legislation and refer it to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> The code of practice has been referred to, I think it is reasonable to regulate matters of this nature.  In the industrial relations Bill last week the Minister introduced a code of practice in the context of industrial relations.  Here the Minister is also doing this in the context of advertising and sponsorship.  At present RTE prepare and issue their own code of practice in relation to advertising and sponsorship and that is regarded extremely highly.  The Independent Broadcasting Authority in Britain look to RTE, their regulations and guidelines on advertising and sponsorship as their model.  Likewise, European broadcasters have used RTE's standard on advertising and sponsorship as a model.  The present RTE code of sponsorship was used by the mass media working party of the Council of Europe in drawing up guidelines on sponsorship and commercial promotion.  The model at present being used by RTE, while it is not a statutory model, is of a very high order.  With the EC and the Council of Europe establishing uniformity in codes of practice, we would be expected to operate accordingly.  Considering the quality of the code of practice that has been in operation by RTE, it seems strange the Minister finds himself obliged to apply his own strict regulations. My fear is that the Minister, by making it a statutory matter for which he has responsibility, may so restrict the code of practice in relation to advertising and sponsorship, that he might drive away advertising from RTE.</P>
    <P>The second area I am concerned about is that the Minister intends to include RTE's promotions of their own activities, irrespective of what they are, as constituting advertising in the context of the five minutes they have been allocated. That is a further infringement of RTE's ability to advertise and it will limit the amount of time available for commercial advertising.  I would like the Minister to address that issue and quell our fears in relation to his intentions.</P>
    <P>The Irish language will be a casualty of this legislation.  RTE had a mandate to <Col N="720" /> promote the language and they fulfilled that to a considerable degree.  There has been much criticism from language enthusiasts, representatives of bodies promoting the language, and from Gaeltacht areas that not enough was being done by the public service broadcasting station.  RTE will be underfinanced now and will have less money to go around. They will certainly have less money for areas that are in need of development. Not enough was being invested in the promotion of Irish programmes, and the Irish language, in the first place but there certainly will be less now.  The independent stations have no such responsibility, mandate or commitment to promote the Irish language.  They do not have an obligation to do that.  That will hit the Irish language further.</P>
    <P>The proliferation of independent stations around Gaeltacht areas will encroach on Raidió na Gaeltachta.  That will be a further threat to the language. I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that and whether licences will be given to stations in areas bordering the Gaeltachtaí without the constraints of promoting the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Those who are involved in the promotion of the Irish language have long requested that there should not only be a Raidió na Gaeltachta but Teilifis na Gaeltachta.  They see that as the only way of ensuring the Irish language will have some hope of survival in the late 20th century and 21st century.  Television is the modern technological medium which people watch and unless we have a station broadcasting in the native language, the language will not be able to prosper.  That hope is dashed.  It looks like it will be impossible to see that development taking place.  This is the death knell, the new threat to the Irish language.  In the context of this Bill may I ask the Minister what proposals he has for the promotion of the Irish language on the airwaves. How does he see them affecting the Irish language?  I can only see them as being detrimental.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Fianna Fáil Party's partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats, we have seen a very solid <Col N="721" /> coalition on this issue.  Yesterday we saw the Progressive Democrats entering the lobbies to impose a guillotine on the proceedings of the Seanad.  They came to this House even though their stated public policy is to abolilsh the House and we expected that while they were here they would participate fully in the democratic functions of the House and uphold them. Their criticism of this House was that it was inefficient, was not doing its duty and that there was no need for it.  Certainly, their actions yesterday in supporting the guillotining of the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Progressive Democrats will have something to say when they speak on this Bill.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the Broadcasting Bill has been introduced and supported by the Government means that we will find ourselves with a united front of free marketeers who on the one hand speak about the cold wind of the marketplace blowing at all levels of Irish industrial society and then look for support for the private sector.  It is a question of one rule for the private sector and another rule for the public sector.  Surely if we are talking about levelling the playing field we can expect the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil will consider a similar policy for both.  We should not be introducing a policy of protectionism for the private sector while we are introducing a policy of nobbling a successful public sector body that is competing in the same area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The trade union movement have been very concerned about the effects of this legislation and the General Secretary, Peter <Col N="722" /> Cassels, has said very many of the provisions of the Bill were completely unacceptable to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The decision of Congress was to withdraw from the joint committee reviewing State companies under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Despite the changes that took place at the annual conference in Tralee last week, the conference strongly condemned the Bill and described it as an act of vandalism.  They said it represented a serious infringement on the social partnership that had been developed under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Members at the annual conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were outraged at the provisions of the Bill.  It is putting in jeopardy the prospect of a new programme for national recovery because it is attacking the very core of what is being sought in that programme. The responsible social partners, the Government and the trade union movement, are working for the benefit of the country in terms of industrial promotion and expansion and employment creation. The opposite will take place when the Bill is passed.  We are talking about one side of the partnership going out on their own, like a bull in a china shop, and undermining one very successful industrial operation and causing the loss of permanent employment.  We will see a rise of poorly paid jobs, as is the position with many independent stations.</P>
    <P>This is contrary to the expressed wishes and public calls by the Taoiseach to the semi-State sector to increase employment. How will this semi-State body increase employment if advertising, which is the source of their revenue, will be limited?  On the one hand the Taoiseach is calling for an increase in employment and during the semi-State sector to get dug in and increase employment and on the other hand the Minister for Communications is introducing legislation which categorically will have the effect of decreasing employment not only in RTE but in a wide range of areas.  We need some assurances on Government policy in regard to this.  I would like the Minister to address this issue.  We need greater <Col N="723" /> assurances.  We need a national broadcasting policy rather than this <i>ad hoc</i> interference that has happened from time to time and which has been proposed on such a wide and damaging scale in this legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of the Government's strategy for overall privatisation.  It is not something that has come out of the blue. It is not a foolish Bill, but it has been introduced in a very unsatisfactory way. The Minister made certain statements and then rode back from them and made others.  It is very sloppy legislation.  It is part of the Government's overall strategy for privatisation in the semi-State sector. It will level the playing field in favour of the private sector which, of ocurse, is contradictory in terms of the marketplace philosophy and the economics that are being promulgated publicly by both sides of the Coalition.  This is where I find most of the hypocrisy in what is being proposed here.</P>
    <P>The second prong of their strategy is control of the media.  That is effectively what this Bill will do.  The Minister is seeking to control RTE and the independent stations by first, capping the amount of advertising by RTE, from which they get their revenue &mdash; this which will limit and restrict their operations &mdash; and secondly, imposing a code of practice which will restrict their operations in the areas of sponsorship and commercial enterprise.</P>
    <P>There is popular hostility against the Bill and the country at large is opposed to it.  Because almost 50 per cent of the Oireachtas is very forcibly opposed to the legislation, the only way the Minister could get it through both Houses was by using the guillotine.  This is unsatisfactory and undermines the whole function of the Oireachtas which is to pass legislation after it has been properly debated and teased out.  This Bill is a blatant attack by the Government on RTE, the most successful public company in the history of this State.  It is an attempt by the Government to muzzle RTE and to weaken their competitiveness.  The <Col N="724" /> Labour Party totally oppose this legislation. The only desirable thing that could happen would be to withdraw it and start again from scratch.</P>

      <P>Senator John A. Murphy asked me this morning if he could contribute a little earlier.  It should be the turn of Senator John Dardis to contribute and he has agreed to let Senator Murphy contribute before him. Does the House agree to accommodate Senator Murphy in the circumstances? Agreed.</P>

      <P>Our dreadful secret is out, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
      <P>The first thing I want to say is that I do not propose to attribute any malicious motive to the Government in bringing in this Bill.  It has been variously said that the purpose of this Bill is to benefit the Government's political friends in the independent broadcasting area and/or to punish RTE for their alleged anti-Government record, with particular reference to the last election campaign and the emphasis given to the debacle of the health services.  I have no evidence to suggest that this Bill is basely motivated. Maybe it is that some remaining wisps of lost innocence still drift about me, but I really believe that one would have to be of a fairly Machiavellian cast of mind to believe that the Government are prostituting the legislative process in order to exact revenge, to line the pockets of their friends, or to show their disapproval of RTE's Dublin 4 values, as being allegedly contrary to Fianna Fáil populism I find all that a bit far-fetched, and I do not particularly want to be associated with that attribution of malign motives because the scenario thus suggested is unacceptable in its cynicism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think RTE have been particularly anti-Fianna Fáil.  If the present Government and the last Government have reason to be displeased with RTE, looking at current affairs programmes, I sometimes think the Government have only themselves to blame either because of their frequent pigheaded refusal to <Col N="725" /> send along representatives to a programme or by sending along someone who was utterly inadequate.  The pattern of public broadcasting and Government relations shows a persistent healthy, and natural pattern of tension.  It is not just Fianna Fáil Ministers who are displeased with RTE from time to time &mdash; we have very short memories if we think like that &mdash; and it is not just Fianna Fáil Ministers who have responsibility for broadcasting who have tended to think paternalistically that they know best.  A man whom I admire greatly and who has played a unique part in the public life in this country, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, was quite certain, and remains quite certain, that he knows what is best for broadcasting. This is by no means something peculiar to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>To go back to the 1973-77 Coalition, nothing quite like the biting satire of &ldquo;Hall's Pictorial Weekly&rdquo; has been seen since then.  It was a very politically damaging programme which arguably contributed to the fall of that Government in the election of 1977.  To their great credit, the Coalition Government did not, so far as I know, take any action in that regard.  Indeed, in a democracy they cannot take any action.  This so-called animus the Government are supposed to have against RTE is no more than the normal pattern between broadcasting and Government, not alone in this country. I was in Australia recently and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation were accused by their critics, some of them Government critics, of being arrogant, monopolising public opinion and so on, the kind of criticism one heard in the past about the BBC as well.  Public broadcasting services of their nature tend to become establishments and tend, therefore, to attract criticism.  I do not believe that a Government will conduct a vendetta against RTE because of the public broadcasting service's right and duty to be critical of that Government.</P>
    <P>I give the Government credit for introducing the Bill for motives of policy. There is at least one section of the Bill which I welcome, that is, the section which gives the Broadcasting Complaints <Col N="726" /> Commission more teeth.  I have been a member of that commission and I thought that their powers and, in particular, their means of communication and of publishing their findings were very limited.  I accept that the Government have brought in the Bill for policy motives rather than for any ulterior motive.  I hope that my arguments will be strengthened by the fact that I dissociate myself from the malign scenario.  Nonetheless, it seems that the political thinking behind the Bill is flawed, the Bill itself, in terms of objectives and methods, is mistaken and ill-judged and is likely to be disastrous in its outcome.</P>
    <P>Much of what I wanted to say has already been said by Senator Costello and others.  I do not propose to go over that ground except to say that I find the arguments which suggest that the capping of RTE advertising is not necessarily going to strengthen the independent broadcasting sector very convincing. There is no guarantee that reducing RTE revenue is going to strengthen the independent broadcasting sector.  Is olc an ghaoth ná séadann do dhuine éigin, the seanfhocal says, but the &ldquo;duine éigin&rdquo; in this case is very likely to be a beneficiary outside the State, the most probable beneficiary of diverted revenue will be UTV.  Revenue once diverted will not easily be attracted back.  TV3 has been cited in this regard.  We must remind ourselves that TV3 is still notional and its future problematic.  We need another television service like a hole in the head, given the fact that most of the country now is increasingly able to receive ten, 12 &mdash; and in Cork I think we have 15 plus &mdash; channels, many of them simply duplicating the same kind of programmes. I find it very hard to believe that TV3 will make any real addition, if you like, to the cultural broadcasting wealth of the nation.</P>
    <P>To say that the diverted revenue of RTE will benefit a purely notional, problematic service is making a very far-reaching jump indeed.  My only concern in regard to the independent broadcasting sector is that of the local and regional broadcasting services.  I have no <Col N="727" /> great interest &mdash; and I believe this is shared by many people &mdash; in the so-called national independent radio services. Nothing I have heard to date leads me to believe that they have, in any way, enriched our broadcasting culture but the local and regional services are a different matter.  Certainly, it is the public and Government concern that local broadcasting services should be strengthened.</P>
    <P>In that regard, there is a very interesting article in to-day's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> about the success of Clare FM which apparently is outstandingly successful in achieving a very high listenership The article discussed the reasons for this and dwelt on the personality of the chief executive of Clare FM, Mr. Caimin Jones, about whom two significant points could be made, one that he was a student of my own and the other, that he is an ex-RTE man.  It is a tribute to the history of RTE that most of the professional pool of expertise in this country is RTE-trained.  The same can be said of the chief executive of Kerry Radio, which is now about to get off the ground.  What Mr. Jones said in the interview is of interest in the debate in this context.  He said that if RTE had promoted a vigorous local radio policy, there would not have been any need for a commercial broadcasting initiative.  I firmly believe that.  To that extent, RTE were negligent in not fully meeting that need.  Perhaps they were not encouraged by the Government to do so.  That is another matter.</P>
    <P>The other significant point made &mdash; not by Mr. Jones but by somebody else in that article this morning &mdash; was that in spite of Clare FM's success, there must be a huge question mark over their ability to attract revenue because the pool of revenue is limited in the country and because of small numbers.  It does not matter how vital and vigorous the local service is, unless it has a large listenership the advertising bodies are not interested in it.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's original statement in the Dáil on 7 June, the basic philosophical line was that monopoly is a bad thing, that it is ending all over Europe and <Col N="728" /> that we must diversify, which is perhaps another word for privatise, the broadcasting service.  I would ask the House to think for a moment about the word &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo;.  It has various derogatory associations but I suggest that there are monopolies and monopolies.  Again, if I may advert to my recent travels, I have seen examples of really bad broadcasting monopolies which directly resulted in a poor quality service.  I do not think that anyone could ever have accused RTE of that kind of monopoly.  It seemed to me that although technically there was a monopoly in RTE, within that monopoly there was a marvellous diversity of creativity and independence where individual talents were encouraged.  We should make the distinction, that the so-called RTE monopoly was not really a threat to a variety of opinions or different ways of presenting our culture and so on.  Of course, RTE had their faults.  I use the past tense because it seems to me that the present Bill is very much a turning point.  From the point of view of being overstaffed, featherbedded and so on, the public broadcasting service would have made a much more justifiable target perhaps five or ten years ago.  There has been reform and it was a considerably leaner, fitter and healthier service before it experienced the present onslaught.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello has referred to the implications of lost advertising revenue and how far-reaching they are.  Indeed, some of the material sent to Deputies and Senators in the last few weeks has revealed not alone how wide and varied the opposition to the Bill is, but how, in the most unexpected ways, the diversion of revenue from RTE will affect all kinds of worthy causes.  For example, the Irish Cancer Society pointed out that a reduced advertising rate which allows them to broadcast their educational material may no longer be available because the new regime will compel RTE to cut down the special rate and, therefore, to limit educationally beneficial programmes in terms of cancer and other health problems.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello also quoted the Association of Advertisers in Ireland who <Col N="729" /> sent us a very interesting memorandum indeed reminding us of something which I think has been lost sight of in the Minister's general philosophy, that this is a very small economy, that the advertising pool is very limited and fixed, that some of the arguments about diverisfication and privatisation and spreading the whole industry may well make sense in the context of a large economy and a large country like the United States but in a country with a total population of 3.5 million &mdash; an adult population of 2.5 million over 15 years which is the effective listening audience, many of the arguments about diverting and increasing the revenue are simply not applicable.  The memorandum from the Association of Advertisers in Ireland also emphasises a point brought up by previous speakers, namely, that revenue is almost certain to be diverted to more attractive markets outside the State, notably to UTV.</P>
    <P>Finally, this memorandum speaks about the deleterious effects of the present measure on the advertising industry itself, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The advertising industry is an employer of highly skilled artists, designers and other creative technically trained people.  These people are essential for the development of our economy in the current and post 1992 Europe.  If advertising revenue leaves our country, we will lose both its control and the people who create Irish advertising.</P>
    <P>Equally impressive is the presentation of the marketing society &mdash; which was again adverted to by Senator Costello &mdash; who urge the reality that UTV are the most likely beneficiary of diverted revenue and I quote:</P>
    <P>Any price rise in advertising will tend to squeeze the smaller advertiser out of the market in favour of the big budget international marketing company. This can have a detrimental effect on the growing sector of new small Irish companies.</P>
    <P>This would appear to be contrary to the Minister's stated objective.  The memorandum <Col N="730" /> goes on to outline all the knockon effects, so to speak, of the change in advertising.</P>
    <P>My main concern, however, is with the likely impact of the Broadcasting Bill and especially of lost revenue on RTE on their morale, on the changed attitude it will bring about among editors and programme producers, on the quality and quantity of home-produced programmes &mdash; at the moment 37 per cent of RTE TV programmes are home-based &mdash; and, in short, the impact of the Bill on the life and health of a great national institution.</P>
    <P>RTE is one of our great success stories. Again, when one has some experience of comparative services around the world one realises how splendid the service is. It is often said that the Irish State was fortunate in starting off its life with a very good Civil Service and that is very true. I think it has been equally fortunate in that the national broadcasting service from the beginning in the 1920s attracted people of great talent, commitment and dedication.  In a very subtle way our national broadcasting service has kept on reflecting us as a changing people.  As we changed from being a rural people to an urban people, as we became more modernised and so on, RTE radio, and more recently television, has reflected that process, contributed to that process and shaped that process.  Perhaps we are good at that kind of thing.  Perhaps communications is our forte as a people.  At any rate, there have been superb programmes over the years in so many areas, minority areas catering for minority tastes, made by talented people, who did it for no other reason than that they are good professionals who were not getting any extra money for doing it, who did it as wage earners.</P>
    <P>I recall offhand a marvellous pattern of colour-sound in a programme called &ldquo;All Ireland Day&rdquo; which lasted for an hour and was a marvellous impressionistic evocation of a unique day in our national life.  I ask myself who would make that kind of programme in an independent radio service, the only purpose of which was to make money?  Who could <Col N="731" /> be bothered to make that kind of programme?</P>
    <P>I can only fear then for the impact of this Bill on areas like drama, documentaries, the RTE sponsored film sector, the vital music area and, as Senator Costello said, the Irish language programmes.  Who else is committed to looking after the Irish language, inadequately as many of us feel, that RTE have discharged that function?  Who else is going to look after the Irish language in the broadcasting service?</P>
    <P>I speak more in sorrow than in anger. I accept the inevitability of the guillotine measure.  In effect, the Seanad is revealed in these days as more impotent, more of a rubberstamp than we care to admit.  I can do nothing about it.  When Geoffrey Keating wrote his <i>Foras Feasa ar Éirinn</i> he said he was doing so in a spirit of melancholy and sorrow but it was his duty to record the glories of the Gaelic race before it perished.  Without being pretentious, I think what must be done on this occasion is to put on record that RTE have been of great service to the nation and their future is now very much in peril.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Anti-national&rdquo; is a phrase I do not use, I do not like using it, but I think in this case it is a fair charge to say that the Government are acting in an anti-national way.  If someone in the 1930s and 1940s had introduced this kind of Bill to put down the national broadcasting service the Fianna Fáil of that day would have been the first up in arms against such a measure, because this Bill is an attack on a national institution.  Without too much exaggeration, it is a form of sabotage.  To retrieve a time-honoured phrase from the nationalist rhetoric of 19th century Ireland, of our forefathers' day, this is a bad day's work for Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by welcoming the Minister for Communications to the House.  I am very glad he is staying with us this morning.  I realise he might wish to be in other places, but we thank him for his attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House is controversial and has been shown to be so.  It <Col N="732" /> needs serious and studied consideration. This week and last week we had many appeals across the floor of the House for a delay in its introduction, that we come back in September and so on.  The word most frequently used was &ldquo;reflection&rdquo;; we needed reflection before we could go on to consider this Bill.  On the basis of the length of time some Senators have taken, I think we have had more than enough time to reflect adequately on the Bill.  It is also understandable that the Government should move to close the debate.  One Senator last week went on for two hours.  I do not think it takes two hours to state a case.</P>
    <P>I have had some experience of working for RTE and I discovered that the shorter the script one was preparing the longer it took.  On that basis it would seem that some people who stand up can go on with no preparation whatsoever because they can talk out the time for as long as they like.  I find it ironic indeed that some of the Senators on the Independent benches &mdash; I exclude Senator Murphy &mdash; who never cease to amaze me with their capacity for instant reaction to every conceivable topic were among the most vocal when asking for a period of reflection. Being reflective is not a characteristic that springs immediately to mind when thinking of those Senators.</P>
    <P>When the Minister published his original proposals we in the Progressive Democrats expressed reservations about their content.  In particular, we were concerned about the future of 2FM and restrictions on what it could broadcast and about giving £3 million to Century Radio.  We believed the proposals were contrary to fair play, and our opposition to them and to other suggestions from the Minister is a matter of public record. It resulted in discussions which have led to amendments in the legislation.  I believe the modified Bill now before us takes some &mdash; not all &mdash; of our views into account.  I continue to have reservations about certain provisions in the Bill, but I realise it is unrealistic to expect that I, or indeed my party, the Progressive Democrats, as a very much smaller party in Government can hope to have our way <Col N="733" /> on every part of the legislation that comes before the Oireachtas.  We have to live in the real world.</P>
    <P>It is odd that people who several weeks ago were haranguing the Minister for being doctrinaire and unbending are the very people who are now saying he is weak and dithering because he has made amendments.  It is one thing or the other; it cannot be both.  While I am still unhappy about certain aspects in the Bill, I believe it is quite proper to regulate what is, after all, our national radio and television station, and it is also appropriate to place controls on any company or organisation who might constitute a monopoly or abuse a dominant position within the market.  That is not to be anti-market; that is to allow those wishing to do so to compete and operate in a fair market where they can compete successfully.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments which have been expressed in relation to RTE having served the country very well and I am confident they will continue to do so. Over the years, the staff in RTE have performed their duties to the highest professional standards and the quality of their produce can be compared favourably with broadcasting services anywhere. I accept that there is diversity within the broadcasting content of the station and I agree with Senator Murphy that having looked at broadcasting in America and most of Europe and in the Far East, the quality of the RTE product is as good as one would find anywhere.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not affect the commitment of RTE people to excellence or their ability to make the best of the resources available to them.  However, just as we in this House have a responsibility to RTE, the station, as a State service, has a responsibility to the country and a responsibility to work within a legislative framework set down by the Oireachtas.  That is a very important principle. The Oireachtas decides on behalf of the people.  That is its privilege; that is its duty.  There may be defects in the system.  It may not be palatable to those who feel that their vision of Ireland or <Col N="734" /> their idea of public taste is the only view which should prevail, but it is the best system we have, the basis of our democracy. There may be some people in RTE or elsewhere who believe they know what is best for the country.  They may be right, but that is not the point.  The point is that the Oireachtas has the right to regulate and it does so to the best of its collective ability.  If a regulation is subsequently found to be erroneous, it can be overturned by democratic decision.</P>
    <P>I have not heard anybody in either House say that he would repeal this legislation. It has been suggested that it is impossible for independent radio stations or the press to compete with 2FM for advertising because there is a degree of cross-subsidisation of 2FM rates and that, if that is the case, it is unfair competition. We do not find it acceptable to be lectured across the floor of this House by parties who, when they were in Government, abdicated their responsibilities to broadcasting and brought nothing but chaos to broadcasting by allowing pirate stations to flourish without responsibility to anyone.  I fully accept the view that people who go into commercial enterprises take risks in expectation of personal gain, and if they fail they must take the consequences and that the State should only intervene for pressing social reasons, such as large scale job losses. Equally, if the State imposes restrictive conditions affecting ability to compete, it must move to ameliorate the consequences of such restrictions.  That is why independent radio stations must be allowed fulfil their public service responsibility without being penalised.</P>
    <P>CKR Radio in Kildare are doing an excellent job and filling a public need. Some of the people who have had most to say about this matter have not even heard their local radio stations.  I listen to my local radio station most mornings coming in here and the quality of their product is excellent.  The same is true of Louth/Meath Radio, another example of good local broadcasting.  The choices that these stations give to radio listeners is very positive.  It is not exaggerating to say that this is the essence of democracy, the <Col N="735" /> promotion of diverse views and culture, so that people can make a free choice.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, recently we have been subjected to a propaganda war as much as to a political war and it has brought home just how easy it is to manipulate people's views if they are confined to only one source of information.  Even the presence of BBC and UTV to those who can receive those stations is a balancing influence in our society.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to my party's position in relation to this House and other matters, and it is appropriate for me to respond.  Our views are well known.  I absolutely reject the Senator's suggestion that we have not participated fully in the workings and in the life of this House.  It is up to the House to prove its relevance.  Frequently, in my experience, it has not done so.  Two to three hour speeches cannot be described as relevant. As a political party we realise that this House is a political institution.  As a political party we must participate in a political institution of the State.  We also realise that we are in a minority in asking for the abolition of this House, that the large parties, not just the Government party, do not wish to see it abolished.  We have to be realists.  As long as it is there, we will be here and will participate.  I hope to be able to participate in this House for as long as I am allowed.</P>

      <P>Absolutely, yes.  We have what is commonly regarded as a stable Government bringing signficant improvement to our economic circumstances. We as junior partners in the Government have contributed to that state of affairs.  We have stated our position on the Radio Bill and on other matters and will continue to do so.  We do not always have our view prevail, but that is in the nature of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello suggested that there was some devious plot to control everything and everybody in RTE.  I do not see anything wrong with setting up the <Col N="736" /> legislative framework within which RTE will operate, but there is no question of anybody from this House or anywhere interfering with the editorial content of what RTE produce.  The people who are responsible for editorial content are free to exercise their judgment and produce quality products.  There is no animosity, certainly in this quarter, towards RTE or the people who work there.  Healthy tension is a positive thing and there certainly is that.  That contributes to what RTE do and I have no reservations about the commitment of the people to their jobs.</P>
    <P>There have been fears about job losses but if we look at the sector as a whole it must be conceded that there has been considerable growth in employment in that sector given what the local radio stations are doing.  I hope that independent programme production can continue to flourish and produce high quality material as in previous years.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the Bill are quite positive. I welcome the Minister's decision to increase the amount of advertising time to five minutes in one hour, although I would have preferred if it were more. Like Senator Murphy I welcome the complaints procedure to rectify an attack on a person's honour or reputation.  It is important that an individual's rights be protected by legislation and that he should be able to have his name cleared if necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Teilifís na Gaeltachta and said that the establishment of a TV channel will not rule out the possibility of establishing Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  I welcome that.  I realise that people in advertising are very unhappy about what is proposed, but perhaps their unhappiness derives from the fact that to date it has been very easy for them to have an advertising campaign which could go into one station without a great deal of effort and earn a great deal of money for them.  There is a vast market there.  It will not contract, but they will have to work for it.  There is nothing wrong with that.  These are my party's and my observations on the Bill and we will be supporting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this very important Bill.  At the outset, I wish to say I strongly resent the attack made on the Minister and the Government. RTE, their employees and the members of whatever political party they can muster have done a major disservice by sensationalising the issue.  By doing so, they have prevented Members in both Houses from seriously considering the legislation.  I, for one, do not take seriously the views expressed by my colleague, Senator Murphy.  He stated the Seanad is being used.  However it is common practice for someone, if they cannot get the support they would like or obtain the agreement of the House, to argue the House is wrong.  I believe the Minister has approached the matter in the right way.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a responsibility to the nation far beyond his responsibility to RTE.  His first responsibility is to the nation, the people and the silent majority who do not have any muscle and who are unable to demonstrate and block the streets in front of this House for three hours.  The views of these taxpayers should be taken into consideration by the Minister who I believe has done no more and no less than that.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in this Bill which will pose a threat to RTE.  Indeed, it is long overdue and was in limbo during the term of office of the Coalition Government who could not agree on the best way to present legislation to deal with what was a growing problem.  The Minister has interpreted the views of the public in the correct way and the Bill will make a major contribution in regulating something which has gone out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other speakers, I am very pleased with the performance of RTE and the way in which they have approached our national games, the Eurovision Song Contest and so on.  They are a credit to the nation and I am one of those people who look on them with a sense of pride but it is only right and proper, like all other national and international companies, that they should be examined. <Col N="738" /> There is a duty on public representatives to assess the progress made and the way in which RTE have developed.  No matter how much we admire the contribution made by them and their employees to the nation, we have to recognise that RTE are a powerful organisation.  However, there are dangers that go with such power; for example, they see themselves as being above control and codes of practice. Therefore, we more than welcome this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, the Government and Fianna Fáil are not paranoid about what is said on current affairs programmes carried on RTE.  One of the questions which needs to be addressed is, should RTE receive all the funds raised by way of the licence fee?  People in rural Ireland, especially those who cannot pick up RTE &mdash; it cannot be picked up in some pockets of the country &mdash; would disagree.  Should RTE have the right, from Bantry Bay in County Cork to Malin Head in County Donegal, to monopolise advertising revenue? I strongly believe they should not be given this right and codes of practice should be adhered to.  There has been much scaremongering in an effort to get the Minister believe there will be job losses in RTE but no one who understands the issue believes jobs will be lost in the advertising section of RTE.</P>
    <P>Like many other companies, RTE tend to believe they have achieved major success but I would remind them they achieved such success because they had a monopoly, were State financed and had all the advantages other companies in Ireland did not have.  There is a danger they will let this success go to their heads. Therefore, I claim the legislation is long overdue.</P>
    <P>RTE have levelled criticism at public representatives and politicians but they should bear in mind that they have had a few runners themselves.  During the years people from RTE have been sponsored and have become active politically. Indeed, some have been elected but they did not make any sensational contributions. To be quite honest, they failed miserably.  I ask RTE to indicate if they <Col N="739" /> believe in monopolies.  Watching programmes in recent months in which they criticised companies whom they alleged had monopolies one would get the impression that RTE do not believe in monopolies; yet, when it comes to their own affairs, it is clear they would like to have a monopoly in broadcasting.</P>
    <P>RTE tried desperately hard to block the introduction of local community radio.  If any criticism can be levelled at the Minister it is that he has not been tough enough and only took action when it became abundantly clear that local radio stations would not survive if RTE were given a free hand.  I do not subscribe to nor do I accept the Minister's intention of capping the revenue or his plan to rescue any local radio or television station.  From my personal knowledge I am aware that RTE have made it almost impossible for local radio stations to get on the air.  The suitable locations in County Donegal for local radio broadcasts were within an area that was fenced off and was the property of RTE.  RTE sought approximately £60,000 to erect a radio mast inside this fenced off area and to use a right of way.  They also sought a substantial amount of revenue per annum which it would have been impossible to pay.  The County Donegal local radio station were forced to select another location outside the control of RTE.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record &mdash; and I am aware of what I am saying &mdash; that following the setting up of Highland Radio, Donegal, RTE increased power to try to put them out of business.  If the Minister wishes to press the button at this very minute and does a test on the output of RTE in County Donegal he will see that it is far in excess of what it should be using.  This is a deliberate attempt to make it impossible for Highland Radio Donegal to exist.  That arrogance is consistent with many of the practices demonstrated by RTE.  I ask the Minister to take positive action because there are a number of people who may not have a voice but are aware that that arrogant attitude has got to be tackled.  Many <Col N="740" /> people may not be able to write to the Department or look for fair play but the Minister has a responsibility in this regard.  I have a responsibility to say to the Minister &mdash; and this is the only medium I have &mdash; that he must ensure local radio stations get fair play.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Highland Radio Donegal I want to inform the Minister that they do not want funds from his Department, from the licence fee or from any other source but they do want a fair crack of the whip.  They do not want any restrictions or to be blocked out by increasing the signal by RTE.  I have an obligation to say that.  Because RTE have not been in a position to give coverage nationally, it was right and proper that the Minister took positive action to license local radio stations.</P>
    <P>I could complain, and I am sure most rural areas find themselves in the same position as County Donegal.  County Donegal features in the news only when something sensational happens or when there is bad news.  Recently bags of waste were washed up on the beaches and along the River Foyle.  The RTE &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; team went down to do a biased programme excluding those who had another point of view and they put out a programme on the pollution of the River Foyle.  I can state here and now that they will find themselves in court defending their right and the content of that programme. I complained bitterly and should like to put it on the record that County Donegal features on RTE only when there is bad news, for example, when we have a pollution scare, when we are bringing bodies ashore after disasters at sea or catastrophes.  Consistently we feature in the news when it is bad.  County Donegal does not feature if we have something which would benefit the county.  That is not the kind of participation and involvement the people of my county want.  There must be a balanced and fair approach.  If we cannot depend on the Minister and his Department to exercise that control, through legislation, then I do not know what RTE would offer us.</P>
    <P>This has been a useful Bill and, like <Col N="741" /> other Members, I feel it is a pity the Bill could not have been discussed in a calmer atmosphere.  Many sections in the Bill could have been examined more carefully but that is not the fault of the Minister. The Minister did his utmost but he was confronted with an Opposition who were not prepared to listen or to discuss the very important measures in the Bill which were many years overdue.  The Minister has made an honest and serious attempt to regularise something which was totally out of control.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and hope he succeeds.  The vast majority of the people of this nation who have not been part of the sensational drive against him, against the Bill and the Government did not have an opportunity to speak.  I am glad I was in a position to make my contribution, which is only a token of what is felt nationally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Broadcasting Bill. I am one of those who is opposed to it and I do not have as sanguine a view of it as my friend, Senator McGowan.</P>
      <P>I would like to start where Senator Murphy left off in relation to the role of the Seanad where this Bill is concerned. We are ending the Seanad for this first year on a fairly appropriate note given the problems we have had throughout the last 12 months, in that we are discussing a Broadcasting Bill where the Seanad, according to our Constitution, has a profound function in the State.  Its function is to discuss and tease out in a vocational sense all legislation that is to be enacted by the State.  This vocational approach is supposed to be one where we look at the detail on Committee Stage and where the Minister may from time to time give or take a point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, we are discussing this Bill today in the most appalling circumstances because we are really dealing with a charade.  Because of the guillotine and the number of speakers who are offering on Second Stage, it is extremely unlikely that any discussion will take place on Committee Stage so that there will not be a possible single constructive <Col N="742" /> line that might emanate from an Opposition source discussed.  Even if we reached Committee Stage we would still be dealing with a charade because it is arranged by the Dáil that it will return very late this year.  The terms of the Bill before us state that the Bill will come into operation on 1 October this year. Consequently the debate on this Bill in the Seanad is a total charade, because regardless of what any member of the Opposition or the Government parties may say, and regardless of what matters might be desirable on Committee Stage, so far as the minutiae of the Bill are concerned, none of them can be implemented unless the Minister has the will to arrange with the Government that the Dáil be recalled from its summer recess.  In practical terms we all know that neither the Minister nor Government have the least intention of doing so. Consequently, our words are wasted in the wind, they will appear in the Official Report but, in so far as this Bill can influence what is happening to any degree it is absolutely purposeless.  It constitutes an appalling background to this debate.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the Bill on which I want to comment in particular on the commercial pragmatic issues.  We are jumping into issues of a vocational nature here in far too hasty a vein.  We are talking about broadcasting policy, movements within the EC and the balance desirable between private and public sector broadcasting.  In respect of all such areas normally there should not be haste in the type of legislation that will constitute the culmination of issues such as this.  Normally this type of vocational issue &mdash; which should not engender too much heat &mdash; might be prefaced, for example by a Green or White Paper which, in turn, would lead to a conventional, national debate.  The views expressed by the vocational bodies, in this instance such as the RTE unions, the Association of Advertisers in Ireland Limited and The Marketing Society should have been sought.  All of this teasing out would then have led to legislation being introduced by a Government <Col N="743" /> which, in turn, would be discussed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Again, the process of having to come to the Seanad with legislation affords the public time to explore the issues and express their views.  In this case we see a <i>modus operandi</i> under which a Bill was introduced and was very quickly withdrawn because of the huge opposition there was to it.  Then the fat was in the fire because a Bill had been published by the Government.  In such circumstances a Government feel they must react by producing instant legislation, leading to us getting the Bill, in its final draft form, today.  This means we are getting instant legislation.  This leads to vocational groups, such as the Association of Advertisers in Ireland, The Marketing Society, the trade unions and other interested bodies, having to make representations not against the calm background of agreeing a White Paper or a preliminary speech on the part of a Minister but against the pressures of legislation actually going through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I contend that the judgment on this issue is wrong, is not the approach that should be adopted to this type of legislation and that we are jumping from the frying pan into the fire.</P>
    <P>It is interesting politically, I suppose, that the action of the Minister on this issue has united &mdash; we have a disunited Opposition here, which is an understatement &mdash; as has never been united before in the term of office of this Government all the disparate and opposition elements there are to the Government. It is not simply political opposition. We have here details of representations made to all of us by sound vocational groups such as the advertising groups. These groups are not pro public sector; they are not pro private sector; they are not pro Fianna Fáil, pro Fine Gael, pro Labour Party, pro The Workers' Party or the Independents; they are just making solid vocational representations in relation to a business they know very well.  In this instance all these groups &mdash; bar elements in the newspapers &mdash; are coming out very forcefully against the <Col N="744" /> Government's proposals in so far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>Of course we had in the first Bill the nonsense about 2FM, the question of the licence fee capping and the hasty withdrawal of all that.  But in regard to the new Bill, The Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland are on record as stating that, as a result, advertising costs could rise by upwards of 30 per cent. They believe the Minister's objective is not likely to be achieved, in regard to the diversification of advertising revenue.  I am not getting into the politics or minutiae of it; neither am I getting into the philosophy of whether one should go public sector, private sector or what mix there should be of both, but I am thinking of solid, pragmatic issues such as the national interest, advertising revenue, where the revenue will go and will it flow out of the country?  The Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland say that unquestionably the major beneficiaries of the restriction on RTE advertising revenue will be the other television companies such as UTV, Sky and other satellites beaming into this country.  In this sense it is quite untrue to suggest that RTE have a monopoly, that we must introduce private sector companies to crack that monopoly.  Already RTE compete hugely against massive infiltration by television companies from outside this State, such as BBC1, BBC2, UTV, Channel 4 or Sky.  Today the airwaves are open.</P>
    <P>If it is an issue of Century Radio having a problem &mdash; again we are into the radio sector akin to television but still distinctly different &mdash; it is interesting to refer to what the Minister had to say in the course of his Second Stage introductory remarks, on the Sound Broadcasting Bill in the Dáil on 20 November 1987 and I quote from the Official Report:</P>
    <P>In the current economic climate, where the Government finds itself having to make major savings in the provision of services which have a higher priority than broadcasting, and where it is finding it necessary to abolish or rationalise various State <Col N="745" /> agencies, it would be unacceptable to provide public moneys to finance a new broadcasting regulatory authority.</P>
    <P>On the same occasion the Minister continued:</P>
    <P>The Government also questioned whether radio service actually need the degree of regulation which would warrant the creation of a new State structure, given the trend internationally towards less or lighter regulation in the broadcasting sector.  We decided on the minimalist approach.  The new service to a large extent will be self-regulatory. Their sole source of income will be from advertising which will only be available if they have a substantial audience.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there appears to be a change of policy in that regard in so far as radio is concerned.  I support the change of policy.  I support the view that Century Radio should be supported, but I want to state unequivocally that support for Century Radio bears no relationship whatsoever to any consideration in so far as television broadcasting here is concerned. I am all for the approach that Century Radio be looked on in isolation by the Government and that a package be put together to help them.  We must foster the private sector in broadcasting as well as having a public sector, but I do not think we should mix our metaphors in this area.</P>
    <P>Even the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, in his approach to public sector broadcasting, is on record as supporting a package for Century Radio and some public sector investment in Century Radio if necessary.  That is an entirely separate issue.  It would cloud judgment were we to introduce the Century Radio issue into this debate because it bears no relationship to it.</P>
    <P>It is highly unsatisfactory that the various vocational groups to which I have referred cannot make representations in normal circumstances rather than having to react to a Bill.  The most satisfactory and succinct comment on the part of the vocational groups was represented in a <Col N="746" /> letter which arrived with my post about three days ago from The Marketing Society.  It is an incredible state of affairs that The Marketing Society can put their thoughts fully together only at a time when a Bill is leaving the Dáil and going to the Seanad which will be completely impotent in this case due to its structure and relevant operative dates.  Therefore, in many regards, we are dealing with farce here.</P>
    <P>The Association of Advertisers in Ireland Limited state that the proposed capping arrangements will leave RTE with half only of the advertising time allowed the independent commercial stations, half of what is allowed under EC directives.  They state that advertising costs will be pushed up and revenue diverted out of this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal in some detail with what The Marketing Society have said because they have put very succinctly what I believe to be the kernel of the commercial and pragmatic opposition to this Bill.  They say, in complimenting the Minister to a certain extent; let us put things into perspective:</P>
    <P>While the society agrees wholeheartedly with the objectives as stated in the Minister's speech to the Dáil on June 7 last, some of the aims intended to serve these objectives seem, in our professional opinion, unlikely to achieve their intentions.</P>
    <P>This is the kernel of entirely reasonable opposition of reasonable people to the Bill.  It is the opinion of unbiased people.</P>
    <P>I will refer to some of the issues they speak about.  If the amount of advertising on RTE is limited there are two immediate effects.  The first is that the cost of advertising will rise as all of the available time must be sold to maximise its permitted revenue.  The second is that advertisers who cannot get time on RTE will look to other relevant media instead.  In relation to this other relevant media, the Minister has made a colossal business misjudgment.  While it might be laudable for the Government, if a second commercial Irish television station was now up and running, to bring in some Bill which <Col N="747" /> might logically and pragmatically result in the lost revenue moving into this private sector television station in Ireland, one might still disagree with him, but one could say there was some business sense here.  The biggest single mistake the Minister is making in this legislation is allowing revenue to slip from RTE's hands.  It is revenue within the Republic of Ireland; it is Irish revenue flowing into RTE, flowing into the advertising agencies and flowing into the video companies.  The Minister is doing this without giving any guarantee or having any real reason to believe that loss of revenue will flow to other Irish companies.</P>
    <P>I do not think for an instant that one can believe that because advertisers have not space to advertise on RTE they will go to the Irish newspaper media.  I do not believe that because newspapers are an entirely different medium to television. It is for these reasons that professional people in the media business, in the video film companies and in the advertising agencies, without a political axe to grind are pounding the message home that in their view there will be a huge loss of revenue out of this State to television stations such as UTV and Channel 4 at present beaming into a huge proportion of houses in this country.  In relation to that issue the Marketing Society state:</P>
    <P>An advertiser who cannot obtain time on RTE but has the funds to advertise, is much more likely to seek an alternative broadcast medium.  The largest share of this is for television and an advertiser who has a television commercial available (often produced outside the country and therefore bearing no direct cost to the Irish marketing company) will select the next best TV alternative.</P>
    <P>The only serious alternative is UTV. Two out of three sets in the Republic can receive UTV programmes and this rises to 85% in Dublin.  The most likely effect of &ldquo;capping&rdquo; therefore is to drive money out of the economy into Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is without any guarantee that it will <Col N="748" /> recirculate among the other Irish media. They go on to state a view which I agree with very much.  The State is committed to the development of TV3 but pragmatically what are we talking about? They go on to state:</P>
    <P>The availability of TV3 still appears to be at least a year away; after that TV3 will have to build a reputation for its programmes and prove that it has a large enough viewership to justify advertisers spending money with the station.  This could take many years to develop, in the meantime UTV will have benefited from the &ldquo;capping&rdquo; and will fight hard to maintain the opportunity handed to it.</P>
    <P>That is a crucial comment, and I agree with it.  If TV3 was now up and going, was a commercial success, and if the revenue lost to RTE could flow into this new television station at least it would be saved for the State because, whether we agreed or disagreed with the Minister's rationale, at least it was an option.  At this stage, forcing RTE to lose revenue when we are at least a year away from the availability of TV3, and then it will be in an embryo state where it might not be an acceptable television advertising medium to many professional advertising punters, is writing a blank cheque of revenue that should be available to this State to companies outside this State.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to believe that even in a year's time TV3 will be up and going and providing a commercial service.  We can see what happened to Century Radio. I am not being critical of Century Radio. It is a fact of life in the private sector that there can be huge successes, middling successes and failures when one moves into green field operations.  That is what Century Radio were doing.  I hope they get their act together but it is a fact of life they are not a very attractive advertising medium at present to advertising companies. TV3 may be in an identical situation in one, two, three or four year's time.  That is why this is the single largest catastrophic misjudgment which has resulted in all these representations to <Col N="749" /> the Minister, the Government and the rest of us in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>They refer, as others have done, to the reduction in RTE earnings, shifting advertising money from the State to Northern Ireland, the fact that the commercials produced in London can flash onto UTV screens without an input from the video film companies in Dublin who have been building up a big business on the back of the development of RTE advertising, and this is in direct contradiction, they state &mdash; and I agree with them &mdash; to the Minister's objectives.  It is a classic example of politicians having pious hopes which they express in flowery speeches but when one gets to the nub of the issue on Committee Stage, or in the commercial sector with which the Minister is dealing, one finds a totally different situation.  If all this business had started with a Green Paper or preliminary speeches, the whole matter could have been teased out, and I would bet my bottom dollar we would not be ending up with the legislation we are on the point of putting onto the Statute Book this afternoon.</P>
    <P>I am not a particular fan of State companies, I am very much pro-private sector.  Having said that, I believe RTE have done an outstanding job as a broadcasting television agency in a very small country.  We are individuals; we have our pet hates and there are individuals we do not like very much in there.  Sometimes they seem to express philosophies we might not altogether agree with but, on balance, they have done superb work over the years in the area of drama and of music.  There is a need to have revenue for symphony concerts and major dramatic events which are in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I do not think the introduction of this type of legislation, particularly the cutting off of revenue without there being an alternative source in the State to mop it up is sensible.  What is lacking is a commercial approach and a sense of pragmatism and I, with others on this side of the House, are completely opposed to what is proposed.  The change of policy was referred to by a political journalist in <Col N="750" /><i>The Irish Times</i> about three weeks ago as one of the most comprehensive political U-turns in recent years.  It is this jumping from the frying pan into the fire that has us in the difficulty we are in here today.  It is regrettable that with so many speakers offering it will be virtually impossible to have any comprehensive discussion of the Bill on Committee Stage.  That is very undesirable.</P>
    <P>We have had representations from the RTE Managers Association.  They point out that most of this lost television advertising revenue will flow out of the State to Ulster Television and perhaps some to Channel 4 who have 55 per cent coverage of homes in the Republic and a much higher ratio in Dublin.  The association go on to state that it is felt in the advertising industry that it would be difficult to entice such revenue back to the Republic again. The impact on the reduced minuteage and revenue is analysed, illustrating that the loss in revenue may need to be recouped in a manner which will be very counter-productive. The <i>Engineers' Journal</i> have published their comments on the Broadcasting Bill.  There are some very interesting observations in relation to the Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley review of RTE which was carried out in 1985, which point to the extent to which RTE as an organisation have improved.  They have become financially stable, they have increased the amount of programming substantially in that period, home produced television programmes are now in excess of 2,500 hours a year, up over 50 per cent on 1985 levels.  All this has been achieved without any increase in the licence fee.  Employment in a wide variety of cultures and skills, both inside and outside the organisation, has been generated from the activity.  There has been a positive response to the challenges of today's commercial climate.  Against this type of background I would put it to the Minister that he is putting Irish employment in jeopardy.  The build-up of the input of advertising into RTE will be curtailed without alternative television advertising mediums into which these funds can flow, and this is the kernel of my criticism.  I know that all members <Col N="751" /> of the Opposition share my opposition to this Bill and I would join with them in rejecting the whole approach to the Bill; the guillotine, the lack of discussion on Committee Stage and the impossibility of there being any question of a single change on Committee Stage going back to a Dáil which will not be recalled from the summer recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that RTE have done a very good job, there is no doubt that they have a monopoly and a very powerful one.  It is essential that in the case of any monopoly set up by the State that the conditions under which they operate are clearly defined and set out by the Oireachtas.  The Minister and the Oireachtas are only carrying out their duty as legislators in bringing this legislation about.  RTE are powerful, and could be a very dangerous monopoly if misused.  RTE have been very vociferous in their condemnation of monopolies in other sections of the community but when it comes to themselves they want to protect their own monopoly.  This is the kind of double standard that the ordinary man in the street finds hard to understand or comprehend.  The Minister is to be congratulated for doing something about this.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that when he came into power he inherited a situation that was completely chaotic with between 70 and 80 pirate stations operating without a licence, and not covered by rules or regulations.  A Government allowed that to continue because they could not agree among themselves on the best thing to do, so they decided to do nothing and let the chaos continue.  This Minister set out to correct that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A monopoly like RTE can project whatever they feel like doing and they can also project whatever the interviewer wants projected.  We hear a lot about balance.  When I see some programmes, it reminds me of the old horse borrowed by the mean farmer in years gone by, he tightened him back three links and let the harness of his own horse out three links, the swings looked balanced but mind you <Col N="752" /> the borrowed horse was pulling a lot more, hence the old saying: &ldquo;the borrowed horse has hard hooves&rdquo;.  This is the kind of balance that was in RTE. Certainly there was balance, but if you noticed when somebody was making a point that they did not like, time ran out or they had to break for a commercial, in order to make sure that only what they wanted to get out went out.  Of course, there was a balance, but how were they balanced?</P>
    <P>We heard similar jargon when the Government decided to open up the skyways to allow more aeroplanes.  When Ryanair opened up we were told that jobs would be lost in Aer Lingus, fares would go out of all proportion, and they would fold up.  When they had the monopoly there was a strike in Aer Lingus during every sunshine week or during high season and nobody could get in or out of the country.  Since they have faced competition, employment has increased, fares have come down and strikes have ceased.  Where does that leave the many experts in this House who forecast a catastrophe for Aer Lingus?  It never happened. In other words, they improved under pressure.  I believe RTE can improve, because a monopoly leads to arrogance and to laziness &mdash; if nobody else is supplying something you can let the queue wait as long as you like.  I believe that competition is a good thing.</P>
    <P>RTE have studios around the country, but, what do they do?  On Sunday week last the yacht club in Mullaghmore invited the Minister for the Marine to announce a grant to refurbish and rebuild the pier, a beautiful bit of architecture. It was built by Lord Palmerstown in the 18th century and it was badly destroyed during last winter's storms.  Could we get Eileen Magnier of RTE to cover that? No way.  But I can assure you that if the Minister was coming down to tell us that he had no money for the pier, and a gang of flagwavers were protesting every little stone that was shifted during the storm would be exaggerated in sound and vision on television that night to try to show up the Government and the Minister as being neglectful, and doing nothing about <Col N="753" /> the beautiful architecture of the pier. When the news is good how often do they want to come to the area concerned? There is a quotation which goes as follows: &ldquo;Good, the more communicated the more abundant grows&rdquo;.  I do not know who said it but I could look it up.</P>
    <P>The sports personnel in RTE and indeed in the media in general have been excellent over the last number of years. See how our sports have improved and how our athletes have improved.  That is because their morale has been boosted, the media are showing the good side.</P>

There was a survey done in the Eastern Health Board area and up to 60 per cent of accidents were completely alcohol-related.  We see the hardship that all of this is bringing on families, and yet we allow it to be advertised.  We talk about banning cigarettes.  If we ban <Col N="754" /> that type of advertising, then there will be lots of space left for the genuine advertisements which will do good for people instead of injuring them.

      <P>During a contentious debate some time ago RTE condemned a certain class of people for using the pulpit to make their point.  I believe RTE have used the pulpit more than those people to condemn this Bill.  They have done themselves more harm than good and have gone out of their way to do a bashing job on the Minister.  I condemn them for doing this.  It is scandalous that they should use the national airwaves to specifically attack one man.  The Minister is carrying out his job and if RTE want to attack the Bill or the Government that is fair enough but it is nothing short of scandalous that they should attack one man.  They are a discredit to the nation and have shown the low depths to which they can descend.  It is callous and unforgiveable to make a personal attack on one person and they should be condemned for it.</P>
      <P>The pirate stations were set up in the first instance because RTE were not doing their job.  RTE2 was set up in competition with the stations which had been set up by industrious people who could not get reception from RTE1. The pirate stations were set up to fill the vacuum which existed in the market and, as we learned from our school books, nature abhors a vacuum.  Many of the staff vacancies in RTE were filled by personnel from some of those pirate stations. This proves that those stations were doing a worth-while job and employed good people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard about all the job losses in RTE.  I should like to refer to the 3,000 people who are employed in the live music business in Ireland.  Many of those people, for example, Daniel O'Donnell, Mick Flavin and John Hogan, would never have been heard of it it were not for the local radio stations.  Many people <Col N="755" /> would never have heard the beautiful voices of these singers or know about their capabilities if it were not for the unlicensed radio stations which played their records.  I believe the setting up of more local stations will lead to greater employment in the music business.</P>
    <P>All the emphasis is being placed on the loss of jobs.  I question why we always hear so much about jobs in Baile Átha Cliath.  What about all the jobs that will be created down the country when those stations are set up?</P>

      <P>When this was brought to the notice of RTE they said their interviewers were entitled to interview whom they liked.</P>
      <P>The people who are opposing this Bill are concerned only about their own interests.  One would think there were hundreds of jobs involved when in fact there are only five or six jobs.  I would remind those people of the following lines from a poem:</P>
      <P>We stand on the torrent's brink</P>
      <P>Our eyes on the clouds afar</P>
      <P>We fear the things we think</P>
      <P>Instead of the things that are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity so many people are motivated by self-interest.  The Opposition are so worried about their own interests that they have not put forward any suggestions on how the Bill could be improved but have concentrated instead on criticising the Government and the Minister, <Col N="757" /> something I detest.  Those are the sad facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>We have heard it said that RTE are anti-Fianna Fáil.  I do not agree with that point of view because I believe they are anti-establishment.  It is always the flag wavers who are interviewed first and Government Ministers and officials have to take the lower ground.  This is a disgraceful way to run a national broadcasting station.  The views of a public representative who is trying to do what is in the best interests of the people he is employed to work for should be heard before the views of the objectors.  Public representatives spend a great deal of time explaining comments which have been made by other people.  This should not be allowed to happen.  What happened to the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, is a typical example of this.  Luckily he knew the audience and was able to identify a person in it who had objected. He could name people and it was clear that the audience were loaded against the Minister, but the public were allowed to believe that this was a balanced programme.</P>
    <P>I have experience of good and bad television.  I will not criticise the Minister because it is easy to do so in opposition. On another occasion my predecessor as Chairman of Sligo County Council made some outlandish remark, RTE contacted him about the matter and he told them to contact me as I was the Chairman. RTE telephoned me, I spoke to them for about 15 minutes and 20 minutes later they telephoned back and said they did not want me because I would not adopt their line.  Where is the balance?</P>

      <P>We must face the fact that the world of communications is changing fast.  When RTE were established to bring in a television service nobody could foresee the explosion of technology. Since then there have been cable systems, satellite channels, pay channels, broadcast systems, competition and independent commercial channels.  It would be ostrich like not to face up to it.  It is essential that broadcasting legislation caters for all new developments.  We will have a great broadcasting service from which RTE will benefit when they are faced with competition from the private sector.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of ballyhoo about one station but they have not gone out of business &mdash; far from it &mdash; I hear them every morning.  They are regarded as underdogs but they, and other independent stations, provide very good news bulletins which put RTE to shame. Eventually RTE will realise that competition will do them a world of good.  It will be a lubricant to some of their wheels that got a bit rusty without opposition.</P>
      <P>Nowadays people want choice and are prepared to pay a lot more money for cable systems, satellites and higher aerials to get it.  We want programme choice in Sligo but we cannot get it.  For years Sligo County Council have been passing resolutions to make RTE accessible in some areas of North Sligo between Knocknarea and Benbulben which were blacked out.  We got the stock answer that it could not be done.  However, a local man put a reflector on the side of Knocknarea and beamed RTE into every house.  Why did RTE not do that?  They were too damn lazy and did not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Their own staff perhaps, but there was only a handful.  Looking at it on television one would think Jack's lads were arriving.  It is said the camera does not lie but it can certainly project an image to suit the person projecting it. The way they castigated and vilified our Minister was beneath contempt, it was scurrilous, scandalous and shameless.  If those same people were asked to open a supermarket or something of that nature they would charge a big fee but they would not be prominent except for exposure by RTE.  Why do they not do the same as Ministers, TDs and Senators who give their time and service free?  Why charge £1,000 to open a supermarket or £1,000 <Col N="760" /> for coming to a concert to do a half hour stint?</P>
      <P>RTE always adopt the negative approach.  On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; recently an expert on finance was interviewed in relation to the unification of Germany. The interviewer asked him what effect it would have on Ireland and he said that it would have positive and negative effects. However, the interviewer asked him to outline the negative effects.  The expert did not get a chance to elaborate on the positive effects because time ran out. This is the kind of balance we get.  We do not want to hear good news.  People are fed up with bad news, people with chips on their shoulders are telephoning with complaints and RTE make it appear that they are the norm.  This morning RTE were trying to justify unemployed people not going to work when offered employment. A registered unemployed person should take any job.  That negativism will disappear when the new broadcasting system comes in because this Government are doing a good job.  I am sure this Bill will be the first to try to regularise the monopoly in broadcasting.  It will do RTE good and I do not believe one job will be lost.  Indeed, I am sure many new jobs will be created around the country and better use made of the airwaves.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I thank the Minister for bringing it in.  I regret he got a raw deal from people who should know better.</P>

      <P>It was a rather sad experience sitting here this morning listening to <Col N="761" /> the voice of members of a great political party, Fianna Fáil, feeling themselves at such an extraordinary disadvantage and to what I felt were the rather naive views expressed that RTE would in some way discriminate against them because they did not turn up at the opening of an extension to a yacht club or something and did not constantly promulgate good news.  It was sad to hear that, but I am not going to go on at length about it because I am going to try to keep what I say short and confine my comments to things that may not have been said before, as far as I am aware.  I am sure the Minister would agree that it is important that we make some attempt to get on to the amendments, and I expect he will find it rather more lively, entertaining and interesting than merely a rehash of speeches he has heard already.</P>
      <P>First, I am glad the Minister has altered the Bill.  In its original form, the closest approximation to it in business life would be fraudulent conversion of funds or outright theft.  I welcome the fact that some of the provisions have been removed, because it would indeed have been a scandal to take money from the public purse, from the taxpayers, and deliver it into a private enterprise operation. Therefore, I am glad that at least that aspect of the Bill has been got rid of.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that Second Stage was terminated so abruptly in the Dáil; I have my own views on the methods by which that was done.  They are not similar to tactics that were engaged in by myself and others in this House, but again, it would be wasting the time of the House to go into too much detail on that issue, so I prefer not to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the view that this Bill is unconstitutional. The editorial of the <i>Irish Law Times</i> was read very extensively into the record.  It is there if anybody wants to read it and I am not going to rehash that. It seems the point was very clearly made in a paragraph which ends: &ldquo;Accordingly, under Article 40 there is a free market to broadcast and those engaged in same should be free to solicit advertising as part of that right&rdquo;.  It is certainly one <Col N="762" /> possible interpretation of Article 40.6 of the Constitution that there is a freedom to broadcast.</P>
    <P>If RTE wanted to broadcast 60 minutes of advertising, they are entitled to do that.  I do not think they would do it for very long, because the operation of free market forces would come into play and nobody would advertise on them; there would be no programming.  It is a logical situation, there would be a logical corrective there.  However, I think it is unconstitutional, it is dangerous.  There is widely held belief in professional circles that it is unconstitutional.  It has been said repeatedly on this side of the House, and there have been appeals to the machinery of the Constitution to have the Supreme Court invoked to assess whether this is the case.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to Article 27 of the Constitution which provides:</P>
    <P>This Article applies to any Bill, other than a Bill expressed to be a Bill containing a proposal for the amendment of this Constitution, which shall have been deemed, by virtue of Article 23 hereof, to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>1.  A majority of the members of Seanad Éireann and not less than one-third of the members of Dáil Éireann may by a joint petition addressed to the President by them under this Article request the President to decline to sign and promulgate as a law any Bill to which this Article applies on the ground that the Bill contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>2.  Every such petition shall be in writing and shall be signed by the petitioners whose signatures shall be verified in the manner prescribed by law.</P>
    <P>3.  Every such petition shall contain a statement of the particular ground or grounds on which the request is based,...</P>
    <P>I have drafted such an instrument and I have sought the agreement of Fine Gael, Labour and the Independents in this House, and I would like to inform the <Col N="763" /> Minister that the entire Opposition will be joined in this tactic.  It is, of course, open to the members of the Progressive Democrats Party if they have the kind of consciences they talk about from time to time, and it is open to any individual member of Fianna Fáil who may wish to join in this exercise.  It is highly unlikely that we will get sufficient numbers to trigger this mechanism completely, but the message will be sent to President Hillery and I believe he may well decide to refer the matter to the Supreme Court. I am placing that on the record so that the Minister will be aware of what we are doing.</P>
    <P>I intended to say as a preamble that I do not wish anything I say to be personally offensive to the Minister, and I hope it is not.  He is a man for whom I have a liking, and I think most people in this House have, and I think he is a good Minister for Justice.  He has shown himself to be a reforming Minister for Justice capable of innovation, but I think holding two such portfolios is really stretching credibility quite far and I cannot say I warm to him as Minister for Communications in the same degree as I do to his position as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I would like to address one or two things before I sit down.  The first is the question of the level playing field, so called.  The Minister seems to be under quite a misapprehension about the nature of what constitutes a level playing field. If he is interested in creating such a level playing field, then certainly I will be happy to back him.  His misinformation or misapprehension clearly extended to Senator Farrell who, just before lunch, said he thought advertising of strong liquor should be banned from the airwaves. The Minister, I am sure, is aware of the fact that it is already.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up the Minister's defence of the newspapers because I think he has been very clever.  I think he has a little bloc, a group around him.  Some newspapers, particularly Independent Newspapers Limited, have a large share-holding in the MMDS system.  They have a little benefit there for themselves.  Some <Col N="764" /> of the newspapers are waking up to the fact that the dislodged advertising will not go to the newspapers at all.  I should like to put certain figures on the record. We have heard about RTE having a monopoly or an advantage but the Minister I am sure is aware of figures relating to the newspaper industry.  The sale of covers brings in £135 million, of which 50 per cent goes straight to the newspaper publishers. The 1989 figures, in terms of specialised advertising from which radio and television are precluded, are as follows: £1.2 million in spirit advertising, £4.2 million in cigarette advertising, £11.2 million in appointments, and £12 million in property.  Then there are the planning applications and the political parties advertise regularly.  In the last election they spent £1.4 million on newspaper advertising.  RTE have to cover all the old boring Ard-Fheiseanna and that sort of business, but the newspapers cream off the revenue.  Here is a playing field that is not level.  Perhaps the Minister when replying will deal with this.  If the Minister really wants a level playing field he should level it up both ways. Would the Minister not agree that there is something askew here where the newspapers have a clear advantage in an area from which the broadcast media are precluded?</P>
    <P>I find the capping quite extraordinary because here we have a national broadcasting service of which we are justly proud, even though some people want to carp.  I am amazed at what sensitive little flowers politicians are.  The wounds that were bared in the House today were laughable.  The decision to go for capping will remove the incentive from broadcasting. That is the really dangerous and nasty thing about it.  The money that is dislodged will go to UTV, Cablelink and so on.</P>
    <P>With regard to the radio services, I would point out that, for example, Capital Radio which has a majority of listenership under 19 years, advertises beer, fortified cider, Stag and those kind of products.  I am concerned that there is not a level playing pitch here too.  The Minister is aware that even before his <Col N="765" /> intervention on behalf of the newspapers there was a significant shift in the market share as between the print media and the broadcast.  There was a shift between 1985 and 1989.  In 1985 the press had 31 per cent of total market share and 45 per cent in 1989, an increase of 45 per cent in four years.  Television, on the other hand, went from 40 per cent in 1985 to 29 per cent in 1989, down 27 per cent. RTE radio went from 12 per cent to 10 per cent which is down 17 per cent, magazines went from 10 per cent to 7 per cent and what they call outdoor advertising remained constant at 7 per cent. The press already have an increase of 45 per cent whereas television and radio have gone down by 27 per cent and 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that RTE have the benefit of a dual income, that they get both advertising revenue and licence fees and that for this reason they are in a favourable position.  This is naive thinking because most of the media, including the newspapers, draw their revenue from a variety of sources of income and do not depend entirely on advertising.  As the Minister knows, the only television service in Europe that is funded solely with licence fees is the BBC and we cannot imagine that we can compete with the BBC.</P>
    <P>I will point out the possible consequences of the Bill.  I have said that the Bill is unconstitutional and I intend operating specific machinery under the Constitution, for which I have the support of all the Opposition parties here, to try to get President Hillery to refer the matter to the Supreme Court.  There is also another political dimension to it because there is a Presidential election in the offing.  That will trigger a by-election in Dublin West.  It has already been referred to by the Government party.  A well known broadcaster was mentioned in this House by a Government speaker in relation to the by-election.  I wonder if the Government would be happy at the prospect of being reduced to a minority Government because of the impact of this Bill?</P>
    <P>I will not take a long time on this Bill <Col N="766" /> because it is important that we get into the meat of the debate, which is in the amendments.  I hope we will be allowed to do this because it is important that we have a balanced debate.  At some levels people regard this as an abstract debate. There has not, perhaps, been all that level of public concern or awareness.  People have not started squawking yet in great numbers and I believe that is because they do not quite follow what the impact will be.  I would like the House to realise what the proposals mean because the proposals as they exist in this Bill at the moment will reduce the potential in terms of advertising overall of RTE by 25 per cent, but the peak time availability by 33? per cent.  To give a concrete example, the revenue derived from each &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; will be reduced by about £28,000. This is a dangerous Bill, and a meanspirited Bill and it introduces a highly undemocratic element into our public life.</P>
    <P>I would not have been terribly happy with the transfer of large sums of money to people, particularly when I look at the people involved.  A year or two ago No. 29 Clare Street was destroyed by an act of public vandalism and one of the principals in the radio station the Minister was attempting to subvent from the public purse was directly involved in that act of vandalism.  I take a serious view of that.  These are the people he is saying we should put in charge on the culture of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Having said these things I will leave the Bill aside and finish my contribution on the basis that it is unconstitutional. We on this side of the House will be making every effort to have the Bill referred to the Supreme Court.  I suppose it is not too late to appeal to the Minister to withdraw the entire Bill.  The reason members filibustered the other day was, quite simply, that they were opposed, lock, stock and barrel to the entire nasty little package.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar an mBille seo.  Níl i gceist agam dul siar ar chuid de na hargóintí sa díospóireacht mar is dóigh <Col N="767" /> liom go bhfuil an talamh sin siúlta go maith.  I should like to refer the Senator Norris's last statement in which he suggested that the Bill should be withdrawn. I do not claim to have heard all the contributions on this Bill but I am amazed that total concentration has been on a few sections.  I intend to comment later on some of the more controversial aspects of the Bill but first I would like to refer to a number of sections about which there has been little comment in the debate to date.  At times small things can be important.  For example, section 9, which makes it an offence to intercept a signal, has to be welcomed.  Legislation is needed to put an end to this malpractice. It is amazing, given all the talk about the Bill, that this provision has not been highlighted.  I welcome the provision as it will allow people to have recourse to the civil process in seeking redress.  It is a simple matter but it is also important.  We are all agreed that those who pirate systems should be brought to justice, but we will not be able to do this until the appropriate laws are implemented.  Therefore no one can quibble with this provision.</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 7, will be welcomed even by RTE, as it will enable them from now on to appoint their own auditors to have the accounts prepared. As a result the accounts of RTE will be made available much sooner to public representatives and the public than heretofore when they were prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is important that all State companies present their accounts at a time when they are still meaningful.  It makes no sense to publish annual accounts which are so out of date as to be meaningless. Therefore I welcome section 7 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 makes provision for the establishment of a broadcasting complaints commission and includes a reference to the giving of inaccurate information relating to a person in a broadcast which constitutes an attack on that person's honour or reputation. Given the rate at which this industry has grown and the amount of information <Col N="768" /> disseminated on both radio and television it is important that we try to protect the good name and honour of individuals. Therefore I welcome the inclusion of this section which will afford individuals extra protection.</P>
    <P>It is hard to visualise what the world was like before the advent of broadcasting. No one will deny that Radio Telefís Éireann have served the people very well.  Indeed, many of their presenters have become household names. During the years they have maintained very high standards, in terms of the content of programming and up to a few years ago, were the only native broadcasters. This was very much in keeping with the resources available.  It would be fair to say if 15 years ago someone forecast an explosion in the telecommunications industry, grave doubts would have been cast upon their wisdom. When Raidió na Gaeltachta was first established it was considered to be a very unusual service.  However, following the advent of pirate radio stations, it became clear there was a market for local radio. This market had to be serviced.  It also became clear that the national station was not meeting this need or making full use of the technology available.  Given that the cost of broadcasting equipment has come down in relative terms it is now possible to maintain small stations.  It was decided in 1988, rather than allow unlicensed radio stations continue to meet this need, to introduce the 1988 Broadcasting Bill.  Under this Bill local radio stations and a new national station were established.</P>
    <P>Local stations provide a very important service in the community.  For example, they cover events which are of no significance nationally but which are of great significance within the community concerned. For instance, on Sunday last in Galway one had the choice of listening to Radio 1, who were covering our national games, Radio na Gaeltachta who were covering both local and national ones, and Radio West who were covering the local community games which were of no interest to anyone outside County Galway but which were of great interest <Col N="769" /> to the people living in the area.  I am aware of many people, including myself, who spent the afternoon switching from station to station to get updates.  Therefore, local radio does fulfil a very important role.  I am very pleased that the stations achieving success are those broadcasting programmes which are in keeping with the local ethos, values and traditions in both music and history.  Not only must we try to ensure that local radio survives but that it proves viable.  I forecast in this House that we will see a similar explosion and change in the whole concept of television in the next ten to 20 years.  As the technology becomes more commonplace and as it becomes cheaper, the diversity that will be possible will be greater.  I welcome this because the output of local broadcasting and the listenership it will attract will become greater as our resources to provide it increase.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact in the modern world that the amount of employment and resources devoted to service industry is growing.  It is reckoned that service industries of all kinds are the most rapid growing segment of employment within the Community.  I can see the day when we will have perhaps not as many television stations but where the idea of producing local television programmes will become a reality. I look forward to that day because everybody is interested in what is happening in their own community.  Therefore, I forecast that the entire communications legislation will have to be changed time and again to match up to and to respond to the changes that are taking place all around us.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the impact that will result from the ready availability of satellite television and multichannels throughout the world.  However, when the novelty wears off the development will be the other direction as happened in radio.  When I was a teenager everybody listened to Radio Luxembourg, and to Radio Caroline but nowadays most people listen to Irish stations.  My belief is that increasingly we will be watching a higher percentage of home-produced material.  Who among us does not have <Col N="770" /> an abiding interest in those things that are happening near home and around us? Therefore, we must look with confidence to that future and ensure that the explosion of technology is matched by an explosion in choice and that we have available to us the resources to exploit this in the future.</P>
    <P>I would like also to make a very short reference to one other matter.  It was a pity that the short wave station proposed in the late forties never got off the ground.  It could be argued that in the late sixties and seventies with the stemming of the haemorrhage of emigration this was not of such great importance as it had been.  However, because of the number of Irish people working Britain and throughout Europe, once again this has become a real issue.  I hope a service could be set up that would provide our emigrants with the means to keep in touch with what is happening at home and what better way of doing that than to provide sound radio for them so that there could be a compilation of the best of Irish radio made available to them throughout Europe.  In that way we could reach people of Irish extraction throughout Europe and hold together what is basically an extension of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>Ní fhéadfainn, ar ndóigh, suí síos gan tagairt a dhéanamh do cheist na Gaeilge. Is minic agus is fada muintir na Gaeilge ag casaoid faoin gcaoi ar chaith RTE leis an Ghaeilge thar na blianta.  Sna seascaidí agus na seachtóidí bhí an chasaoid chéanna ann nach rabhthas ag caitheamh go féaráilte le lucht na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Bhí casaoidí géara ann nach raibh RTE ag déanamh de réir a ndualgais maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  Tuigim ag raibh fadhbanna ann nuair nach raibh ann ach stáisiúin amháin.  Bhí fadhb ann sa mhéid is go raibh éileamh ag an mórphobal ar an stáisiún sin, agus go raibh mionphobal ansin go raibh a dteanga féin acu agus nach raibh fáil acu ar chláir sa teanga sin. Ar ndóigh, rinne George Colley a bhí mar Aire Gaeltachta ag an am, cuid den scéal sin a leigheas nuair a chuir sé Raidió na Gaeltachta ar bun.  Is iontach an tseirbhís atá tugtha ag an raidió sin do mhuintir <Col N="771" /> na Gaeltachta agus mhuintir na Gaeilge ó shin.  B'iontach an dul chun cinn sé nuair a cuireadh ar fáil ar an VHF, an ardmhinicíocht, é ar fud an tíre.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam an ceangal a shnaidhmíonn sé idir pobal na Gaeltachta, thuaidh, theas agus thiar.  Níl áit ar bith sa tír a dtéim i mease lucht na Gaeilge nach mbíonn tagairtí á ndéanamh d'iontais Raidió na Gaeltachta.  Creidim, áfach, gurb é an trua é nár cuireadh an raidió ar bun faoi údarás neamhspleách, le ceangal conartha le RTE maidir leis an taobh theicniúil de, maidir leis an gcraoladh féin.</P>
    <P>Creidim nach bhfeileann sé go gcaitear chuile cinneadh a dhéantar maidir le Raidió na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh trí cheannáras RTÉ anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Is mór an trua é nach bhfuil aon comhairle Raidió na Gaeltachta ann i láthair na huaire.  Sílim go gcaithfimid a thuiscint, agus go mórmhór go gcaithfidh iad siúd atá i gceannas a thuiscint, nach bhfuil aon údar ann níos mó go gcaitear leithéidí Raidió na Gaeltachta a reachtáil trí láreagraíocht mhór ar nós RTÉ. Bheadh súil agamsa go mbeimid ag plé san fhómhar anseo Bille a chuirfidh raidió Gaeltachta agus teilifís Ghaeltachta faoina n-údarás féin ar fáil, agus go mbeadh ceannas ag an údarás sin ar reachtáil na stáisiún sin.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to note from the Minister's remarks that, contrary to what had been said in the Seanad previously, the proposal to allow the third channel to establish their UHF transmission would not rule out the possibility of establishing a Teilifís na Gaeltachta service.  That is very important.  It is a source of great consolation to me that he has confirmed that they have retained sufficient UHF transmission frequencies to enable such a service to be established.  Likewise, when that decision comes to be made I would imagine that new funding arrangements will have to be made for that service.  It is clear that in normal commercial circumstances Teilifís na Gaeltachta would not be viable without a licence contribution. We are all aware that the licence contribution is meant to service <Col N="772" /> such needs.  For example, the RTE Symphony Orchestra falls within the same category.  I presume that, when a decision is taken in regard to Teilifís na Gaeltachta there will be special provision for the necessary finances available to that station. Equally, it is important that it be recognised that such a service is not geared only at the people of the Gaeltacht and Irish speakers but comprises a necessary part of the preservation of the Irish language, the common heritage of all of us, without which the country would be all the poorer.  It is within the best terms of public service broadcasting that such a service should be provided and funds set aside, whether under a separate authority or the existing one, for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It was with great pleasure gur chuala mé an Taoiseach ag rá an tseachtain seo caite go mbeadh cinneadh á dhéanamh faoi seo go luath.  Tá mé cinnte, agus a fhios agam an spéis phearsanta atá aige siúd sa scéal seo agus, ainneoin na rudaí atá ráite agus na maslaí atá caite, tá mé cinnte gur cinneadh dearfach a dhéanfar, agus go gcuirfear ann do theilifís na Gaeltachta agus gurb iad Fianna Fáil a chuirfidh ann é mar a chuir siad ann do Raidió na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Díreach i gcás an raidió, ba mhaith liom tagairt do rud amháin eile.  Sílim, agus stáisiúin áitiúla agus stáisiúin bheaga ag craoladh ceithre huaire fichead i gcaitheamh an lae, gurb é an trua é go bhfuil uaireanta Raidió na Gaeltachta chomh teoranta sin.  Níl sé sásúil don lucht éisteachta go gcaithfidh siad bheith ag faire ar an gclog le féachaint cén t-am den lá gur féidir leo éisteacht leis an raidió sin.  Tagann sé ar an aer ar maidin ag a hocht a chlog agus imíonn sé den aer arís ag leathuair tar éis a haon tráthnóna. Tagann sé ar an aer ag a trí agus imíonn sé arís ag ceathrú chun a hocht tráthnóna.  Tá an lá sin róghearr.</P>
    <P>Níl mé ag iarraidh go mbeidh sé ar fáil ar feadh ceithre huaire fichead gach lá ach sílim, ar a laghad, go mba cheart go mbeadh sé ar fáil ag an ngnátham a éiríonn daoine ar maidin, abair ag leathuair tar éis a seacht, go dtí meán oíche. Má tá na stáisiúin áitiúla in ann é sin <Col N="773" /> a dhéanamh, creidim go mba cheart go mbeadh Raidió na Gaeltachta in ann é sin a dhéanamh chomh maith.  Creidim nach ceart an polasaí é agus níor thuig mé riamh é; agus go mórmhór anois, má tá na stáisiúin bheaga tráchtála in ann fógraí a tharraingt chucu féin, cén fáth nach raibh fógraí ceadaithe ar Raidió na Gaeltachta, agus cén fáth nach raibh siad amuigh ar an margadh le fógraí a tharraingt chucu féin, a d'íocfadh as cuid de na costais a bhaineann leis an tseirbhís sin.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us contains very good provisions, and time will tell how some will work in practice.  Developments in regard to the overall broadcasting scene are dependent very much on the explosion in technology taking place.  It would be a grave mistake for anybody here to believe that anything in this fast moving world is stable or fixed.  In future years I predict several similar Bills will be introduced here to meet the requirements of the times in which we live.  I must stress yet again what I believe to have been a misrepresentation of the truth in regard to this Bill.  I can always understand people disagreeing but not misrepresenting the truth.  The provisions of the Bill clearly set out how licence fee revenue is to be disbursed and how that overall question of advertising should be regulated.  I must stress that the Independent Radio and Television Commission is independent; it would appear people have forgotten that fact and have twisted the truth in that connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that this Bill was devised and introduced as a stick with which to beat RTE.  The station refused to become the mouthpiece of Fianna Fáil and, therefore, must be silenced.  They must be silenced because they articulated the deep concerns of the Irish people at the inhumane health cuts carried out by the previous Fianna Fáil Government.  The Minister made it clear that he would teach RTE a lesson, that he would screw them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not interested in the views of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He has shown contempt for <Col N="774" /> the democratic process by his remarks and actions in the Dáil and has produced this Bill to screw RTE because that State organisation chose to maintain their independence. RTE must continue to resist such attacks on their independence.  The freedom and objectivity of the press and media generally is the cornerstone of our democracy.  In this Bill the Minister is punishing RTE for upholding that important principle.</P>
    <P>We commend RTE for their role in the democratic system, keeping our people informed in a fair and objective manner despite Government refusal to participate in debate on the media on most occasions.  It would appear that the Government are afraid to have their policies and actions exposed to critical questioning.  Senator Conroy explained that refusal by the fact that one member of each party is involved in the discussions, and, to quote him:</P>
    <P>...despite the fact that we, in the largest party, often larger than the other parties put together, have only one speaker on a given programme and all the other parties will have one as well.</P>
    <P>Surely Fianna Fáil have the confidence to defend their decisions on their merits rather than count heads around a table? What Senator Conroy really wants is RTE to provide a continuous political broadcast on behalf of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>No Bill has caused more acrimony in the Dáil and here than this one.  In introducing such a botched Bill the Minister was either out of touch with public opinion, that of the Opposition and of most of his own backbenchers, or alternatively, he decided to disregard them and ram through this ill-conceived Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposal to incorporate in the Bill power to restrict RTE's advertising revenue is wrong and will not work in practice. Over the years RTE have improved their efficiency, have taken on competition and prospered.  Indeed, it is a model many of our other State bodies might emulate.  RTE have defied the knockers who predicted that private enterprise <i>vis-a-vis</i> private radio would <Col N="775" /> cripple the station.  RTE accepted the challenge and are now being punished for so doing.</P>
    <P>One might well pose the question: henceforth what will be the motivation for the station, with one arm tied behind its back, to continue its successful role as a State broadcasting organisation?  There must be a great temptation for them to throw in the towel, allow events take a different course and become a lame duck within the broadcasting area.  This, of course, is probably what the Minister wants.  If this happens Fianna Fáil will have achieved their objective of silencing our independent State broadcasting organisation.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy informs us that if this happens legislation will be introduced to correct the situation.  This legislation is designed to screw RTE and its success will be judged by the Minister on the level of losses suffered.  We will then have Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats calling for the privatisation of the organisation.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment the management and staff of RTE for the excellence of their work down through the years.  To refer to them as having cosy, cushy jobs, as Senator Kiely did, is unfair.  It is most demoralising for RTE management to have to listen to statements from the other side of the House to the effect that if they cannot run the Authority in a proper fashion they should get out of the business and let people in who will do the business for them.  This is a very unfair way to refer to an efficient management structure and is, indeed, an incorrect reflection on staff performance within that organisation.</P>
    <P>The beneficiaries of this Bill of course will be UTV, Channel 4 and the satellite channels.  It is accepted that TV advertising when limited does not transfer to other advertising media.  Advertising revenue will flow out of the State to these stations and with it many of the jobs of people involved in producing such advertisements. This does not seem to worry the Government as it will only marginally add to the thousand people per week who <Col N="776" /> leave the country because the country has failed to give them a living.  We pride ourselves on being a successful exporting economy.  It is ironic that our biggest State export is our people and our unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>In this respect it is a disgrace that Ireland, with such a large emigrant population throughout the world, does not have an overseas service.  Once they are gone out of the country they are forgotten. What the Minister should be doing is bringing legislation before the House to establish a shortwave or high frequency radio station.  The cost of a transmitter to broadcast such a station is about £2 million.  In the context of an annual reduction of £10 million to £12 million now being foisted on RTE, surely £2 million is a manageable outlay.  We are the only country in Europe, and one of the few in the world, that does not provide such a service.  I think it is a shame that our emigrants must tune into the BBC overseas service to get any news from home through this medium.</P>
    <P>I welcome the experimental project in Belgium at present, which falls far short of a proper service.  By ringing a number in Brussels 5095050 callers can receive Radio 1 as it is being broadcast live in Ireland for the price of a local call.  We welcome this.  I understand that up to the introduction of the Bill RTE was looking at the possibility of leasing airwaves from stations who already operate short wave transmitters to reach out to our emigrants around the world.  This now, of course, will have to be knocked because of the cutbacks within the organisation.  This is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>I hope the about-turn made by the Minister in regard to his ludicrous proposals on 2FM will transfer to the Bill itself.  I am not hopeful however.  In setting to save Century Radio, which the Bill will not achieve now, the Minister decided to kill off the profit and efficient orientation of the RTE management and staff.  What is being said to the semi-States in this Bill is that profit and success spells trouble; be a loss maker and a parasite on the State coffers and you will be allowed to go on your merry way.  Be <Col N="777" /> commercially aggressive, successful and have progressive policies and you will be taken out of business by the Government.</P>
    <P>We limit our national broadcasting agencies advertising at a time when the EC are proposing uninhibited access to their airwaves, not only for programmes but for advertising broadcast.  We are going against the EC trend.  While the Minister is limiting advertising broadcasting time he has said nothing about the price of advertising.  What this means is that RTE in a damage limitation exercise will increase the cost to advertisers which, in turn, will reduce the competitiveness leading to more revenue flowing out of the country to UTV and other stations.  In fact RTE is being placed in a commercial poverty trap.  The Association of Advertisers in Ireland expressed their concern.  I will not quote them because they have been quoted already, but I would like to refer to the previous quotations put on the record with regard to this which say the message for me.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment RTE on the excellence of their programmes down through the years.  Programmes in the current affairs section like &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; and its predecessor &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; have been of great service to the Irish people.  The Sports Department have brought many hours of great entertainment to the homes of Ireland since Mícheál O'Hehir first set out on the road of making our national games available to people all over the country.</P>
    <P>The televising of the World Cup competition was a headline to all European stations.  RTE acquitted themselves as well as any, in fact they acquitted themselves as well as our World Cup team did.</P>
    <P>RTE has done a great service in promoting Irish culture and in ensuring that traditions and material from changing culture is recorded and stored for future generations.  An example of this was when Seán Ó Riada popularised Irish music.  RTE facilitated him by giving the freedom of the airwaves to him.  Seán Ó Riada's programmes revived interest in Irish music and gave it a new lease of life.  It allowed new generations of Irish <Col N="778" /> people to enjoy our music and culture. My own county man Ciarán Mac Mathúna stated that the effect of the Bill was likely to reduce to insignificance the role of RTE in researching, recording and bringing different aspects of our musical heritage to our people.  That would be disgraceful and I am shocked and disappointed to think this might happen. Charity organisations have stated in a letter on 19 June that the Bill will have catastrophic effects on their work.  The Irish Cancer Society sated and I quote:</P>
    <P>Presently RTE allow charities a greatly reduced advertising rate. Should their allowed advertising time be cut down they will cut out this special rate.  Presently we spend IR£26,000 p.a. on radio spots promoting our programme of Rehabilitation, Education, Information and Funding.  Should the charity rate be abolished the cost of the above advertising would rocked to IR£132,000. Obviously we could not afford this and without it our programmes would be very much less effective and our income reduced, which in turn would mean curtailment of services.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly any move to change the <i>status quo</i> in regard to Radio 1 and 2FM would be disastrous and will hit the already hard hit terminally ill, the cancer researchers and the future prevention of cancer through education.</P>
    <P>Media manipulation by the Minister is unhealthy.  Control of the media by him is dangerous.  This is the Minister's objective.  He expects a Pavlovian response from the broadcasters.  It is opportune for them, whether in private or public, to give the Minister his due response by asserting their political independence and ensuring that political reporting is at all times balanced and objective.  Our democracy deserves this from them.</P>

      <P>Before I go into detail on the Bill, it is necessary to acknowledge some of the comments made by my colleague on the other side.  I presume his <Col N="779" /> comments reflect accurately the views of his party and in that context I must confess to being somewhat surprised because throughout his contribution he seemed to be acting almost exclusively as an apologist for those who, Canute-like, wish to hold back the orderly and phased development of broadcasting in this country.  Perhaps my colleague can clarify that at some future stage, but I found his contribution negative in the extreme, highly selective in its accusations and distorted in relation to the reality of broadcasting in this country, specifically because it impinged on a crucial and important concession made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>He referred to charities.  Since this debate started, charitable organisations, those on short contract with RTE, those in vulnerable positions within RTE, have all been targeted &mdash; the soft option is what I would call it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that Senator Neville did not concede that the Minister was acutely aware of the potential danger to the role of charities as a result of their access to national television and radio in particular, and that he did not acknowledge that the Minister has amended the original Bill to allow an extra 30 seconds advertising per hour with this in mind.</P>
      <P>However, there is a wider issue.  When the national lottery started charitable organisations were the first to rush to the barricades and say that their income would be severely reduced, that people were not going to contribute any more and that there would be no more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Which is what happened; there is no doubt about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence to suggest that the charities have been severely curtailed or that their income has been reduced.  Like a number of my colleagues on all sides of the House, I have contributed to charities in my own <Col N="780" /> way.  I made no secret of the fact that as a broadcaster, I am available and willing to help charities.  As a broadcaster I can inform the Senator that most charities have a very well developed public relations organisation who know not only the programmes people listen to and watch but have advertising agencies, or employees of advertising agencies, or individuals who have expertise in public relations bombard RTE programme presenters for free advertising, which they get on a regular basis.  I hope the Minister will not curtail that.  I doubt if that is something that has entered his thinking. In using soft targets such as charities the Senator was not making any reasonable contribution to this debate which is about the future role of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that a fundamental objective of the Government and Fianna Fáil broadcasting policy was the essential need to provide an alternative to the State broadcasting monopoly, particularly in the area of news and current affairs.  That is what this Bill is about. It has nothing to do with trying to use RTE but it has everything to do with providing the people with an alternative. I have made no secret of the fact that I have been supportive of the concept of an alternative form of broadcasting for many years notwithstanding the fact that I have derived my main broadcasting income from RTE for almost 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two unions within RTE have consistently supported the concept of alternative broadcasting since this debate started back in the late seventies when the pirate radio stations first came on stream.  Those two unions were the National Union of Journalists, of which I am a member through my involvement in sports and news broadcasting, and the Irish Actors Equity, of which I am also a member through my involvement in the presentation of music programmes.  I was chairman of the radio and television equity group in RTE in the early eighties when a working committee was set up by that union to investigate the alternative broadcasting structures that might be put in place.  At that time there was already a plethora of pirate stations operating; it <Col N="781" /> was not as if RTE was in virgin territory. There were already dozens of pirate stations operating a totally unregulated free for all which, I might add for the benefit of Senator Neville and his colleagues on the other side of the House, continued throughout the eighties until a Fianna Fáil Government grappled with the problem and at least brought some order into a disordered, chaotic broadcasting regime. That will be conveniently forgotten as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hoping in the context of the Second Stage debate to articulate those views.  I will be coming to that point, but I think that what has happened in this debate is gross distortion of the issues.  I am saddened that this Bill has not been acted upon by responsible commentators in this House and in the other House to initiate a reasoned, rational and serious debate on the status and future role of broadcasting and RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the point I was making; the working group within Equity came back with a recommendation to the major union that they were in favour of an alternative; the reason was that they wanted to protect their members' interests, which is what a good trade union should be about.  The National Union of Journalists were also in favour <Col N="782" /> of an alternative broadcasting regime because they saw it as protecting the long-term interests of their members.  I would like to remind the House that until alternative legal broadcasting was initiated, if you did not broadcast with RTE you did not broadcast, and if you did not accept the salaries, fees and terms and conditions of employment that RTE gave you as a broadcaster, you did not work.</P>
    <P>I was always in favour of an alternative for purely selfish reasons &mdash; nothing to do with any altruistic, high minded notions I might have had about where broadcasting should or should not be.  It was my pocket, and that of my colleagues in broadcasting, which were being affected. It is in that context that I am explaining to my distinguished colleague on the other side of the House that I am not a member of the RTE staff; I am on a short-term contract.</P>
    <P>It is also important that RTE's contribution to the national life should be put on the record.  When we think of broadcasters such as Michael O'Hehir, we realise that it is the easiest thing in the world for any Member to stand up and praise RTE not only in terms of their wonderful programming but of their personnel.  I might remark in passing that Michael O'Hehir is a sad loss to sports broadcasting.  I am glad to hear his health is improving.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to single out RTE's contribution and to make banal remarks.  I am proud of my association with RTE as a national broadcasting service. I am proud of what RTE as a national broadcasting service have contributed to the life of this country, since 1927.  RTE hold a unique position in Irish life.  The only other station which compares with RTE is the BBC in Britain. The integrity and credibility of their news and current affairs programmes and other programmes has been unquestioned for generations.  We are privileged to have had, and hopefully will continue to have, a national service such as that provided by RTE, both radio and television. The concept of public broadcasting was laid down by the first Director General of the BBC, Lord Reith, and it <Col N="783" /> has been the bible, the unofficial philosophy, so to speak, of broadcasters ever since.  Lord Reith said that the concept of public broadcasting meant that broadcasters were to inform, educate and entertain, which is what RTE have done in abundance for generations.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of certain aspects of RTE's public broadcasting policy.  I have sometimes felt &mdash; this view is shared by many people &mdash; that some broadcasters, or to be more accurate, the managers in RTE who decide programme policy, have been concerned to such an extraordinary degree with informing and educating the public that they have failed to entertain the public.  The emergence and development of the pirate radio sector was a direct result of the failure by RTE to realise that they were living in changing times during the late seventies and early eighties.  However, it is to their credit that within a few years they realised that the politicians in this and the other House were not reflecting the views of the people on the street when they complimented them each year on their programming quality.  The reality was that an increasing number of people were turning away from RTE and were listening to their local, albeit amateurish, broadcasting stations.</P>
    <P>In 1987, following years of inactivity, for ideological reasons, by the then Coalition Government &mdash; in fairness to Fine Gael, I am sure that if they had been in Government on their own they would have introduced proposals in this regard &mdash; when nothing was done about broadcasting, it became the laughing stock of Europe that illegal broadcasting operated in Ireland.  It is to the Minister's credit that within a short time of taking office in 1987 he not only had initiated proposals but had implemented them in the shortest possible time so that today we have in place an alternative national and local broadcasting structure.</P>
    <P>I am not for one minute going to dance on RTE's grave.  Indeed, referring to my personal selfish interest, I have no wish to broadcast with any other organisation. <Col N="784" /> As I said earlier, I am proud of my association with RTE and I hope it will continue. It must be acknowledged that the advent of alternative services at local and national level &mdash; I will refer later to the national service &mdash; has shown that when a professional and competent service is put in place, with the help of local advertisers, local radio is a viable entity.  The one major objection to the 1988 Bill was the Minister's proposal to oblige local and national contractors to devote 20 per cent of their programming time exclusively to news and current affairs.  While I did not object to this proposal I felt the Minister was being somewhat ambitious in his aspirations in that area because of the obvious difficulties involved in securing start-up finance and getting organised. I do not think the Minister has had any criticism from local radio stations about this 20 per cent requirement, and I am sure he will happy to confirm this in his reply.  I doubt if he has received letters from local contractors asking him to reduce the 20 per cent requirement.</P>
    <P>We Irish have always been good at talking to ourselves, which is what local radio is all about.  It is about people in a locality talking about themselves, their neighbours, their region and their friends.  The success of the local stations over the last 18 months is proof of this. It is to the credit of the Minister and the Government that they grasped that nettle in 1987-88 and put in place a service of which we can be proud.  Of course, there are going to be difficulties and some of the 16 local radio stations may not be able to survive in their present form. They are, after all, free marketeers and have to go out into the marketplace and compete.  Some may not survive but I do not think that local broadcasting will be in any real danger.</P>
    <P>I have dealt to some extent with the monopoly position of RTE.  It is important to put on the record that RTE &mdash; maybe not at management or executive level but certainly at the lower level &mdash; did themselves enormous damage in the way they attacked the Minister for Communications in the early stages of this <Col N="785" /> debate.  I accept that when people genuinely believe their jobs are threatened they can become very emotional and it would be wrong of me not to inform the Minister in this House of the discussions I have had, wearing my broadcasting hat, with the employees of RTE, There is low morale and even a feeling of anger and apathy among some broadcasters who believe that the incentive to succeed will be taken away specifically by the capping of advertising which will in effect reduce RTE's potential to earn as much money as the marketplace dictates.  It is in this climate that many of the 2,000 people working in RTE are responding to this Bill.  There is a difference between personal abuse and a reasoned debate and logical proposals for an alternative.  I believe some people within RTE were perceived as abusing their monopoly position by going on air and expressing not only political opinions but abusing the Minister's integrity and his person. However, I believe reason has prevailed and in this context I would draw the Minister's attention to a submission which I received from the Radio Telefís Éireann Managers' Association and their Honorary Secretary, Mr. Tony Fahy.  That submission states, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The RTEMA is very deeply concerned about the negative effects the Bill will have on all RTE's operations by considerably weakening its ability to survive and perform as a professional public service broadcasting organisation.</P>
    <P>Having said that, however, the association welcomes the amendments introduced by the Minister for Communications in Dáil Éireann on Friday, 29 June.  The increase in the minutage allowance for advertising from four and a half to five minutes per hour will provide a small measure of relief and the linking of the licence fee base to inflation will provide further limited scope for RTE revenue from the second year onwards.</P>
    <P>They went on:</P>
    <P>With a view to affording some <Col N="786" /> further relief to RTE in the very difficult years ahead and also giving some flexibility to the Government in enabling it to keep in touch with the developing situation in a run up to the launch of TV3 we ask that consideration be given to other proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already indicated that he is not prepared to accept any further amendments, suffice for me to say that the proposals by the managers' association concerned changes in the advertising capping.  There is also a proposal that the current 100 per cent rigid link in relation to advertising revenue to the licence fee should be expressed in a higher range and, finally, that these vital parts of the section dealing with RTE's minutage and revenue cap be implemented at a date to be set by the Minister.  I am pleased the Minister has already indicated that he will not be implementing these proposals until 1 October at the earliest.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out to the House, when we talk about advertising capping, that this is not without precedent or unique, or a proposal the Minister plucked from the air.  There is a European standard.  A State or private body not just in the Community but in the Council of Europe, cannot exceed a certain amount of advertising time per hour.  The European standard permitted under the EC Broadcasting Directive and the Council of Europe Convention is nine minutes per hour.  RTE, are currently allowed six minutes per hour while UTV are allowed seven minutes per hour.  The trend within Europe is to curtail advertising even further or to shuttle it into specific periods of the hour, the main reason being that Europeans generally are concerned about what they see as a reduction in programme quality and a huge increase in the influence of multinational advertisers.  It is important that contributors to this debate should realise that there is already in existence a capping mechanism within Europe for television and radio.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister in the context <Col N="787" /> of capping, and the argument put forward by RTE, that their potential to generate more income has been severely curtailed, that he might listen to proposals for the further utilisation of existing resources within RTE with no extra cost to the Exchequer and within the budget of RTE.  This point was made by the RTE trade union group in a submission in which they said that one of their major objections to the establishment of an alternative broadcasting service was that they knew of the existence of a vast resource, including a network of linked studios nationwide and skilled staff to work them, which was paid for by the people through the RTE Authority but which was to a certain extent under-utilised. We are all aware that there are studios in parts of the country where RTE have not initiated or originated programmes. It has been a source of great annoyance to people living down the country that when one tunes in to Ulster Television, particularly in my part of the country, they traditionally not only have the national news at tea time but a very extensive magazine-current affairs features programme which is transmitted for almost an hour and reflects life in that part of the island.  If there is a criticism of RTE in a public service context it is that there has been over the past ten to 15 years a tendency to reflect increasingly what is happening in Dublin and on the east coast rather than in, for example, the west, north-west or the regions generally.</P>
    <P>As the Bible says, they, RTE, should look at the mote in their own eye in this respect.  I am talking here more about television than radio.  Radio has always had a very proud tradition of taking news items at regional level from their substantial number of &ldquo;stringers&rdquo; around the country &mdash; local correspondents.  My late father was a local correspondent for RTE and the national newspapers so I grew up in that environment and, therefore, have some knowledge of the reaction of RTE to news stories sent in from my part of the country.  My knowledge also came from talking to other correspondents. The Minister has not been inclined, since <Col N="788" /> this debate started &mdash; I am talking about 1988 rather than the most recent one &mdash; to allow RTE extend their range of services in the broadcasting area simply because he has been concerned about setting up an alternative broadcasting regime.  I can understand his feeling on this matter but I am thinking about the medium to long term.  The studios, personnel and expertise are there and the RTE group of unions have a valid point in relation to more development of the regional services despite the fact that we have a local radio and that we will have an alternative national television channel.</P>
    <P>The potential that RTE have to earn extra revenue in relation to the capping of their advertising has been probably the most critical and most criticised part of this legislation.  It is important to put on the record of the House that while RTE are restricted as a result of the reduction in advertising time per hour, they are not restricted in developing their other important services.  Indeed, within the last few months, and prior to any inkling of the Minister's thinking on this, RTE restructured their commercial activities and set up a separate RTE commercial subsidiary to market RTE programmes and to capitalise and exploit the programming expertise and talent within the station.  This was to be expected.  I am surprised that RTE did not rationalise that area of their activities some years ago and take a lead from other broadcasting organisations around the world, specifically the BBC.</P>
    <P>BBC television enterprises, and ITV television enterprisees, earn millions of pounds worldwide for their respective companies through the sale, not only of programmes but of radio cassettes, audio cassettes, recordings on record, classical recordings and commercial pop recordings. There are endless opportunities for the exploitation of this vital national resource.  We have not heard anything in the argument to date on this Bill about that aspect of RTE's activities in any of the submissions I received.  It is important for the Minister to amplify this argument in his reply at the end of Second Stage.  I know that the response might be that <Col N="789" /> there is a possibility of losing £12 million of revenue; these figures come from RTE and are based on their expected advertising income over a specific period of time.  It would strengthen the argument to say that surely RTE cannot be expected to generate £12 million in extra curricular activities.</P>
    <P>Great oaks from little acorns grow and we are now living in an inprecedented television age.  Television has a voracious appetite.  A statement from our friends in the Association of Advertisers in Ireland Ltd.  said that in addition to RTE channels, RTE 1 and Network 2, there are ten other channels available to many Irish homes and it is expected that this number will double over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Where, I ask, are the programmes to come from?  They have got to come from professional programme makers, the RTE are in a very special position here. To refer to the RTE group of unions again, they have the resources, the personnel, the expertise.  It is to the credit of sporting organisations in this country, the FAI, and more recently the GAA, that they are already beginning to see the potential for their games, on an international level and the GAA are beginning to negotiate substantial contracts with TV contractors for the transmission of their games all over the world.  Anybody who would suggest that Irish programming is not acceptable in other parts of the world and, therefore, that there would be no potential for RTE to generate more income should telephone the General Secretary of the GAA and he will tell them how to sell their programmes.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to a code of practice relating to advertising, in other words section 4.  He has not clarified as yet how he plans to go about this.  One can glean from the comments he has been making that he is not at all satisfied with the existing code of practice as exercised by RTE.  In a recent speech he drew attention to what he felt was the excess of TV time given to An Bord Gáis who sponsored the World Cup transmissions from RTE.  Senator Neville referred to the wonderful job RTE have done and I <Col N="790" /> endorse that.  It was a tremendous technological and professional achievement. In these islands they covered far more football games than either BBC or ITV, yet we are always being told they have very limited resources.  They managed not only to achieve a high level of excellence but exceeded that of two stations which we are told &mdash; and which we know &mdash; have far greater resources.  Obviously, the input of An Bord Gáis was a considerable help to RTE in achieving this standard of excellence.  In that context I hope the Minister's code of practice will not go too far in restricting RTE's ability to attract commercial and corporate sponsorship, and not only RTE because this Bill obviously applies to the new TV channel, TV3, that is coming onstream. It is my considered opinion that one of the main sources of programming finance for TV3 and for RTE increasingly in the coming years will be the corporate sector.</P>
    <P>There must be guidelines.  There are guidelines operating among our European partners and I hope the Minister will not take on board some of the restrictions which are currently in operation in some member states of the EC.  For example, in Holland in music programmes the manufacturer of the electronic equipment and drum kits has their name blotted out by tape.  I hope the Minister will not go to that extreme.  It is obvious from the wording of the Bill that for the moment he is allowing RTE to continue applying the codes that are currently in force governing standards, practice and prohibitions in broadcast advertising. That is at the level of the multinational corporate advertisers.  I suggest to the Minister that any severe restriction in this area could have a detrimental effect on the small entrepreneur.  I am thinking of my colleague Senator Cassidy and others in the entertainment industry who have struggled for the past number of years to convince the powers that be in RTE that they should associate themselves with national and international music promotion, that by identifying with them would help them to attract more listeners and, obviously, more advertising.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> I would not like to see inhibiting legislation that would mean RTE would turn around and say to the small-time entrepreneurs &ldquo;I am sorry, the Minister says we can no longer be identified with you, therefore you are going to have to fund the promotional budget for these events yourself&rdquo;.  That would be detrimental. This is a new phenomenon.  It is creating employment.  There are a number of Irish people who have offices and organisations in this country who are creating employment, albeit on a small level, and more importantly supporting the Irish music industry.  RTE are to be complimented on aligning themselves with these interests in the past two or three years.  I raise it in passing and hope that when the Minister comes to dealing specifically with the code of practice he will keep that in mind and not unduly restrict RTE.  Of course, there must be restrictions but not undue restrictions.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased the Minister has initiated changes regarding complaints to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission about broadcasts affecting an individual.  For some considerable time, especially in the past ten years, many citizens have felt humiliated, degraded and verbally abused, if one can use that wide range of expressions, by individuals in the media generally.  I am careful not to select RTE here.  Their attitude in this area wherever there has been a wrongdoing has been exemplary, but generally people offended by the media have had little redress.  An example is a statement made in a broadcast on radio or TV which is transmitted at peak time and is plainly inaccurate or causes distress to a citizen. The citizen goes through the Broadcasting Complaints Commission procedure and if their case has been listened to and they are vindicated, all that happens by way of redress is a couple of paragraphs in the <i>RTE Guide</i>, or possibly a sentence or two at some point during the day on radio or TV.  That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>In fairness to RTE, I do not think they will raise any major objections to the improvements to this legislation.  Let me <Col N="792" /> reiterate, I believe RTE's role as a corporate body has been exemplary.  One could argue that individuals in RTE in current affairs and news programmes have on occasion given the impression that politicians and more vulnerable members of society are fair game.  I mention politicians in that context because they are vulnerable.  However, generally they are able to look after themselves and it is more the private citizen I am concerned about here.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the RTE group of unions in their submission in relation to the broadcasting debate acknowledge there has been a problem in this area. They referred to the image of RTE and said that in dealing with politicians it is important to recognise and admit that RTE have an image problem.  Some commentators portray them as a powerful, resourceful organisation using public moneys to compete unfairly with the other media.  Some politicians see them as a collection of malcontents availing of every opportunity to make them, the politicians, look bad.  Many see RTE as inefficient, with too many staff being paid too much to make a big deal out of a relatively simple job and opposing changes at all cost.  The group go on to say that among audiences they are well received, with surveys showing a high level of audience satisfaction.  They still produce and show the most popular radio and TV programmes in the country, but they admit that RTE had, and have, an image problem.  I hope the strengthening of this section will go some way towards creating a climate where those citizens who feel RTE or the broadcasting contractors in general have maligned them will now get proper redress.  I welcome this section of the Bill and I compliment the Minister on including it in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have a note here about Ciarán Mac Mathúna, one of our most esteemed professional broadcasters.  Senator Neville referred to him as supporting his argument in favour of not making changes as set out in this Bill.  I assume Senator Neville was referring to comments Mr. <Col N="793" /> Mac Mathúna made on his recent conferring for which I take this opportunity to congratulate him.  He is the elder statesman of Irish broadcasting and one of nature's gentlemen.  Senator Neville may not be aware that some 12 months ago, RTE attempted to reduce the programmes presented by Ciarán Mac Mathúna and but for statements made in this House and the intervention of the Minister's Department, Mr. Mac Mathúna might no longer be broadcasting for RTE.  That is just by way of correcting the record.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Miniser at some stage, to look at Atlantic 252 and say what he will do with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Atlantic 252 is one of the great white elephants of Irish broadcasting. I make no secret of my total opposition to its concept and I did not believe it would generate the income projected. The projections made by the experts in RTE about Atlantic 252 lead me to believe I should have a certain caution in relation to the figures they are talking about in relation to this Bill.  I will not labour the point.  The Minister and my colleagues know what I am talking about.  Could Atlantic 252 be transformed in some way or could RTE be encouraged to give more radio broadcasts of Irish radio programmes to the Irish emigrant population in Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I lived in England for several years and the Minister goes back and forth on a regular basis.  I am sure there is a civil servant in the Department reading hundreds of letters from the Irish in Britain asking the Minister to improve RTE reception in Britain.  Here is a station which is not only broadcasting to two-thirds of Britain on the long wave but to the entire island of Ireland.  It is, in effect, a third national channel for RTE; yet, to the unitiated who might tune into it, it bears no relation to this country.  It uses mid-Atlantic disc jockeys, its programme controller is English and it broadcasts pop music for 12 hours a day.  The reason <Col N="794" /> behind it was to generate income in England where there was not a national commercial radio station.</P>
    <P>As the Minister and other Members of the House are aware, the British Government are currently debating their broadcasting Bill which will result in the establishment of three national commercial stations and an extension to the existing BBC station, Radio 5.  In this context, it is interesting that the Minister's comments about 2 FM are bearing fruit in Britain where the Government felt, and the BBC agreed, there was a need to have a sport and education channel.  This is something the Minister was musing about, so it is interesting that the BBC are going along that road in the context of the changes taking place in Britain and the fact that for years a major source of irritation and annoyance to the Irish population in Britain is that they cannot hear RTE programmes.  If the vote was to be extended to the Irish in Britain at the same time as the Minister announced he was improving reception in Britain so that all could hear the All-Ireland final, Fianna Fáil or whoever are in power would remain in power until the year 2050.</P>

      <P>This is a milestone in broadcasting.  It is the second piece of legislation introduced by this Government in a short space and as my colleague.  Senator Costello said, it will not be the last broadcasting legislation this country will see.  I hope it will create a proper climate for the future development of broadcasting generally. In the long-term, RTE will not be hurt in the manner in which people are saying they will be hurt.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>We are eager to be brief in order to relieve the Minister's boredom and get on to Committee and Report Stages as soon as possible.  The passage of this Bill through both Houses has been close to some sort of farcical circus and we are continuing in that vein today in rushing this Bill through by midnight. Everybody knows what will happen.  We know very well that Senator Lydon and his colleagues will troop through the lobbies and will vote as they are told later this evening.  The Bill will not be properly discussed in this House.  It was not discussed properly in the other House. Amendments will not be properly discussed, none will be accepted and the Bill will become law.  It is a circus, it is a farce and I am of two minds as to whether this side of the House should participate in such a complete denial of parliamentary democracy and examination of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Senator Mooney on being such a prominent participant in that circus by walking a very delicate tightrope between his party and his employers.  The Senator did it very <Col N="796" /> adeptly and smoothly, although I do not agree with much of what he had to say.</P>
    <P>The main problem with this Bill is not necessarily the detail that has been spelled out in the other House where it was allowed, but it is the public perception of the motivation behind it.  From my soundings in RTE there is a view that the motivation of the Government in introducing this Bill and the main pillars of this Bill is revenge.  This Government have it in for RTE for reasons which they perceive to be purely political.  There is certainly a perception among many in top management and certainly in the news-room in RTE that the Government, through formal and informal statements, blame RTE for the fact that they lost the general election in 1989.  They believe that the coverage given to the Government and to special topics, specifically the health services, was disproportionately antagonistic to Fianna Fáil and to the Government and, therefore, prejudiced Fianna Fáil's chances of winning that election.  I do not share that view but I understand the Government feeling that way.  Nevertheless, that is not a justification for introducing a Bill to clip the wings of the station, to demoralise its staff and to emasculate its potential in the future.  It is well known and documented that the Government have long been antagonistic towards RTE.  I am not referring to the Minister only but to the Fianna Fáil Party in Government.  This antagonism stems from a frustration peculiar to Fianna Fáil who have found it very difficult to take constructive or independent criticism.  Fianna Fáil fail to understand that as a concept.  They suffer from a frustration that they cannot control the national broadcasting station.  We have seen over the years in the news room and in relation to programmes such as &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo;, &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; and, more recently, &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; that Fianna Fáil were constantly in conflict with RTE.  As a result, rightly or wrongly, there is a perception that Fianna Fáil in this Bill are making a straightforward attempt to gain naked vengence on RTE.  If that is so, I suppose the Bill is going to be very effective.  It will <Col N="797" /> damage the station and destroy RTE as a broadcasting service in the way we know it.</P>
    <P>There is also a perception that the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; I will come to the Progressive Democrats later &mdash; wish to control RTE.  I have little doubt that that is the motive behind the Bill.  One will never be able to prove or disprove the motive of vengeance, one has to make a subjective judgment, but this is the view one arrives at from informal conversations and perceptions.  There is no doubt, if the motive is not pure vengeance, it is to control RTE and the media.  There is also no doubt that following the implementation of this Bill Fianna Fáil's control over RTE will be greatly increased.  This will be done by way of reducing their revenue and, as a consequence, their power and by flexing Government muscles and showing what can be done if RTE do not jump into line.</P>
    <P>There are three ways by which the Government can control RTE which they are at liberty to use and which they are using in the Bill.  The first, and most effective, is to control the revenue granted to them by way of the licence fee.  In the Dáil, in reply to a question from Deputy Mitchell, the Minister stated there will be no increase in the licence fee.  &ldquo;For the present is the question&rdquo;, Deputy Mitchell asked to which the Minister responded, &ldquo;full stop&rdquo;.  This means that this source of revenue will be cut off for RTE.</P>
    <P>The second way they can control RTE is to curb their commercial activities and advertising, one of the main aims of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not their commercial activities, just advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The third way to control RTE is for them to appoint the members of the RTE Authority.  By his own declaration, the Minister has done a very effective job on the licence fee.  He has curbed their advertising and, as a consequence, the amount they may bring in in advertising revenue and he appointed a new Authority recently which, <Col N="798" /> unashamedly and nakedly, was full of people whose loyalty is not to broadcasting but to Fianna Fáil and the Government in power.</P>
      <P>It is dangerous that all Governments abuse right to control the national media by appointing people to the Authority who have little or no interest in broadcasting but have a primary loyalty to those who appoint them.  We should not use this as a weapon to beat the Government as all Governments have abused that power extremely openly.  Not only have the Government tightened their control over RTE and reduced RTE's standing and power, they also had a major say in activities of and personnel involved in the independent stations.</P>
      <P>About a year and a half ago the Government established the Independent Radio and Television Commission but, once again, the appointments to that body were made by the same party, not the same Government who appointed the RTE Authority.  The appointments to the commission were considered to be marginally less partisan than the appointments made to the Authority but were still very safe from the point of view of the Government.  It was expected they would hand out licences to those sympathetic to the Fianna Fáil Government. It is generally accepted that this is what they did, perhaps in a way that was not as partisan as the Government might have anticipated, but the stations were left in the hands of those with whom the Fianna Fáil Party felt comfortable.</P>
      <P>It is to the shame of the Progressive Democrats, who now form part of the Government, that they have not said a word on this Bill in the House.  As I scan the empty benches, on the Government side, I do not blame them for not being present all day because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can say one thing for certain and that is that when Senator Dardis spoke he spoke in favour of the Bill and will vote for it this evening.  I would have more respect for them if they got up in this House and said they would like to see RTE privatised, that they did not believe in a licence fee or in public broadcasting but they swallowed the Fianna Fáil line, hook, line and sinker, which is an opportunist line to take control of the media for the Government &mdash; which I think, suits them.  They have been sold the final part in Coalition which will take them back into the Fianna Fáil Party. There is no ideological barrier between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil any longer; the personality differences which existed previously have disappeared into the realms of the past.</P>

      <P>What has that to do with the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It has a lot to do with the Bill because I am commenting on the position of a political party in the context of the Bill.  It is fair to point out that the Government want to see public service broadcasters as servants not of the State but of the party and that that is the perception they have always held.  They want to see also independent broadcasting stations as servants of the party.  That is the lesson to be learned from this Bill.  That is the direction in which this Bill will take us.  It is not fair simply to blame Fianna Fáil for this because when Fine Gael and Labour were in power their behaviour on this issue was by no means impeccable. They appointed people to the Authority who were well known supporters, directors and handlers in their general election campaigns.  They were quite arrogant about the manner in which they tried to take control of the key positions in RTE. Not only did they appoint people to the RTE Authority whose first loyalty was to the Coalition parties rather than to the State but, also in a well known controversy, they obstructed a very able man in his ambitions and the recommendation he should get for the job of Director <Col N="801" /> General because it was thought his loyalty was not to the party in power but to Fianna Fáil the party in Opposition.  It is time this messing around, the juxtaposing and swapping of key people in key positions &mdash; which depends simply on the party in power &mdash; stopped.  RTE, despite the appalling way they have been treated by successive Governments and the fact that their independence has been severely compromised and damaged, have done a magnificent job in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is absurd that the public have to put up with this farcical scenario of seeing Government after Government changing the personnel in RTE as a reward they give after they win an election and when membership of the Authority comes up for grabs.  It is time broadcasting was taken out of the political arena and that some independent body &mdash; which is not beyond the imagination of Fianna Fáil or of Fine Gael and Labour &mdash; was set up not to overlook broadcasting but to make vital appointments to the positions which control the public service broadcasting media.  This is not something which applies exclusively to RTE, it applies to nearly all our semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies I have always maintained that there is an appalling abuse of power not ony by this Government but by Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats in relation to semi-State bodies where vital appointments are made &mdash; to Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and to Irish Life &mdash; simply as rewards for services given at election time.  The people so appointed have too much power for their expertise &mdash; or their lack of it &mdash; not to be taken into account by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole area of semi-State bodies, the media and governmental control of the media, is sick, it is a shame, and should be taken out of the political arena. I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that issue when he comes to reply.  I would like him to consider the idea that this power of patronage, which <Col N="802" /> all Ministers seem to exercise so ruthlessly, should be handed over to someone with a less partisan view and who is less likely to yield to political temptation.</P>
    <P>The last Bill which the Minister brought before the Seanad was in many areas a very good Bill and a very effective one.  He brought in a Bill to deal with the pirates and rightly said &mdash; and successive Fianna Fáil speakers have rightly said &mdash; we were the laughing stock of Europe during that time.  It is a double disappointment that having done that and having effectively dealt with pirate radios that we should have as a follow up to that Bill, despite what Fianna Fáil speakers have said, a Bill to control the public service media for one party.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that any party that can do this could easily follow it through with more ruthless legislation in the future. There are ways and means of controlling the media which do not necessarily need legislation.  It is not beyond the imagination of a Minister or someone else with party affiliations to make telephone calls making recommendations about certain jobs in RTE.  It would be foolish for anyone on an interview board to ignore that advice when the same Government have the power to clip the organisation's wings if that advice is ignored.  Nothing more needs to be said.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a total separation of the Government and the national broadcasting station.  There should be no contact, official or unofficial, on issues which are sensitive in political terms or which are sensitive, above all things, in news terms.  There should be a wall between all Government parties and those areas which are politically sensitive in the news media, otherwise these jobs will be influenced by the Government and those who hold the purse strings because the implicit threat remains following the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Having seen this Bill there is a real threat that the Government will go further if this does not work.  If capping advertising is not enough to bring RTE to their knees not only will the licence not be increased &mdash; according to the Minister in the other House &mdash; but it will be <Col N="803" /> reduced.  The real danger is that if RTE do not come to heel, they will be reduced further until they do.  This Bill proves that not only were they huffing and puffing about taking on RTE and reducing their power but they are actually prepared to do it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the proof of the pudding in the eating.  The Government have done this and, having done it, they will undoubtedly be prepared to go further. The die is cast once this Bill has been passed.  Now they can go further.  They can reduce further the commercial activities and the advertising revenue of RTE, they can make new appointments to the RTE Authority, if they want, and can interfere with positions subtly or less subtly.  That is the real danger; it is a new dimension in political interference in a broadcasting station.</P>
    <P>I do not know what will be the immediate effect of capping RTE's advertising revenue.  There have been all sorts of predictions on the part of people from all sides of the House.  I presume the first effect of the reduction will be a lessening of standards of broadcasting in RTE.  I do not know where the advertising will go.  I do not necessarily believe those who say that this proposal means the Minister attempting to look after his friends; I do not think that is necessarily true at all. Advertising is likely to go in various different directions &mdash; abroad, to newspapers, to some of the other local stations &mdash; but it will not go to RTE; that is the whole purpose of this exercise.  I do not think that the Fianna Fáil Party or their colleagues, the Progressive Democrats, have actually worked out that advertising will go to a specific place yet.  But I suppose if they decide to cap advertising further &mdash; which they may well do &mdash; if RTE find some ingenious ways of making more money, keeping their heads above water, the Minister will have to come back and cap advertising further.  Then I presume the advertising cake will be bigger for the rest and will go to friends of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>What is disappointing, and where I agree with Senator Mooney, is that this <Col N="804" /> Bill has failed to provoke any serious discussion on public service broadcasting. It is so provocative, so controversial, ruthless and dishonest in its approach that those who are opposed to it are so united they have not had time to debate the real issue, which is public service broadcasting and its role in this country. It is worth noting &mdash; and I am open to correction by Senator Kiely on this &mdash; that not a single non-Government Member in either House has supported or voted for this Bill.  In this House we have six Independents, all with different approaches to political life, all of different views, all on different wavelengths, all absolutely and totally opposed to this Bill for various reasons.  The same applied in the other House.  Nobody of an independent frame of mind in either House has supported this Bill.</P>
    <P>What we would have liked to have done was to have sought and been granted by the Minister a serious debate on public service broadcasting.  Personally I would like to have seen a breakdown of the licence fee revenue, where that goes.  It would have been far more helpful if, in debating public service broadcasting &mdash; which we have not done because we will not have sufficient time &mdash; the Minister had come to us and said: the licence fee goes to this and the commercial and advertising revenue goes to that; in other words, what do RTE need the licence fee revenue for and what is it used for?  Then we could have examined the merits of the licence fee and of public service broadcasting pure and simply; we could have examined the commercial advertising activities of RTE as against those of the other stations. There was and is room for compromise and change.  Undoubtedly there is confusion about RTE's role in Irish society, whether it is a public or private service broadcasting organisation.  But until such time as we get a breakdown of figures, and a determination of what is public service broadcasting, we will not be able to debate that role, where the licence fee goes, where it does not go; where the advertising revenue goes and where it does not go.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> What I am convinced of is that the effect of these proposals &mdash; apart from seizing the political initiative of Fianna Fáil, increasing their grip and dominance over RTE &mdash; will be to reduce the quality of the national service programmes and broadcasting.  In this Bill we have the worst of both worlds.  The Government are successfully, ruthlessly and dishonestly getting their pound of flesh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief points on this Bill.  I welcome the Bill.  Indeed I should like to commend the Minister on having done in 1988 what the previous administration failed to do within the four years and three months of their term of office when, because of differences of opinion on broadcasting among the two parties who formed the then Coalition Government, they could not agree on a proper broadcasting Bill. When the present Minister assumed his Communications portfolio in 1987 he immediately began to remedy the position obtaining when there were at least 60 to 70 pirate radio stations in operation in a chaotic manner flouting all regulatory and moral obligations.</P>
      <P>I agree with Fianna Fáil policy on broadcasting.  Indeed as a member of that party I suppose I could say I had an input in that policy in an endeavour to divise an alternative to the State broadcasting monopoly particularly with regard to news and current affairs programming. The broadcasting structures created under the provisions of the Radio and Television Act, 1988 were very welcome making provision for local, independent radio broadcasting stations who gave a great service to listeners in their areas, opening up the broadcasting sector to new entrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice, from a study undertaken by the Research Bureau of Ireland that, on an average weekday, over 1 million or 40 per cent of all listeners tune into one or more of their independent local stations, that these stations command a higher listenership than 2FM.  In fact local Clare radio must be complimented on the fact that they have commanded a listenership of 63 per cent.  It should be noted also <Col N="806" /> that these local independent broadcasting stations must operate on an income based solely on advertising revenue.  As has been pointed out already, they receive no licence fee, a privilege enjoyed by RTE only.  To ensure that a fair share of the available advertising revenue would go to the independent broadcasting stations, the provisions of section 3 have been devised, with which I am in full agreement.  I am aware that probably it will reduce RTE's advertising revenue. However, other State bodies have had their revenue reduced, have had to accept it, have continued to compete in their respective fields and remain successful. I see no reason whatsoever RTE cannot do likewise.</P>
    <P>I listened to the news on my local radio on Saturday last when there was mention of Kerry local radio going on air, contending that that station would have to compete with the local newspaper, <i>The Kerryman</i> for advertising.  It is good that these provincial newspapers have to compete with local radio.  My own provincial paper in Limerick is disappointing.  It is definitely biased and most partial to Fine Gael.  I remember them publishing a letter from Senator Neville about something that happened when the Larceny Bill was being discussed in the Seanad. After discussion with members of Fianna Fáil, I decided to answer that letter. Senator Neville's letter appeared on 2 June and I wrote in a letter which was to appear in the issue of 16 June.  Unfortunately it did not appear in that issue. Neither did it appear in the issue of 23 June, I telephoned the <i>Limerick Leader</i> and spoke to a reporter that I know there on 25 June and asked why my letter was not published.  He told me he would look after it.  It did not appear the following week, and I have not heard from that provincial paper or its reporter since.</P>
    <P>On another occasion I felt I was discriminated against in a report and I wrote a letter.  I got an apology, but when I asked to insert something in the paper the reporter said &ldquo;you should keep away from the typewriter&rdquo;.  This is most unfair <Col N="807" /> and I am delighted that we have independent radio stations to counteract such unfair media reporting.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator Neville today and he praised RTE, but I did not hear one bit of praise for our local radio which is doing great work down in our community. Senator Neville praised the work of Mícheál Ó Hehir.  We would all praise Mícheál Ó Hehir.  I had the pleasure of meeting him at the Munster Football Final recently and was delighted to see him taking his seat in the McCarthy stand in Páirc Uí Chaoimh and wished him well.  I know Mícheál Ó Hehir did great work when he was there but his work has continued now by Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh to whom I would like to give the best of praise.  I would like to praise the great work of the local sports programme on Radio Limerick every Saturday from 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock and also the work of other radio stations which is especially appreciated by the listenership there and in other areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister every success in ensuring that these local radio stations, which are of great benefit to the local community, survive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the Broadcasting Bill.  It has had a chequered history so far and the Minister here has been the victim of quite an amount of attack in regard to it, as he has been entrusted with the responsibility of bringing it in.</P>
      <P>It is obviously different in some respects from what we started out with but the intentions are generally the same. Much of what has happened in recent weeks and months could have been avoided if the suggestion put forward by our spokesman in the Dáil, Deputy Jim Mitchell, had been taken up and a review body appointed to look at the whole question of broadcasting and how it has developed.  Initially it is important to look at the whole question of broadcasting both in relation to the national service, RTE, and other services, including new ones coming on the market and the many local stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> Broadcasting is a new phenomenon with tremendous revenue-generating capacities and potential for development.  It is important to give full consideration to what we want in the context of a national service and how other services will fit in. We have to live in the real world and, in the context of the problems Century have seen, what has emerged is that there is not a bottomless pit in relation to advertising. There is much merit in the local stations that were set up in the aftermath of the pirates and it was always on the cards that there would be difficulties for another national service coming on stream and trying to compete.  This Bill is being rushed through and the chickens are now coming home to roost in the form of the difficulties we have had, and we have fallen back on RTE as the scapegoat.</P>
    <P>I would like to address, for a few minutes, the whole question of RTE's position and how tremendously well it has served the country.  I will have a few critical words to say about its operation as well.  We have been privileged here to have had a television and radio service that has developed in many areas and can compete with any service in any other country.  RTE are to be commended for that.  As the service has developed and grown, problems have arisen.  RTE have had a monopoly in relation to national broadcasting.  They have a duty to produce and import programmes and to report news and current affairs.  Broadly speaking they have done that job very well.</P>
    <P>The emergence of 2FM was a response to the pirates, a response to the needs of the younger generation and an alternative to the current affairs news programmes. It there is a complaint maybe it is that there are too many of these news and current affairs programmes.  If RTE has this dominant position it is important that there are safeguards there for the people, particularly in relation to some programmes that have emanated from RTE.  Sometimes in programmes involving national, public or local issues, RTE will try to get a certain balance in the <Col N="809" /> context of people appearing on these programmes, but at times the balance is loaded maybe in favour of certain individuals or certain parties.  Some people say that if one is in the game that is the way it is played.  If RTE are in the game they should not be above criticism either.  If there are complaints or questions raised as to how programmes are structured they must answer that.  There was a programme some time ago about housing, and one individual was on four or five times and other individuals once or twice, but some major parties did not have one representative on the programme.  Some people will obviously get more time than others, but there must be a certain balance and fair play in a major broadcasting authority like RTE.  This is important because at times the press have been under pressure as regards libel awards, and so have RTE.  If an individual &mdash; a private individual or a politician &mdash; has a complaint to make &mdash; I suppost politicians are more thick skinned and are less likely to end up in court &mdash; he should be able to contact a press council or a complaints board.  I hope the complaints procedure will be successful &mdash; but that is an aspect that has to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The difficulties that have arisen with Century Radio should have been addressed without doing a hatchet job on RTE.  It is important that RTE have the necessary revenue to fulfil their obligations. It will not be easy for them to fulfil their obligations because of the loss of revenue and jobs.  If RTE suddenly find there are job losses and are in the red, will the Minister respond positively to them?  The collection of television fees has to be examined because I think a lot more can be done in this area.  I do not know the estimated figure for unpaid licences, but I know people who will not buy a television licence until they are caught.  They then arrive in court with their licence and tell the justice they have paid it, he tells them not to do it again and off they go.  That is a very prevalent attitude.  The licence is £62 &mdash; not everyone can afford it &mdash; but there are many who can afford it and will not pay it.  Will the Minister outline the improvements <Col N="810" /> procedures he has in mind for the collection of the television licence fees because that would solve some problems.</P>
    <P>The limiting and capping of advertising on RTE has been badly approached.  It should be remembered there is not a bottomless pit.  We have two main television channels, with perhaps a third on the way, for a population of 3.5 million.  They have four television channels in England for a population of 50 million.  We have to live in the real world; we are lucky to have six or nine channels at our disposal.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate the way this matter was handled.  A lot of the problems and difficulties could have been avoided if the Minister has got the views of the commission, as happened in the case of local radio.  A lot of work went into setting up the radio stations.  This proved that it was not just a case of getting an arial and starting to broadcast.  Century Radio should have been addressed as an individual case.  Century Radio and RTE were not competing on a level pitch. However, if the Minister had wanted Century Radio to develop, certain provisions should have been made.  At the time things were rushed.</P>
    <P>At what stage does the Minister envisage being in a position to draw up a code of practice?  This matter too has been handled badly.  We have seen the spectacle of the Progressive Democrats, who at times are governed by what the leading article in the papers say, chop and change.  We have seen them scurrying and running for cover.  The threat to 2FM which has now been averted would have been a despicable act.  It is important that we get back on the rails.  RTE have done tremendous work at home and abroad, and as recently as the World Cup, their programmes, debate and presentation was unsurpassed.  It is important that the prospect to limit advertising be looked at.  I appeal to the Minister to review the legislation one year after 1 October 1990 and to listen to those involved in broadcasting.</P>
    <P>All that has happened is regrettable. The Bill has been badly handled and RTE have been singled out for victimisation. <Col N="811" /> That is why I and members of this party are opposing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sad day for Seanad Éireann; because of the way we are dealing with this issue.  It is clear that we are effectively only having a Second Stage debate and that Committee Stage can mean nothing as it is obvious the Minister will not accept amendments because the Dáil has adjourned and there is no intention of recalling it to process amendments made in this House.  The first thing that is wrong is that we are engaging in a bit of shadow boxing and irrelevant discussion as we are not going to make any fundamental changes in the legislation.  We are not going to amend the legislation and we are engaging in a meaningless charade.  It would be wrong to address the House and not to make that point.</P>
      <P>The broadcasting service is very important. It is one of the finer things of life and a good broadcasting service improves the quality of life, heightens awareness and consciousness and is important for the development of people.  For that reason I am concerned about our broadcasting service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am privileged to be the deputy spokesperson on broadcasting.  I take this responsibility very seriously because it is a very serious business.  The past few weeks have seen a terrible debacle in the history of Irish politics.  Because of the sensitivity of broadcasting and its importance to the quality of our day-to-day lives, a Bill of this sort should have gone through a much more consultative process. There should have been much more discussion, analysis and consultation. The Bill is haphazard, it was speedily introduced and does not seem to reflect the philosophy of broadcasting.  This is very sad.  The reason I say the Bill does not reflect the philosophy of broadcasting, a long-term view and a synthesis of the needs of the country in that area, is that it has been changed very quickly under pressure and so often.  If the Bill was based on philosophical considerations, a worked out strategy for <Col N="812" /> Irish broadcasting and the Minister's perception of the good of the Irish people in terms of broadcasting, then he would have stood firm instead of caving in on so many occasions and there would not have been so many adjustments to the Bill. I am disappointed about this.</P>
    <P>Obviously I accept that there may be need to be amendments to and consultation about legislation but whole chunks of this Bill have disappeared or have been altered willy nilly.  The problem with the legislation is that it is not based on sound principles and has been fraught with controversy from the very beginning.  I consider today's debate a complete charade and a waste of our time because we will not be able to amend the legislation.  The Bill is being rushed through and has not been thought out after the due process of consultation.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to RTE.  Perhaps I am a traditionalist in this respect, but I make no apology for saying that I genuinely have a tremendous affection for RTE.  I am not in any sense impugning other Members of the House &mdash; neither am I prepared to comment for them and their perception of RTE &mdash; but I am a traditionalist in the sense that I have a tremendous affection for RTE, which I believe is a superb broadcasting system. When I was growing up I was very interested in RTE programmes.  In recent years I have been fortunate enough to travel a certain amount and I can genuinely say to this House that I have not found a better broadcasting service than RTE in any other country.  When I was in America recently I listened to the broadcasting service there.  The quality of the programmes, presenters and material used by American television and radio is a nightmare compared with the service provided by RTE.  One would be likely to get a migraine from listening to American television or radio for an hour.</P>
    <P>We have a tremendous broadcasting service.  I know it may not be the view of all sectors of the community &mdash; at times some younger people may feel a certain level of alienation and frustration at the service &mdash; but I believe that RTE are a superb broadcasting station.  I do not <Col N="813" /> propose to bore the House by giving a detailed analysis of the programmes for a week on RTE, the quality of such programmes, etc., other than to make that essential point.  That is another reason I believe the legislation is untimely and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>There is a real risk that the Bill will reduce RTE's competence and services. It is worth remembering that over the last five years RTE, through a process initiated by a previous Government of reducing semi-State expenditure, have become a much leaner operation.  They have reduced their workforce by 10 per cent, cut their costs tremendously and got themselves out of a loss-making situation. That is a tremendous and necessary achievement by RTE.  All of us can be proud of the people who work in RTE. We can be proud of them as an institution, as a broadcasting service, and we can be proud of their professionalism and their excellence.  It must be very frustrating for them, having got their housekeeping right, put their house in order, having made themselves leaner and trimmer, reduced their workforce by 10 per cent and reduced costs tremendously, that the Minister is capping their advertising revenue.  Jobs will be lost in RTE and the advertising and in film industries after the implementation of this Bill. There will be up to 600 jobs lost in these industries, which is a conservative estimate. This must be a real source of frustration to the people in these industries.</P>
    <P>If we could be convinced that the advertising revenue would be diverted into the commercial and private stations and that it would have a good effect we could at least discuss the Bill in a rational way.  However, I am not so convinced.  I do not believe that the advertising revenue which will be diverted from RTE will make its way to the channels for which it is intended.  It is very likely that a considerable slice of this revenue will go to Sky, Super and other channels outside the country.  This is one of the fundamental flows in the Bill.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's views on this.  I hope he can convince me that this revenue will not leave the State.  This <Col N="814" /> Chamber has a tradition in not being overly partisan in the analysis of issues and I hope the Minister can convince us that this money will make its way to the local broadcasting stations.  I do not believe that there is adequate proof that that will be the case.  I am convinced that the money will make its way to Sky, to Super and other channels outside the country and will be used by them to supplement their inferior broadcasting services. By diverting money away from an already trimmed RTE in terms of their workforce and operations they will lose their competitiveness.  It is not just a question of this revenue leaving RTE and going abroad, which is bad enough, but there is also the secondary cancer, so to speak, of RTE's capacity to produce a variety of programmes and of creativity being stunted.</P>
    <P>Having stunted RTE and diverted the advertising money out of the country the tertiary cancer will be a further influx of external channels.  These will pose a threat to Irish culture, Irish values and the very fine programmes on RTE 1 and on RTE 2.  It will be a great pity if we lose those quality Irish programmes.  I believe this will be the ultimate result of the Bill.  That is unfortunate because the ultimate logic is that our commercial independent sector will not be enhanced in any respect.  It will not improve the playing pitch, RTE will be weakened, external broadcasting services will gain, so we are on a treble loser in that respect.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that RTE do a superb job, I make no apologies for saying that as I have no particular axe to grind.  There is no element of nepotism or anything like that involved.  No members of my family work in RTE.  I have no self-interest other than that I believe objectively they are an excellent national broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>In recent years it is clear that RTE developed a very interesting set of minority programmes for the handicapped, such as &ldquo;Listen and See&rdquo;, programmes for the deaf and for different minority interest groups, who should not be regarded as a weaker section of our community. In any developing society their <Col N="815" /> position must be strengthened, we must all work towards creating quality for them.  There is no doubt that traditionally in our society, as in many other cultures, women have been discriminated against in many areas.  One of RTE's greatest contributions to Irish society, in the past few years particularly has been the range of excellent women's programmes.  There can be no doubt that programmes like &ldquo;Women Today&rdquo; have done tremendous work in improving the consciousness of women, their self image and their positive contribution to society.  Women who had previously in every real sense been discriminated against, disenfranchised, who had been remote from the centres of power and weakened by their isolation, have been able to listen to other women in similar circumstances through programmes recently on RTE such as &ldquo;Women Today&rdquo;.  They gained confidence and intellectual development which enabled them to speak out on such programmes, and have made a necessary contribution to Irish life.</P>
    <P>Politicians meet people on a regular basis.  I have met many many women over the last number of years who have gained new vitality, confidence, and self-assertiveness from programmes like those presented by Marian Finucane.  That is why I am angry about the weakening of RTE.  I am proud of the station and I believe in it, and its values.  It reflects many strands of Irish life.  It would be a tragedy if we weakened RTE but it would make it somewhat less objectionable if the House could be convinced that stripping RTE of advertising revenue meant it would go to native broadcasting services. Thank God we have missed out on a lot of the initial assault on RTE because of the good work of the trade union movement. The Members of the Dáil amended the legislation and I am delighted about that but even so I am not convinced &mdash; and I do not believe that many Members of this House are convinced &mdash; that the diversion of advertising revenue, apart from causing job losses in RTE, the film industry and the advertising sector means that revenue will become available to <Col N="816" /> native broadcasting services.  It will undoubtedly go to other interests like Sky which is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this legislation arose from the troubles of Oliver Barry and Century.  I do not want to use the privilege of this House to make rash or loose allegations because despite the fact that we are legally immune here, it is not correct to engage in that kind of procedure. There is suspicion and doubt in relation to the real motivation about Century. There is a very wide and general perception that party political considerations were involved.  I will not develop that point further but if that is the case it is very unfortunate that the legislation arose as a consequence of that.</P>
    <P>There is another problem in the legislation, the question of the price of advertising. The Minister will have to convince us in his reply to Second Stage that there will not be a massive inflationary spiral in advertising costs.  I contend the capping of advertising time will result in an inflationary spiral of advertising costs.</P>
    <P>This leads to a much more significant matter, the question of the licence fee.  I have heard Members of this House &mdash; and Members of the other House &mdash; argue that the licence fee is not exceptionally costly at the moment.  Given the level of personal taxation, the cost of mortgages, the cost of living and the day-to-day pressures that impinge on many of our people, the licence fee is very expensive.  There is no capacity for increasing it and the level of default of licence fee payments substantiates that view.  We must be concerned about the cost of the licence fee.  I am afraid that all this will result over the next few years in a big increase in the cost of the licence fee which will place unacceptable hardship on individual consumers and on our citizens.  People do not have the capacity to absorb an increased cost of the licence.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, this legislation can only result in annihilation of RTE services, a reduction in the quality of their programmes or spiralling licence fees.  They are frightening and unacceptable prospects. I have alluded to job loss.  In a situation of chronic unemployment the <Col N="817" /> greatest political challenge facing all Members of this House and the Government which we should be debating in a rational way is the question of how in God's name we go about creating jobs for the unemployed, and not a rushed, ill thought out, non-philosophically based legislative package which had to be changed so often.  The big problem confronting this country is unemployment.  I do not say that in any cynical or populist fashion.  I believe that passionately from dealing, as I am, day to day with totally frustrated constituents who come to all of us with a total sense of hopelessness about getting employment.  At this Stage I receive, as do many other people in active politics, representations from the finest of educated, intelligent young-people asking me to get them jobs.  That is bizarre.  We cannot get them jobs. There is a terrible spirit of hopelessness among them when they come to us in that way, and for that reason unemployment is the real issue at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am talking about the Broadcasting Bill and about the resultant loss of 500 jobs at a minimum arising from the Bill.  That is an important aspect, too.</P>
      <P>RTE are a national service, a national institution, owned by the people of this country, and when they got themselves into good condition and were not losing money, the money arising from their success was being used for national considerations and was channelled towards such activities as supporting a symphony orchestra, supporting new drama, supporting creativity, new programme experimentation, women's programmes and programmes for minority interest groups.  It is not as if the money belonged to a multi-national or was going out of the country.  It was used for indigenous creativity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney said in relation to emigrants that we should make RTE available in the British Isles.  I accept <Col N="818" /> that.  That kind of thing could and should be done with RTE's revenue if we were not today ruining their potential for development.  Senator Mooney is correct: we should try to have RTE broadcasts available on the British mainland, but we could not possibly do so, and they will not be fit to create a range of programmes suitable, if they are to have their hands tied as is being done here. Through external pressures the Minister has correctly got rid of the bizarre proposals in relation to 2FM most of which would have ruined that station.  Despite what many people say, 2FM is not just a non-stop music station.  They do a range of programmes like &ldquo;Beat on the Street&rdquo; and their very good, comprehensive news programmes are worth while also.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we are having this debate in such circumstances.  Because this is such a sensitive area and because of the importance of our broadcasting services in terms of quality of life, it is unfortunate that we are in this situation and speaking in this kind of scenario.  It is particularly unfortunate since it is clear that the legislation will not be amended at all today.  It is unfortunate that when we are going to cripple RTE there will be no positive fall-out for the country. It would be bad enough to knock one institution if there was to be a positive result otherwise, but we are acting like the child who knocks down two sand castles and does not build anything in their place.  All we are doing here is diverting advertising revenue out of the country and it will not even advance the cause of the people it is supposedly going to help in the commercial sector.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to reconsider many aspects of the Bill and at the very least think very seriously along the lines proposed by Senator Cosgrave of reviewing this legislation and setting up the mechanism for its regular review in the interests of equity and of developing the broadcasting service.  If the Minister could possibly accept now that basic mechanisms must be developed to reverse many of the aspects of this Bill then we would have done a good day's <Col N="819" /> work.  My party will be opposing Second Stage of the Bill and also many aspects of it in Committee because we see it as having no thought out basis or no coherent philosophical background.  It is not based on any philosophy on broadcasting in the short or long term.  It will not work to the good of anyone other than outside interests.</P>
    <P>Again I ask the Minister to consider at the very least setting up mechanisms to review this legislation regularly and try to overcome its inherent weaknesses.  I ask him to be so courageous as to admit that the whole thing is wrong and should not be put on the Statute Book.</P>

If I had had my way we would have collapsed Second Stage this morning and have had the Minister battle his way through every section of this for the whole of the day.  Then we would have had a real debate, but apparently a number of people felt they had a great deal to say on this Bill.  I certainly will not be speaking at any great length on it.  Our strategy has been bad and we might have handled it differently.  The Government side were quite cynical in the way they suddenly decided after last week that, having had nobody to fill in the spaces to discuss this, as soon as the time became finite, as soon as the guillotine motion was passed, to start filling in with speakers and wasting time.  Of course, the longer Second Stage goes on the more it serves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I was saying, Fianna Fáil could not get this Bill through quickly enough last week and cut down on the number of speakers.  Suddenly this week there are people available to make all sorts of long speeches on it.  It is a fairly cynical response.  It may be quite an acceptable parliamentary process but it does the function of the House no good.</P>
      <P>This is most dangerous legislation, as I have said already.  It is an absolute abuse of power.  It is a dangerous development of a type which we will all regret in future years.  I am not in the habit in this House of making personal statements about Ministers or otherwise.  The House may not be aware that the Minister and I are neighbours in the sense that we live only a number of miles apart from each other, but I must say for the record that the contemptuous way in which the Minister presented Second Stage of this Bill was utterly unacceptable.  I was listening to it in my office and I feel a great surge of anger about it.  If the Minister attempts to do the same thing in the wrap up of this debate one of us will be taken from the House.  I will not stand for it.  I presume it will be me because we lack the voting power on this side.  I certainly will not sit here and listen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not even begun to discuss the Chair at this stage.  I do not understand how you could have taken that interpretation of my words.  I do not see your own involvement in it at all, so I do not understand the reason for your response.  The Minister's presentation was contemptuous and it was a very poor start to the Bill.  I do not know the reasons for it and I thought it was unnecessary. One way or another, we can have our arguments, we can put the case, argue the point and be out-voted at the end of the day but it was certainly unacceptable as far as I am concerned.  It would certainly not be acceptable in the other House.  I am sure the Minister knows that <Col N="821" /> this would be the general view of this side.  I have said it outside the House and it is important that I say it inside the House as well.</P>
      <P>Were we taking a longer period of time on Second Stage, I had intended to explore in detail the basis of what the Minister had to say in his very optimistic presentation of the Wireless and Telegraphy Bill of last year, when all was going to be well with the world, and when all these newcomers were going to make everything right, the implication being that RTE of course would not be able to survive in the very competitive milieu out there.  The attempts to sort out RTE have proved to be sadly ineffective and because of that ineffectiveness, we are now back today to complete the burial process.  That is the objective of this Bill and I have not the slightest doubt about it.  It is incredible that the personal animosity of members of Cabinet towards the national broadcasting station should now manifest itself in the form of incomplete and defective legislation which reflects badly on all we try to do in the enactment of legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister's attitude towards RTE, was reflected in the contemptuous presentation of the Second Stage speech in this House.  It was regrettable and unnecessary; it was a transference of the Minister's contempt for RTE to the processes of this House.  It is important that it should be recognised as no more than that.  I am prepared to defend my position on that.</P>
      <P>There is nothing new about the thrust of this Bill.  The thrust of this Bill is a very simple one &mdash; that when the public sector becomes over-competitive, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the private sector, we restrain it, block it, impede it or bury it.  We do not let it operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plenty of examples have been given here over the last two days as to how RTE go about their business.  I am not going into that whole area but we need to look at what the licence fee is for.  I hope some of the speakers on the far side of the House who would also present themselves as being the great supporters of all that is Gaelic and all that is Irish, <Col N="822" /> whether it be in games, music or anything else, will also recognise that, when they throw RTE into the milieu of competitiveness without the support which was there before, TAM ratings must be taken into account when people vote according to their preference for a soccer match rather than Irish dancing as they will, we will listen again to the whinging on the far side.  We should also recognise that those aspects of Irish culture which were promoted and developed by RTE will suffer in the future, because the hard edge of competitiveness will not allow RTE to promote them.</P>
    <P>Certain elements of the funding of RTE might well have been profitably and positively considered by the Minister at this time.  I do not have any objection, I have not the slightest difficulty about saying that RTE should not be given a head start on everybody else, except that I would say we should do it on a commercial basis.  Let us ask what we require from RTE.  What we require of RTE is quite clear and is written into the legislation that established it: to educate, inform and entertain.  What aspect of that is public service broadcasting?  What part of that is a national resonsibility?  What aspects of that are considered to be uncommercial but necessary?  We should cost those things and then have a licence fee which will cover that responsibility. Whatever the cost of it, let us have a licensed income in order to cover it. Beyond that, for commercial activities, let them then get into the marketplace and take on all-comers, as they have been so successfully doing in taking on probably the best television service in the world, in the mainland UK, or as some speakers now call it, the British Isles.  I would like to have a discussion as to where exactly the British Isles are.  There have been some passing references to it in the last while.  It is not an area of the map on which I am quite clear.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why RTE should not be commercial.  I have consistently taken the view here that semi-State industry should be competitive.  It should not be a drain on the taxpayer.  It should not be there as a cost to everybody else. <Col N="823" /> It should either provide a social service which is necessary and which we pay for out of taxation or, if it is on a competitive basis, should act competitively.  I can apply that to any of the semi-State bodies, whether it be in the transport or the broadcasting sector.  If we are saying RTE are required to spend X percentage of time in broadcasting as Gaeilge, mar shampla, we should consider how that will reflect itself in loss of income to RTE. If we require them to provide a certain amount of classical music, in terms of their broadcasting hours per year, we should consider the cost in terms of loss of advertising or the cost of setting up an orchestra and so on.</P>
    <P>Let us cost those objectives and recognise our commitment to promote Irish culture, an Ghaeilge and Irish games, and to keep an orchestra or a drama section &mdash; the RTE Players or whoever they happen to be.  Having costed our commitments we should then tailor the licence fee to meet them.  Then let RTE go on the marketplace, sell their advertising and win their audiences in the same way as any other commercial activity. That seems to me a very reasonable procedure.</P>
    <P>The way section 3 has been phrased is unfortunate.  More unfortunate than the capping to the certain number of minutes per hour is the connection with the licence fee income.  That is utterly unnecessary.  That is an attempt to make RTE uncompetitive.  That means, in effect, that they may not be able to charge the market rate if, for some reason, the advertising costs go up to such an extent that selling the five minutes at prime time will bring them over the annual level to which they are restricted by the connection to the licence fee income.  That is a nonsense.  No commercial undertaking would operate that way.</P>
    <P>What sickens me more than anything else about this legislation is that for years we listened to claims that RTE were unprofitable, that we should make them profitable, make them lean, cut back on the fat, make them go out there and work <Col N="824" /> for their audience, make them competitive, and make them pay their own way.  It is the same with every semi-State body.  I saw the ESB, Aer Lingus and all of them go through this.  The Government were happier to be critical of those bodies when they could not make it in the marketplace because then they had a target to have a go at.  But as soon as they became competitive, whether it was Aer Lingus <i>vis-á-vis</i> Ryanair or RTE <i>vis-á-vis</i> commercial broadcasting, and could find their own niche or start going ahead, then of course the influence of commercial people who have an input into the Government for whatever reason, suddenly becomes very important and it is the semi-State body that suffers. Whether it is taking routes from Aer Lingus or reducing the income of RTE, as we are doing here today, as soon as they become competitive, they become a threat and the answer is to bury them.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of the last Bill introduced by the Minister, on which I argued long and late into the night with the Minister, was the so-called cultural aspect.  I raised with the Minister the prospect of educational broadcasting, which is not available in this country at the moment. It is not available through a lack of coordination by a wholy body of people including RTE.  When the Bill came before the House last year I proposed an amendment which would have required each licensee to set aside a number of hours for the broadcasting of educational programmes.  This is the only country in Western Europe that does not set aside time for the broadcasting of educational programmes.  I put it to the Minister that he should have made this a requirement which could have been done at no cost. Unfortunately, he did not do so.</P>
    <P>I also asked the Minister to make it a requirement that each licensee set aside a certain number of hours for the broadcasting of programmes through Irish.  The Minister assured me that this matter would be taken into account in the issuing of licences but, again, this was not done. I further asked the Minister to make it a requirement that those stations providing a service in the Gaeltacht areas set aside <Col N="825" /> time, in proportion to the population of the Gaeltacht, for the broadcasting of programmes through Irish but, once more, he did not do so.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that RTE are criticised and that people will take a trip out to the station to picket them on the basis they are required to broadcast programmes through Irish but will not picket Century Radio, Capital or any other station.  They only picket the national broadcasting station because there is a perception that this is the responsibility of the national broadcasting service.  Unfortunately, RTE will be left with all the responsibility but with no money.</P>
    <P>RTE are a superb station.  That is not a conclusion I have come to within the past week; I express this view consistently. To my mind Radio 1 and BBC Radio 4 are two of the best English language stations in the world.  In his famous &ldquo;talk, talk, talk&rdquo; speech a few years ago the Minister outlined the problems he had with a radio station whose &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme was followed by Gay Byrne, Pat Kenny, &ldquo;The News at One&rdquo; and by Marian Finnucane.  The Minister argued that there was too much talk on the station and the people of Ireland did not want this.  It is easy to see why any member of the Government would be worried about too much talk as talking leads to thinking which, in turn, leads to people becoming critical and very often critical people vote the wrong way.</P>
    <P>It is a perfectly logical process but the reality is that the audience listenership surveys issued last week indicate that the stations which have come to the fore are those which broadcast talk shows.  I am referring here to stations such as Clare FM, Carlow-Kildare Radio and Louth-Meath Radio.  These stations broadcast talk shows and are attracting audiences. RTE have got the mix right.  When we discussed the legislation to establish independent radio it was envisaged that Century Radio, when established, would offer an alternative to programmes such as &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; broadcast by RTE but they have failed to deliver.  We have placed an onus on RTE to deliver the goods and broadcast programmes which <Col N="826" /> are not popular or wanted by the people in the &ldquo;licence to print money&rdquo; business. At the end of the day, RTE are going to suffer.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister agree that the most honest presentation made to the Independent Radio and Television Commission, prior to the issuing of licences, was made by the former owner of Radio Nova in which he stated that he would play music and utter one word of Irish each day?  In hindsight, was that not the most honest presentation made in contrast to all the drivel we had to listen to? What is also significant &mdash; this marked the beginning of the cutting down of RTE &mdash; is that the Minister refused to allow them tender for local radio licences.  I accept that if one is going to provide an alternative, RTE cannot be allowed provide it.  That is fair enough but, in recognising they will not be able to compete at that level, there is one service they could provide to local stations and that is a news service by way of a separate company.  They have the necessary technology, capital and personnel to provide such a service and it would allow them to make the maximum use of their resources.  Unfortunately, they were not allowed to provide such a service.</P>
    <P>When Century Radio were discussed some weeks back, at a time when it was envisaged they would go to the wall, it was pointed out that the one service which might stand on its own was their news service.  At present they provide a news service to local stations around the country and are making a profit in the process.  RTE identified this as a market for themselves and that showed they were on the ball.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of discussing the various provisions of the Bill as I will have an opportunity to do so when we come to deal with Committee Stage but let me repeat I regret the tone of the Minister's presentation.  As I said, the Minister was being contemptuous and I appeal to him to avail of the opportunity to argue the toss one way or the other.  It seems to be defective legislation which the Minister will live to regret and I have no doubt he will have to come back to <Col N="827" /> the House in a couple of years, as he had to do two years after introducing the previous Bill, to sort out the mess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the way in which it has considered the Bill and the many Senators who contributed to the debate.  It was a pleasure to listen to the debate since it recommenced at 10.30 a.m. this morning. Unfortunately, the last day I had to leave the House for about an hour and a half to fulfil an appointment which had been arranged well in advance of the debate. Apart from this, I have listened with great interest to the Second Stage debate.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge there are many varied and strongly held views, both for and against this legislation.  Those who put forward their views did so by and large in a thoughtful, courteous and non-personal way.  The kernel of the Government's and Fianna Fáil's broadcasting policy is to provide multiplicity of choice in the broadcasting domain and in particular to provide an alternative voice or voices in the area of broadcast news and current affairs.  It is essential that these alternatives are strong and vibrant so that when taken together with RTE's services they offer a balance both nationally and, in this technological age, to the multiplicity of services coming from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points I would like to make at this early stage is that the Government and I, as Minister for Communications, recognise that RTE have been the premier broadcaster here and will remain so, even with the advent of the multiplicity of choice I referred to.  Senator O'Reilly made reference to his affection for RTE as if in some way the Government, or the Government parties, were making some move to remove this premier role from RTE but nothing could be further from the truth.  The reality is that RTE will continue to have an income of approximately £100 million to provide a service for 3.5 million people.  Most broadcasting organisations worldwide would consider this to be a substantial sum of money.  It is my hope that RTE will develop their <Col N="828" /> commercial operations to increase their revenue.  Senator O'Reilly and others also talked about the need for consultation. Fine Gael made great play about the need for consultation, and time for reflection with no action.  I can understand Fine Gael, they are being consistent. They were in Government for nearly five years and we had reflection and consultation but we also had 70 pirate radio stations and no attempt was made to create a legal regime for alternative radio.</P>
    <P>We had consultation between the Minister for Communications at the time, Deputy Mitchell, and the Labour Party. The Bill was introduced.  We had a couple of hours debate on Second Stage in 1985 and the Bill never again saw the light of day.  There was plenty of consultation but meanwhile the law of the land was being brought into disrepute.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly and others made the point that the debate in the Dáil and in this House has been a charade and that I had not been listening or taking note of points and, at the same time, he said the Minister caved in regularly.  He cannot have it both ways.  I cannot be accused of being rigid and not being prepared to take on board reasonable points in a debating sense and at the same time be accused of caving in.</P>
    <P>The Radio and Television Act, 1988, opened up the Irish broadcasting sector to new entrants.  There was a welcome on all sides of the House for this development as well as a wish to see them succeed. Indeed, the new entrants have done exceedingly well in the short time they have been on air, as the recent joint national listenership research survey attested.  It indicated on an average weekday that over one million people, or 40 per cent of all listeners, are tuning into one or more of the independent stations. They are not my figures, they are not Fianna Fáil figures, they are not Government figures but they are the figures of the Joint National Listnership Research Survey which was carried out by RTE together with the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the advertising sector.  Their survey carried out <Col N="829" /> over April and May, at a time when many of the stations were on air only a few months, when Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Kerry and a number of others had not gone on air at the time showed that 40 per cent of the listening audience was, at one time during the day, listening to independent radio as established by the 1988 Act, which has been criticised.</P>
    <P>My objective now is to ensure that the growth we have seen in the independent sector and in radio listenership generally, can be strengthened and sustained. Obviously I could not hope to address all the issues that were raised in the course of the debate, but what did strike me &mdash; and I say this with the utmost respect to the contributions made &mdash; was the almost singular failure of any Senators from the benches opposite to actually address the fundamental objective which this legislation is intended to achieve, which is to create conditions of fair competition in the broadcasting domain.</P>
    <P>We had numerous expressions of concern about the possible effects of these proposals on RTE.  Equally there was a general consensus that the development of an independent broadcasting sector was a very desirable objective.  If we really believe that a competing independent sector is desirable, it is not enough to say that the new services knew the conditions that applied when they entered the fray.  We need to take positive action to establish conditions of fairness where we can have a strong, vibrant and lasting alternative broadcasting medium.  That conditions are unfair is self-evident and stems fundamentally from the dual funded benefit that RTE has.  Apart altogether from the dominant position it has established throughout 60 years in radio and 30 years in television, RTE holds a monopoly privilege.  Not alone does this benefit give RTE a very significant quantum of resources which is not available to the independent services, but it has the effect of creating a distortion in the advertising market.  This goes without saying.</P>
    <P>If I took any consolation from the rather acrimonious debate we had on this legislation in the Dáil it was the fact that <Col N="830" /> ultimately, and somewhat belatedly, there was a recognition at least from the Labour Party of the unfairness of the conditions that apply in the broadcasting sector and that they ultimately produced a proposal which in terms of practice and effect was not significantly different from my original proposals.  The Labour Party have put down a similar amendment in this House, amendment No. 6, which suggests that a levy on the gross advertising revenue of the RTE Authority and services licensed by the commission would be paid to the Independent Radio and Television Commission; and that money will be disbursed for the benefit of the public service aspects of the broadcasters. The limit to be raised by the levy is £5 million, and it is not to be taken from companies with a turnover of less than £1 million in effect, that means RTE pay the vast bulk of it &mdash; a levy of about £5 million &mdash; through the IRTC which was really the bones of what I had proposed.</P>
    <P>I was also struck by part of Senator Hederman's contribution when, describing the undoubtedly excellent quality of some of RTE's services, she stressed that RTE's public service obligations must be financed by a combination of licence fee and advertising.  If that logic applies to RTE it must equally apply to the independent sector who have a similar public service broadcasting mandate with the extra obligation to provide a specific quota of news and current affairs.  That mandate was provided for in section 9 of the 1988 Act and in section 18 (3) which deals with the establishment of television services.  This particular point was the basis of my original proposal, which was to make available to the IRTC a modest proportion of licence fee revenue for distribution among the independent services to enable them to meet those obligations. The lion's share would continue to go to RTE.</P>
    <P>On the independent side there was no question of an unconditional handout to the independent stations because of the criteria by which moneys could be disbursed. There would have been full accountability to a body set up by the <Col N="831" /> Oireachtas.  Such a furore was created about this proposal, and such confusion created in the public mind that it became untenable and RTE have to take a lot of the blame for that because they made no effort to treat the proposal in a rational and objective way.  It was a case of put up the barricades, and what we have we hold.  This left me with little option but to tackle the issue of creating fairer competition and conditions by approaching it from the advertising revenue side and curtailing RTE's distorting role in that market.</P>
    <P>I reject the claim that these proposals are about controlling the media or curbing the independence of comment on RTE.  When these comments come from Fine Gael and Labour it is slightly ironic. The Labour Party would be first to admit and I made this point in a debate in the Dáil on 13 June &mdash; that the RTE broadcasting monopoly has been open to abuse.  I am sorry there is no Labour Party Member present for this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I said it with regret, not as an accusation.  Column 2321 of the Dáil Official Report of 13 June reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically, I recall five years ago when Deputy Spring as a Coalition Minister threatened RTE with a withdrawal of support for the principle of public service broadcasting because of alleged political bias against the Labour Party.  Deputy Spring wrote a letter to RTE in June 1985 expressing his anger, indeed his sense of betrayal, at the treatment of his party by RTE <Col N="832" /> at that time compared to The Workers' Party.  The word &ldquo;betrayal&rdquo; is an interesting one as it suggests that RTE public service broadcasters should favour those political parties who support the RTE monopoly and that if they do not, then the monopoly should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>To listen to Fine Gael speakers in relation to the totally unbiased broadcasting of RTE, it is interesting that, of all the political parties in these Houses, it was Fine Gael who felt it incumbent on them &mdash; in relation to a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme transmitted on 24 January, 1989 when the complainant was Deputy Alan Dukes &mdash; to lodge a complaint with the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. Following the broadcast of that &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme of 24 January, Deputy Dukes sent a letter to RTE complaining about the lack of political impartiality in the programme, contending that it was not politically evenhanded. He said the thesis put forward on that programme was that the economic difficulties in this country began in 1984 under the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government and that the first real action to correct that financial crisis had been taken after the last general election.  That complaint was considered by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission but RTE did respond.  They denied there was any bias in the content of the programme, that it was not a programme on economic history but one which examined the immediate circumstances of the first budget of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, to be announced on the following day and should be evaluated as such.  The Broadcasting Complaints Commission examined this complaint and on 21 March 1990 unanimously dismissed it; the secretary of the commission signed the report.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that, of the two parties on the other side who accuse this side of interference in RTE or of complaining about RTE, one party while in Government felt obliged to write talking about betrayal and the other lodged complaints with the Broadcasting Complaints Commission about RTE.  I am glad that the <Col N="833" /> fairness of RTE's programming was upheld by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.</P>
    <P>What I am endeavouring to do is to create plurality in the media, particularly in the area of news and current affairs, moving away from the circumstances in which there was one source of information only at domestic level in the broadcasting sector which, for most people, is their main source of information on contemporary affairs.</P>
    <P>The question was raised of charities and of RTE's concessionary advertising rate for charities.  It is important to emphasise that that charity advertising rate is and never was available on television; it is available on radio only for a maximum of seven minutes per day at the concession rate.  In response to the strong views and representations of the charitable organisations I extended the limit on time from 4.5 to five minutes.</P>
    <P>We heard a plea also for the independent broadcasting sector.  RTE had a total output in 1989-90 of 7,500 hours of which home-produced programmes was about 50 per cent, or 3,750 hours.  Of their total output of 7,500 hours RTE give 2.57 per cent to independent producers and broadcasters, that is 180 hours out of 7,500 hours devoted to the independent sector.  Listening to the arguments advanced in this House and the other House I was anxious to endeavour to secure the position of the independent broadcasting sector &mdash; as had been decided in the EC directive and the Council of Europe Convention on broadcasting &mdash; by writing in an amendment to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Various speakers asked when the code of practice would come into force.  The idea behind the Bill is that there will be discussions between the RTE Authority, the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the Department of Communications with a view to implementing it.  I can assure the House that I will be guided very much in that decision by the code of practice already operated within RTE.</P>
    <P>Atlantic 252 was mentioned.  I should <Col N="834" /> say it is a joint venture between Radio Luxembourg and RTE which has been losing money consistently and has not, in my view, really achieved what RTE themselves had hoped.  In the provisions of the Bill I have endeavoured to encourage its development by excluding it from the capping of advertising so that they will be entitled to raise up to 20 per cent in advertising revenue.  I have no intention of interfering with that venture other than endeavouring to encourage it to be more successful than it has been to date.</P>
    <P>Many other points were raised in regard to the licence fee and its collection. The licence fee collection and sales performance of An Post has been very successful since they assumed responsibility at the beginning of 1984 since when there has been an increase of over 22 per cent in TV licence sales.  Each year licence sales targets are set by An Post in consultation with RTE.  They have been exceeding these targets and doing very well.  For example, in 1988 the target was 827,500 licences whereas they actually sold 840,000, an excess of 12,500.  In 1989 the target was 852,000 while their sales amounted to 861,722, an excess of 9,722.  A further demanding target of 877,000 sales for 1990 has been agreed between An Post and RTE.  An Post are hopeful of meeting that target and perhaps, for the fifth consecutive year, will exceed it which will be another source of income for RTE.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I wanted to raise in relation to RTE's source of income.  I might add that I have already written to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in regard to this issue.  I want to stress that it was never intended or proposed that income from RTE's commercial enterprise unit would be taken into account in determining the limits on advertising revenue set in this Bill.  The establishment of that unit was a decision I fully supported.  I would be keen to see it develop and expand so as to maximise revenue from existing and new activities.  That point was raised by Senator Mooney.  I am glad to be able to tell him that that letter to the Irish <Col N="835" /> Congress of Trade Unions was sent on 12 July.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Senators who, in the main, contributed in a reasonable, rational manner.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Naughten on Wednesday, 11 July 1990:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  recognise the serious income crisis affecting thousands of Irish farmers,</P>
    <P>(2)  implement measures to alleviate the present income crisis in the areas of beef, store cattle, sheep, milk and cereals.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;recognises the major improvement <Col N="837" /> in farm incomes since 1986 and commends the Government for the measures which have been taken during 1990 to maintain farm incomes in the face of the more unfavourable market conditions which prevail at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Hussey.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will resume where I left off last week.  The point needs to be made that there is no need to get into a debate about what happened to farm prices this year.  As we are all aware the trend in recent months for all products has been pretty well in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>I wish to stress the profound significance of GATT for this country.  It is the most important agricultural agreement reached since we joined the Community. I was very pleased that after the G7 meeting in Houston last week, Commissioner MacSharry took a very positive stand in defence of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I hope the Government will be successful in putting forward to the Commission the significance we attach to the GATT talks.</P>
      <P>One of the items discussed at the meeting in Houston which was given prominence was the agreement to make substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support.  This agreement was represented as almost something new, which, of course, it is not.  As far back as the mid-term review in April 1989, the European Community accepted that substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support, protection sustained over an agreed period, resulting in correcting and preventing restrictions and distortions in world agricultural trade, would be the norm.  The Community's position has not changed despite what has been represented in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the issues of concern to me because I am a cereal grower is the question of cereal substitutes which must be dealt with under the GATT.  We have just begun what I hope will be a very successful harvest.  The yield indicators are very good, and if the weather stays good please God we will have a good <Col N="838" /> harvest.  One of the major irritants to Irish cereal growers is that they have to pay more than £6 a tonne in a co-responsibility levy when at the same time 18 million tonnes of cereal substitutes from a subsidised ethanol industry in the United States can enter the Community without restriction.  It is quite legitimate for growers to be very aggrieved about having to pay a tax for what is perceived to be surplus production when American cereal substitutes can enter the Community without penalty.  I hope this matter will be dealt with in the GATT round which will be concluded before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The price of lamb and sheep meat has been dealt with already.  I share the concern of farmers, and other Members of the House, about the market for sheep. As somebody in my part of the country said, it has got to the stage where sheep are like rabbits before myxomatosis, they are everywhere.  It was right to encourage farmers to get into sheep production. They are faced with marketing difficulties now but at the time it was the right decision.</P>
    <P>The other question which needs to be addressed is winter fattening.  I am a member of a discussion group of 12 farmers and almost everyone of them built slatted beef units in the early seventies. Nearly all of those slatted units are now empty because of the very bad margins in winter fattening.  It is a terrible waste of national resources to build facilities and then not to use them.  I hope that something can be done about this issue at EC level.</P>
    <P>In relation to the initiatives which the Government might take to improve farm incomes, the reality is that the play is in Brussels for most of the time.  The Minister, and previous Ministers of all Governments have done their utmost at Brussels level to safeguard and protect the interests of Irish farmers.  They have done that quite successfully most of the time but the action they can take is restricted in some respects.</P>
    <P>One thing which needs to be encouraged is rural development.  There have been some developments in this area as <Col N="839" /> a result of the 1987 document produced by the Commission.  There is, and there will be, substantial aid available for initiatives in rural development.  I say in all sincerity to the Department of Agriculture and Food that they must not try to control that initiative; they must participate in it.  The centre in UCG and the local effort involved in this must be encouraged and given the full support of the Department.  I know the Minister will agree with me on this point.  Traditionally farming was equated with rural development but, of course, there is much more to rural development than just farming.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the trend within the Common Agricultural Policy to move to a system of income support.  Of course, this is something that GATT will accommodate because they do not mind if we have income support rather than price support but our capacity as a country to afford a system of income support, where we would have to rely on a certain amount of our domestic resources, is very limited.  The core of the Common Agricultural Policy must be kept in place. The Minister announced the members of Bord Glas today and he was here when we debated the Bill establishing that body and he must be aware of the huge opportunities for horticulture.</P>
    <P>Intervention has been a very significant part of our price support system.  One of the deficiencies of intervention is that it has been a first processors price and in a sense is a licence to avoid marketing.  My message above all else is that we need to be more marketing orientated.  The Government must lend their support to initiatives which will improve farm incomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating this motion at a very opportune time.  If what I heard in the restaurant a few minutes ago is correct, farm incomes in general will decline by 25 per cent this year and the incomes of dairy farmers will decline by 30 per cent.  I understand those Teagasc figures have just been published. This raises the question: did Teagasc organise the publication of these figures <Col N="840" /> to coincide with this debate, was this debate organised to coincide with the publication of the Teagasc figures or &mdash; I see the Minister is smiling &mdash; was it entirely coincidental?  My guess is that it happens to be a coincidence, but a very appropriate one.</P>
      <P>There are a number of problems in relation to farm incomes which those figures spell out in fairly stark and clear terms.  These problems are going to hit certain elements of the farming community to a far greater extent than others. In particular, they will hit the small farmers.  Of course, the Labour Party are very concerned about the welfare of small farmers.  These problems are also going to hit non-dairy farmers because, traditionally, incomes of non-dairy farmers have been considerably lower than the incomes of farmers in the dairying sector. To be realistic about it, there will be a very substantial reduction in the incomes of dairy farmers who, relatively speaking, have been doing very well in recent times.</P>
      <P>The incomes of farmers in 1989 tended to remain nominally static which I suppose means that there was a real decline in the value of farmers' incomes in 1989 equivalent to the rate of inflation which was of the order of 3 to 4 per cent.  If what I have heard is correct, farm incomes in general will decline by 25 per cent this year while the incomes of dairy farmers will decline by 30 per cent.  That is stunning and anyone who meets farmers even to the extent that I do, is aware that all is not well in relation to their incomes. There was a very perceptible decline even allowing for the fact that farmers always tended to over-state their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three initiatives should be taken first, there should be direct income aid for poorer farmers; second, there should be an increase in headage payments for farmers in disadvantaged areas and, third, the Government should use all their influence to speed up the reclassification of the disadvantaged areas so that more areas would be designated as disadvantaged and the areas of differing levels of disadvantage would be increased for the benefit of farmers who are now badly hit.  I am particularly anxious that <Col N="841" /> some initiative should be taken in relation to direct income aid for farmers on low incomes.  It is ridiculous that to a large extent EC aid has helped all farmers on the basis of output.  There are variations but, generally speaking, that is the case. I strongly urge the Government to use their influence to modify that; there is considerable scope even under the present regulations for doing so.</P>
    <P>Under present EC law it is possible for the Government to introduce direct income aids and I would be very anxious that that would be done.  It is of fundamental importance to take that initiative. I say this because of my own experience and because of a discussion I had with a very good friend and party colleague of mine, Councillor Jimmy Townsend.  Some people may think there are no farmers in the Labour Party, but Jimmy Townsend is a very successful and efficient smallish farmer in County Carlow and a Labour Party county councillor. To some extent I got this idea from him.  I have tried to investigate what can be done and I understand it is possible that an initiative can be taken under the present legislation.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge an increased headage payment.  The headage system of payment is primarily designed to aid small farmers on low incomes.  At present, under existing EC law, it is possible to have as much as a 30 per cent increase in the maximum amounts permitted in headage payments.  Again, I urge the Minister to consider taking some initiatives under that heading.</P>
    <P>I propose that the Government use their influence in the European Community to speed up the reclassification of disadvantaged areas.  It is very important that that is done because it is expected that the total area now designated as disadvantaged will be increased and that the areas of differing levels of disadvantage will also be increased, to this country's benefit.  It is very important that every influence is used by the Government to try to speed things in Brussels so that the new system of classification could be introduced this year or very early next year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> There are a number of broad comments I want to make.  I accept that there has been a very serious reduction in the beef sector.  These affect people in varying degrees, particularly in relation to the size of their beef holding.  Many beef farmers run their small holdings inefficiently. There are all sorts of problems in relation to beef and I will refer briefly to two of them.  First, there is something of a drift from the consumption of animal products in general, particularly in the case of meat.  The numbers of vegetarians in the population has been increasing in Ireland and worldwide.  It would be unrealistic to expect it to change.</P>
    <P>Second there is the problem of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and its effects on the market.  We need to adequately and honestly face up to the implications of this disease and to the very small possibility that it may be transmissible to humans.  We cannot rule that out and there is no point in making sweeping generalisations about things being technically safe and so on.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I fully accept that the risks are minimal.  There are risks attached to pretty well every form of human endeavour but it is very important that we get this right and that we face up to what is involved because what happens will have an impact on our capacity to change.  What will come from Europe will be minimal, we do not have the research capacity to influence ideas or to modify to any serious extent the influence from the United Kingdom, the United States or the European Community.  It is on that basis that we should approach the matter instead of always reassuring ourselves that there is no problem and so on.  We should look at it, consider it and act accordingly.  I hope everybody will have the maturity to act in a responsible manner in relation to that.</P>
    <P>I outlined earlier the extent of the decline in dairy farmers' incomes which ultimately are related to the fall in the consumption of dairy products.  All this will put the quota system under threat. At present there is far too much butter moving into intervention, which in turn will create its own pressures.  If the trend <Col N="843" /> continues and if the present realities remain it is inevitable that we will see a reduction in quotas.  If not, there will be a reduction in price, and that is the old dilemma which has been analysed in this country for a number of years.  The general consensus primarily emanated from Professor Sheehy of UCD who was one of the first people to come down in favour of the idea of quotas.</P>

      <P>Indeed, some of them are good.  There is no doubt about that.  Professor Sheehy is a very good example. The general consensus in the agricultural economic world is that quotas are the best thing for us but we are facing the possibility of reductions if the trends do not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not realise that Mr. Reagan was from Tipperary, but you can always learn something new.  I heard that he had a pub down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems relating to dairy produce is the fall-off in consumption which arises because of a trend in nutrition, health and so on.  There is a perception that dairy products are not desirable at the levels at which they are being consumed.  There has been a move away from them in the marketplace. Over the years we have tended to resist this, to say it is wrong and so on.  In 1976 when I was more conscious of nutrition than I am now, a headline in a newspaper said that dairy products had a clean bill of health.  Maybe they had, but, the consumption of butter dropped dramatically. The consumption of butter here will be determined primarily by forces from outside this country.  We have a very limited capacity to modify or to resist those forces.  We should take them and make the best of them instead of saying they are wrong or sticking our heads in the sands.  I am concerned that this may, to some extent, be happening in relation to <Col N="844" /> the BSE problem.  We should try to make the best of it instead of pretending it does not exist and making sweeping statements which sooner or later will catch up with us.</P>
    <P>It is imperative to get the marketing side of agriculture right.  I am referring to high quality levels, developing new products and branded Irish products which will have the loyalty of the consumer right across Europe and the world at large.</P>
    <P>One of the great failures of the Irish food industry, again illustrated recently in relation to meat in Britain, was that we could not get branded Irish meat to gain the market advantage that comes from the perception of it being produced here in healthy, clean conditions.  It was sold under the name of Sainsburys or Marks &amp; Spencer or however it sells over there.  We cannot get our branded products straight to the consumer.  Let me hasten to say that I realise that to do that is extremely expensive and time consuming. However, I urge the food industry strongly to try to increase its scale of production.  Otherwise we will not make any progress.  We are talking here of fundamental changes in the dairy industry in particular.  I suppose we are talking about one co-operative in Munster; Golden Vale, Ballyclough, Mitchelstown &mdash; and I am probably leaving out Kerry &mdash; will all have to come together.  That applies also to the beef industry.  The great failure with beef is our inability to get consumer-ready products.  It has gone on and on and the way things have developed would drive one to despair.</P>
    <P>In America President Bush seems to have come out of the GATT talks quite happy.  I was glad to hear Senator Dardis say that effectively nothing much has been decided, but the impression has been created that there are going to be changes which will have an enormous impact on this country.  In approximate terms this country gains to the extent of £1 billion net from the EC but that could be put at risk as a result of the GATT.  I do not think most people in this country realise the significance of that.  I must say <Col N="845" /> that in recent times the farming community seem to be getting the message but I do not think the general public realise it.  It will affect all of us.  It is very important that at EC level we get our act together and use what influence we have to see that our interests are protected.  In my view our interests are best served by getting that money into the country.  I have radically different views from those of most of my colleagues on this side of the House and on the other side as to how that money will subsequently be worked through the economy.  It is essential that the money be got here and once we get it we can hope to strike some reasonable balance as to how it should be used.  We in the Labour Party have considerably different views on that matter from those of the other parties represented here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment so ably moved by my colleague, Senator Tom Hussey.  Senator Upton mentioned the GATT negotiations.  I agree with him that we need to unite on this.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed to read last week, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 11 July, that the former EC Commissioner, Mr. Peter Sutherland, one of the best Commissioners we have had who did an excellent job for the country while he was Commissioner, stated at a meeting of the 15 members of the &ldquo;Eminent Persons Group on World Trade&rdquo;, that he was in favour of phasing out subsidies on food. He was quoted in the paper as saying he would advocate the phasing out of agricultural subsidies.  I was sorry to hear that statement from such an important person, especially at this time.  I appeal to the Fine Gael Party who have this motion down here this evening to clarify the position because I am sure note will be taken of his statement in other places in and outside the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are facing a tough period in those negotiations, and I wish our Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, and our Commissioner Ray MacSharry every success.  I am sure they will fight a tough battle to see to it that the CAP is not only not tampered with <Col N="846" /> but improved to protect the family farm, because if anything happens there this country will be in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>We have our problems but they did not happen overnight.  Many things have happened in the cattle trade, particularly in recent months with &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;. I sometimes wonder whether we have had a touch of it here in this Chamber and in the other Chamber in the past couple of months in view of the carry on. Tuesday's papers stated that the demand for beef has dropped by 10 per cent due to consumer resistance.  That augurs badly for the Irish farmer and we hope that scare will disappear.  I compliment the Minister who stayed up all night some weeks ago to try to sort out that matter with the Commission.  He was very successful.</P>
    <P>All is not gloom.  I see also in Tuesday's paper that 1992 will be a boom year for dairy products according to a group of economists who have carried out a survey on dairy products.  We hope that boom will come.  The price of milk has dropped and the sheep industry is in trouble, but that again is due to quantities in the EC and could not be foreseen.  However, more could be done by CBF to market our lamb.  Something could be done also in the breeding area.  In the past few years insufficient attention was paid to the type of ewe or to breeding for which headage payments were made.  As a result the carcasses are not up to standard.  More attention should be paid to that matter.</P>
    <P>Commissioner MacSharry has the full support of the Council of Ministers in the GATT negotiations, as stated in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal,</i> and we wish him well. The Fine Gael Party have tabled this motion of no confidence in Fianna Fáil's agriculture policy.  Five years ago the then Minister and Minister of State had a great deal to say about the severely handicapped and disadvantaged areas. There was ballyhoo from Cork to Donegal about it; meetings were held and promises were made before the 1987 general election.  The scheme sent to Brussels was thrown back in our faces, much valuable time was wasted and hundreds of <Col N="847" /> millions of pounds were lost to the economy and to the farmers.  The Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, and his Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, and the rest of the cabinet had to take up the cudgel and get down to business and get a proper scheme to present to Brussels.  We are all pleased the scheme has been presented and we are hopeful of the outcome.  It will mean a boost to family farm incomes and I believe vast areas will be redesignated severely handicapped.  Areas will be slotted into different categories which I do not want to detail at the moment.</P>
    <P>One could go on and on about farming. Twenty years ago or more the subsidy on ground limestone was greatly appreciated by farmers.  It helped not alone the dairy farmer and all other farmers, but particularly the grain farmer.  The Minister should try to get some assistance from Brussels to reintroduce that subsidy. It would encourage people to improve the fertility of their holdings bringing greater production.  In the future, particularly in grain, competition will be very keen.</P>
    <P>I hope in the near future the EC will do something about the dumping of low cost feed material which has created problems for us.  We have very high quality barley and feed wheat but the quality of products from outside the EC is very low.  There is a problem with New Zealand lamb which affects the lamb trade. All those areas should be examined as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a good job handling many serious matters during the last three years.  He stood up to it well; he worked night and day with his team and I have every confidence that with a united home front, he will succeed in the GATT negotiations.</P>

      <P>I support this motion which is being taken at a time when farming is in crisis.  Agriculture is under threat, and the economy is under threat. This motion is as important as any Bill that has been taken this week.  We had a lot of discussion on the Pensions Bill and on the Broadcasting Bill and tomorrow we will talk on the Insurance Bill but this motion is as important as those Bills and it is time people realised it.</P>
      <P>Agriculture constitutes 10½ per cent of GNP.  If the American proposals in relation to CAP are carried through over the next few years our economy will be devastated.  I cannot understand how Fianna Fáil feel there is no crisis in farm incomes when it has been revealed that this year farm incomes are down by 25 per cent, dairy farm incomes are down by 30 per cent and beef is down by £100 per head on last year's prices.  Dairy farmers are taking £300 less per cow and cereal farmers are in a disastrous situation. Calves are realising £100 less than they did last year.  The situation is serious. It should be recognised that there is an incomes crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> Senator Byrne referred to the disadvantaged areas and mentioned the last extension to disadvantaged areas.  In 1985, Deputy Austin Deasy, as Minister for Agriculture, and Deputy Connaughton, as Minister of State, announced the biggest extension ever to the disadvantaged areas scheme, including in it 5,000 extra farmers; this compares with 3,000 in 1979.  In 1986, the then Minister, Deputy Deasy, doubled the headage scheme payment because of the severe weather and put £13 million into fodder vouchers.  These two measures cost £20 million.  If that amount was now available there would not be any problem with the decision to extend the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister inform the House about the current situation regarding disadvantaged areas?  Ireland has a strong case for extending the areas which the EC classifies as being disadvantaged.  If the case had been put successfully, Ireland would be better off by £1 million each year and 30,000 farmers would be directly affected.</P>
    <P>Obviously the six month Irish Presidency was the best time to push our claim.  This should have been possible as Irish officials completed the file last December and passed the ball to the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, who promptly dropped it.  The Minister should explain why he failed to look after the interests of Irish farmers in Brussels.  The Minister either deliberately let the matter slip or he has no clout in Brussels.  Instead of using the EC Presidency to help small farmers throughout Europe, the Irish Presidency will be remembered for allowing agriculture to take a severe nose dive.</P>
    <P>On 28 March last at a meeting of the IFA in Adare, County Limerick, Paddy Lane stated that the file had been sent to Brussels early in February and that a final decision would have been made by 17 March.  Mr. Lane was very firm on this. He repeated it, and further claimed that payments would be made to the extended areas in 1990.  What happened?  Is it possible or likely that the Minister for Finance put down the boot and deprived the agricultural community and the economy <Col N="850" /> of a considerable input from the EC? I do not believe Mr. Lane deliberately misled the farmers in Limerick.  I would like to know what happened.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take this opportunity to inform the House of the areas submitted to Brussels for consideration for inclusion in the extended areas.  It is important to let the Oireachtas know what is happening.  In Limerick at the moment members of the Minister's party and Fianna Fáil county councillors are telling people in a cloak and dagger fashion that their areas are included in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to this issue I would refer the Minister to statements in <i>The Limerick Leader</i> of 22 May, when an announcement was made regarding the extension of the disadvantaged areas saying that more than 1,000 farmers in east Limerick would be included in the EC disadvantaged areas under proposals finalised by the Government that week. The article went on to state that Deputy O'Dea had confirmed that parishes, which he listed, were to be designated disadvantaged under the proposals to be submitted for sanction to Brussels.  Will the Minister indicate what areas have been submitted to Brussels so that we do not end up with people who chance their arm?  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing we must do is recognise the progress made in agriculture since Fianna Fáil returned to office.  When Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1987 milk was being sold at approximately 80p a gallon.  Last year this figure had increased to approximately £1.05, an increase of 25p or more than 30 per cent.  Farm increases also increased.  No such increases were achieved under the previous administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville referred to the performance of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, but I ask him to contrast Deputy O'Kennedy's performance with that of Deputy Deasy who as Minister was involved in the negotiations on the super-levy.  It is quite clear <Col N="851" /> he sold Irish dairy farmers down the drain.  A special case could have been made for a quota higher than the one negotiated for Irish farmers at that time. I should point out that since Deputy O'Kennedy returned to office the quota has been increased by approximately 24 million gallons.  He increased the quota by 11 million gallons last year.  The Minister has to be complimented for obtaining those increases.</P>
    <P>We are all aware, given world market trends, that prices this year are not as good as those which obtained last year. However, we have to acknowledge the efforts being made by the Minister to alleviate the hardships farmers have had to endure this year.  For the first time, the EC cow premium of £52.43 per cow will be paid in respect of ten cows in dairy farms producing less than 12,800 gallons. In relation to the cattle and beef sector, he negotiated a reduction in the delay in the intervention period from 120 days to 45 days.  He also secured a devaluation of the Green Pound.  These must be recognised as significant achievements.</P>
    <P>In relation to the disadvantaged areas, I have not made any representations for the inclusion of areas in west Limerick. The Minister ordered that a survey be carried out and under it 45,000 farmers were interviewed and six million acres surveyed.  The findings were submitted to Brussels and I am sure farmers will be pleased with the results of the work done by the Minister when an announcement is made by Brussels.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the view adopted by the Labour Party.  Not all that long ago a very important motion was tabled by Senator Dardis in relation to the GATT negotiations which was supported by the Fine Gael Party.  However, the same day the Labour Party tabled a motion in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy.  If it were not for the Common Agricultural Policy we would not have a farmer on the land today. They argued that premiums should be increased but I ask them to bear in mind that there would be no premiums if it were not for the Common Agricultural <Col N="852" /> Policy.  They also suggested that the support mechanisms have added considerably to the cost of food to the consumer.  As I pointed out in the debate on that motion, when farmers do well the economy flourishes.  However, Senator Costello disagrees and seems to be against farmers, even though Senator Upton seems to be speaking for them.</P>
    <P>There was much ballyhoo when former Deputy Ray MacSharry was appointed Commissioner and it was claimed he would not be given a portfolio of significance in the Commission.  Fortunately, he was given one of the most important tasks when he was put in charge of, agriculture.  We should be delighted about this, as since his appointment he has done great work on our behalf.  It should also be noted that he has responsibility for rural development. In this respect, I congratulate the Minister on obtaining FEOGA grants for the food industry, including £2 million for the meat processing sector; £2.9 million for poultry processing; £1 million for horticulture; £200,000 for cereals; £900,000 for livestock marts; £200,000 for dairying; £200,000 for potato storage and £1.3 million for fish processing.</P>
    <P>In connection with the grant for poultry processing, I am delighted that Kantoher Food Products Limited in my area have been given a grant of £439,660 towards the provision of additional poultry processing facilities.  These should prove of immense benefit to poultry producers in west Limerick and surrounding areas and lead to an improvement in the quality of life in that area.  Kerrytree Technology Limited have been granted a sum of £421,071 for the provision of facilities for processing of daffodil flowers and bulbs at Ballyhahill, County Limerick.  We should note each of those achievements.</P>
    <P>We should also acknowledge that increased grants have been made available in an effort to tackle farm pollution which, as we are aware, presents major difficulties in agricultural areas.  The new rates have been increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent in the normal areas and 45 per cent to 55 per cent in the disadvantaged areas with young farmers <Col N="853" /> qualifying for an additional 25 per cent. We must acknowledge those increases which will lead to an improvement in conditions for farmers who will be able to farm in a clean environment with the result that the economy will benefit.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should like to respond to Senator Byrne who outlined the attitude of Fianna Fáil to the motion before the House.  It would appear he did not read the motion which calls on the Government to recognise the serious income crisis affecting thousands of farmers.  Last week we wondered what the outcome of the GATT talks would be and, as expected, the industrial nations considered agricultural subsidies as the most contentious issue.  In relation to funding, total farm support within the EC amounts to 10 billion ECUs whereas in the United States the comparable figure is $500 million.  There is no doubt the next round of trade talks, due to begin on 23 July in Geneva, are very important. Given that transfers account for 5 per cent of our national income is it any wonder we are interested in the GATT negotiations?  If price supports were reduced national income would fall.</P>
      <P>The drop in farm incomes during the last 15 years was frightening and we are justified in using the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; to describe that.  It should also be borne in mind that farm incomes were unsatisfactory long before the GATT negotiations became the flavour of the month.</P>
      <P>We have still the added hardship where thousands of small farmers are struggling on very low incomes.  It is interesting to note that in the last couple of weeks in the Seanad despite dealing with the Broadcasting Bill and the Pension Bill, we found time to debate motions in relation to the GATT talks, the implication of mad cow disease and the problems associated with ERAD.  I hope the general public, particularly the urban community, are not saying that the farmers are again crying wolf.  I am from a rural community and I am always alarmed at the urban-rural divide which is still as obvious as it was in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fall in milk prices has been the <Col N="854" /> talking point for the last number of years. Farming organisations are lobbying for increased milk prices and are calling on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to ensure the proper functioning of the milk price support mechanism.  They want to secure a legally binding commitment from the EC Commission that they will support prices to the maximum extent, and are calling also on the co-ops to seriously consider their reserves to boost temporarily milk prices above market returns.</P>
    <P>Dairy farm incomes, as mentioned by Senator Upton, have fallen by as much as 30 per cent, yet farming experts are projecting a reduction of 40 per cent unless EC milk price support schemes are introduced to prevent future reductions in milk prices.</P>
    <P>The input, fertiliser and machinery costs relating to the beef industry have increased dramatically and so, of course, has borrowing.  The Minister should insist that the beef intervention period is reduced substantially in order to achieve a much needed boost to Irish beef prices. The EC should agree also to the suckler cow premium being available to all dairy farmers.  Other schemes are proposed to boost farm prices &mdash; a 90 day cut in intervention payments which would result in a 3p per gallon milk price increase to suppliers which would be very welcome and a 4p per lb. increase to beef producers; new and improved butter and skim milk utilisation schemes need to be implemented by the Commission to ensure improved market prices and greater confidence in the sector over the following months.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed on reading a reply from the Minister to a question put to him the other day, concerning the proposal from the European Commission to reduce quotas for dairy farmers as a mechanism to reduce butter stocks going into intervention.  When asked for a guarantee that no proposal, such as a reduced milk quota, would be implemented or even considered in the context of a review of the quota in 1992, he gave no guarantee.  From what I can gather there is not a hope of a proposal <Col N="855" /> being considered by the European Commission. At this stage, the Minister for Agriculture and Food should be implored to lobby Mr. Ray MacSharry, EC Commissioner for Agriculture for an EC marketing programme for dairy products to combat the present situation where farmers are experiencing falling returns from the butter market.</P>
    <P>On reflection, the policies of this Government and of the EC have shown a total disregard for the low to middle income farmer, for example, the milk quota structure is loaded against the small producer; he cannot lease or buy extra quota because his wealthy neighbour can outbid him any time; and his bank manager frowns when he wants to borrow money.  He will not lend him money because he has a meagre quota of less than 25,000 gallons and as such he could not make his repayments and the bank manager turns him away.  If a farmer wishes to get his farmyard in line with the new EC directives on pollution and milk hygiene, he would need a win on the national lottery to ensure that he would not go out of business &mdash; so much for Delors' aspiration to retain the social fabric of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>There was a crisis in relation to cereals, to which other Senators referred and gave the various figures, but I will not deal with that issue now because of pressure of time.  In the Slieve Felim area, which is my own area, there are 25 electoral divisions on the Tipperary-Limerick border.  I appeal to the Minister of State to go to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance to ensure that that region would qualify for western development funding in order to arrest the population decline there.  This will not cause any problem because it already qualifies for EC funding for the purposes of roads, electricity, forestry and agri-tourism as well as headage payments. That is a plus if the Minister wants to do something to arrest the fall of the population there.</P>
    <P>My last point relates to women.  They are the forgotten statistic in rural Ireland. They are systematically excluded from <Col N="856" /> official status and I appear for funding within the integrated rural development for women.  If they do not remain in rural Ireland we shall have a desert and it will not matter who has or has not a milk quota because there will be nobody there to use it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to this important motion this evening. Although there are clear differences within the House on the motion before us, there are also large areas on which we agree.  We are all very conscious of the importance of agriculture in this economy.  We know that when farm prices and incomes are under pressure, as they clearly are at the moment, this has important consequences not just for farmers, but for the whole economy.  We are all conscious of the risks that are involved in the current GATT negotiations, and the need to continue to press for an agreement which meets Irish and European needs.</P>
      <P>So, there is much common ground.  In addition, the Government are extremely conscious of the difficulties which farmers are undergoing at present.  It is precisely because of this that the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, has sought and obtained a number of measures at Community level which are designed to mitigate the effect of the fall in EC and world market prices which has occurred from mid-1989 onwards.</P>
      <P>However, before going on to outline what the range of measures which have been taken are, I would like to provide relevant background information to this debate.</P>
      <P>Between 1986 and 1989, aggregate farm incomes, as measured by the CSO increased by 50 per cent in nominal terms and just under 40 per cent in real terms. So, although incomes in 1990 are under pressure, we should acknowledge that the income base upon which this pressure is being exerted was the highest in real terms achieved during the eighties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the same 1986-89 period, the increase in prices, as measured by the <Col N="857" /> consumer price index, was less than 10 per cent, which represents an annual inflation rate over the period of just over 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The overall economic policies which ensured this low rate of inflation are of crucial importance to farmers.  The same sound economic policies also helped to reduce interest rates in 1987 and 1988. Under the influence of external factors, interest rates rose again in 1989, but it is very heartening to see that rates have fallen again and I look forward to further good news on that front later in the year.</P>
    <P>There should be no misunderstanding. A stable macro-economic climate, which can keep inflation and interest rates as low as possible, is one of the main contributions which Government can make to supporting farmers' incomes.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have made the point that the average figure for farm incomes hides a wide variation in incomes within farming.  We all know that this indeed is the case.  In recent years, it is dairy farmers who have done best. Indeed, the high calf prices which dairy farmers received, particularly in 1988 and 1989, obviously put pressure on margins in beef production.  It may be small consolation for dairy farmers, whose income this year is under pressure from a fall in the price of both milk and calves, but it has to be acknowleged that the level of calf prices in 1988 and 1989 were not sustainable.  We are moving back to a more normal set of price relationships between calf, store and finished beef animal, and this is a necessary development for beef producers.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that prices have fallen for milk and calves; they have also fallen for beef and sheep.  This has already been pointed out by a number of Senators.  The reason for these price reductions is that markets for our major-products at EC and world level have changed.  The balance between supply and demand is less favourable in 1990 than it was in 1988 and 1989.  The reasons for this varies by product.  In the case of dairy products and beef, there has been a drop in consumption.  The BSE scare in the UK has reduced beef consumption <Col N="858" /> there by 25 per cent.  In the case of sheep, there has been, as you know, a major increase in supply, both from Ireland and the UK, to the French market.  This extra supply, as well as the weakness in sterling which applied until recently, helped push lamb prices downwards.</P>
    <P>Given that these major market changes occurred, it was inevitable that there would be an impact on prices.  The Government have taken a considerable number of measures which have sought to minimise the price reductions.  Some of these have already been mentioned during this debate.  I will briefly list them.</P>
    <P>In the beef sector &mdash; the sector which has had most difficulty over the past two years &mdash; the Government have consistently made it clear to our Community partners and to the EC Commission the importance of this sector to our whole economy.  When the new EC beef regime was put in place in early 1989, the EC Council of Ministers formally recognised the relative importance of the beef industry to this economy.  It must be acknowledged that the support measures which the EC Commission has introduced since then in the beef sector has kept faith with the recognition.</P>
    <P>In April 1989, carcase intervention was introduced and in the autumn of last year, a significant aids to private storage scheme operated.  In the course of this year, Ireland has been successful in tendering for beef intervention.  During the first full year of operation of the new EC tendering system for beef, Ireland accounted for 47 per cent of the Community total compared to an average of 20 per cent in earlier years.  As part of the EC price agreement for 1990-91, the cut in intervention payment delays from 120 to 45 days was also of importance.</P>
    <P>More recently, the BSE scare in the UK has had a significant effect on beef markets and prices.  Here again, decisive action was taken.  The decision to operate the safety net clause for intervention was vital to stop prices falling further and to restore some confidence to the market. In effect this has meant that since 6 June open intervention has been in place in Ireland and the UK.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> In addition to this, swift action was taken to avoid trade barriers for beef being established within the EC after France announced an import ban on British beef.  The Minister called an emergency meeting of the Agriculture Council on 6 June to deal with the problem and managed to achieve a solution which was acceptable all round.  This ensured that unilateral actions were immediately ended.  It also meant that what could have been a trade crisis in Europe, which extended way beyond agriculture, was headed off.  The resolution of this problem was one of the major achievements of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>There is obvious concern among dairy farmers as milk prices have fallen sharply over the past year.  Let us be clear about the reasons for this.  During 1988 and 1989, world prices for dairy products rose sharply in response to low levels of stocks and relatively tight supply/demand conditions. On the basis of this rising market, the EC reduced certain supports to the dairy sector.  During 1989, consumption of butter and certain other dairy products fell and prices weakened.  Thus, we reached 1990 with lower market prices for our key dairy products and lower EC supports than had been present 12 to 18 months earlier.</P>
    <P>The situation at present is that product markets continue to be weak and there are no immediate signs of improvement. What has changed is the degree of support which the EC is providing to the milk market.  Following representations from Ireland, additional support measures were introduced this year, in the form of higher export refunds for butter and higher aids for butter used in the confectionery industry and in the form of concentrated butter and increased subsidies for the use of skimmed milk powder.  It is also well known that intervention is being extensively used by Irish processors for butter and skimmed milk powder.</P>
    <P>We will continue to press for market support arrangements which will provide an adequate milk price.  In the longer term, the key to an acceptable milk price <Col N="860" /> is not only the level of EC supports but a movement away from excessive dependence on the intervention products of butter and skimmed milk powder.  I accept that this will take time and money. It will have to be accompanied by further rationalisation of our processing and marketing arrangements for milk, but it is the only way to go in the long-term.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in the sheep sector have been referred to by a number of Senators. Again, I accept that there are difficulties but I do not accept that the Government have not been active in trying to solve these difficulties.</P>
    <P>To some extent, the sheep sector represents a problem of success.  There has been a massive growth in sheep numbers in recent years.  Farmers saw an opportunity and responded to it.  I believe that they were right to do so.  The extra numbers have led to additional output and exports.  They have also led to many farmers having a more diversified farming system than they had in the early eighties.  Experience has clearly shown that spreading risk for a farmer by having more than one predominant enterprise can be a very sensible approach.</P>
    <P>We are moving towards a single market for sheep to be achieved by 1993.  The EC market regime which remains until then continues to provide reasonable security for sheep producers.  It is clear that the stabiliser regime for sheep could mean that ewe premia in the coming years could be lower than would otherwise be the case but we will be pressing to ensure that adequate levels of support remain for this sector.  The decisions taken at the EC price fixing in April of this year point in the right direction, when it was decided that prospective reductions in the ewe premium will be compensated from 1991-92 by increased sheep headage payments in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>In addition, the changes in the sheep régime which were agreed last year, provided for a change in the payment arrangements for the ewe premium in 1990.  This will mean that the 1989 premium and two-thirds of the 1990 premium will be paid during the current <Col N="861" /> year.  This should represent an important assistance to the cash flow situation of many farmers.  I am hopeful that the bulk of the ewe premium payments will be made in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the main product areas which are under pressure.  I would now like to move to measures which can broadly be defined as being in the structural area.  A number of these measures which have been put in place under EC policy have the advantage of providing payments directly to farmers.  As the balance between price support and structural measures has changed within the CAP in recent years, the contribution which direct subsidies make to total farm income has increased.  Between 1984 and 1989, using Central Statistics Office figures, the contribution of the net figure for subsidies and levies went from 8 per cent to 11 per cent of aggregate farm income.</P>
    <P>An important part of these subsidies is paid under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  As you know, the Government have submitted a detailed application to the EC Commission seeking agreement to extend the disadvantaged areas.  This would be done by adding new areas to the list of less severely handicapped areas and by designating coastal areas as areas suffering from specific handicaps.  In addition, it is proposed that 1.3 million acres, currently designated as less severely handicapped, would be classified as more severely handicapped and that areas now designated as mountain sheep grazing areas would be reclassified as less severely handicapped areas.  The rates of payment would also be adjusted.  This plan has gone to Brussels.  We are hopeful for a favourable result which in turn will lead to increase in headage payments from 1991 onwards.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the new proposals together with the existing expenditure under the disadvantaged areas scheme will attract 65 per cent Community recoupment when fully implemented and, when account is taken of the abolition this year of the off farm income restriction, total expenditure when the <Col N="862" /> current proposals are fully implemented will increase headage payments from £60 million to £100 million a year.  In addition, the new designated areas will benefit from increased investment aids, exemption from the milk co-responsibility levy and the special supplement to the ewe premium I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The payments under the structural policy of the CAP are just part of a wider reorientation of Community spending &mdash; which fit into the 1992 programme and the increased spending in the less economically advanced parts of the Community. The enlarged EC Structural Funds will be an important part of our national investment in the period up to 1993.  The various operational programmes which will determine how these funds are to be spent are in the course of being approved.  Many of these will have a direct impact on rural areas.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for the control of farmyard pollution has already stimulated significant investment by farmers.  Between 1989 and 1990, an estimated £200 million will be invested by farmers, much of it on pollution control.</P>
    <P>The operational programme on rural development, which will provide support for agri-tourism new enterprises and agricultural training and education will be approved later this year.  In addition, the various operational programmes for infrastructure, industry, human resources will each have a positive impact on economic growth, and will provide in many rural areas additional income and employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Increasingly in the future, everyone, whether at Government or at farm level, will have to become more conscious of looking at the income issue for farmers in a wider context than just what is earned from farming.  As the results of household budget survey clearly show, farm households have diverse sources of income, just as do non-farm households.  It will be one of the challenges of the nineties to expand the range and contribution of these non-farm income sources to farm households.  This is why we need to have a more diversified rural economy and why <Col N="863" /> the increased EC Structural Fund spending should work towards this objective.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to some of the longer-term issues Senators have raised. One of the central issues is the current round of GATT negotiations.  Ireland has strongly supported the Community position in these negotiations, which is being ably directed by Commissioner MacSharry.  We accept that we are working towards lower overall agricultural support levels in all countries in the expectation that this will lead to balanced markets and a more market oriented trading system.</P>
    <P>During the Irish EC Presidency, the Agriculture Council was fully involved in developing and maintaining the Community's negotiating position.  The Council unanimously confirmed the Community's global approach at its meetings in April and June, declared that the basic principles of the CAP were not negotiable and stressed that full credit should be obtained for past reform measures.  The Council also decided that Agricultural Ministers will continue to be involved to the greatest possible extent in the negotiations.  The European solidarity which we were able to bring about through unanimous decisions &mdash; never an easy achievement at the Council of Ministers &mdash; was a major factor in resisting the American demands for elimination of agriculture supports in the EC and the fact is that for the first time ever at the Houston meeting last week the Americans have dropped their demand for elimination of support and have recognised the need for a balanced and global approach which has always been the EC position.  The negotiations can now continue and the contribution of our Presidency will have been seen to have been very significant.</P>
    <P>We will continue to follow the GATT negotiations with great attention, as clearly the outcome of these negotiations is of fundamental national importance. We are prepared to negotiate to achieve a more sensible and coherent world trading order for agriculture.  This would benefit all GATT members.  We are not prepared <Col N="864" /> to negotiate away the principles or mechanisms of the CAP.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators stressed the uncertainty which prevail in agriculture at the moment.  Questions were asked about the future of the milk quota system.  The question was posed as to what is the overall policy towards the agricultural and food sector.</P>
    <P>There are indeed some major uncertainties about the future.  We do not know for certain what will be the future of the milk quota regime.  The Commission is required to produce a report on milk quotas during 1991, with a view to assisting a decision on future policy post 1992. The current Irish view on this issue is that the basic milk quota system will remain, though perhaps in a more flexible form. There are aspects of the beef regime which are also due to be reviewed this year and, of course, the whole sugar regime will be renegotiated over coming months as well.  We would expect that the arrangements for cereals would in any event fall to be revised also.</P>
    <P>At the wider level of policy, the outcome of the GATT negotiations will obviously be of importance.  Even though we cannot predict the precise outcome, we know that there will be lower support and protection levels in the 1990s than applied in the 1970s and 1980s.  Our knowledge of the movement of EC policy points us in this direction anyway.</P>
    <P>So we are somewhat at a policy crossroads. In the light of all of this, the Minister set up a policy review group within the Department in November 1989.  This group have had consultations with a wide spectrum of interests in the industry. They are due to submit their report to the Minister later this year.</P>
    <P>The future is clearly going to be competitive for Irish farmers.  We know that we have the advantages of good quality food, a relatively clean environment and a low cost of production for our major products.  We have opportunities to diversify our rural economy, through tourism and other industry.  It will not be easy to meet the challenges which the nineties will pose for us, but we have no other option than to rise to them.</P>
    <Col N="865" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I compliment the Minister on his detailed response, although I would not agree fully with him.  There are other aspects I would add.  I do think he made a conscientious effort to reply.</P>
      <P>In the four minutes I have, I want to once more quickly identify the problem and then move on to what I would propose as the solution to it.  The problem is obviously that at the moment there is a drop of 20 to 25 per cent in farm incomes. Basically dairy farmers have a £300 per head reduction in their incomes under the heading of dairy cows.  There is a £100 reduction in all cattle prices and it is worth remembering that 65 per cent of farmers have quotas of 20,000 gallons or less.  There is a crisis for farmers in terms of getting credit from financial institutions. There is a crisis of income in their homes and rural depopulation continues. There is a very serious problem.</P>
      <P>To add to what the Minister has said, I would propose that the Government provide low interest loans of 11 per cent for specific purposes, for example, working capital for winter and beef production, cereals and pig production.  That kind of thing is necessary, particularly since no financial institution is willing to lend to farmers at the moment.</P>
      <P>I would propose a greater increase in the headage payment schemes than the welcome ones announced earlier.  I would increase that so that headage would be paid directly to 30,000 small farmers here irrespective of their location.  Increasing the severely handicapped areas and the headage payments would be an important measure of tremendous support from Brussels and it would be an easy method of giving the farmers a real advancement in their situation.</P>
      <P>I would also propose that the Minister speed up the whole payment of farm grants from various Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would propose that small milk producers countrywide would get any additional milk quota that may come on stream and I would propose that there be provided immediately a land authority in the Department of Agriculture to maintain and continue the division of land and <Col N="866" /> of commonages and estates and that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>The last proposal I would make is that the reduction in payment period from 120 to 30 days for intervention beef should be passed on to the producers.  Factories have hijacked this payment to a large degree.</P>
    <P>Those are the things I would add to what the Minister has said.  There is a real crisis.  I honestly believe it will be a very big political issue in the future.  It is right that this House should debate it.  It warrants discussion at all levels.  We face massive rural depopulation, tremendous poverty among small farmers.  I have helped the occasional farmer fill up a grant form and their level of income is quite frightening.  We have to take emergency steps and we have to take them now.  Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh and I would like to thank my colleague, Deputy Naughten, for the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>

How he was able to draft a reply along those lines and stand up here in this House and read it seriously I do not know.  The Minister knows, I know and my colleagues across the Floor know, that everything the Minister said in that document is untrue, false and misleading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I pointed out quite clearly the difficulties in Irish farming.  I pointed out that I believe the farm management survey was being deliberately delayed because it would show a drastic drop in farmers' incomes. That survey was released this afternoon and it confirmed precisely what I said. What I said here the last evening was that farm prices have dropped from 20 to 25 per cent.  The farm survey published today has stated 21 per cent in 1990 and 4 per cent in 1989.  That is a 25 per cent drop over two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet, our colleagues on the far side of the House come in with an amendment that commends the Government on the <Col N="867" /> measures they have taken during 1990 to maintain farm incomes in the face of the unfavourable market conditions which prevail.  Is there any other sector of the community that would tolerate their incomes dropping by 25 per cent?  Then we have Members standing up in this House and justifying that.  I am absolutely stunned that the honourable Members across the floor put in this motion and signed their names to it.  Do they realise what is happening throughout rural Ireland where family farms are being put up for sale, families are emigrating to England and America, and farm families are leaving and coming to live in Dublin simply because they can no longer meet their repayments.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the survey out today that not alone has this disastrous situation affected farmers throughout the country but it has, to a greater degree, affected farmers in the west whose income dropped by 7 per cent last year.  The income for people in the rest of the country dropped by 2 per cent and the average drop worked out at 4 per cent.  Am I living on the same island as the people across the floor?  How can they justify that?  I thank the Minister of State for coming in here and listening very attentively to the debate but I wonder where is the Minister? We have had no apology for his absence.  He has treated this Chamber with contempt by not coming here for this very important debate.  Have we forgotten that agricultural exports account for 25 per cent of our total exports?  Have we forgotten the huge section of the community who depend on agriculture for a livelihood, either directly or indirectly, and yet the Minister for Agriculture and Food has treated this House with contempt by not coming in here to listen to the debate.  It is a deplorable situation; it must be regretted and one I wish to place on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>I appeal to my colleagues on the far side of the House to take the only honourable course open and withdraw this amendment and allow our very reasoned motion to go through.  We have called on the Government to recognise the serious <Col N="868" /> income crisis affecting thousands of Irish farmers but not one speaker has recognised that problem.  The figures from Teagasc indicate that farm incomes droped by 4 per cent in 1989 and are projected to fall by 20 per cent in 1990. We have stated that and we have asked the Government to implement measures to alleviate this present income crisis in sheep, beef, milk, cereals and horticulture, an area very close to the heart of the Minister of State.  It does not matter what line of farming you take at present, farm incomes have slumped. Yet we have a Government sitting back and paying no heed.  I cannot understand why the Government representatives from rural Ireland who know this problem at first hand will allow the Government to stand idly by and allow a generation to be pushed from the land, because that is what we are facing.  The real crunch has not come yet.  Wait until loans are due to be paid in September and October and people will not have the money to pay them.  Banks are not going to be as tolerant on this occasion as they were on previous occasions.  Interest rates are too high at 17 per cent and no farm enterprise can justify borrowing at present.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to outline his policy and his Department's policy to a young man handed 100 acres of land from his father.  What line of produce will they advise him to get into?  There is no answer to the question because the Minister knows, I know, and everybody else in this House knows that there is no line of farming he can go into today that will justify borrowing.  A person without stock will remain without stock because the income derived from that source will not justify borrowing.  I cannot understand why the Government will not recognise the problem and set about trying to come to grips with it and alleviate the hardship.</P>
    <P>I did not come in here last week abusing or criticising the Minister.  I pointed out very clearly what was wrong in regard to the huge drop in sheep prices and a drop of £100 per animal in beef prices. That drop is worse when one talks about <Col N="869" /> the stores.  I pointed out that lamb prices were 84p per lb. during the first week of July this year; they were £1.10 per lb. last year.  I pointed out that wool is 30p per lb. this year but it was 72p per lb. last year.  I said what was wrong and then I went on to point out to the Minister what I felt could alleviate the problem.  I pointed out that the first thing we need is a guaranteed market price for cattle next spring because if we do not have that, after the two very bad years that winter feeders have had, there will be no one buying store cattle this year because there will be no money to buy them.  I pointed out that it was vitally important that we got low interest loans, that money could be borrowed in Europe and lent here at 11 per cent instead of 17 per cent. These are two very important factors that would cost very little.</P>
    <P>I further pointed out I could not understand why something was not being done to market our mutton which is being dumped at 10p per lb.  CBF made no effort to market it and perhaps that was because of a cut in their budget last year of 50 per cent.  We are entitled to answers but we have got none.  Again, I pointed out to the Minister the three areas where we could create a massive number of jobs as well as getting a foundation for the cattle, sheep and wool industries.  We should try to do something to process our hide skins, but we have done nothing. There should be co-ordinated Government effort, together with the IDA and the National Development Corporation, to ensure that industries like these get on the market.  All of those measures would be a major help to the agricultural industry as well as creating vital jobs.</P>
    <P>I further pointed out that there should be a scheme providing for aid for private storage to take some of the lamb off the market in the crucial months of July, August and September.  If we are not able to get some of that lamb glut off the market, things will get worse.  That was one scheme that could have been introduced without great cost.  The French pressed for this at the last meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which we were chairing but we gave them very <Col N="870" /> little support.  It is a reflection on the Irish Government that they did not get in behind the French and look for a scheme providing for aid for private storage of lamb.  That was not done and we stand condemned for that.  There is a lot more an Irish Agriculture Commissioner could do for our agriculture.  It was a pity that during the six months we had the chair of the Council of Ministers with an Irish Agriculture Commissioner we did not do more to alleviate the crisis in Irish agriculture that was evident at that time.</P>
    <P>I pointed out another scheme which could be introduced with a stroke of a pen which would only cost 35 per cent of what the farmer would get &mdash; I was talking about headage payments.  We could be paying twice as much headage payments as we are paying.  It is 65 per cent subsidised from Europe.  We were told that in 1992 we would get more by way of income subsidies rather than in price support.  Here was one way the Government, with a stroke of a pen, could have increased the headage payments but they have done nothing about it.  We have submitted a proposal to Europe to have disadvantaged areas reclassified as severely handicapped which would allow headage payments to be paid.  That proposal was first put in 1987.  There were some technicalities and it came back but it was not pushed and as a result here we are in 1990 and the areas are still not reclassified.  That means a loss of income to the farming community and particularly to the farmers along the west coast. Some Senators here know what I am talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the question of the payment of those subsidies.  I cannot understand why the application forms for headage payments only came out three weeks ago.  They should have been out last March and readings should be carried out all summer.  They had to be returned by last Friday and readings will not begin until August and, as a result, farmers will not be able to sell <Col N="871" /> cattle.  Why cannot that be done right?  I further pointed out to the Minister that he should now make a statement that he would accept mart dockets, and factory dockets on the sale of cattle where the subsidy was applied for but where a reading had not been taken.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to do something along those lines.  If he would accept those documents it would mean the orderly marketing of cattle and it would not mean a backlog at the end of the year.  I regret the type of reply we have got here tonight; it displayed a dismissive attitude and it failed to recognise the problem.  The trouble is that we do not recognise the problems in Irish agriculture when they arise and when we <Col N="872" /> try to do something about them it is too late.  We have a stop-go policy in relation to agriculture.  If a senior officer in the Department of Agriculture and Food was asked tomorrow morning about the policy for Irish farming he would not be able to give an answer because we do not know whether we are coming or going.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;advertisement&rsquo; means a purchased radio insert or a purchased moving television insert but does not include any of the following:</P>
      <P>(i)  announcements regarding other programmes or services, provided or to be provided by the Authority,</P>
      <P>(ii)  promotional material for charitable, philanthropic or voluntary bodies charged for at a special rate,</P>
      <P>(iii)  passing references to a sponsor of a programme within programmes or programme interludes,</P>
      <P>(iv)  any coverage of a sporting or other public event where promotional hoardings are a feature of the event,</P>
      <P>(v)  giveway gifts or prizes which are donated and which in any particular case are not a frequent occurrence in the same programme;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to make a long speech on this amendment.  The provisions speak for themselves.  Our basic objective is to protect advertising for charitable organisations, and so on, and to make sure it does not become part of the quota which in essence we object to anyway, but that is another discussion.  I urge the Minister to accept this as a very reasonable amendment. I think it is not contentious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator O'Reilly in asking the Minister to accept these exclusions from the definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;. It is very important that various charitable and philanthropic voluntary bodies should be able to advertise at a special rate.  If not, they will be unable to do their work and fulfil their functions which can be very much in the interests of the whole community.  It is important also that passing references be excluded <Col N="875" /> from advertising.  That perhaps raises the matter of the definition of a passing reference, but if one is to home in on things like passing references, we are into nit picking and I do not think that is desirable.</P>
      <P>For these reasons and in the hope that the Minister will accept this amendment let me say I think it is reasonable and sensible.  I urge him to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke) Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>This question came up on Second Stage and we had an extensive discussion on whether we should have a definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;.  I remain convinced that it is preferable not to have one because of the dangers of putting ourselves into a straitjacket in an area which needs some flexibility.  The areas where the proposed definitions would have an impact would be in relation to section 3 (1) dealing with time limits for advertising on RTE services and section 4 dealing with codes of practice for advertising.</P>
      <P>In the first place the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; or &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; has appeared in broadcasting legislation on various occasions over the past 30 years.  It has never been considered necessary to give it a formal legal definition for the purpose of that legislation.  In other words, its general, common-sense meaning has proved adequate heretofore and I have heard no persuasive reasons either in the other House or here to depart from that position.</P>

    <P>Most of the real issues which the definition seeks to exclude from the term &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; or &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; in so far as they arise at all can be better dealt with in the codes of practice provisions. For instance, the first element which the definition seeks to exclude is announcements regarding other programmes or services.  Already one is into an area of ambiguity with the definition because it makes no distinction between what one might call informational and promotional announcements.  It is totally proper and acceptable that a radio or TV service <Col N="876" /> should give informational announcements, for example about upcoming programmes. There is no way such announcements would have been perceived as advertisements <i>per se.</i>  To the extent that the issue has now been raised it will be a simple matter to make this clear in the code of practice relating to advertising.</P>
    <P>The next item the definition seeks to deal with is charity advertising.  Basically, it is proposed to exempt such advertising from the definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;. There is clearly a misunderstanding as to how RTE treat such advertising, and I spoke about this in my closing speech on Second Stage.  The first point to make is the special discounts for charity advertising only applied to RTE's radio services and even then RTE only allow a maximum of seven minutes discounted charity advertising per day.  Charity advertising on the TV service is charged at the appropriate full commercial rate. The only exception is where special appeals are associated with major emergencies or disasters when the advertising is allowed free of charge.  What I have done to accommodate RTE's existing practice, is to increase the maximum amount of advertising allowed per hour from my originally proposed four minutes 30 seconds to five minutes per hour.  This will be more than adequate to allow RTE to continue to offer their maximum of seven minutes discount charity advertising per day.  It is important to remember in relation to the increase from four-and-a-half minutes to five minutes that I had also had discussions with Congress in relation to their view that they wanted to increase minutage.  It was with that in mind that I increased the time.  It will be five minutes per hour on all of RTE's services, not just five minutes per hour overall, but five minutes per hour on RTE Radio 1 and 2FM.  It will be five minutes on RTE1 and on Network 2.  They will have overall an increase in advertising. The concession of the extra half minute is equivalent in current value terms to almost £2 million advertising revenue per annum.  It should ensure that RTE will reach the advertising cap limit without <Col N="877" /> having to introduce unduly excessive increases in their advertising rates.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (iii) of the amendment refers to passing references to a sponsor on a sponsored programme.  What is a passing reference?  It is too vague a provision for definition.  I suggest that we leave it to the code of practice.  The question of gifts or prizes on programmes is also better left to the code of practice. It is not the intention to prohibit the acceptance of such gifts but we want to ensure that as far as possible they do not constitute surreptitious advertising.  The objection to this kind of occurrence does not relate to giving necessary information about a prize but to extolling its particular qualities and brand image in a manner which constitutes advertising, bearing in mind the principle accepted by all broadcasters &mdash; which in any event becomes mandatory under an EC Directive on broadcasting activities &mdash; of the separation of programme matter from advertising.</P>
    <P>I hope I have put forward sufficient reasons to illustrate why a definition along the lines proposed is unnecessary and would create more ambiguities than it would solve.  I accept the good faith of the Senators in putting forward the amendment but the best way forward is to go with the years of experience and practice that RTE have, together with the new IRTC, and allow the definition to be catered for in the code of practice and in the day-to-day operation rather than, as the amendment would unwittingly do, impose a straitjacket.  The acceptance of the amendment would put RTE, and others, into a straitjacket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister changed four and a half minutes to five minutes.  Paragraph (ii) of the amendment refers to promotional material for charitable, philanthropic or voluntary bodies being charged at a special rate.  If an industrialist wants to advertise he does research and realises that many people for instance will be in the kitchen and will not see his advertisement.  The charitable organisations are not in a position to carry out that sort of research and they could <Col N="878" /> not be considered to be in equal competition with industrialists.  That is why the Minister should make a concession in relation to charitable organisations. Charitable organisations will be at a disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> industrialists.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>My party have a fundamental objection to the Bill which I dealt with at great length on Second Stage.  I will not go into detail again other than to say that we fundamentally oppose the concept of capping of advertising in this way.  We would have been relieved had this amendment been accepted.  We have no option but to press this amendment. We cannot accept the Minister's explanation.  We are genuinely concerned about charitable organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Harte said, that charitable organisations will not be competing on an equal basis with commercial groups who have the back-up of comprehensive and elaborate research facilities.  Charitable organisations will not have that type of support when they are placing advertisements and, accordingly, will not be able to advertise as wisely or as competitively as commercial bodies.  They will not be competing on the level playing pitch about which we have all been hearing. Indeed, we must take a trip to see this level playing pitch some time.</P>
      <P>The extra half minute for advertising is equal to about £2 million a year in revenue.  It seems to be taken that RTE will use that £2 million of advertising revenue commercially to maximise their income and when they do that, it will mean that the various charitable organisations who might have hoped to get some advertising at reduced rates will not have a chance.  For those reasons, I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the definition of advertising in this amendment, what is important is not so much what is in the definition as what is excluded from the definition.  That is the whole burden of <Col N="879" /> this amendment and that is primarily where the concern is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extra half minute in relation to charities.  That is roughly an extra 300 hours per year which is an enormous amount of time as can be shown by anyone selling time in the communications business.  Taking RTE Radio 1 and 2FM it will be an extra 24 minutes per day for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this change. From my calculations, the reduction is about 35 per cent of the normal advertising time for charitable organisations.  I do not agree with Senator Harte who suggested that charitable organisations would not be beaming in at prime time. We should congratulate the charitable organisations we hear every weekend advertising collections after Masses. Those advertisements, as far as I can see, are put out at prime time.  The marketing operation of some of the well-organised charities is equal to that of some of the most sophisticated organisations anywhere in Europe.  In relation to the gifts or incentives, as they are called in the industry, I saw in a Sunday newspaper that a car was being given away.</P>

      <P>As a result of the Minister's proposals, RTE's income will be reduced by between £10 and £12 million. This, in turn, will result in each department of RTE being put under pressure. In making readjustments RTE will look at everything.  The Irish Cancer Society state that at the moment they spend £26,000 per annum on radio advertisements but that this figure will increase to £132,000 if they are charged commercial rates.  RTE will be under so much pressure they will have no choice but to charge commercial rates.  In fact the voluntary organisations to whom Senator Mooney referred earlier today will also be put under pressure and will be forced to defend themselves.  Because of this, it is clear the Minister's proposals will have a devastating effect on all charitable institutions. It is important that we protect them and the way to do this is for the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed.  That is my view and it continues to be my view given the comments the Senator has just made. We should be clear on one point.  We will discuss that item when we reach sections 2 and 3.  Therefore, I will put on hold the comments I wish to make on that aspect until we reach those sections.</P>
      <P>In relation to paragraph (i) of the amendment, does the Minister envisage that that aspect will be covered in the code?  In other words, will the code of practice make reference to &ldquo;announcements regarding other programmes or services, provided or to be provided by the Authority&rdquo;?  I am in agreement with the Minister on this aspect.  I do not think there is a great need to define every word in the Bill but I need to be clear about it. If this is considered to be a major issue, it might be necessary to include a definition in the Bill.  When BBC TV close down each evening they invariably announce that Radio 2 or Radio 4 will continue until 6 a.m.  Would the Minister indicate whether announcements like that will be counted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated the time limit will apply to all the services provided by RTE, including radio and television services.  I am not sure what relevance should be attached to that.  Is the Minister <Col N="882" /> saying that, for instance, if RTE broadcast for ten hours on any one day the number of minutes prescribed per hour will be multiplied by ten?  It is my understanding RTE may not exceed the maximum figure prescribed during any one hour.</P>
    <P>By any definition, advertisements have to be paid for.  Is the Minister of the view for instance, that for it to come within the definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo;, revenue would have to be created?  That is an important issue.  When watching television programmes I find it offensive that product after product is plugged.  I agree with the Minister when he says there is a need to exercise control.  There has been abuse and I have no difficulty in saying this.  Indeed, I have made this point to people in RTE.  I disagree with the view expressed on the other side of the House that RTE are whinging.  RTE have been fighting back and will use every means at their disposal.  Some people do not like the way they are fighting back, but this may mean they are more effective than they would have been if they had gone about it the nice way.</P>
    <P>Passing references have been made to sponsor events, for example, the Whit-bread Gold Cup or the Hennessy Gold Cup.  We should be realistic about this matter; such sponsorship cannot be counted, unless somebody is going to use a stop watch.  I ask the Minister to clarify the matter because if a definition is not included, the Authority will be able to plug their own services and programmes whenever they want.  I would like to hear the Minister's response before deciding to take the matter any further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to respond to the point made by Senator Harte on paragraph (i) of his amendment which reads &ldquo;promotional material for charitable, philanthropic or voluntary bodies charged for at a special rate&rdquo;. Senator Harte made reference to the times people watch television.  In relation to television no concession rates are available at the moment.  The only concession made is that concession rates are available on radio for seven minutes a day <Col N="883" /> maximum.  I want to assure Senator Neville I was very much taken by the argument put forward by the Irish Cancer Society who expressed concern about the future of the seven minute concession rate.  It was in response to this concern and the concern expressed by the ICTU that the decision was taken to extend the time from four and a half to five minutes. Given that RTE have a public service mandate and have available to them <i>in toto</i> the moneys raised by way of the licence fee, a strong case can be made for making available free of charge advertising time or space to registered charities. They are given one slot, the traditional slot, on a Sunday evening at about 6.25 p.m. just before the 6.30 news programme to make a weekly appeal.</P>
      <P>That slot has always been there and is free.  There is a very strong case to be made, even within the seven minutes, for asking the State organisation with access to the licence fee to offer to the registeered charities a concession in relation to announcements rather than paid advertising rates.  These societies and charities are doing excellent work and they deserve greater support than this one slot a week.  In an emergency appeal for some tragedy, such as an earthquake or famine, RTE give time free of charge. I see no reason they cannot carry notices for registered charities through their public service work.  I am not saying they should do it all day every day, I am not even saying they should do it for the seven minutes, but they could provide a certain number of minutes as a public service announcement, rather than as a paid advertisement.  Having made that point, I believe it should be done free of charge.  The extra minutage I have given them resulting from the debates that have taken place in the Dáil and the response I have given to the Cancer Society and the other societies that have been in touch, is reasonable.  The charitable organisations have made a combined single approach for consideration and I have given them a reasonable response on the increased minutage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely referred to other <Col N="884" /> incomes of RTE.  This Bill does present RTE with a challenge but never before have they failed to respond to a challenge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senators cast their minds back to the mid-seventies, they will recall that the cabling of homes was started. This provided good quality BBC and UTV reception.  RTE said that would create major difficulties for them; they would not be able to respond to the challenge presented by BBC because of the amount of funds available to them and UTV through the ITV and ITN networks. It was felt that this would present a major challenge and could wipe out RTE television, but RTE fought back and came forward with good programming the people wanted to watch.  During the debate on the 1988 legislation on whether we should have an alternative radio system &mdash; local radio or national radio &mdash; RTE's response was that they could not tackle it.  Through their lobbying and their influence within the Labour Party &mdash; quite legitimately and with an ideological point of view &mdash; they stopped the 1985 Bill of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition because it did not leave sufficient space for RTE to get involved in local radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what happened. That is the reality.  If that is what the Dáil debate was all about, that is quite legitimate.  RTE fought against that Bill and said they could not take on the competition. RTE are quite capable of taking on competition.</P>
      <P>I wrote to Mr. Peter Cassells, General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who raised the point that was raised by Senator Kiely, in relation to RTE's commercial enterprise and the potential income from RTE's commercial enterprise.  In a letter to him I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> I wish to stress that it was never intended or proposed that income from RTE's commercial enterprise unit would be taken into account in determining the limit on advertising revenue being set in the Bill.  The establishment of this unit was a decision of which I was fully supportive and I would be keen to see it develop and expand so as to maximise revenue from both existing and new activities.</P>
    <P>This is an area which has been recognised only recently by RTE.  The potential they have for selling their own excellent programmes &mdash; as BBC have done through their enterprise unit and as the ITV network do as well &mdash; is vast.  They should put their resources into that area now.</P>
    <P>The question of gifts was raised by Senator Cassidy and referred to by Senator O'Toole.  I have no objection whatsoever to the idea of giving away a car, or a holiday &mdash; it is good for programming &mdash; but what I do object to, and I have said this already, is the presenter standing beside a car as if it was in a showroom with flashing lights and the theme music which goes with its normal advertising, and it is promoted by the presenter in a way that can be misleading by linking his name while agreeing to every word of the promotional blurb of the producing or manufacturing company. That is wrong.  RTE in their voluntary code of practice agree that it is wrong, but it happens regularly.  It is something that should be looked at in the context of a mandatory code of practice. It is in the voluntary code of practice but it is honoured more in the breach than in the observance.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole made a passing reference to the Carroll's Irish Open, the Whitbread Around the World race, or other events, but obviously, that does not count as advertising.  That is part of the event and will not count as revenue.  As far as advertising is concerned it does count because advertising has to create a revenue, otherwise it is not advertising.</P>
    <P>As far as the cross advertising of services is concerned it is totally proper and <Col N="886" /> acceptable that a radio or television service should give information on announcements about upcoming programmes and there is no way such announcements would have been perceived as advertisements <i>per se.</i>  To the extent that the issue has been raised, it will be a simple matter to make this clear in a code of practice relating to advertising. That is the situation.</P>

      <P>The <i>RTE Guide</i> is a very successful, commercial operation in competition with other publications in the news industry, in the newspaper industry and in other industries and there is no reason they should not pay for and have their time counted as advertising. Cross promotion from radio to television, television to radio, has to be looked at in the context of advertising.  There is nothing wrong with RTE 2 or 2FM advertising any of their services.  There is nothing on television or Radio 1 for them but when they go from one service to the other, that will be taken as advertising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not paid for in advertising their own services &mdash; in relation to the <i>RTE Guide</i>, so that I can be clear on this &mdash; they will have to take the <i>RTE Guide</i> into account as if it were being paid for; it should be the appropriate <i>RTE Guide</i> rate for the amount of time used and which will have to be taken into account in their advertising.</P>
      <P>That is as far as I can go on the questions raised.  I have endeavoured to be as open and frank as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While referring to the <i>RTE Guide</i> I should say that one area of this overall legislation which has not been examined is that of its benefit to the newspaper industry.  We have a newspaper industry of which we should be proud &mdash; it regularly does not support my point of view on given issues &mdash; but it is important <Col N="887" /> that we have a strong newspaper or print media sector here.  It has to be said that for a long time that sector has suffered from unfair competition by way of advertising from RTE.  This Bill and its provisions &mdash; as well as helping the electronics media in the plurality I am seeking in relation to the national, independent local and community radios around the country and the television company &mdash; will also be a major help to the print media, one example of that being the <i>RTE Guide.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify for us what is the rationale for preventing, say, 2FM announcing a television programme of that evening on the other channel &mdash; advertising a good television programme?  I cannot see the rationale for including that in this Bill. Perhaps the Minister could explain to the House what is involved there.</P>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's remarks about the newspapers that he will be accepting our amendment later with regard to VAT as it applies to the newspaper industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a specific question. I gave an example of BBC, when finishing their television service at night, regularly promoting radio programmes that will be transmitted later that night. I received a specific answer from the Minister with regard to the <i>RTE Guide.</i>  I disagree with him but I am absolutely clear in regard to it.  The reason I disagree with it is that the concept of synergy between related companies within a multi-company is a well known one in industry. It is well known that the resources available to the group of companies are deployed or disbursed between each of the companies within the family.  I see no reason that could not be done in the case of the <i>RTE Guide.</i>  The idea is that it would generate as much revenue as possible. However, that is a point of view on which the Minister and I clearly differ. The amendment does not appear to cover that issue.  I do not want to waste the time of the House attempting to deal with it. <Col N="888" /> The Minister has given me a clear answer, which was what I sought.</P>
      <P>I am not clear as to whether, if RTE are promoting a radio programme or <i>vice versa</i>&mdash; nowadays with simultaneous broadcasting when the criss-cross between them becomes more interlinked; certainly RTE transmit a number of programmes when there is simultaneous transmission on radio and television &mdash; such circumstances could well lead to a fudged position.  Let us suppose that an RTE announcer says: we are now ceasing our coverage of the Horse Show but it will continue on Network 2; that is a promotion for Network 2.  I know I have used an extreme example but that is how outlandish the whole issue could become if that has to be counted as advertising. Another regular occurrence is that there is now, let us say, a documentary presentation and later on in the same evening, on the other channel, there will be a number of experts assessing the merits of that programme, discussing it. They are related programmes on two different channels.  I know I have given fudged examples.</P>
      <P>I want to revert to the clearer example because that is where the difficulty could arise.  Let us suppose a continuity announcer says: from 12 o'clock on there will be, say, programmes, X, Y and Z, when the other stations will have been promoted, either the other television channel or radio as the case may be.  My direct question to the Minister is: is that considered to be advertising?  There was a slight conflict in the Minister's presentation. The Minister made it clear to me &mdash; and I was quite happy &mdash; that in order to be regarded as an advertisement it would have to generate revenue for the station.  Therefore I thought that such publications as the <i>RTE Guide</i> would not generate revenue for the station and, therefore, could not be deemed to be an advertisement.  The Minister has disabused me of that idea by saying that that would not be allowed.</P>
      <P>I want to be quite clear in regard to the criss-cross between radio and television.</P>

      <P>I will endeavour to clarify <Col N="889" /> it for the Senator.  This takes me back to the overall objection to the amendment before us, that is the problem of strait-jacketing ourselves into this legislation, that we have not got the flexibility I believe to be essential in relation to the operation of its provisions by way of the code of practice.  The Senator gave the example himself of an RTE announcer saying: we are now going off the air on this channel but X, Y or Z programme will be transmitted later.  That is a straight informational announcement rather than a big promotion.</P>
      <P>A practice that has become a feature of the services, as such, is that, let us say, RTE Radio 1 run an advertisement on television on the basis of their being number one in the country and so on, which may continue for 30 seconds or a minute, not by way of information in relation to programming but rather an advertisement for the concept of Radio 1 as opposed to information about a specific programme or programmes, saying that programme X will be transmitted at such and such a time.  There is that major difference between them.</P>

      <P>That is why I am saying: let us not tie ourselves into a straitjacket. Let us remain within the code of practice so that we can make the provisions of this Bill operate effectively.  The idea behind it is to ensure that we do not run into the type of promotional criss-crossing to which I referred &mdash; the set piece advertisement, as such, which may run for 15 or 30 seconds, or a minute &mdash; in direct competition with other services.</P>

      <P>In the course of my remarks on Second Stage I mentioned the <i>RTE Guide</i>, a weekly magazine sold <Col N="890" /> right across the country, one of the most popular magazines, yielding a fair share of revenue.  It is also an extremely good magazine in which to advertise.  I do not see any problem in that respect.  I had been expecting that that magazine would have been covered by the provisions of this Bill in relation to advertising.</P>
      <P>The other example of how extra revenue can be generated was covered by a number of Senators today and would be a tremendous example for, say, BBC enterprises or ITV enterprises.  In fairness I should say that RTE have started their enterprises commercial unit in their archives &ldquo;Treasures of Gold&rdquo;.  In the commercial world, which much revenue can be generated, to say the least £10 million could be generated annually by way of promoting this archival material. The video is the fastest growing industry in the area of communications.  RTE have, to their credit, preserved an enormous reserve of very high quality product which they can bring on stream.  We saw examples of it in the form of a particular &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; tribute which had thousands and thousands of sales.  That is one way of generating extra income.</P>
      <P>Another way of generating extra income is by Atlantic 252.  In reply to Second Stage the Minister told us that he is allowing an additional 20 per cent on advertising for that.  The amount of good that could be done for this country in the context of tourism, apart from the revenue, is mind boggling.  The airwaves going right into England are available with 58 million people out there to be targeted.</P>
      <P>What was not touched upon in relation to advertising was the quality of advertising in relation to drink.  I believe it is wrong to glorify drink in radio and television advertising as part and parcel of the daily intake of liquid into the human system.</P>

I would like to ask the Senator would RTE1 be likely to recommend, when going off the air, that people should listen to Kerry Radio?  Would they do that free of charge for the people of Kerry?  We are talking about fair competition and about the magazine and so forth.  RTE have plenty of latitude all along the line. Would RTE suggest to their viewers that they should turn on all of the independent stations all over the country which are now licensed?</P>

      <P>I am sure they will carry that statement as well.  I thought it was an independent radio.  I would like to ask a specific question.  It is important to get these statements from the Minister on <Col N="892" /> the record of the House in terms of other discussions.  I accept that the Minister has made every effort to clarify it.  He has explained what would be unacceptable and has given me the moving picture side, the corporate image promotion of one service by another.  I would accept that is an advertisement by any standards.  I disagree that they should not be able to do it, but at least we know where we are going on it.  What I was talking about is where there is a still shot with a voice over making a particular announcement. I want to know what the Minister would say about that.  I hope what I am talking about is clear.  I am talking about a still shot, without moving pictures, with the title of the programme and a voice over from continuity saying this is what will be dealt with.  That is something that is done all the time on BBC1 and BBC2.  They have their timetables scheduled in such a way that their programmes are coterminous in the sense that they begin programmes at the same time, and invariably one station is promoted by the other at every single change of programme. It goes on all the time and is accepted practice and it is done in most places where they have a double service.</P>
      <P>I want to answer Senator Kiely's point about why it would not be appropriate for RTE to finish up the evening by suggesting their viewers should turn over to a competing station.  It is for the simple reason that the competing station would be a competitor in the marketplace.  Why would RTE be giving a gee-up to a competitor in the marketplace?  The point I am making is that they should be allowed, like any group of companies, to support each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have just referred to is synergy, no more than that.  I am not trying to pull the wool over anybody's eyes here.  I am saying that there we have a company, RTE, with a number of different services, who can use the total infrastructure to promote all their services.  The Minister has said where he differs from me on those issues and I accept that he has made it quite clear.  However I want to pin it down because I am not clear about the <Col N="893" /> difference between what is informational, what is promotional and what is advertisement.  I would also, as I said, like the Minister's comments on the example of a still shot with a voice over from continuity promoting, telling us or informing us &mdash; I am not sure what word the Minister wants to use &mdash; about something that will take place later on on the other channel or on the other service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The more the Senator teases this out the more he makes my case on flexibility in the Bill in relation to what is meant by advertising and why I put more and more emphasis on section 4, the codes of practice relating to advertising and other commercial promotions. Section 4 (1) says:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall draw up and may amend, from time to time as he thinks proper, codes governing standards, practice and prohibitions in advertising, sponsorship or other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasting services and the Authority, every sound broadcasting contractor and the television programme service contractor shall comply with every such code in relation to its broadcasting services.</P>
      <P>Many of the things the Senator has raised are specific detailed queries that are dealt with in a sensible way by the RTE Authority at the moment under their code of practice.  Section 4 (3) says that the Minister shall consult the Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission in drawing up or amending a code under subsection (1).  The points being raised by the Senator are classic points to be argued and debated during the consultation process in relation to what is to be included and what is to be excluded, and they will be decided in consultation with the RTE Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission when deciding what is to be the statutory code of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the consultation is clear.  The IRTC will invariably state that they do not think <Col N="894" /> RTE should be allowed to promote one service via the other and the RTE Authority will say they think they should be allowed.  As I said in my first contribution, I would prefer to go along without a definition on advertising if we could do that.  The more we hear of it, however, the more worried I become.  I would like the Act to be specific and for the Minister to indicate what his view is because the consultation will be quite clear on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given my view as far as I possibly can and I have tried to define it and be as precise as I possibly can, much more so in this debate.  We did not get into it in as much detail in this form in the lower House.  I have defined it as far as I possibly can in relation to the <i>RTE Guide</i>, corporate advertising and the general announcements.  I have teased it out as far as I can go at this stage.  I do not want to be unhelpful to the House, but I believe that to go further in the definition would subvert the whole intention of the consultation process provided in section 4.  I cannot be of any further guidance to Senators in making a decision to vote for or against amendment No. 1.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to what has been said but there is a fundamental difference which the Minister, with all due respect, has not addressed, that there is only one broadcasting organisation in the country which will have two television channels and two radio stations.  The House is entitled to know the Minister's thinking when he comes to adjudicating on the conflicting views of the IRTC, which will be batting for a whole lot of stations, none of which are commercially linked, and RTE who have two television channels and two radio stations, together with Cork Local Radio and Raidió na Gaeltachta.  Why should anybody reading this Bill believe anything other than that the Minister is going to load the dice more firmly against RTE when he draws up his code of practice? If an independent person is drawing up this much lauded code of practice, <Col N="895" /> which is an interesting idea, what reason have we or anybody else to believe that it will not be loaded against the one organisation who have an interest in inter-promotion between their various broadcasting groups?  That is the issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister has talked at great length about the complexities of it and we appreciate them and, perhaps, the amendment has its flaws, but that is not the critical issue.  The critical issue is why should we, or the Irish public, believe that the Minister will give a favourable hearing to the view of the one organisation who have good commercial reasons to do inter-promotion; in other words, to maximise the viewing or listening audience of the organisation.  That is the crux of the issue, because the Bill is not about advertising, it is about reducing the audience that RTE have and increasing the audience of other stations.  All the other things are side issues.  What criteria will the Minister use that will not effectively, and invariably, end up with RTE being penalised further because they are the only ones who could be accused of any co-promotion between their various radio and television services?  That is the crux of the issue and the Minister has not addressed it.</P>

All the others have only one, and, bearing in mind his eternally unforgettable phrase about levelling the playing pitch, what is he going to do?  Does he mean that the code of practice is going to be one that will restrict RTE's opportunities to promote their own broadcasting services?  Is that what this is all about?  The Minister can talk forever and shrug his shoulders but the reality is that there is only one organisation who can suffer from his code of practice and they are RTE.</P>

      <P>I want to make a couple of points in support of our amendment. As I pointed out on Second Stage and on amendment No. 1, the Bill is unacceptable on all the grounds we outlined. We are now seeking, as a last ditch stand to bring some sanity to the whole debate, a delay in its implementation and we appeal to the Minister to be reasonable and to accept it.  We are seeking a delay because we want to give RTE some chance to adjust to the outrageous provisions in the Bill.  The restrictions on RTE have been decided in a rushed fashion.  We appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment and to delay the implementation of the Bill, thus giving RTE an opportunity to adjust to its very restrictive implications.  We are asking the Minister to postpone the legislation &mdash; we will be reasonable about the dates, there is nothing sacrosanct about 1995 &mdash;<Col N="902" /> for a considerable period.  During that considerable period the Minister could engage in thorough consultations.  This is a reasonable amendment which I commend to the House and I do not see any need to elaborate on the matter further.</P>

Ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí an amhlaidh go bhfuil na Seanadóirí thall sásta leis an mBille ach nach bhfuil siad sásta go dtiocfaidh sé i bhfeidhm láithreach?  An é sin ciall an leasaithe?  An chiall a bhainimse as an leasú atá molta ná go bhfuil Seanadóirí sásta go rithfí an Bille seo agus go ndéanfaí dlí de ach nach bhfuil siad sásta go dtiocfaidh sé i bhfeidhm ag tús mhí Dheireadh Fómhair seo chugainn?  De bharr an chur ina aghaidh atá déanta acu tá cineál iontais orm anois go bhfuil siad sásta leis an mBille de réir an leasaithe, ach go dteastaíonn uath lá teacht á bhfeidhm an Bhille a athrú.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment on section 2, in relation to the substitution of the date.  Like Senator O'Reilly I am utterly opposed to this Bill and I should like the Minister to throw it out.  If that cannot happen I should like the Minister to accept this amendment for the following reason.  Getting away from the issues of capitalism, socialism, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, The Workers' Party and all these other matters, in the most pragmatic sense the single greatest weakness in this Bill is that the Minister plans to implement this legislation on 1 October this year when it is going to affect radically RTE revenue from a television source.  All the groups in the television radio advertising and <Col N="903" /> video sectors have informed the Minister and the rest of us that the advertising interest will want to move their funds into advertising, not in the newspapers and not on the radio, but into an alternative television medium.</P>
      <P>While it may be a pious hope of the Minister that these funds in time will be invested by advertisers in TV3, on 1 October this year TV3 will not have begun to assume a commercial function in this country.  In the light of reasonable submissions made by one of the advertising agencies, even though in theory it might exist in a year's time, it might be two, three, four or five years before there is sufficient flesh in it commercially to give confidence to the advertising interests that putting funds into TV3 is a reasonable answer.  It is the single greatest weakness in this Bill and it damns the Bill.</P>
      <P>If this pressure is implemented on 1 October this year, the logical conclusion, according to all those people whose views we should respect in this area &mdash; they are vocational and objective and in no sense political &mdash; is that huge sums of money will leave the country and go to advertising in television companies who are outside the State but who beam into this State such as UTV, Channel 4 and Sky Television.</P>
      <P>In summary, this State damns this Bill. I think the Minister would be a very wise man to take the point and substitute a date other than 1 October 1990.  I would welcome 1995 as suggested by Senator Manning but it need not be that year. There is clear evidence in the most pragmatic commercial sense of major misjudgment here unless the Minister takes the amendment on that specific issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 proposes that this Bill be the subject of a commencement order which would be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are proposing that the commencement order be introduced. That would allow the Minister, in pragmatic terms, to take amendments here this evening because the commencement <Col N="904" /> order could not be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas before the resumption of the Dáil which is going to be in late October.  It would also allow some reconsideration of what has been the most contentious Bill to go through the Oireachtas for some time.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we are proposing that that commencement order be renewed each year so that we would all have an opportunity to reconsider the effects of the measure.  We would be able to see how it was working in practice and we would have an opportunity to get away from the deleterious effects of this Bill which we certainly feel will arise.</P>

It is accepted by everybody except the Minister and some of his most ardent supporters, not everyone in Fianna Fáil, that this is botched legislation.  It is bad legislation. It is designed to screw RTE.  Many things will happen between now and 1995, and certainly a general election.  It is an excellent opportunity for the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and it is a courageous decision by the Minister to bring it before us.  During the years 1983 to 1987 we stood by while the airwaves had no regulation whatsoever. There is no one so foolish as to believe that all legislation can be 100 per cent correct but two items of legislation introduced in 1988 are responsible for 16 radio stations being in operation today.  The Minister said that at some stage every day, after only one year in operation, 40 per cent of the people of Ireland tune in to local radio.  That is a commendable listenership percentage for the 1988 legislation when one takes into account that <Col N="914" /> the counties of Laois, Offaly, Westmeath, Wicklow and parts of Tipperary still do not have local radio&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to compliment him for his courage in bringing this legislation before us and for that reason we must give him credit where it is due.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 8, to delete &ldquo;1990&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1995&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was conveyed to me, when we were debating this Bill in the other House, that the start date was a subject of difficulty for RTE because of possible contractual commitments entered into with advertisers and others relating to their autumn and winter programming schedules.  I listened to the points made about the potential difficulties and, with that in mind, took on board those arguments and changed the proposal that the Bill would come into force on the day signed by the President to its coming into force on 1 October 1990.  When this Bill was published its provisions would have meant, in this year, a change of approximately £5 million in revenue for RTE. As a result of the change I have effected they will now have a saving of approximately £2.2 million this year.  That was a major step by the Government.  I am not prepared to accept the &ldquo;1995&rdquo; date proposed by Senators on the far side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Senator Staunton <Col N="915" /> that the Bill all hinged on the fact that TV3 was not yet in place just does not stand up.  The fact of the matter is that we have alternative radio in place.  The provisions of this Bill are geared not only at the electronic media but also the print media, the latter having been in place for many years.  Therefore, I am not prepared to delay the implementation of the Bill until 1995.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>While being totally opposed to the Bill my party support this amendment because we believe it will ameliorate its worst effects.  We do not see any great need for rushing its implementation.  Certainly, RTE will have to adjust to the enormous cutback in their revenue envisaged under this provision. Therefore, it would be very reasonable for the Minister to postpone the implementation date to enable measures to be put in place and procedures initiated so that RTE are afforded an opportunity to adjust.  The least we might expect from the Minister is he will provide an interim period to allow RTE adjust to the changes being proposed.</P>
      <P>There is a connection also with amendment No. 11 in that we are requesting that the provisions of section 4 not come into effect until the Minister for Communications has issued a commencement order which shall be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> The second part of our amendment No. 11 reads:</P>
    <P>(6) The provisions of this section will cease to have effect unless the Minister for Communications brings an order before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their renewal within twelve months from the date of issue of the Commencement Order.</P>
    <P>We must remember that what the Minister is proposing is a new code of practice. In the other section he is proposing new capping arrangements in relation to advertising and, in this one, arrangements with regard to a code of practice. I should like to make the point that RTE's existing code is recognised internationally as a valuable one.  In fact it is the basis on which the European Council are developing their uniform code of practice for the European scene.  It is not a question of there being any fault in the existing code of practice.  The Minister could allow circumstances develop until we receive uniform guidelines from the European Council.  There is no reason to impose restrictions at present.  Having received those uniform guidelines the Minister could consider issuing a commencement order to be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In section 3 the Minister is taking onto himself certain powers to further cap RTE's ability to earn advertising revenue in that he is further restricting their advertising time on air.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>(2) A code under subsection (1) relating to the Authority may provide for the extent to which the Authority's promotion of its own commercial activities within its own broadcasting services is to be treated as advertising for the purposes of section 3...</P>
    <P>That provision could amount to a further lessening of RTE's ability to earn revenue.</P>
    <P>The Minister taking onto himself those restrictive powers &mdash; which I believe to be part and parcel of the Bill's overall restrictive powers &mdash; will lead to a constitutional challenge against this Bill.  The <Col N="917" /> least we can expect from the Minister is that the relevant orders be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We do not know what will be the precise encroachment on RTE's advertising time.  I contend this section should not have been included in the Bill in the first place.  Their advertising time reduced to five minutes hourly will be encroached on further by any promotion no matter how small or large in relation to their programmes.  I contend it is normal for RTE to refer to programmes what will arise later which, in itself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are asking the Minister to take on board this amendment which seeks to afford both Houses of the Oireachtas an opportunity to ascertain precisely the extra capping arrangement supposedly hidden in this code of practice.  Indeed, I contend it is more than a code of practice; it is a code of practice plus restrictions.</P>

      <P>First of all, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, I should like to welcome your two rulings.  It is very important that you should act <i>ultra vires</i> because the more this Bill proceeds the less constitutional it appears.  I have no doubt that President Hillery will refer it to the Supreme Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say I am supported in this view by at least one former Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to support the two amendments. I do not imagine that the Minister will accept them.  It would be a wild flight of fantasy to anticipate the Minister &mdash;<Col N="918" /> although I can see him nodding in his usual charming way &mdash; accepting these amendments because they would certainly frustrate his intention.  I have to say that I believe his intention is vindictive.  I do not want to be personal about this.  If I may explain to the Minister why I am not being personal then I should say there is a mass of vindictiveness throughout Fianna Fáil to which I listened during the day with regard to RTE.  I may say there is also some element of it on this side of the House as well.  Senator Manning's amendment seeks to delete &ldquo;1990&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1995&rdquo; would obviously frustrate the intention of the Bill and that is why it has been placed there.</P>
    <P>The same could not quite be said of amendment No. 11, also a very sensible one, but need not necessarily limit the Minister's actions.  It only requires him to place an instrument before the House. I doubt if he will do it, because it would be an indication of a genuine commitment to democracy which in this instance, in this Bill, I think is absent from the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the day we were treated to some lectures from the Government side about the dangers of filibustering and we reminded the Government parties that this filibustering had been perfected by Charles Stewart Parnell.  I would like to place on the record some well known words, from Charles Stewart Parnell: &ldquo;No man has a right to fix the boundary of the march of a nation&rdquo;.  RTE is a national institution and the Minister is constructing a very skilful attack upon RTE and attempting to restrict the march of a national institution.</P>

      <P>I would like to place on the record my gratitude to Senator Lanigan, the disciple whom Jesus loved but apparently his father was not too keen, for making my point for me.  This is an attempt to control the airwaves, and it is a very dangerous one because it does, as Senator Lanigan has so correctly said, attempt to restrict freedom of speech. For that reason certain sections of this Bill are clearly unconstitutional and this side of the House, uniting in opposition, will attempt to get President Hillery to refer it to the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the points made by the Senator about the limit on advertising time, if this was the first time it was introduced there might be some basis for the argument he makes.  There is, however already a limit and a cap on the advertising time available to RTE. That has always been the case; it is six minutes with flexibility up to seven and a half minutes at the moment.  What is happening is that it is being altered on <Col N="920" /> the basis of the underlying principle of this legislation and the 1988 legislation, a principle which I know the Senator holds dear to his heart, the principle of pluralism. What we want is pluralism of the airwaves.  We want choice.  We no longer want monopoly.  We do not want what we had during Fine Gael's time, a choice of 70 illegal pirate stations.  We want choice in the legal sense which was created as a result of the legislation I brought in 1987-88 with the first of those stations decided upon by the Independent.  Radio and Television Commission coming on air in 1989.  We want choice.  We want pluralism, and that is what this legislation is about.  I totally reject the accusation of vindictiveness in relation to RTE.</P>
      <P>RTE is, and always will be, the premier broadcasting agency and Authority in this country.  It is the Authority which is owned by the taxpayers and it has served this country exceedingly well since its establishment in the twenties &mdash; and the television service since it came on air in the sixties.  We are proud of what RTE do.  I, as Minister for Communications, have extended their hours in my period as Minister, I have done everything that is humanly possible to extend their hours, I have extended their hours in Cork; I have extended their television broadcasting hours during the day for their news programmes, etc; and I have given sanction for the construction of long awaited and long delayed, but thankfully nearly completed, new studios and library to store their vast treasure trove of records.  All of these things I have done because I respect and admire the work of RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot, however, close our eyes to what is happening around us in Europe. We cannot just build a wall and put a roof on it and say we are not going to have any stations coming from abroad, that we are going to close off the airwaves and leave it to a State monopoly.  Right across Europe in the old days there were State monopolies which provided a limited service.  That has broken down right <Col N="921" /> across Europe because people want choice, and what we are doing is making sure they have that choice.</P>
    <P>We brought in legislation to give people the choice of RTE or local radio. People are demanding choice in television also by subscribing to piped television, using illegal deflector systems and signing up for the MMDS system.  As was mentioned by a Cork Senator earlier this morning, there are 15 or 16 channels available in the Cork region; only two of them from Ireland.  All of these other influences are coming from abroad.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's view that as well as the excellent programme provided by RTE 1 and Network 2 we should have a third choice from an Irish source, with an Irish ethos for the Irish people, so that they would have a choice between Irish television networks and foreign networks. That makes sense; it is logical. That is what we are trying to provide. This legislation is fundamental to the principle of plurality which I know Senator Norris treasures so much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might just comment a little on that.  I wonder if the Minister listens to or watches a great deal of television either on the continent of Europe or in the United States of America&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because I have the opportunity frequently to visit Europe and America, and if the Minister is under any illusion that what one gets on the Continent or in America is choice, then I am afraid he is not living in the real world.  What one gets is wall to wall video music.  I wonder if that is the kind of European plurality that the Minister wants to inflict on this country.</P>

      <P>I thought it was an interesting and well argued position that the Minister took, although I was not entirely convinced by it.  I am interested that he thought so feelingly about plurality and the influence of continental Europe.  I hope that when he wears his other hat he will one day get around to listening to the voice of European plurality as expressed by the European Court of Human Rights to which he is being signally deaf.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum effect of this legislation, even from the point of view of those who would be most critical of it, would be to bring RTE back, in money terms, to the income they had in 1988.  We are talking about an income of roughly £100 million for the State broadcasting company to provide a broadcasting service for a population of 3.5 million.  Together with that, I am trying in every way possible to support them in the development of their commercial units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill extends the date from 1990 to 1995 and sets out the quality and content of the programming.  I accept that Senator Norris has a strong view about whether we are talking about a choice of wall to wall music videos etc.  I would remind him of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, and what section 18 (3) and <Col N="923" /> (4), lays down for the independent broadcaster on the television side, the commission being the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
    <P>(3) The Commission shall ensure that the television programme service provided under the Act shall in its programming &mdash; (a) be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language; (b) uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to the rightful liberty of expression; (c) have regard to the need for the formation of public awareness and understanding of the values and traditions of countries other than the State, including in particular those of such countries which are members of the European Community; and</P>
    <P>(d) includes a reasonable proportion of news and current affairs programmes;</P>
    <P>and the television programme service contractor shall comply with any requirements of the Commission in respect of such matters.  Subsection (4) reads:</P>
    <P>(4) For the purpose of ensuring compliance with subsection (3) the Commission shall ensure that a reasonable proportion of the programme service&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  is produced in the State or in another Member State of the European Community and</P>
    <P>(b)  is devoted to original programme material produced therein by persons <Col N="924" /> other than the contractor, his subsidiary, his parent of existing broadcasting organisations.</P>
    <P>That is the mandate under which the independent television company will operate.  It is the same mandate as RTE operate under at present except it goes further to include the fact that they must provide a reasonable proportion of their programme service from independent sources outside of their own organisations. To say that the services to be provided by the television company will in some way be a reduced service is misleading; they cannot do that by law.  It is laid down in the Act passed by this House and by the Dáil.  It is fundamental to us as a nation that we meet and have the opportunity to have at least one further source of entertainment, news, current affairs and the Irish ethos to bring us up to three stations to match the 15, 20 or 30 that will be beamed in within the next couple of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the amendment being withdrawn?  There is a number of amendments to be discussed, and I am only trying to move things along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two items; first, the Minister has not responded to amendment No. 11.  I would like to hear what he has to say about that amendment. Listening to the Minister I sometimes think he is arguing from the point of view of this side of the House, and I am wondering if it is the same Minister who has this legislation here at all?  None of us is against having three services.  I have not heard a Senator speak against a third service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all in favour of pluralism.  We are all in favour of the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution.  Those are precisely the things we are seeking to save by opposing this legislation.  The independents are already in existence. There is competition.  What the Minister <Col N="925" /> is doing is not in the interest of competition but, as I see it, in the interest of unfair competition.  We already have competition.  What we have seen in the original proposals, is an attempt to nobble 2FM; the diversion of the licence fee and now the capping of advertising. That is not fair competition.  These are specific proposals to get rid of fair competition. Let us not hear the Minister speak of pluralism and democratic values in relation to this legislation.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to address some remarks to amendment No. 11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>While one agrees with the section the Minister read out from the 1988 Bill, it was very largely a pious aspiration. I do not think there is anything really strictly legally binding in it.  It is subject to interpretation.  For example, what is a reasonable proportion and has that been determined?  I do not know, and the Minister does not know either, because he is having to consult.  There are always these preambles.  As working politicians we know that every piece of fraudulent legislation contains an element of whitewash.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred most unwisely to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I hope they stick to their guns, and remain firm in their attitude which is opposition to this Bill.  They have suggested that they will get out of the national agreement as a result of their hostility to this Bill which they plainly do not see in quite the same democratic terms as the Minister does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make one final point.  I welcome the fact that as usual the Minister gives very clear concrete examples of things.  That is helpful in a debate like this.  He mentioned a figure of £100 million but he placed this in the context of the comparability of RTE to some of the other incoming signals such as from the BBC.  I may be incorrect but I believe that the current budget figures for BBC News is £175 million, so how can a station in Ireland with a total global budget of <Col N="926" /> £100 million compete if it is being restricted to £100 million with a world service from the neighbouring island that has a budget for news alone of £175 million?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the proof is the TAM ratings.  RTE are competing with them and have been competing with them in 1985 and doing an excellent job. I see no reason that they cannot compete and continue to compete.  The argument in relation to RTE versus BBC &mdash; I will not quibble with the Senator's figure &mdash; it is slightly less than £175 million, but my understanding is that the new service is over £100 million.  We are dealing with vastly different populations.  RTE have been doing an excellent job and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>The same arguments as I put up for the rejection of amendment No. 2 stand for amendment No. 11.  Amendment No. 11 is merely another delaying tactic and the Government have decided that it is a matter where we are going to ensure that this legislation comes into place on 1 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that this amendment is another delaying tactic. There is a specific provision in amendment No. 11 that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provisions of this section will cease to have effect unless the Minister for Communications brings an order before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their renewal within twelve months...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the opportunity of seeing what is in the provisions.  This section makes provision for the further capping of RTE's revenue from advertising, because the promotion of their own commercial activities is included.  We would want to see the effect that will have.  Will the limit of five minutes on advertising per hour take from RTE's scope to advertise themselves? It is not a delaying tactic.  It is a specific reference to a new restriction on top of the existing capping restriction in <Col N="927" /> section 3.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say it is a delaying tactic.</P>

    <P>Táimid ag tógáil le chéile leasuithe uimhreacha a 3, 4, 14, 15 agus 24, de réir mar atá ordaithe anseo.  Baineann siad seo uilig le Comhairle Athbhreithnithe Pholasaí Raidió, nó mar a thugtar air anseo, the Broadcasting Policy Review Council. Tá súil agam, mar sin, go bhfanfaidh mé ar an ábhar agus nach mbeidh mé ag imeacht uaidh.  Tá sé ráite go han-soiléir céard atá i gceist sa leasú seo.  In aon eagraíocht ar nós RTE, nó Raidió na Gaeltachta, bíonn comhairle ann.  Teastaíonn comhairle le cúnamh, le treoir, le misneach a thabhairt, agus le hathruithe a mholadh ó am go chéile.  Faoin mBille mar atá sé tá sé faoi smacht an iomarca ag an Aire.</P>
    <P>Ba dheas agus ba mhaith an rud é go mbeadh comhairle le fáil ag an Aire ó bhliain go chéile.  Sin atá molta sna leasuithe seo go léir, uimhreacha a 3, 4, 14, 15, 24 agus bainfidh cuid áirithe de na rudaí seo leis an gComhairle Athbhreithnithe Pholasaí Raidió seo.  Anois, cé a bheadh ar an gcomhairle seo?  Tá sé leagtha síos sna leasuithe 3, 4, 14, 15 seo.  Níl a fhios ag Seanadóirí céard faoi a bhfuil mé ag caint agus beidh siad ag rá aon nóiméad anois go bhfuil mé as ord.  Tá mé ag rá leo ná, an comhdhéanamh a bheidh sa chomhairle athbhreithnithe seo ná, daoine ó RTE, duine nó beirt ón IRTC, daoine atá ag plé le fógraíocht, fógraíocht raidió, nó fógraíocht teilifíse, na páipéir nuachta náisiúnta agus nuachtáin chúigí agus áitiúla.</P>
    <P>Tá sé molta anseo go mbeidh 18 nduine <Col N="929" /> ar an gcomhairle le comhairle a chur ar an Aire.  Bheadh daoine ar an gcomhairle seo le cúnamh agus comhairle a thabhairt ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Tá sé luaite ansin go speisialta, ag bun alt a dó sa líne deireanach.  Cheapfadh an tAire daoine feiliúacha eile le dul ar an gcomhairle seo.  Is rud inmholta é comhairle bheith ann le ceisteanna a chur.  In amanna eascraíonn deacrachtaí agus ba dheas an rud dá mbeadh an grúpa daoine seo ag gníomhú, dála, abair, Raidió na Gaeltachta, a bhfuil comhairle ann ar a bhfuil 16 bhall.  Tagann siadsan le chéile go rialta, ar a laghad ceithre huaire i rith na bliana, chun chuile shórt a bhaineann leis an raidió sin a phlé, agus cuireann siad a gcuid moltaí ar aghaidh chuig an Aire.</P>
    <P>Anois, ní chaithfidh an tAire glacadh le moltaí an chomhairle seo, mar ní rud bunreachtúil é.  Ní bheadh sé ag feidhmiú faoin Acht.  Ag deireadh na bliana chuirfí tuairisc le chéile ar imeachtaí na bliana.  Is dócha, freisin, nuair a bheadh an tuairisc bhliantúil á déanamh go mbeadh athruithe le moladh, polasaithe nua le cur i gcrích tar éis athbhreithniú a dhéanamh. Ansin, i bhfo-alt (4) den leasú, tá sé ráite go speisialta go rachfaí i gcomhairle le lucht fógraíochta, na daoine a bhfuil baint acu le cúrsaí fógraíochta agus poiblíochta ar an raidió agus an teilifís, agus go mbeadh cruinniú acu siúd leis an gcomhairle sé mhí ar a laghad roimh dheireadh na bliana.  Má bhíonn athruithe le déanamh agus moltaí faoi chaibidil bheadh siad le fáil ag an gcomhairle in am le hiad a chur chuig an Aire sa chaoi go bhféadfadh an tAire iad siúd a chur san áireamh dá mbeadh sé ag moladh athruithe ar bith i modhanna imeachta agus riaracháin raidió agus teilifíse.</P>
    <P>Faoi láthair níl aon rud mar sin ann agus níl sé i gceist ag an Aire aon chomhairle mar sin a ghlacadh.  Déarfaidh sé go bhfuil RTE ann.  Ach, tá comhairle ag Raidió na Gaeltachta agus dá mbeadh an argóint ann nach gá seo a bheith ann, cén fáth, mar sin, go bhfuil a leithéid ag Raidió na Gaeltachta, agus go bhfuil <Col N="930" /> fáilte roimh a leithéid, mar baineann siad uilig leis an rud céanna?  Nuair a bheadh an t-athbhreithniú á dhéanamh ag an gcomhairle seo, chuirfí san áireamh chuile cheist a bhainfeadh le raidió nó teilifís.  Bheadh siad ag caint ar aon athrú a thiocfadh ar phobal áitiúil, mar shampla, aon athrú go mba chóir nó inmholta a chur i bhfeidhm ar raidió nó theilifís áitiúil, nó ar raidió náisiúnta nó idirnáisiúnta. Bheadh siad in ann labhairt faoi chaighdeáin ó thaobh na cothromaíochta, na Gaeilge agus an chultúir de maidir le hathruithe atá beartaithe.</P>
    <P>Sin iad na feidhmeanna a d'fheicfí dá gcuirfí ar bun an chomhairle athbhreithnithe seo atá molta.  D'iarrfainn ar an Aire é sin a chur san áireamh agus gan dearmad a dhéanamh de leasú 24 go háirithe, atá anseo freisin.  Tá teilifís na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta sonraithe ansin.  Dúirt mé an oíche cheana gurbh é sin ceann de na bunlochtanna a bhí ar an mBille, maidir le hiarthar na hÉireann, lucht na Gaeilge agus muintir na Gaeltachta, nach raibh tada ráite ann faoi theilifís Ghaeilge a bheith bunaithe sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá sé molta anseo, nuair a cheapfaí an chomhairle athbhreithnithe, go suífeadh siad síos leis an Aire mar chomhairleoirí agus go ndéanfadh siad machnamh an-ghéar agus an-láidir ar theilifís Ghaeilge nó theilifís Ghaeltachta, an costas a bheadh air, an bealach a bhféadfaí é a chur ar bun agus an t-am lena chur ar bun.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, mholfaí, agus bheinn ag súil le go mbeadh an chomhairle seo ag moladh don Aire, go gcuirfí ar bun teilifís Ghaeilge, Ghaeltachta, neamhspleách agus go bhféadfadh sin a bheith ann in áit RTE3, mar shampla, mar ní dóigh liomsa go n-éireoidh go deo le RTE3. Ach, mar sin, níl mise ag iarraidh comhairle a chur ar an gcomhairle, nach bhfuil bunaithe fós.  Tá mé ag moladh, nuair a bheidh a leithéid sin ar bun, go dtabharfadh sé aird ar an gcomhairle seo agus go mbeadh sé i gceist go gcuirfeadh siad <Col N="931" /> comhairle ar an Aire.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few references to the manner in which the proceedings were conducted here this evening.  It is with regret that I note there has been disorder in the House.  I confirm the correctness of the ruling of the Leas-Chathaoirleach in relation to the disorder that occurred and also make it clear to all Members of the House that the Leas-Chathaoirleach, in accordance with Standing Orders, carries the right to exercise the function of the Cathaoirleach in its entirety in the absence of the Cathaoirleach on official business.</P>
      <P>On this occasion the Cathaoirleach was absent on official business and had in accordance with practice arranged with the Leas-Chathaoirleach to replace him and his function for the period of the absence.  I now rule in confirmation of the action taken by the Leas-Chathaoirleach. I regret that people who should know better attempted to misdirect and cause disturbance to the extent that the business of this House was conducted in a most unruly and disorderly manner.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>In page 4, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall appoint a review body to be known as the Broadcasting Policy Review Council (in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Broadcasting Council&rsquo;).</P>
    <P>(2)  The Broadcasting Council shall consist of representatives of the Authority, the Independent Radio and Television Commission, radio and television broadcasting contractors, advertisers, news-papers, faculties of <Col N="933" /> communications in the institutes of higher leaning, the trade unions, the Irish language and such other persons as the Minister thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(3)  There shall not be more than 18 members on the Broadcasting Council.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Broadcasting Council shall make an annual report to both Houses of the Oireachtas including its recommendations for changes in broadcasting policy.</P>
    <P>(5)  Its remit shall include consideration of all relevant questions affecting community, local, national and international broadcasting including funding, competition (internal and external), balance standards (including standards relating to good taste, violence, sex and language), public order, copyright, performing rights, home production (including independent home production), Irish language culture and news content.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Senator Ó Foighil.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of a review body has been outlined in this amendment.  It is proposed that we have a broadcasting council and include on it representatives of the Authority which means effectively interposing yet another layer of bureaucracy.  One of the difficulties is that we have this tendency to appoint more bodies than necessary in this relatively small country.  In this case it is difficult to see what real benefit which would accrue from having this very unwieldy body as suggested in the amendment. It is suggested it would include representatives of the Authority.  Presumably the Authority has access to the Minister in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) states that the Broadcasting Council shall consist of representatives of the Authority, the Independent Radio and Television Commission, radio and television broadcasting contractors, advertisers, newspapers, faculties of communications in the institutes of higher learning, the trade unions, the Irish language and such other persons as <Col N="934" /> the Minister thinks fit.  It seems almost ludicrous that in subsection (3) of this amendment it is then suggested that there shall not be more than 18 members on the Broadcasting Council.  How can you fairly represent so many different interests if you have only 18 members on any such body?</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) states that the Broadcasting Council shall make an annual report to both Houses of the Oireachtas including its recommendations for changes in broadcasting policy.  In some ways at times far too many bodies make annual reports on this, that and the other. It states that their remit &mdash; should include consideration of all relevant questions affecting community, local, national and international broadcasting, including funding, competition, internal and external, balance standards, including standards relating to good taste, violence, sex and language, public order, copyright, performing rights, home production, including independent home production, Irish language, culture and news content &mdash; a broad remit indeed.  It would also have to appoint a large executive body working with it to have any hope of covering all the various aspects, questions affecting community, local, national and international broadcasting, including funding, which is a huge subject.</P>
    <P>It would be useful to have some form of body where complaints could be more easily considered, because one of the most important things a broadcasting council could deal with is the question of redress.  If, for some reason or another, a comment is made, correctly or incorrectly, in a newspaper the person, or people concerned, have the opportunity at least to write a letter to the editor and immediately get a response which may get some sort of comparable publicity to the initial comment.  Unfortunately, that cannot happen easily with radio.  It is even more difficult by definition of the medium for it to happen with television but if there were to be a particular reason for a broadcasting council I suggest that <Col N="935" /> would be the primary remit of any such body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. While I recognise that in section 4 the Minister proposes to draw up and amend codes governing standards, the purpose of this amendment is to have a body of people very widely representative to assist the Minister in doing just that.  No one in this House is 100 per cent satisfied with standards, codes of practice, etc., in the media at present. Surely the previous speaker was not enamoured of television over the past number of weeks and the advertisement from RTE; it is as near to anarchy as you will find anywhere for a State broadcasting service to lay into the Government in that fashion.  If that suits the previous speakers, let the people get what they want.  Many people feel aggrieved at the direction in which standards are going.  If you listen for most mornings of the year to Radio 1 and 2 and the national chat shows you will find material in the programmes which is anti-system, whether Church or State.</P>
      <P>Anyone on the far side of the House who stands up and says there is nothing wrong with the present system clearly does not understand the problem.  People are offended day in, day out.  While I would be slow to impose or seek to restrict views, whether they are majority views or the smallest minority view that I would not agree with, people are entitled to hold and express them but there must be some minimum standard of decency.  I am shocked that my learned colleague took such a blanket objection to Senator Manning's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate that the Minister is doing something about this in section 4, I and my colleagues are thinking of the future.  Looking back over the past few years it seems standards are going down the slippery slope.  There is sedition every morning with people encouraged not to accept the <i>status quo</i> or the authority of <Col N="936" /> the Government.  That is why I ask the Minister to take into his confidence a cross section of the people mentioned in this proposed new section.  There must be some reason for this amendment.  Many people are aggrieved and genuinely upset.  Subsection (5) of the amendment provides:</P>
    <P>Its remit shall include consideration of all relevant questions affecting community, local, national and international broadcasting including funding, competition (internal and external), balance standards (including standards relating to good taste, violence, sex and language), public order, copyright, performing rights, home production...</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no doubt but that those standards are under attack daily from people who in their own minds have a mission in life to change the face of this country.  The media are powerful and have achieved such tremendous good but the small few find it either smart or modernistic in their own minds to use peculiar or vulgar language which is now commonplace on our national radio.  Surely with what the State is spending on education the vocabulary of our people must be wider than the litany of four letter words heard weekly on one or other of the chat shows would suggest?  That is why I am horrified at the reaction to this amendment from the other side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the comments that have been made by the previous speaker on one aspect of standards, those in relation to comments on groups of individuals, but, unfortunately, in this amendment as it is phrased that is just one, almost incidental, part well down the primary remit this proposed broadcasting council are given in the amendment which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...to include consideration...affecting...community, local, national and international broadcasting including <Col N="937" /> funding, competition (internal and external), balance standards...</P>
    <P>I have to agree with much of what the previous speaker said in relation to good taste, violence, sex and language.  There is, in the opinion of many people, a very definite deterioration of standards.  I have great sympathy with that view.  If we were looking at some form of body or council to whom matters of that nature could be remitted, and if that were the sole purpose of this council or body, I would have a great deal of sympathy with it. There is no doubt that in matters of good taste, violence, sex, and bad language many people are extremely concerned. All too often on our television screens, even on RTE, we see programmes which many of us feel are in anything but good taste.  We see too many television series in which violence seems to be the prime motivation.  Many people are not happy about how sex is often portrayed on our national television or about the use of four letter words and so on.  We have to balance this against the freedom to express views, nonetheless, in the opinion of many people, the balance at present is not a very healthy or happy one.  Were this the purpose of this amendment I would have a tremendous amount of sympathy with it.</P>
    <P>I am not sure, however, in such circumstances one could say to the Minister that he should include the form of representation suggested in the amendment with all sorts of people involved much more in the form of running an executive or other commentary in relation to television and radio rather than a council who would primarily be concerned with moral standards and standards of taste.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (1) provides that the Minister shall draw up and may amend, from time to time as he thinks proper, codes governing standards.  Section 4 (3) states that he shall consult the Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission in drawing up or amending a code under subsection (1).  If that was the sole <Col N="938" /> purpose of the amendment I would have great sympathy with it.  I would be very glad to hear the Minister's views in relation to this question of maintaining standards on our national television and radio.  Unfortunately, in relation to that the Minister, and all of us in this House, can do very little about external broadcasting on television beamed into this country, but let us try to have good standards within our own broadcasting and television services.</P>

      <P>Is it seriously being suggested that we are to set up another layer of bureaucracy?  Our nearest neighbour, Great Britain, has appointed a media watchdog in the person of Lord Rees-Mogg. It is rather strange in a society such as the United Kingdom which is pledged to plurality and liberalism that they now have somebody set in place by Government statute who is to be the overseer of the morality of what people should watch rather than what they should listen to because he is concerned about television.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seems to suggest we should create a monster that may very quickly get out of control. Is it seriously suggested that we should have 18 men and women good and true who will tell us what we should see and hear at a cost to the Exchequer?  Where is the role of the RTE Authority in all of this?  Certainly, I do not think RTE would encourage this amendment.  I do not see why there should be a duplication of powers or another layer of bureaucracy. I assume that the appointees to the RTE Authority and to the IRTC, irrespective of the Minister who appoints them either now or in the future, will be people of <Col N="939" /> the calibre of those who would form this broadcasting council of 18 members. Anybody reading the detail of the amendment would realise that if it were to be implemented it would neuter the existing authorities.  What would be their role? Would they be merely a rubber stamp? In the section where the Minister refers to drawing up the codes of practice, the Authority is the supreme body in this area and it is to the Authority the Minister would refer any suggestions or proposals in relation to the code of practice. I object to this on the basis that it is an unnecessary extra layer of bureaucracy, and because of where this body would take us.  Since the foundation of this State, we have had enough debate about censorship, about what has been banned and what has not been banned.  Surely, it is not being suggested that there should be yet another statutory watchdog set up to tell us what we should or should not do.  Having said that, I fully agree with everything that my distinguished colleague, Senator McDonald, has said, in relation to the excesses in the media, not just in the electronic media&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have no doubt that there is a need for some reassessment of the activities of broadcasters and people in the media generally, but a reassessment is different from an imposition of censorship.</P>
      <P>In my Second Stage speech I welcomed section 6 which tightens up complaints to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission regarding broadcasts affecting an individual.  The proposals contained in the legislation as outlined by the Minister in that section, will go a long way towards redressing what has been a very real complaint from individuals who felt the power of the media &mdash; and with due respect to my colleagues in the printed media, the impact of the electronic media is very powerful indeed.  When someone on a current affairs or news programme says something which is inaccurate or slanderous, or is, in any way denigrating or humiliating the dignity of an individual, it is very difficult to get redress.  I am confident that the section for tightening up the complaints procedures to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission will go a long way towards redressing that problem.  It is in that context that I do not support this amendment.</P>

The Government believe that this legislation is necessary, that it should be implemented as and from the date proposed and that it is part of a logical process which commenced in 1987 when I, as Minister for Communications, took in hand the chaos which had been allowed to develop in the broadcasting sector, and restored order to the broadcasting environment.
