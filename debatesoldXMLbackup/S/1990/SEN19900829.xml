      <P>I have notice from Senator Maurice Manning that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The failure of the Government to honour a specific commitment made to the former workers of Irish Shipping.</P>
      <P>I regret that I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Manning as not suitable for discussion as it is <i>sub judice.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 2, the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1990.  Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders it is proposed that all Stages of the Companies (Amendment) Bill would conclude by 2 p.m. today by the putting of the question from the Chair.  There will be a sos from 2 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. and from 2.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. we will have the statements/discussion on the Middle East.  Also, No. 3 will be taken immediately on the conclusion of No. 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in a dilemma at the moment.  The Whips <Col N="1052" /> agreed yesterday that Second Stage of the Companies (Amendment) Bill would be taken until 2 o'clock, the Committee Stage until 4 o'clock and there would be a 15 minute time limit on Second Stage speeches.  I was informed, as was Senator Joe O'Toole, on the way in this morning about this need to finish the Bill today at 2 o'clock and that there were urgent reasons for doing this, but we were not told what those urgent reasons were.  I do not wish to be disruptive.  If there are urgent reasons for doing this then we will do everything we can to facilitate the Government in getting the legislation through, but it is a bit cavalier to be told on the way into this House that this has to be done and no reason given for doing so.</P>
      <P>I do not want to waste time on the Order of Business because this is a very important matter.  I do not want to have a row on the Order of Business, but I am concerned about what is happening.  If the group leaders could meet afterwards with the Minister or his officials and be given reasons for this overwhelming urgency, I could then talk to my own group and we could agree to the Order of Business.  What has happened is unacceptable. I do not want to call a division on the Order of Business.  I do not want to waste time on the Order of Business, because there are many speakers who want to make important points on this legislation.</P>
      <P>To solve this problem perhaps the Leader of the House could arrange a meeting so that we can learn what these reasons are.  I cannot agree to the Order of Business as proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; to that.  This is unacceptable.  We have made it quite clear that in terms of facilitating the Government to debate this legislation we would do everything possible.  It is just not good enough having tried to reach agreement to find ways of doing business, to discover changes being made at short notice.  As we said earlier in the summer here the guillotine now seems to have become standard practice. It seems to be the way to do business. <Col N="1053" /> There are a number of issues involved here.  I understand it is impossible to contact the Supreme Court after 4 p.m. in order to implement what is proposed in this legislation.  I still think there is a long gap between 2 o'clock and 4 o'clock.  The signing of the legislation by the President is something that could be done in 20 minutes, one would imagine.</P>
      <P>This legislation was discussed earlier in this House as section 9 of the Companies Bill and we took a long time dealing with the issues contained in it.  It now raises many other topical issues which deserve discussion.  I cannot agree to hurry this legislation through without being giving a compelling reason.  I have not heard why this debate cannot wait until tomorrow. I believe the further two hours could be used for debate.  It is unfair to the people who have a contribution to make. I find myself in the position of having to oppose the Order of Business unless the Leader of the House can qualify or modify what he has proposed or to give other assurances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, find myself in disagreement with the Order of Business. This whole business is becoming more and more incredible.  It has now become a matter of urgency that has to be resolved by 2 o'clock.  Last week it was a routine matter.  What are we to believe? What is credible and is not credible?  The figures being thrown around vary almost by the second.  I am wondering if this whole business is in accord with Article 24 of the Constitution, particularly in relation to necessities to consult the Council of State, resolutions from the Dáil and so on.  I raise the point for consideration. I certainly have doubts about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer very briefly to the statements on the Middle East.  I believe the Leader of the House yesterday stated that this debate was partly in response to a request from Members that we should have a debate on Middle East issues.  I accept that time is limited.  I accept that these statements <Col N="1054" /> should be made and that there has to be a time limit, but I do not think the statements made here this afternoon should be regarded as a debate on Middle East issues.  I hope the Leader of the House does not take it as a precedent and tell us subsequently that that debate has occurred.  What I am saying, in essence, is that I believe that here in the Seanad it is necessary to have a substantial debate on Middle East issues for which I and some of my colleagues will be pressing at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have to oppose this proposal.  It seems to me to be quite outrageous.  I wonder why the Seanad exists.  Yesterday we met for ten minutes and were treated with contempt by the media, and perfectly correctly in my opinion: it is complete and utter nonsense. The Minister is a member of the Progressive Democrats Party, and members of that party in this House have told us that they are committed to the abolition of the Seanad.  If they are going to treat the Seanad in this way, as partners in Government why do they not get ahead and abolish it because it appears to be absolutely no use whatever?  We are not allowed to have any impact on legislation.  Legislation is rammed through in a time scale which prevents us from doing our constitutional duty which is to refine legislation and to put down amendments.  I wonder if the Progresive Democrats policy has infected the entire Government and if this represents the final stages of contempt which will lead to the abolition of the Seanad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to.  The Government's attitude towards the Seanad appears to be one of contempt which will, inevitably, lead towards its abolition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  That is a matter of opinion and if the Senator persists in interrupting me I shall move item No. 78, that Seanad Eireann calls on the Government to establish a proper assessment therapeutic unit for girls with severe conduct disorders.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask why we cannot meet tomorrow because there is not just this matter to discuss.  I would point out to the House that the other House has provided time for a discussion which is directly relevant to this matter.  We are expected to gallop in here to the assistance of friends of the Fianna Fáil Party, through pickets from Gateaux and Irish Shipping. Will the Leader of the House provide time for a debate on the Gateaux strike and also one, which is long overdue on Irish Shipping?  I realise that no complete answer can be given to the following question today but I would like to signal to the Government that a considerable number on all sides of the House are interested in it.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader to ask the Government what plans they have to follow up the incitement to hatred legislation with anti-discrimination legislation, which was indicated at the time. There will be a general welcome in the country for it.  I realise we cannot get a complete answer, but I will be asking this again when we reconvene in the late autumn.  Perhaps, the Leader will ask the Government what their plans in this regard are.</P>

      <P>I should like to dissociate myself from my colleague's reference to item No. 78.  I thought his remarks were surprisingly sexist, flippant and only moderately funny, for which I cannot forgive him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am uneasy about the suggestion that item No. 4 be given only two hours.  Many of us will have more things to say on what should be more properly called the Gulf crisis than the Middle East situation, if I am not <Col N="1056" /> being too pedantic, than we will have on item No. 2.  I would ask the Leader to either be more generous with the allotment of time for that discussion or else to make sure that the time limits are such that each interested contributor will be accommodated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points were made by Senators.  What Senator Manning indicated was correct and I cannot deny that.  Agreement was reached yesterday on giving 15 minute per speaker. It was agreed we would go on until 4 o'clock.  Initially, we agreed to go on until 2 p.m. and then we agreed to go on until 4 p.m.  We were called back to discuss this legislation last evening at 6 p.m.  If that happened we could have had much more time and gone on until 11 p.m. or midnight.  That did not happen and we are discussing this legislation this morning.  The reasons given to me why all Stages must be concluded by 2 p.m. is that the Bill, to become law quickly, must be signed by the President shortly afterwards. Members will agree that this legislation is a matter of grave urgency.  The urgency is obvious.  That is the reason we are saying 2 p.m. rather than 4 p.m.  It will not be two hours extra because the plan is for a sos of half-an-hour.  It will be an extra hour and a half.</P>
      <P>This Bill is, effectively, Part IX of the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  That Bill, which was initiated and debated at length in the Seanad, went to the Dáil for a long Second Stage debate.  The Committee Stage of Parts I and II were debated by the Dáil and because of the complex and highly technical nature of the Bill it was decided that a select committee of the Dáil should complete the remaining sections, including Part IX.  Part IX, from section 154 to section 185, is what is before us for debate today.  This legislation has been well discussed and agreed by all sides of the House.  It deals with court protection for companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now refer briefly to the point made by Senator Manning.  The Whips can meet after the Order or Business is agreed, but at the moment the Order of Business stands.  We can talk later.  We <Col N="1057" /> may agree to a change but I have to say at this point that the Order of Business is as I have indicated.  My reply to Senator O'Toole is similar to what I have indicated to Senator Manning, and the same applies to Senator Upton.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton referred to statements and I should like to say that, as I indicated yesterday, we can call them statements or a discussion on any aspect, whether it is the Brian Keenan affair, the Middle East problem or the Gulf crisis. It will be a broad debate.  I see nothing wrong in having an extra hour, Senator Murphy, if that is what Members want. We are free to do that, particularly with time on our hands this evening.</P>
    <P>I have to support my colleague, Senators Lanigan and Murphy in their comments regarding a certain statement. I was not impressed.  I have no intention of having a debate on the Gateaux or Irish Shipping issues.  I have noted Senator Norris' other comments.  He was making the point, like Senator Manning and other speakers, about the short time for the debate on the Bill before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything the Leader has said has convinced me that he is <Col N="1058" /> wrong in what he is doing.  First of all, we are saying the President must sign it in two hours.  That is constitutional contempt. I suggest that the Supreme Court be contacted.</P>

      <P>Could the Supreme Court be asked to wait on after 4 o'clock? It would not be the end of the world if they were asked to wait on one or two hours if there is a matter of such grave importance.  Otherwise we must oppose the Order of Business.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, the Bill I am bringing to the Seanad to-day is to a considerable extent the same as Part IX of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, which passed through all Stages in this House some time ago.  There are, of course, some changes which reflect the consideration of the Bill by the Dáil, as well as the fact that Part IX is now effectively a stand-alone piece of legislation. While the 1987 Bill is currently at Report Stage in the Dáil, it has been decided, for reasons which I will touch on later, to accelerate the progress of these measures now by way of this separate legislation.</P>
      <P>Our economic fortunes are never totally within our own control.  Movements in international interest rates, fluctuating exchange rates, changing oil prices and other such factors have tangible and ever-changing effects on our daily lives.  The present events in the Middle East have sharply reminded us, if that were necessary, that despite good economic management &mdash; and, as I remarked in the Dáil yesterday, the Government's record is second to none on this respect &mdash; it is simply not possible to control all the forces that affect commercial life.  What the State can do, however, is to try to improve the environment that assists and encourages companies to cope with difficulties which arise, whether as a result of international developments or otherwise. That, of course, is the purpose of the measure before the House today.</P>
      <P>The decision to accelerate the passage of these particular provisions is a recognition that significant extra difficulties may be faced by Irish companies as a result of the present unrest in the Middle East, and that to wait for the passage of the main companies Bill later this year might deprive some companies of the benefits of having this particular type of mechanism in place.</P>
      <P>Turning to the Bill itself, the provisions involved provide what I believe will be a valuable new mechanism for the rescue and return to health of ailing, but potentially viable companies.  I would not normally expect to see them being used by healthy companies or, indeed, in the final analysis by firms without prospects of future viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central feature of what is being proposed is the appointment to a company by the High Court of an expert &mdash; called an examiner in the Bill &mdash; and the placing of the company concerned under the protection of the court for a limited period.  Essentially, in order to &ldquo;qualify&rdquo; for protection, the company concerned must, under section 2 of the Bill, be unable to pay their debts, or be likely to be unable to pay their debts.  At the same time that section gives guidance to the <Col N="1061" /> court as to whether the company should get protection &mdash; in other words, it may take a view as to whether the company have a chance of survival as a going concern.</P>
    <P>Petitions for the appointment of an examiner can, under the Bill, be sought by creditors or shareholders of the company, by the company or by their directors. In the case of shareholders, section 3 provides a standard cut-off point whereby they must hold at least 10 per cent of the share capital in order to apply to the court.</P>
    <P>From the date the court becomes involved, the debts of the company will effectively be frozen, since under section 5 no enforcement action can then be taken by creditors.  Neither can proceedings for a winding-up of the company be commenced, nor a receiver appointed. The purpose of this stay is to preserve the <i>status quo</i>, to enable the company to be stabilised and the process of rehabilitation to be put in place.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise, however, that the temporary suspension of these normal remedies or procedures is only being allowed within the specific parameters set out in the Bill, under the supervision of the High Court and with the aim of achieving the restoration to health of companies in financial difficulty.  Granting this breathing space is designed to allow the company's difficulties to be resolved in an orderly way and in a less threatened environment.  The aim would be to achieve a result that is much more desirable than the result of any rash action to close the company.</P>
    <P>To provide for a situation where companies operate within a group, section 4 provides for the making of orders in the case of related companies.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps mention at this stage that in most cases the examiner might be expected to be just that &mdash; an examiner, analyst, diagnostician or whatever. However, it must be accepted that there will also be many cases where the examiner will have to take action himself, in terms of asset disposal, trading policies <Col N="1062" /> and so on which the existing management is either unwilling or incapable of doing.</P>
    <P>For example, there may be an asset which is a drain on the company's resources but which in the normal course of events could not be sold because it is subject to a charge.  Subject to provisions recognising the interest of the security holder, section 11 of the Bill will allow the court to authorise the disposal of such an asset by the examiner.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the assets might need to be protected if there was a danger that action might be taken in relation to those assets by the directors or management which might prejudice the interests of the company or its creditors.  In such circumstances section 9 will allow the court to order that all or any of the powers of the directors can only be exercised by the examiner.</P>
    <P>While the main role of the examiner is, of course, not to run the company, the court may nevertheless feel that giving the examiner control of certain functions would be in the best interests of the company or its creditors.  Once the examiner is in place, he will carry out an initial assessment of the company's affairs and if he considers from this initial assessment that the company, or part of it, can be saved, he will proceed to draw up a rescue plan.</P>
    <P>The examiner will, of course, have a vital need for a full flow of management information, and sections 8 and 9 will give him some important powers in this respect.  As a start, he must be given details of the company's assets and liabilities and information relating to creditors, within seven days of his appointment.  In addition he will be able to attend all meetings of the directors as well as general meetings of the company.</P>
    <P>In cases where a provisional liquidator or a receiver have already been appointed to a company it is important that the court can ensure in subsequently appointing an examiner that the actions of either the receiver or the provisional liquidator do not frustrate the rescue process.  Section 6, therefore, will allow the court to make certain types of orders in relation to both.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> Having conducted his initial assessment of the company the examiner will report back to the court within three weeks of his appointment and section 16 sets out what that report must contain. While obviously containing financial information, it must also give the examiner's view as to whether the company and the whole or part of its undertaking would be capable of survival as a going concern, what conditions are essential to ensure such survival and whether compromise proposals might be more advantageous to shareholders and creditors than the winding-up of the company. The examiner must also give his own recommendations as to what course should be taken including, if warranted, actual draft compromise proposals.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the examiner's initial assessment is that the company would not be capable of survival, then the court must hold a hearing at which all affected shareholders are entitled to be heard.  Following the hearing the court may make an order as to what should happen to the company &mdash; for example, whether it should remain under the protection of the court, wound up, or some other course of action would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Assuming, however, that the examiner's initial response is favourable, he would, as I mentioned earlier, proceed to the next phase without a court hearing. This would obviously involve rounds of discussions with classes of creditors and shareholders, meetings of various kinds and so on, in an effort to work out an acceptable rescue package or, in the terms of the Bill, compromise proposals.</P>
    <P>These proposals must contain certain specific information and meet certain criteria set out in section 22.  They must, for example, provide equal treatment for each claim or interest of a particular class of creditors or shareholders.  They must also show how the different classes would be affected and provide for mechanisms as to how the ovarall plan is to be implemented.  One particularly useful piece of information to be included is an effective comparison between the effect <Col N="1064" /> of the proposals as against the probable financial outcome of a winding-up for the various parties involved.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us should underestimate the difficulty of doing this and it really will take a major effort, even in the smallest of companies, to make the whole thing work.  However, assuming there is sufficient agreement to his proposals, the examiner can then seek to have them confirmed by the court.  For its part the court must be satisfied that the proposals meet certain tests &mdash; for example, that they are fair and equitable to any class of members or creditors that have not accepted them and whose claims or interests would be impaired.  If the court confirms the plan, it will be binding on everyone concerned, the examiner's appointment will be at an end and the company will cease to be under the protection of the court.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the value of consultation with the creditors of the company and allows the court to direct that a committee of creditors be appointed to assist the examiner.  I would like here to point out that the need to keep all interested parties informed is catered for throughout the Bill.  For example, notification of the presentation of a petition in the first place must be delivered to the Registrar of Companies straightaway; when the examiner is appointed notifications must be published; the examiner must give the committee of creditors, if there is one, a copy of the proposals and there are provisions for consultations with members and creditors on the proposals.</P>
    <P>The whole system is designed to operate within a tight timescale.  I strongly believe that this is the only way of ensuring that the mechanism can be successful and used to the full.  In fact, one of the main criticisms of similar systems operating elsewhere is that they can be too long drawn out and, therefore, obviously too costly.</P>
    <P>It is important that all those affected by the use of the provisions of this Bill should be reassured by the certainty that the system being introduced is to operate within this tightly defined timescale. <Col N="1065" /> Thus, the court protection period is restricted to three months, with an additional 30 days if needed to facilitate the examiner in the preparation of his final report.  There are also time limits within which the examiner must furnish his reports &mdash; the one giving his initial assessment within three weeks of his appointment and the second one containing his actual proposals within a further three weeks.  Again, I know these limits are quite demanding, but there are so many interests to be balanced in this whole process that, quite literally, time is of the essence.</P>
    <P>While it is not the practice to discuss the financial affairs of individual companies, I took the opportunity yesterday in the Dáil to disclose information relating to the affairs of Goodman International, about whose position there has been substantial speculation and comment. I was authorised by IBI Corporate Finance Limited, on behalf of Goodman International and Goodman Holdings, to provide that information in relation to Goodman International and other relevant companies.  For the benefit of Senators, I will give the same information here from the communication I received from IBI Corporate Finance Limited in a letter to me dated 27th August 1990 and I would emphasise that I am now quoting:</P>
    <P>As at 17th August, 1990, Goodman International and its subsidiaries (other than Food Industries plc) owed banks approximately IR£460 million which had been available on an unsecured short term basis.  In addition, banks had guaranteed obligations in respect of the performance of Goodman International and its subsidiaries (other than Food Industries plc) under beef supply contracts in an amount of approximately IR£200 million.</P>
    <P>Goodman International and its subsidiaries (other than Food Industries plc) are owed IR£180 million by Iraqi entities, this figure includes £11 million of interest due.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> Goodman International and its subsidiaries (other than Food Industries plc) are owed IR £203 million by other companies owned by Goodman Holdings of which it is estimated not more than IR £90 million will be recovered.</P>
    <P>Shareholders funds of Goodman International as shown by the consolidated accounts to 31st December, 1989 were IR £191 million and the net worth of Goodman Holdings as at that date was IR £273 million.  These did not take into account any major provisions in relation to the Iraqi debt or amount owning by other subsidiaries of Goodman Holdings which now stand at the amount stated above.</P>
    <P>The trading operations of Goodman International continue to be substantially profitable before interest which mainly arises from the failure to receive payment for beef shipments to Iraq and the inability of other subsidiaries of Goodman Holdings to repay the debt outstanding.</P>
    <P>Food Industries plc is a separate listed company with its own independent board of directors and management. It continues to trade profitably and arranges its own finance independently.  It has virtually no trading links with Goodman International There is no inter-dependence of borrowings between Food Industries plc and other subsidiaries of Goodman Holdings and/or Goodman International. The links between Food Industries plc and Goodman International are the ownership of 68% and some common directors.</P>
    <P>I repeat that this information was provided to me by IBI Corporate Finance Limited.</P>
    <P>I would like at this stage to comment on the beef industry, its achievements and some of its problems.  The pre-eminent position of the cattle and beef industry in the Irish economy is best illustrated by the fact that it contributes some 10 per cent to gross domestic product.  Output of cattle and calves for 1989 was valued at £1,211 million or 36 per cent of gross <Col N="1067" /> agricultural output, while cattle and beef exports amounted to £760 million and represented 32 per cent of total agricultural exports and 5.2 per cent of total exports.  If export refunds are included, export earnings from the beef sector increase to £1,010 million and their contribution to agricultural exports and total exports increase to 43 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.</P>
    <P>The beef sector has achieved very significant progress over the past 20 years in terms of moving away from live exports and increasing value-added exports.  This situation is evident from the fact that our live cattle exports represented 46 per cent of the total destined for export in 1969 and less than 11 per cent by 1989.  Indeed, the level of live exports to destinations outside of the island of Ireland in 1989 was down to less than 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Over the same 20 year period the industry progressed from producing cattle for export and subsequent slaughter in other countries to one which now exports 75 per cent of our cattle output as beef to destinations throughout the world.  It has progressed from then exporting 87 per cent of our beef in the bone-in state and only 13 per cent boneless to now exporting 58 per cent boneless and 42 per cent bone-in.  There are some 100,000 farmers involved in the production of cattle, the raw material of the industry.  The industry is also of major benefit to the services sector particularly in the area of transport.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that our membership of the EC and the access to the various support schemes have contributed more to the increased production of the beef industry over the last 20 years than has our access to the large EC market of consumers.  We have manifestly failed to penetrate this sophisticated and increasingly valuable continental EC market to any significant degree, a market where we sell only 40 per cent of steer production. As a consequence we have relied on volatile Middle East markets as outlets for much of our beef exports.  Serious problems have recently arisen in our principal markets abroad.  Examples of these <Col N="1068" /> include the following.  We stand to lose a major outlet for our beef due to the embargo on trade with Iraq.  This embargo prevents all exports of beef to a destination which took 51,000 tonnes of Irish beef in 1989 and which could reasonably have been expected, in the absence of the embargo, to take between 30,000 and 40,000 tonnes in the remainder of this year, an export quantity which we now stand to lose.  There is a widespread threat to our third country exports in general due to the BSE scare.  Iran and Egypt are of most serious concern.  Iran, which is the most important of the third countries with which we have BSE problems, took 61,000 tonnes of Irish beef in 1989.  The demand for beef in the UK and the Continent is down by at least 10 per cent and there is little prospect of a significant improvement in the short term.  The outlets for our live cattle have also been affected, particularly in Libya, by concern about BSE.</P>
    <P>Overall, if the present situation continues unchanged, the prospect is that over the September-December period the only realistic outlet for our beef will be the intervention system.  Under existing arrangements for intervention the safety-net mechanism which gives guaranteed access to intervention for certain categories of steers is operating and we anticipate that this will continue for the rest of the year.  However, this will not take all of the steers and heifers and cows do not qualify for intervention under existing EC rules.  While this safety net is of assistance to our industry it is an expensive system for the Community and there may be some difficulties when the system comes up for review again at the end of 1990.</P>
    <P>The possibility of difficulties arising for companies generally because of the current Middle East crisis has accentuated the desirability of having these provisions put in place as soon as possible.  Notwithstanding that I have given details in one particular case, I want to stress again that today's measure is one of general application.  It should, therefore, I suggest, be judged on its potential to meet the needs of companies in general, as <Col N="1069" /> were the provisions contained in Part IX of the 1987 Bill.  I hope that the Seanad's previous experience of that Bill will assist the passage through the House today of the similar measure which is now before it.  I am confident that the Bill will be an encouragement to firms experiencing difficulties to tackle in a new way their problems at an early stage and initiate action that can ensure their continued existence.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the passage of the Bill into law, and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing a piece of legislation today that went through the House some three years ago. At that time the Bill was accorded exceptional treatment here.  The then Minister accepted scores of amendments which certainly enhanced the legislation.  I recall long and earnest discussions on the whole question of insolvency, the area before the House today.  The only amendments that I tabled to that very comprehensive Bill during the course of the discussions here related to this group of sections.</P>
      <P>The underlying problems the Oireachtas are dealing with are the first effects of the war in the Middle East &mdash; and thankfully it is still a cold war.  This House must, I submit, expel personalities from our considerations and devote our efforts to the harsh economic effect of the embargo on our developed trade and on the consequent frightening knock-on effects, not just for workers in our meat factories but for farmers and the factory operatives in other industries which have close ties with the processed or added value beef industry &mdash; the paper and packaging industry for example, the plastic and tape manufacturers and indeed, as the Minister has said, the transport and shipping companies.  All of these, I take it, have not been left for payment for their goods and services as long as Goodman International has been left by the Government of Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main factor for Mr. Goodman's <Col N="1070" /> success, as I see it, in his dealings with Irish farmers over the past 30 years was that he paid on the nail, as it were, for livestock or any other farm produce he dealt in.  I think it is true to say that he paid substantial sums to farmers for produce delivered in good faith by them to factories that failed for whatever reason and ones that he then took over. It is well known that the Goodman companies bailed out concerns like Dublin Meats, DJS in Donegal and Clover Meats.  Indeed, if my memory serves me, that organisation paid in excess of £2 million to farmers in good faith to rescue them from the effects of the Clover Meats affair.  At that time the Government and the farming community were very glad that the Goodman Group helped to pick up the pieces and we have a colleague in the House who was very severely affected by the Clover closure.</P>
    <P>Just as our Government used the opportunities presented to them to successfully liberate Mr. Brian Keenan, much to the pleasure and delight of persons of goodwill everywhere, so too must we look to and support every effort to ensure that our citizens who availed of work opportunities and positions in both Iraq and Kuwait are allowed home safely. This, we must recognise, represents a most difficult task for our Government and I think we must be supportive of the Government's efforts in that area.</P>
    <P>The Government must be part of and supportive of the United Nations Resolutions and of the policies of the European Community.  If I were an Austrian citizen I would hang my head in shame at the action of their President.  How can a statesman condone the actions and posturing of Iraq just 51 years after 1939, unless one supported the policies of expansion then as now.</P>
    <P>The Government are asking this House to pass legislation today to prevent the collapse of the Goodman Group.  The prospects facing the agricultural industry before this recent bombshell were bad enough, but this collapse could be the final straw.  There are thousands of families <Col N="1071" /> deeply concerned because of recent developments.  Many jobs are at risk and many small businesses are facing possible closure yet the Government remain silent about the circumstances which brought about this sad situation.  The failure of the Taoiseach and his Ministers &mdash; particularly those involved in 1987 &mdash; to disclose publicly the circumstances which led to the reintroduction of the export credit insurance or goods to Iraq in 1987 forces me to ask the Minister to set up an inquiry into events at that time.</P>
    <P>The decision of the present Minister for Finance and his colleagues to restore export credit insurance cover clearly signals support by the Government for the development and expansion of trade with Iraq.  I refer my colleagues to the various debates in the Oireachtas where there is clear evidence to support what I have just said.  Deputy A. Reynolds when introducing the Insurance Export Guarantee Bill, 1988, as Minister for Industry and Commerce said that as a result of the successful growth in business contacts in Iraq and in the context of the Irish/Iraqi Joint Commission, it was decided to provide export credit facilities in respect of Iraq.  He also said that this was a positive development in terms of sustaining export growth in the long term.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ray Burke, answering in the Dáil on 3 May 1989, as Minister for Industry and Commerce said: &ldquo;For my part, I would like to confirm the Government's confidence in the well being of our economic relations with Iraq&rdquo;.  This action was taken and these things were said at a time when many other European countries, so far as one can judge decided not to grant cover for Iraq because the risks were too high because of the war.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten either that in 1986 the Government decided not to underwrite any further risks for Iraq because of the risks involved.  There is an obligation on the Government to explain why they took the decision to restore insurance cover for that country and to expose this country to potential liabilities well in excess of £100 million.  We should <Col N="1072" /> be told why they encouraged the expansion and development of trade, particularly in the beef sector, with Iraq.</P>
    <P>We should be given details of the discussions which took place between the Government and Goodman International in 1987 in relation to contracts for the supply of meat to Iraq.  We should also be told if discussions took place between the Taoiseach and members of the Government and representatives of the Goodman Group and, indeed, Mr. Goodman himself regarding the provision of export credit insurance to cover contracts secured for the supply of meat to that country.  Were members of the Government aware that in order to fulfil the contracts some meat would have to be provided from outside our jurisdiction?</P>
    <P>These are all relevant points especially when one considers the litigation between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and this group on the cessation of the export insurance scheme.  It is unfortunate that the Goodman Group is now owed such a colossal amount of money by Iraq.  The Irish economy faces enormous difficulties.  I should like to ask the Minister if meat is the only commodity for which the Government of Iraq have been slow to pay.  Can we expect that other Irish companies will find themselves in the same situation?  For example, if they did not pay for the medical services provided by PARC, would the losses sustained deal a crippling blow to Aer Lingus?  Would their third subsidiary find itself in financial difficulties? These are disturbing questions.</P>
    <P>The Minister should withdraw the court action and pay the export insurance cover to the Goodman Group because if that case were to prove successful from the organisation's side there would not be much use paying £80 million or £100 million to them if in five or six months time they go into liquidation.  These are disturbing problems.  The farming industry face huge uncertainties at a time when farm incomes are on the decline and margins are once again being significantly reduced.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us, as the Minister has so very clearly pointed out, is Part IX of <Col N="1073" /> the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  We had a very long and indepth discussion on every aspect of that legislation as it progressed through this House over a period of 15 or 18 months.  There was some criticism that the legislation was passing too slowly, but many amendments proposed and accepted enhanced that legislation.  Members recognise the benefit of having these kinds of provisions in place, as they are in the US and the UK, for example.  Our companies and exporters are entitled to the best possible protection if difficulties arise as a result of activities outside their control.</P>
    <P>I wish the passage of this Bill success. I hope the Minister will bear in mind not just the problems facing one company but the knock-on effect.  I had hoped we would have an opportunity to go into the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage and I very much regret that the agreement reached yesterday has been changed without notice.  That is an unfortunate way of dealing with what is probably the most important legislation to come before the House in a long time.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain how he sees the examiner having access to funds in order to keep a company ticking over, particularly in the early days of his appointment.  The reality is, I presume, that wages will have to be paid and creditors, who would be asked to continue to supply goods or services must be satisfied that there are funds to cover their costs.  There are many areas that need clarification.  Our experience of this Bill, especially Part IX, is that it needs solid and painstaking consideration.  I believe that more than one company will be affected by the difficulties in the Middle East.  It is useful to point out that the Goodman company traded profitably for the last 30 years and their salient feature, which is very much appreciated, is their prompt payment to the farming community.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of export credit insurance after it had been reintroduced with guarantees by the Government is very important.  I doubt if that export trade would have continued without <Col N="1074" /> some very definite guarantees.  The House is entitled to a clear statement on the situation regarding the withdrawal of that insurance cover.</P>
    <P>The third point I wish to make is very appropriate.  While I agree that the Government must be very much part of and supportive of the United Nations resolution, the Minister should have been aware of the knock-on effects and difficulties that would arise by his support of sanctions.  The whole question of the propriety of including food as part of a blockade sends shivers down the backs of many Irish households.  It is over 150 years since we had the Famine but it is a very live issue in our folklore and in the minds of third and fourth generations of Irish people.  Very few people would be supportive of an international campaign to starve out a whole country of people just because another large country want to secure their supply of a very valuable commodity.  Do we really subscribe to the policy of starvation of innocent people in our legitimate desire to see justice for Kuwait?</P>
    <P>I put the case to the Minister that perhaps he and the Government should consider seriously withdrawing the court proceedings and the claim for insurance payment at this stage.  If that payment were made it would go a long way towards ensuring that many jobs would be saved and that the cloud which is hanging over many people and households would be lifted.</P>

The facts are that the Whips have agreed on 15 minute contributions from Members and on a ten-minute contribution from the Minister but it was not put onto the record of the House formally and this is merely regularising that position.  You can take it as of now, given that it has been proposed by the Government Whip and agreed by those members of the Opposition here present, that we are now operating a schedule as outlined by Senator Wright.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to set an example in regard to the time standards which have been laid down.  I congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. O'Malley, all his officials and the Government on the alacrity they have displayed in putting the Companies (Amendment) Bill together and presenting it to both Houses.  It is particularly timely and appropriate that the decision should have been taken to recall both Houses of the Oireachtas in order to implement this very important legislation in view of the Gulf crisis and the possible repercussions and reverberations this might have on companies throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am glad that, by and large, the majority of the Members of Dáil Éireann avoided, in general, the temptation to use the occasion to involve themselves in a political dogfight or the settling of old scores because of this issue.  It was particularly heartening to see that the debate in the other House, through all stages, was constructive and the degree of cooperation shown between the Opposition parties and the Government was excellent. I hope that all Members of this House will respond in like manner and as responsibly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been indicated by the Minister, this Bill is virtually identical with Part 4 of the Companies Bill as it had been agreed and passed in special committee. The new Bill to enact Part IX of the old Companies Bill has only relatively minor changes from the original Bill which has already come before the Dáil and <Col N="1076" /> Seanad.  Such changes as have been made have been purely to permit Part IX to stand alone.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that some people, not necessarily all politicians but some media personnel, have also been involved, have seen fit to misrepresent the intentions of the Minister, his Department and the Government with regard to the emergency legislation before the House and the need to pass it as soon as possible.  This Bill is not designed for any particular single company.  It is for all those who might be affected as a result of the crisis that has arisen internationally.</P>
    <P>The horrendous and frightening events in the Gulf States which could not have been foreseen and which happened like a bolt out of the blue, sent shock waves throughout the financial markets of the world.  This, unfortunately, has led to a real crisis in stock exchanges.  It has resulted in major falls in the exchanges in Wall Street, Tokyo, London and our own Stock Exchange.  As a consequence, millions of pounds, dollars, yens and Deutsche Marks have been wiped off the value of shares.  This has been one major effect of the Gulf crisis.  The interdependence of the finances of individual countries on each other has been clearly exemplified by the events of the last three or four weeks and the relative volatility of the international financial market has been clearly exposed and its vulnerability in the face of calamity is now clearer than it may have been heretofore.  For example, who would have thought that almost $400 billion would have been wiped off the capital value of shares on the New York Stock Exchange over the last three weeks?  Who would have thought that the comparative value of sterling on the international money markets would have risen to the height it has as overseas investors buy into British high interest rates and visualise the benefits of sterling's residual status as a relatively new found petro-currency?  Those examples clarify for us the amazing changes which can take place on the international financial markets and within the currency value ratings in a matter of a few weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> Since these events have clearly shattered and altered the world's money markets, it is obvious that they would impact themselves to a major degree on many companies who had a dependence on trading within the troubled regions of the Gulf State countries.  There are many companies throughout the world, both public and private, who have had major trading relations with many of the Gulf States and, because of the Gulf war, they are now exposed.  They are in a very vulnerable position.  I am aware of a number of companies in the United Kingdom who will be put to the wall, if not go bust, as a result of the crisis.  They are companies who for commercial reasons, traded to a very high extent with the Gulf States and, as a consequence, are now in a most difficult position.  It is clearly obvious that companies who had major trade dealings with Iraq will be even more exposed than those who dealt with the other Gulf States because of the agreed embargo and sanctions on trade with that country.</P>
    <P>Ireland is just one of many countries which will suffer because of the activities in the Gulf States and, because of the possible extent of the repercussions on our small and very open economy, it is only right, appropriate and proper that the Government should try to find some way of limiting the damage for the sake of the employees who work for these companies and those who trade with them, all of whom may suffer disastrously as a consequence.  I am pleased that the Government have grasped the nettle. The knock-on effects throughout our economy could be disastrous and many thousands of people's livelihoods would be seriously damaged, if not wrecked, if action had not been taken.</P>
    <P>In discussing the Bill it would be totally inappropriate to concentrate on the problems of any individual company because the Bill is obviously framed and presented as a stand alone part of the original companies Bill.  As such, the main thrust of the legislation was already encompassed within the original Bill and was taken in cognisance of the fact that <Col N="1078" /> events can arise and, indeed, have which could put companies into a precarious situation.  Those companies could possibly trade themselves out of their difficulties given the opportunity to do so and so be salvaged.  This legislation is not for any single company.  It can be availed of by any company which qualifies under the terms described by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The analogy the Minister has put to us with regard to the rescue of companies, and in relation to the medical connotations that are contained in it, are appropriate and simplify the interpretation of this for many people. Clearly, it is intended to help to cure on a permanent basis those who are temporarily ill.  It is not intended to be used by healthy companies or by companies who are terminally ill and in their dying throes.  It would not work in such situations. It is intended to provide a breathing space for potentially viable companies who have short-term cashflow problems or are in trading difficulties.  It is being produced to provide adequate and safe protection under the careful scrutiny of the courts following detailed reports by the examiner.  It will prevent the liquidation of potentially viable companies and will protect potentially viable companies from having to take fire brigade action in relation to the sales of some of their assets.  It will allow them time and a breathing space in which to resolve their difficulties in an orderly way which should result in a more desirable long-term future than that which might result from rushed actions in either closing the companies or the fire brigade action of selling assets.</P>
    <P>Time, well-thought out and organised actions can be vital in rescuing companies in the face of apparent impending financial disaster.  This gives an opportunity for reflection so that the best overall approach can be taken to overcome the difficulties to the benefit of all &mdash; the country, the company, the creditors and employees, thus ensuring that the &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; which we so often hear about after the collapse or the liquidation of a company, would not arise.  We have all heard that if this bank or that financial <Col N="1079" /> institution had held fire and did not ditch a certain company into the arms of a receiver or liquidator all would have been well given time and patience by the financial institutions concerned.  How often have all of us listened to those comments with either sympathy or in total disbelief?  I have been told such stories on many occasions but was never quite sure what to believe because the gates had been opened and the horses had bolted.  At least now there will be no place for the &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; stories.</P>
    <P>In general, I think highly of our financial institutions but, like the rest of us, they are not infallible and they too make mistakes.  They can be very much like an ailing company who sometimes precipitately panics and take fire brigade action in relation to the sale of assets. Sometimes financial institutions also panic and rush madly to liquidators to salvage their loans to companies, without thinking the issue through to see if there is a better way.</P>
    <P>This Bill should ensure that this does not arise any more.  We are all well aware that this emergency legislation has focused special attention on the beef trade and the ramifications of this on the national economy and farmers' incomes. That is reasonable and fair given that the beef industry constitutes approximately 10 per cent of our gross national product and 36 per cent of our agricultural output.</P>
    <P>The very rapid development of the beef trade over the past 15 to 20 years has been one of our outstanding achievements and, in particular, the progression from live exports to increasing value-added exports, as exemplified by the fact that our live exports in 1969 were 46 per cent as against 11 per cent in 1989 and our live exports to destinations outside Ireland last year were just 3 per cent. This development and achievement has had major spin-off effects on the national economy.  Now some 5,000 people are directly employed in the meat processing industry and approximately 100,000 farmers are directly involved in cattle production.  The knock-on effects of this progression have been huge and have <Col N="1080" /> benefited the entire economy and the living standards of a large section of our society.  Consequently, an impending disaster in our cattle industry would have major knock-on effects in a downward direction on farm incomes and the incomes of all involved in the cattle industry.</P>
    <P>The Government have a duty to protect, in as far as they can, this major part of our economy.  The sanctions on trade with Iraq will cost us nationally the loss of some 40,000 tonnes of beef this year, an enormous loss to our economy. The cattle industry is getting a lifeline now.  There are probably other companies besides the one that has been spoken about and so well publicised, who may have to seek the protection and comfort of the examiner and the courts in this crisis.  I hope this is not the case but at least we, as legislators, will have done our duty in providing the necessary legislative structures to deal with the crisis.</P>
    <P>I realise that there may be some imperfections in this legislation; there is nothing completely perfect or correct.  I am glad that there will be tighter restrictions on the time scale in this Bill as distinct from, say, the old Chapter 11 system as it operates in the United States which is a long-drawn-out system, very ineffective, costly and does not seem to work.  We will have an opportunity to observe the workings of this legislation, the amendment to the Companies Acts. I hope we will not have too many opportunities but I have no doubt that we will see how it works and perhaps, if necessary, we can alter and amend it when the full Companies Bill comes before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak.  I cannot say that I really welcome the Bill and I believe the Government have been less than honest <Col N="1081" /> in their statements about it.  I listened over the weekend to various Government Ministers claiming that this had nothing whatever to do with the collapse of a particular company namely, the Goodman company.  Any simple-minded citizen of this State knows this is not the case.  What else is it related to if it is not related to this company?  Why was this date chosen if it is not related to a crisis in the Goodman company?  Why are we told that the Seanad must conclude this debate by 2 p.m. if there is not some particular urgency that relates to a particular company?  Therefore, first of all, I have to reject what the Government have said with regard to the reasons for rushing this Bill through.  I also express general concern at the way in which this happens and at the readiness of the Government to come to the rescue of their own friends.  Let there be no mistake, this is precisely what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask a few general questions before I get into some technical matters regarding the precise operation of the Bill itself.  How is it that the Goodman company obtained such enormous unsecured tranches of credit running into hundreds of millions of pounds secured against nothing in terms of the company's assets, secured only against the personal guarantee of Mr. Goodman?  This seems a quite extraordinary arrangement and I wonder why it was allowed.  I wonder is there, to use an oft-quoted phrase of political hackery these days, a level playing field.  What about the small people? Is that lady in New York right?  I cannot remember her name &mdash; the property tycoon who claimed that only the small people paid taxes.  Are we to assume that there are certain differentials operated by banks here with regard to particular forms of creditor?  Was Mr. Goodman a preferential creditor?  What rates of interest was he expected to pay?  Why is it stated in newspapers this morning, for example, that he is going to be allowed to wipe away very substantial amounts, running into millions of pounds, of bad debt?  The average person with a mortgage will wonder why this is the case and <Col N="1082" /> if there is something special about Mr. Goodman.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask if there is any longer anything special about Fianna Fáil, the Republican party.  What kind of republic are they now leading us into?  I am not an expert on the beef industry; I am an ordinary, average citizen of this country. I have watched &mdash; as I believe the majority of the citizens have &mdash; with astonishment the unparalleled concentration of power in the hands of one person financially.  Five per cent of our gross national product and 40 per cent of our beef industry, accumulated over a very short space of time, was concentrated in the hands of one private individual.</P>
    <P>As an ordinary person listening to the news, watching the television and reading the newspapers I witnessed over the last few years massive campaigns all over the countryside including the advice of a number of politicians to shareholders in co-operatives to allow themselves to be absorbed into the Goodman empire, as it was called.  They were promised financial rewards for this, a good deal.  I wonder how those people are feeling this morning or this week when they see this little carrot of greed exposed as the hollow sham that it was.  I wonder if we can have some comments on that, because we have watched this accumulation of power grow into a kind of South Sea bubble that has now, apparently, burst and we are expected to gallop in to the rescue.</P>
    <P>I listened during the week to another programme on which a small farmer with a farm of about 70 or 80 acres was being interviewed.  He said it was increasingly difficult for him, with bank interest charges and so on, to deal with the economic circumstances of his life.  He was being forced off the land, forced out.  I think from what I heard that he was probably one of those whose small holding was established by the operations of the Land Commission which broke up the large estates.  He said what an extraordinary irony it was for him in this republic to find that, his family having been given those 70 or 80 acres of land, economic circumstances were now pushing him out <Col N="1083" /> and that his holding would inevitably be taken over by what he called a rancher. There will only be ranchers; there will not be many more small farmers because they are being pushed out.</P>
    <P>We have seen this massive concentration also with the cattle business at the level of co-operatives, the dairy industry, the beef industry and so on.  It seems that to Fianna Fáil big is beautiful and the bigger the more beautiful.  This has tragic consequences for people in this country.  I wonder, when I see the way in which we are being brought back here, why the rights of the people involved in the Gateaux strike, for example, were treated with such contempt in the Seanad this morning.  I asked for a debate and was told there just would not be one and I was given no explanation.  What about the workers of Irish Shipping, some of them with 40 years service, individuals with very little financial muscle who have been defrauded by the State out of their pension rights, assets sold off and applied to general State purposes, not to the pension funds?  We are talking of the pension funds of people here.  It was the same with the Irish Sweepstake workers.  The assets of that, the land holdings out in Ballsbridge, were liquidated and disposed of back into the central assets of the State and eventually some piddling amount was made available &mdash; a couple of hundred thousand pounds, £3,000 or £4,000 each.  I wonder at the morality of this.  We are always being treated to hogwash, particularly in these Chambers, about the Christian and democratic nature of the State.  I wonder how Christian and democratic the divergence of attitudes is towards Gateaux, Irish Shipping and Sweepstake workers, on the one hand, and Mr. Goodman's enterprise on the other.</P>
    <P>I would like, as a footnote, to place on the record that I am involved in a company, I am the managing director and principal shareholder of a company, which has done work with regard to the gay community, the AIDS epidemic and so on, that has been recognised in this Chamber.  There was a debate here and all <Col N="1084" /> sides agreed that we must have money to rebuild the Hirschfield Centre which was burned down, probably maliciously.  It was supported by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights to which the Taoiseach gave responsibility to prioritise lottery funding.  It was approved for £50,000 by Dublin Corporation and it was axed a couple of weeks ago by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn.  I have been seeking a meeting with the Taoiseach for the last year to deal with this and today I got my first response in writing &mdash; he is unable to meet me but it will be borne in mind.  Of course, I am not Mr. Goodman; I am not dealing in beef and my market is not Iraq.</P>
    <P>We are all being so high flown and so moral about this situation.  I accept that jobs must be saved, but I wonder at the business acumen of these people.  I wonder at the business acumen of the banks who expose themselves to these risks.  We have seen it already in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland where bad commercial decisions were made by banks.  I wonder who is running our banks.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the market.  The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, is a man for whose business acumen I certainly have a great deal of respect.  Our earlier trading history with Iraq was certainly a happy one and as one who was involved in it, I am happy to acknowledge that.  I wonder how happy we all are today when we see the record of Saddam Hussein in human rights.  There is no equivalence between exporting beef and the country to which it is exported.  The market was a very dubious one in ethical terms because we knew perfectly well what was going on in Iraq and we did not give one solitary damn about it.</P>
    <P>Even in practical terms, what kind of a market was it for us to develop?  It was clearly unstable.  President Hussein only stayed in power by eliminating opposition. It was also inimical to everything this country stands for with very little respect for our traditions, beliefs and ideals.  I also wonder about the product. After all, we are having difficulties with <Col N="1085" /> marketing our beef internationally. There is the scare about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and there is also a growing distaste for red meat in the western European market.  Since this is a diminishing market, why this enormous investment in it?</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to one or two matters concerning export credits.  I do not want to rehash what has been said before but I would refer people who are interested to the speech made by the Minister, Deputy O'Malley on 10 May 1989 where he pointed out that the most extraordinary preferential treatment was being given to one company, and he named it &mdash; Goodman International. Three years ago he pointed out the dangers of exposing this country to this and he put his finger on the nub of the problem when he said that we would eventually be expected to pick up the tab when the situation exploded and it has exploded.  He suggested very clearly here that a large proportion &mdash; £50 million, £60 million or £70 million &mdash; of those export credits were being used to guarantee beef that did not originate in this country and here we are today rescuing and propping up this company.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask a question which, the Minister might answer or the examiner will look into.  In terms of the patriotism of Mr. Goodman, is it true that when the initial contract with Iraq went through, the haulage contract did not go on the open market but instead was secured through the Bulgarian state transport haulage company at preferential rates because they were capable of doing it at 25 per cent of the European normal cost for hard dollar currency?  If that is true, what does it tell us about the patriotism of Goodman International?</P>
    <P>I would like to ask a couple of questions with regard to the technicalities of the Bill because I have had some information from chartered accountants.  They point out that because of the complicated mechanisms involved, the usefulness of this Bill for small companies is questionable. They also question the need, for example, for Fóir Teoranta to be <Col N="1086" /> specifically identified since it would presumably fall within the definition of a creditor anyway.</P>
    <P>In relation to the appointment of an examiner, notwithstanding the prior appointment of a receiver, certain technical difficulties may flow from this: first the discharge of the company's preferential liabilities which were crystallised on the appointment of a receiver; secondly, the settlement of employee entitlements arising under various labour legislation; thirdly, the status of a signed contract for the sale of some or all of the assets; fourthly the commitments entered into by the receiver following his appointment; and fifthly, the appointment of an examiner in circumstances where the receiver has already ceased to trade.  It also should be pointed out that it would be unfortunate, or perhaps dangerous, to allow somebody who has already been appointed an examiner of a company like this subsequently to become the receiver.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to place on the record five principal points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Leas-Chathaoirleach's point and I will not abuse the time.  The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland have produced an exhaustive briefing which is available, and perhaps I can make it available to the Minister.  I do not have the opportunity to place it on the record of the House for the reasons indicated by the Leas-Chathaoirleach but it would be valuable to take into consideration the merits of their technical comments on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.  I would like to open with a quotation which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians are very small-minded. Frankly I couldn't care less about them.  They take up too much of our time and they certainly miss the bigger picture in relation to agriculture with <Col N="1087" /> their petty behaviour.  They really don't understand the industry and they are looking for political mileage.</P>
    <P>The House will be relieved to know those are not my words.  They were used in an interview last October which was broadcast on LM FM, which goes out in the north-east of Leinster, repeated on RTE and published in the agricultural press. The speaker in that interview, when referring to problems with the take-over in the milk sector, put it all down to politicians interfering with commerce.  It was stated then that politicians tended to stick their noses into things they did not understand and that they were not very interested in the opinions of those in the industry.  The person who said that went on to say that over the past two years in excess of 430,000 tonnes of beef had been sent to Iraq.  He added &ldquo;This year that market is not in operation; not one kilo of Irish beef is going there at present&rdquo;&mdash; that was last October.  They are the words of Larry Goodman.</P>
    <P>I can only wonder what he would have to say today and what the situation might be without the intervention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the politicians in both Houses, who do understand. That is not to take from Mr. Goodman's achievements and his contribution to the beef industry or to be unaware of our responsibilities to help to alleviate the present difficulties which have profound implications, not just for the agricultural sector but for the whole economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation before the House and I congratulate the Minister on acting quickly and decisively to help companies cope with the unique and difficult trading conditions caused by the crisis in the Gulf and, in particular, for moving to safeguard the beef industry. The Minister referred to the general application of the Bill and I am glad that companies which might run into trouble, and which are capable of trading out of their difficulties, will be given the chance, within a tight timescale, to avoid immediate winding up and receivership and to seek the protection of the courts.</P>
    <P>It is notable that under section 3 creditors <Col N="1088" /> also have recourse to the courts.  I do not subscribe to the notion which has been canvassed in several areas over the last few days that this legislation will make either domestic or foreign banks any more reluctant to advance money. It could be argued that a more prudent approach to lending by the banks in the past might have diminished the necessity for the urgency of this legislation. Responsible profitable companies do not have any reason to fear that their legitimate borrowing requirements will be affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill's strength is that it allows an independent assessment to be made of the state of a company and that under sections 8 and 9 the examiner is given adequate power to establish the facts. Yesterday in the Dáil, and this morning in the Seanad, the Minister gave an outline of the financial position of Goodman International as supplied to him by IBI Corporate Finance Limited.  It is my hope that if and when an examiner is appointed it will be possible to unravel what I suspect is a very complicated web.</P>
    <P>Our greatest priority in this House must be to ensure that farmers will have an outlet for their beef, that they will get paid for the 800,000 cattle that will be available to slaughter between now and the end of the year and that the jobs of the 5,000 people in the meat processing sector are protected.  That must be our primary responsibility.  The crisis in the cattle trade is bad enough, and farmers are losing heavily enough, without matters being made worse.  A heading in this morning's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> which states that £700 million is needed to save the beef trade was not very helpful.  It is true that if one multiplied 800,000 cattle by their price per head one would come up with that figure but that is to suggest that they will all be bought and paid for in one day, whereas the money is turned over.  The figure is substantially less than that.</P>
    <P>Nationally, a build-up in disposable stock numbers is a good thing and we have recovered to something like the 1986 peak of finished cattle but if farmers cannot dispose of those cattle at a profit <Col N="1089" /> it will not be long before the numbers will be moving in the wrong direction again.  The huge seasonal imbalance in the slaughtering of cattle here is undesirable. Killing half of our cattle in the final quarter of the year and having factories closed or on short-time for the rest of the year is undesirable.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's view about the achievements of the beef industry since we joined the Common Market but I also share his view about the missed opportunities in relation to how we have marketed, or mis-marketed, our beef to a population of 350 million consumers within the European Community.  The extreme seasonality to which I referred, is a product of the EC system which discourages winter fattening.  It is hoped that the scope of intervention can be extended, that initiatives to secure Iranian and other Middle East contracts will be successful and that the problems in relation to the disposal of cows and heifers can be dealt with.  Our immediate problem is how we deal with the numbers that will come on the market over the next four months.</P>
    <P>This legislation must be central in helping in that regard.  That is not to say that Goodman International should get one red cent in assistance from the Government. Such help would be entirely inappropriate and, quite rightly, would not be tolerated by the taxpayer.  It should not be the Government's or the taxpayers' responsibility to pick up the pieces from very private companies who take risks in the expectation of large profits which they intend to retain, and even less so for those who use funds to build a stake in the stock market or in property.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer has already reason to be grateful to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for his action in cancelling export credit insurance on beef sent to Iraq.  His foresight in this regard looks like saving the hard-pressed Irish taxpayer in the order of £180 million.  If it is possible at present to make £60 to £80 a head out of each steer sold into intervention, it should be possible for any plant owner killing cattle to make a tidy profit.  The fact that that sort of aid and <Col N="1090" /> assistance is available, not that it is not badly needed, explains our inability to market effectively on the European market.  Presumably, those selling to high risk countries would, in the normal course of events, expect to make even more than that.</P>
    <P>The perils of too much dominance within the sector has already been referred to this morning and that is particularly evident in relation to commodity purchasing.  Those perils have been well aired and, but for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it is probable that things would be even worse than they are.  The phrase, a level playing field, is a cliche that has been used in recent debates in this House and elsewhere but I wonder to what extent the co-operative meat plants, and other smaller players in the field, failed to survive because they were playing by the EC's Government rules while others may have been bending or ignoring the rules.</P>
    <P>There are many points I disagree with Senator Norris on but I share his view that the banks do not come out of this incident with very much credit, if that is the correct word to use.  It is hard to blame any farmer, or person with a mortgage, for being astonished to learn that many millions of pounds have been lent by the banks without any security.  Trade creditors who are looking for their money are likely to take the same view.  Farmers, or householders, who have lodged their deeds, worth five or ten times the value of their borrowing, cannot be blamed for feeling cynical about the conduct of banks.  Some small borrowers have suffered profoundly where they defaulted in such circumstances.  As a public representative from a rural area, I know of cases, like others, where that sort of hardship has been experienced.</P>
    <P>There have been achievements in the beef industry during the early years of operation of the Goodman group. However, we must now rebuild the beef slaughtering industry and I know that this legislation will help that process take place smoothly.  I congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the <Col N="1091" /> speed of his initiative and I am glad to see him in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first, and most mind-boggling contradiction in all this is that we were reassured last week that this was a routine matter, despite the fact that that could not have been true given that the recall of the Seanad is anything but routine.  Today's newspapers show us some of the dimensions of the iceberg but what we do not know at this stage is what the iceberg will look like when everything unfolds.  What we are seeing in the Larry Goodman crisis is to some extent part of a pattern in the beef industry.  It is most spectacular and damaging but it is part of a pattern.</P>
      <P>These series of collapses have been part and parcel of the meat industry over the past number of years.  They have given rise to all sorts of behaviour.  There have been kidnappings, court cases and movements which amounted to something approximately to lynching gangs moving around.  The reputations of some people were destroyed and the meat industry gave rise to a new political phenomenon in the last general election, if one's information is correct.  It gave rise to a phenomenon whereby bounced bank cheques were used as election literature. If my information is correct some of those bounced cheques found their way onto telegraph poles in the North. That certainly was a remarkable phenomenon. It is part and parcel of the type of industry we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister this morning in his address outlined very briefly some of the dimensions of the significance of the beef industry; I will not bother repeating them but there was one other dimension he could have mentioned, that was, the degree to which the beef industry over the years spawned a whole series of reports, one after another, pointing out the potential of that industry.  You could fill a library with them.  One after another they have turned out to be useless.  It is potential which failed to be harnessed. One of the basic reasons that potential failed to be harnessed was that the political <Col N="1092" /> will was not there to capitalise on that industry for the country.  We allowed to develop a series of political situations which gave rise to exploitation and opportunism and facilitated those people whose attitudes to business were derived from the same principles that inspired the behaviour and the attitudes of cattle jobbers over the years &mdash; when many the time they spent their lives trying to fool farmers and rip them off.  That is the background.</P>
    <P>We do not know what the dimensions of this crisis are.  We do not know how the crisis will work its way through the economy.  We have too many uncharted waters.  This is an enormous problem and we do not know how it is going to work its way through the system.  Farmers are in a miserable state.  Many of them depend on beef; something like 52,000 farmers have no farm income and exist on something like £2,500 per year.  They are now facing the prospect that this autumn the bottom will be ripped out of a market in respect of the value of cattle. Cattle prices have been knocked back to the order of something like £50 to £100 per head.  That is the dimension we are talking about.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to note that this morning the Minister did not refer to the workers in the course of his speech.  If I am correct in saying that.  I think it is a great pity that the welfare of the workers in this industry and, indeed, the welfare of many other workers in the broader, wider economy does not seem to have been given the same level of concern as has been afforded to the farmers.</P>
    <P>As was said in the other House yesterday, this Bill confronts many fundamental aspects in relation to how this country works.  It raises very basic questions about democracy.  It raises questions about how special relationships can arise between one man and the Fianna Fáil Party.  It gives rise to questions why and how it can be possible for somebody to meet his bankers in the morning and fly by helicopter for lunch at Kinsealy later that day.  I have spoken about its effects on agriculture.  There was the question of its effects on the <Col N="1093" /> international standing of Ireland.  Most of the money has been borrowed outside the country.  What will be the effect of that in the longer term?  What will be the effect on the credibility of other Irish industries?  What will be the effect on the credibility of the Irish Government and how it does business with Irish entrepreneurs, when this turns out to be a sorry sordid mess?  The reality is something that nobody should go away from.</P>
    <P>We are seeing the end of Larry Goodman. Larry is gone; it is goodbye Larry and the game is over.  Humpty Dumpty has fallen off the wall and he definitely will not be put back together again.  All the Taoiseach's horses, all the Taoiseach's men and all the toddling around that was done, will not get him back.  It is over; it is over for a number of reasons. The most important reason is that Larry has lost his Midas touch.  He is no longer Midas.  Credibility and belief in him have been removed and that is the most important thing of all.  It is shocking and appalling that somebody can get to that stage, finish up as he is, and control 5 per cent of the economy.  It is absolutely terrifying that that could happen and could be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Bill before us will not do anything much for Larry.  It will give him just a certain amount of time, as it were, on the economic or the business life support machine.  That is the size of it.  My honest view is that at the end of the three month or four month period the banks will simply move in.  It would make sense for them to move in at that stage and zap what will remain.  What you are seeing now is a set up to keep the show on the road for the next three or four months.  All one can say about that is that I certainly hope it will succeed because the implications of it not succeeding are too terrible to contemplate.</P>
    <P>In relation to some of the specifics of the Bill, there is a three months' deadline, as I understand it, with an extra month if the courts agree.  It says that a report is to be brought in in three weeks and following that report, as I understand it, a plan will be worked out in another three weeks.  I do not think that can happen.  I <Col N="1094" /> do not think anybody has the capacity to readily and easily unravel this whole business in the space of three weeks, come to a conclusion and, following that, come up with a viable plan in the space of another three weeks.  I do not think that that is going to happen.  I would like to ask the Minister one straight question on one provision of the Bill.  Why did the Minister not take the power to go to the courts and look for the appointment of the examiner?  I would like to hear why that was not done.</P>
    <P>Essentially what happened is that working capital available to Mr. Goodman, through his contacts and his credibility because of those contacts, was effectively diversified into a gamble. That, of course, arose because of the special relationship which existed between himself and the Fianna Fáil Party.  It also arose for other reasons.  It arose because of his bullying attitude, his intolerance of any criticism, which was spelled out fairly clearly in the extract from the interview which Senator Dardis read for us here this morning; and it arose because of the way he muscled in and, as it were, frightened the living daylights out of certain aspects of the Press.  It must be quite paradoxical and fairly sickening for a number of people in RTE now to read back on the grovelling apology which they issued to Mr. Goodman after honourable, decent journalists tried to expose in the agricultural programmes some of that carry-on.  Certainly, there are fairly fundamental issues involved in relation to freedom of speech and the interaction between freedom of speech and the welfare of the country.  There are very important issues arising in all that conflict.</P>
    <P>Of course, there was the credit insurance.  Let me say, to be fair to the Minister, that his record stands.  He is to be congratulated on his attitude there.  It would be unfair of me not to acknowledge that.  Then there is all this other stuff such as the great press conference in 1988 when Larry was going to do it, when Larry was going to develop Tuam, and create the jobs there.  Lo and behold, it was just another bottle of smoke.  It was <Col N="1095" /> absolutely useless and a low grade, sickening piece of PR.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to banks as well.  I am coming to the conclusion that in the banks, and particularly the higher up you go in the banks, almost at weekly intervals there should be readings for these people &mdash; compulsory, if I can be permitted to say so &mdash; of the story of the &ldquo;King's New Suit&rdquo;.  I think they would benefit greatly from reading that little essay.  It could be given to them through little talks, like they do at the end of the night on television.  Many people in banks, who go around with all these new technological gadgets would benefit from reading the &ldquo;King's New Suit&rdquo; once a week.  It could be done at one of those lunches I believe they indulge in, perhaps on Fridays.  It could be &ldquo;King's New Suit Day&rdquo; for these people.  The principles of the &ldquo;King's New Suit&rdquo; and the capacity to see nakedness have stood the test of time.  There must be some other people who could benefit from a reading of this essay.  There would be those enthusiasts for Larry as a milk person.  Larry was swimming in the milk, when he went around waving his cheque book and the unfortunate poor devils who took him seriously and believed in him, and believed that kind of stuff could work. People were prepared to cast aside the historical relevance and the historical achievements of the co-operative movement. It was all to be cast aside on a few waves of Larry's cheque book.  Some of those people must be feeling fairly sick this morning.</P>
    <P>I extend congratulations to and say &ldquo;fair play&rdquo; to T.J. Maher in particular. He put his head on the political line because, basically, he stood for a belief against that kind of stuff.  I have differences with T.J. Maher on many issues but on that I would certainly have to say I admire him and the fact that he stood for old values and old decency in terms of communities trying to stick together, make a go of it and move away from the whole cheque book mentality.</P>
    <P>Very briefly, I wish to say that I agree with the idea that it is absolutely imperative <Col N="1096" /> that not one red penny goes to Mr. Goodman arising from what we are going to see in the next few days.  He has had his &ldquo;shot&rdquo;.  That should be the end of it.  Whatever means are used to beef up farming and keep it going should be kept very far away from Mr. Goodman.  I appreciate the Minister saying that Mr. Goodman will not be getting any direct money.  I question whether or not it is possible for him to get money indirectly bearing in mind his capacity to sell into intervention and so on, arising from what can be negotiated.  Also I want to question what is going to be the the set-up when Deputy O'Kennedy gets back from Iran, if he gets the contract.  Mr. Goodman should be kept very far away from that type of contract.</P>
    <P>In relation to what should be done, and what we should learn from all of this, I certainly agree with the call from the Leader of our party, Deputy Dick Spring, that there should be a sworn inquiry.  I was pleased to hear the Minister, Deputy O'Malley this morning on radio not ruling that out, even if he did not go along it.  I hope the Minister will consider the issue further and will accede to that request. Indeed, I hope the Government will allow the full facts to be examined.  This is one of the biggest economic scandals to hit this country since the company was founded all those years ago.  It is absolutely shocking.  It is imperative that the full facts be ascertained.</P>
    <P>Second, it is very important that we learn from the effects of the secrecy with which Mr. Goodman surrounded himself, the way he could use loopholes in the law to, effectively, keep the whole thing secret and yet protect himself through a company in the Channel Islands which is, apparently, worthless. It is very important that that item is confronted and not allowed recur.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the heel of the hunt this comes back to politicians and the way they allow people to get out of control. The buck, ultimately, stops in this House and in the other House of the Oireachtas. Members of these Houses should set about keeping control of people such as Mr. Goodman, no matter how powerful <Col N="1097" /> they become.  It may not make political sense in the short-term but in the long term it will certainly pay dividends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1990 I should like to compliment the Government, and the Minister, on their prompt and very necessary action to expediate the introduction of this wise legislation. In the extraordinary circumstances in which we now find ourselves I believe it is sensible to implement this Bill at the earliest possible opportunity.  The advantages are obvious, particularly as many of our companies must now seek to operate in adverse financial conditions due to external circumstances beyond our control.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the events which are being experienced owing to the ongoing crisis in the Middle East will have grave implications for companies, particularly those engaged directly or indirectly in the beef industry.  Indeed, the effect would have a serious impact on our economy generally.  I believe the tremors are beginning to be felt.  The constraints of the present situation demand that special measures be taken as quickly as possible to ensure short-term judicial protection to companies which are vulnerable and find themselves exposed at present.</P>
      <P>Essentially, many companies which may be substantially sound in the long term will be the unfortunate victims of detrimental circumstances, unless we move to enact protective measures to help companies trying to trade as normally as possible.  The effects of the current crisis are too awful to contemplate and the consequences for all of us are obvious.  It is now our duty, as responsible legislators, to anticipate eventualities which may arise and act as quickly as possible to generate a suitable trading environment for the many businesses which stand to suffer overwhelming losses and, ultimately, to cease to trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need hardly refer to the implications of that scenario in the context of economic buoyancy and financial stability. Until the current difficult influences abate, it is our duty to see to it that <Col N="1098" /> companies which are viable in the long-term are allowed to trade while under the supervision of the court.  This new mechanism is absolutely imperative.  In general, the legislation empowers the High Court to appoint an examiner who will be accountable to the court.  The role of the examiner will be to review the operations of the particular company and, if necessary, to make recommendations for the company's restructuring. In effect the company will be protected from immediate insolvency while allowing their assets, if necessary to be disposed of in a controlled and measured fashion.  This facility is vital to prevent a rapid off-loading of assets in an effort to shore up their financial position.</P>
    <P>No enforcement action can be taken by creditors.  The company's debts will be, in effect, frozen and proceedings for winding up or for the appointment of a receiver are precluded.  Swift action is necessary.  I hope Senator Upton is wrong and that the banks do not do what he says is obvious to them in three months' time.</P>
    <P>A lot of people will be watching to see exactly what the banks will do because, as has been said already, they are not exactly innocent in this whole affair.  The 5,000 people directly employed in meat processing, the 100,000 farmers involved in cattle production and a huge number of others will be indirectly affected if this vital legislation is not accelerated. Clearly, the conditions likely to obtain will have frightening repercussions for all of us.  The situation now dictates, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that adequate protective measures be introduced immediately. Nobody will thank the Government, or the Opposition, if we are seen to stall with this legislation.</P>
    <P>The cattle and beef industry is paramount to our economy.  That industry alone contributes some 10 per cent to GDP or 36 per cent of gross agricultural output, valued in 1989 at £1,211 million. It represents 32 per cent of total agricultural exports and 5.2 per cent of total exports.  The industry is now facing one of its most difficult crises due to many factors not least the collapse of the Iraqi <Col N="1099" /> market.  Such whimsical trading conditions must be urgently addressed.  I believe that legislation now before us extends some protection to companies who have had to bear the brunt of such conditions.  The impact must be cushioned in the manner outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The onus now rests on legislators to support and encourage companies to address their financial difficulties while seeking to prevent their total derailment. In so far as is practical to facilitate this process, the Bill proposes the extension of court protection to an ailing company for a restricted period of three months, with an additional 30 days if necessary. This support will be extended if &mdash; and only if &mdash; the court is satisfied that a company are unable or likely to be unable to pay their debts while taking into overall consideration the protective viability and potential of the company as an ongoing concern.</P>
    <P>This procedure allows the fullest consultative process.  A High Court petition can be sought by the company, by their directors, creditors or shareholders holding a minimum of 10 per cent share capital. Equally, provisions are in place to facilitate the swift necessary flow of information to the examiner from all relevant parties concerned with the affairs of the company in question.  The expeditious nature of this procedure is vital.  I welcome the fact that excessive formality and delay are avoided.</P>
    <P>Equally, it is obviously necessary that legislation of this kind be flexible and that the examiner be given a reasonably wide degree of discretion in discharging his duties.  The circumstances of each company seeking High Court protection will be entirely different.  As all facts cannot be envisaged by statutory measure, the examiner must enjoy some latitude in the exercise of his role.  This legislation is straightforward and uncomplicated in my view.  This is a tremendous benefit if it is effective in securing its objectives.  This legislation represents a considerable and rational approach towards alleviating operating difficulties and has the capacity <Col N="1100" /> to prevent precipitous action where assets are indiscriminately off-loaded or, at worst, a company is closed.</P>
    <P>Actions which might be prejudicial to the overall interests of the company can be prevented by the examiner.  He, and only he, under court order as provided in section 9 of this Bill, can exercise the power of the directors.  The time factor involved in this legislation is also crucial. If a company is to be rescued successfully action must be immediate and deliberations cannot be in any way protracted. I welcome the time structures inherent in this mechanism.  Court protection is restricted to three months, or an extra day if the situation demands it.  The initial report of the examiner must be submitted within three weeks of his appointment and his precise recommendations must be received within a further three weeks. Companies on the brink of disaster will, undoubtedly, welcome this new measure as a useful breathing space while their operations are undergoing severe difficulties which are, in the long term, soluble, given adequate time and protection.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be associated with this Bill.  The Government have no choice but to create circumstances in which companies can trade.  In the current situation they have no option but to assist companies in whatever practical ways they can to stave off utter destruction and all the implications for our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate. It was absolutely necessary that the House be reconvened because of the problems that we are discussing here today.  We are living in very strange <Col N="1101" /> times.  We have been through a summer recess.  There have been many calls for the re-call of the Dáil and the Seanad during this summer recess, not because of the issue we have been brought back to discuss, but because of the possibility of the world being engulfed in a war in the Middle East or because of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  The perception around this country for the last two to three weeks has been that this might have been the overwhelming reason why the Dáil and Seanad might be recalled.  It is remarkable that, of course, we are recalled and that our recall has nothing whatever to do with the crisis in the Gulf. Because of the crisis in this specific Goodman company we were all brought back to Dublin to implement, very urgently, the Companies Bill and, of course, with good reason.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the emphasis among most speakers &mdash; and the emphasis in the media &mdash; is not on the minutiae of the Companies Bill.  We have not been brought back in the middle of the summer recess to discuss such minutiae as though it was the continuation of the legislation process.  We have, in fact, been brought back because of the Goodman crisis.  It has been of legitimate concern to legislators and others to home in on what on earth is happening in so far as the Goodman company are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister in the House today.  It would be very churlish of me, in Opposition, not to compliment him because his hands are particularly clean on this issue.  It took considerable courage for him, late last year, to face up to the Goodman issue and to halt the export credit guarantees which up to that time for a couple of years had applied in so far as sales to Iraq were concerned.  I want to compliment him.  It was a brave act.  It was distinctly to the advantage of the Irish taxpayer that he took that profound action at that time.  Having said that, on balance, in so far as the export credit scheme is concerned we have to question what has been happening in so far as the country of Iraq is concerned and the perceptions within the Government <Col N="1102" /> in regard to the risks in Iraq.</P>
    <P>We have to point out that in 1986 the then Government made a decision that there would be no further underwriting of Iraqi risks on export credit guarantee schemes because of the perception of risks entirely independent of an invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.  We had in 1987 the dramatic reintroduction of an export credit guarantee scheme by the Government at that time.  We have on the record the remarks of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds in introducing the Insurance Export Guarantee Bill, 1988, when he said that as a result of successful growth and business contacts in Iraq in the context of the Irish/Iraqi Joint Commission it was decided to provide export credit facilities in respect of Iraq.  He said this is a positive development in terms of sustaining export growth.  Additionally, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Burke, in May 1989 said that he would like to confirm the Government's confidence in the well-being of our economic relations with Iraq.  In so far as Goodman may be a private company with supposedly unlimited liability there is, of course, a political issue involved here.  When you talk about export credit guarantees &mdash; which you are talking about &mdash; if the scheme fails because of the specific risks in the country or the company to which the company is selling, then the tab is picked up by the Irish State and, without putting a tooth in it by the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Specifically in this case, of great interest to the taxpayer will be the whole question of what is going to happen in relation to the case pending at this time between the Goodman company and the Department of Industry and Commerce. If the Department of Industry and Commerce win their case &mdash; we are talking about potential liabilities here that are quoted in excess of £100 million &mdash; then it is a problem for the Goodman corporation. If the Department of Industry and Commerce lose their case, it means that the taxpayer is sucked in through this guarantee scheme in funding Goodman because of the export guarantees reintroduced <Col N="1103" /> by the Government in 1987.  It is extremely questionable why that should have been done at that time given the perception of risk and given the views that no doubt existed within the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and within the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is certainly a matter that is worth probing at this time, because it is a major issue.</P>
    <P>The political judgment of the Government and of the Taoiseach in so far as the Goodman company is concerned, to divorce it from the personality of Mr. Goodman, is also fairly suspect.  That is clear from the press conference two years ago which the Taoiseach held jointly with Mr. Goodman and with the IDA when it was announced that there would be an investment in the order of about £260 million in food processing industries in this country.  Their judgment, I believe, has got to be suspect if that event could take place and if the Government was underpinning its projections for the food processing sector in this quarter, when we see what is happening at this stage.</P>
    <P>I do not propose in any sense to get involved in a personal criticism of Mr. Goodman.  Mr. Goodman is an entrepreneur. There are positives; there are negatives; there are huge negatives of which we are reading.  Having said that I believe it is fair to put on the record that had Mr. Goodman not existed it is not apparent that there was any other giant in the meat industry in Ireland who might have developed the meat industry to the extent to which Mr. Goodman did.  Nor is there any evidence that any Government or any Minister in any Government had a scheme or plan in mind which might have developed aspects of the meat industry.  I do not want to get in to any question of character assassination when we are talking about this particular debate.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Minister here present and his colleague, Senator Dardis, who spoke a short time ago, were absolutely right in stating that under no circumstances whatever should there be or will there be Government aid in the <Col N="1104" /> form of grants for the Goodman company, as presently constituted.  Both from what the Minister told us in the House yesterday and what we have learned from other sources, including a speech from Deputy Spring, and from the comments in today's papers and in the financial press from reputable sources, it would be inconceivable for the Government to aid this company as presently structured.  In today's paper Government sources are quoted as stating that the Fraud Squad will be investigating the possibility of a fraud of the order of about £25 million within the Goodman group.  We read of debts to banks of £460 million.  The diversification obviously was disastrous.  There were enough problems already in trading with the Middle East in a specific sector that the group apparently knew, without the type of grandiose diversification into the United Kingdom, into the sugar industry and into other areas, which has led to huge losses and which has bled the company of whatever liquidity it might have had.</P>
    <P>That having been said, obviously the object of the Government &mdash; and it seems that the Government are doing this &mdash; is to protect the agricultural sector and specifically to protect the meat sector and the meat industry.  I agree with Senator Dardis that a banner headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> today speaking of some hundreds of millions being necessary to bail out the cattle industry is unduly alarmist.  We have to give some reassurance to the farming community in this country that there is not an impending disaster in so far as the fundamental health of the cattle sector is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that, in what the Minister quotes from what he has been told by the Investment Bank of Ireland yesterday, there is a statement to the effect, from a reliable, sober source, that the trading operations of Goodman International continue to be substantially profitable before interest.  That should give heart to the farming community. They should be made aware that there is not and need not necessarily be a crisis in so far as the cattle trade is concerned <Col N="1105" /> because of a restructured group with equity possibly coming from other sources or with the Government stepping in. For example, the business editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, in contrast to what <i>The Irish Times</i> are suggesting, says that the examiner should, in this instance, be able to borrow working capital needed for cattle purchases and that, even if the Government have to guarantee the loans, the exposure should be no more than £30 million to £40 million and certainly, if an exposure for the Government in guaranteed loans to a company being run by prudent hands can shore up and pin down the cattle industry for this winter, the problem in so far as the national interest or the farming interest is concerned need not be entirely as dramatic as are those facing Mr. Goodman and the people at present involved in the Goodman structure.</P>
    <P>We must have regard to what has been stated in the Dáil yesterday by a number of Deputies, to the comments in today's national press from many sober sources and to the list of issues which we have read about, the long list of allegations of debts running to £700 million in cash in guarantees, allegations relating to 30 banks, allegations that Mr. Goodman circumvented personal liabilities with a limited company in the Channel Islands, allegations concerning the Classic Meats Company, allegations concerning the export credit guarantees in the recycling of beef from outside Ireland through the system, libel actions mentioned threatening journalists, and allegations concerning PAYE.  I would take the view that, most certainly in this instance, there is a case for an inquiry.</P>
    <P>My understanding from Senator Upton and from the leader on this side of the House is that the Minister present being interviewed on radio this morning stated that he had no objection personally to a judicial inquiry taking place but that he did not necessarily see the point of it.  I suggest that the Minister consider this judicial inquiry, that in the light of the welter of allegations which have been made and continue to be made, it is probably <Col N="1106" /> necessary at this stage that such a judicial inquiry takes place.  Again, I want to compliment the Minister for his very strong action in relation to Goodman and export credit guarantees late last years.  It was a very fine decision of which this country at the present time is reaping the benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to put on record my disgust at the fact that only three hours was given to the debate on this very important issue, probably the most important issue, in my view, to be put before this House prior to this and for many years to come.  I do not know who was responsible for the decision that this House should be given only this limited time.  It is a disgraceful way to treat the House.</P>
      <P>First, I want to say that anybody who thinks this legislation is before the House other than because of the collapse of the Goodman Company is absolutely crazy. The reason the legislation is being brought before this House is to provide a means to salvage part of that company. I believe that the Goodman empire is finished.  I want to put on record, as far as I am concerned, that over the last 20 years there is no doubt whatsoever that Larry Goodman did for the beef industry what nobody was able to do before.  In fact, he was the first man who tried to give added value to beef and to get a market abroad for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much that the collapse, as I see it, of this company was from gambling on the British Stock Exchange. That is one of the major problems and one of the reasons that we are here today. That, of course, together with selling to countries which were very questionable, and indeed the whole question of export credits which were given to this company some three years ago to sell to Iraq. Indeed, I note that the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 1988 report referred to the fact that ICI were open to cover for £107 million worth of beef at 30 June 1989.  This is a scandalous situation because trading with Iraq was a dodgy business in any event.  I cannot understand why the Goodman Company <Col N="1107" /> were not able to get oil instead of money when they were unable to get money.  I would like to know what efforts were made.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Staunton, referred to the possibility of a judicial inquiry.  I think it is only right and proper that there should be a judicial inquiry.  I also think that the banks and their whole involvement in the Goodman affair should not be excluded from the inquiry. It is unbelievable that the banks handed out money to this company without guarantees, and whether we like it or not, the Irish taxpayer or the Irish farmer in the beef industry is going to have to meet the cost of this.  Again, I regret very much that there is not more time to debate this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I believe it is necessary at this time.  I compliment the Minister and the Government on their prompt action.  It indicates an awareness of current affairs in the Middle East and the consequences for those who are selling in that area.  I certainly believe that it is right, timely and necessary.</P>
      <P>The Senators who opposed the Bill in this House are negative people, in my opinion.  They even use the passage of the Bill to attack Larry Goodman.  Senator Norris asked the question &ldquo;Is there anything special about Larry Goodman?&rdquo; I believe that the vast majority of the people in Ireland strongly believe that there is something special about Larry Goodman.  Larry Goodman is a very aggressive salesman who has been part of a team who have succeeded in getting markets for our products.  He is the kind of person with the kind of company that this country needs to succeed in selling our products.  I strongly support Larry Goodman, not for any political contribution that he would make to the party I belong to, because I have survived and the party have survived for years before the name of Larry Goodman ever was mentioned or known to me.  I welcome Larry Goodman's initiative, his progress and that of all the others with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there are six major players <Col N="1108" /> selling in the Middle East.  If Larry Goodman has found himself in difficulty now, it is sad not only for the people of this country but in a special way for the small farmers, the small producers in the west of Ireland, the small men who are depending on cattle exports.  We know how quick the reaction and the consequences can reach those small farmers. In one day and one week the cattle mart actually is a complete non-event and the small farmers who expect to have a cash flow are very seriously affected.  I believe that the firms, including Larry Goodman's, that are in difficulty now deserve our maximum support.</P>
    <P>Export credit guarantees are not a new thing in the world.  Most countries have export credit guarantees, whether they are selling plant, machinery, ships, aeroplanes or even guns.  There are people who gave Iraq export credit guarantees and sold them guns.  It behoves the legislators and public representatives in this country to recognise that in business you are not right every time and you will not always choose the right customer.</P>
    <P>There are people here who believe it would be prudent to use the passage of this legislation to destroy Larry Goodman and his empire.  That would be a tragedy and it would be narrow-minded. It would serve those negative people in this country who belong to splinter parties, who will never be part of a central party big enough to form a government to legislate for this country.  Those are the people whose arrogant outbursts, in a democracy, have to be listened to.  I believe it is right that they have a voice; but, thank God, they will never be part of main stream politics in this country that will influence the legislation because I would fear the consequences.</P>

      <P>I believe that the six major players who are selling in an area where there is concern at the moment <Col N="1109" /> deserve our maximum support and I think that anybody who takes a contrary view is not in tune with the wishes of the Irish people.  We are concerned for our citizens who are in that region.  We are concerned equally for our citizens, our farmers, all the people whose economy and livelihood are affected.  I, coming from very near the grassroots, from a small farm in Donegal, know the difficulties that those small farmers have in selling their cattle and sheep.  Whatever you may say about Larry Goodman and his cheque book, he lifted the horizon in this country to a pitch where there was competition.  He has done a lot for the farming community.</P>
      <P>Before you criticise Larry Goodman, Goodman International and the five other major players in the beef export business, you should ask yourself how much this country is contributing to the promotion of sales.  To my knowledge, it is quite a paltry sum we are giving to the CBF.  While other European countries are giving large amounts of money to promote the export of their products, we are at the bottom of the league.  We are a small country and we know each other's business.  There are many jealous operators. If anybody survives and makes a success of their business, it is said they have done so only because of their political involvement.  There is a lot of score-settling going on and the attitude that one should never miss an opportunity of having a bash at anybody who is having difficulties in business.  If you look at how much Britain, France, Germany and Denmark have given to support the sales of their products, the sales of beef&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any difficulty in convincing the reasonable people in this country that we are at the bottom of the league in supporting the sales of our beef, our lamb and our farm products.  Here I believe that there is an inconsistency when we crib and concern ourselves about how much we are given. On the week of 25 August the farmer's paper reported &ldquo;Major Grant Package <Col N="1110" /> On The Way&rdquo; and stated that over the next four years £1.2 billion would be injected into Irish farms through capital grants and incentives.  I wonder what the capital grants and incentives are for. They are mostly for cattle sheds, for farm improvement, for pollution control, for disease eradication &mdash; all orientated to help sustain people on small farms that have the rearing of cattle as their sole livelihood.  Would it not be very unwise to spend £1.2 billion in four years and not be concerned about the people who are in the front line trying to sell that very same product?  I am glad that no such short-sightedness exists at Government level because, if it did, that would be a disastrous situation.  Whatever the Minister's reservations about Goodman International, I do not believe for a minute that they will prevent the Minister from taking what he sees as appropriate action on the day to protect the industry that is so vital to this country.</P>
      <P>The international standing of Ireland, as somebody referred to, was never higher.  We have people who were ready to knock our Presidency of the EC.  The vast majority of the Irish people recognise that the Presidency was a big occasion for this country and it lifted this country internationally to the point where we have a recognition far in excess of our capacity, our numbers and our size.  This country enjoyed a great Presidency and the value of that Presidency and the manner in which it was handled are paying dividends; and some of these dividends have only borne fruit in the last week.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce enjoys, with other Ministers in the Cabinet, a very high profile internationally.  I think he is in a position to get in touch with any Government in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis in the Middle East and Iraq is unavoidable.  As far as we are concerned in this country, we cannot contribute very much.  We cannot even get our own people who are trapped in that situation out of it because of the dictatorship that exists in that country.  I believe this legislation is necessary.  I hope the banks and those who have been <Col N="1111" /> involved in financing Goodman International and all of the other people who are in difficulty &mdash; and it is not Goodman alone &mdash; will have consideration and support in the long term and be allowed to trade themselves out of the current difficulties.  I think that that is the general wish of all in this country.  Whether it is the Staggs, the Springs, or the De Rossas or other minority sections, I do not think they are going to influence the correct decision being taken by Government. There is a groundswell of support for Larry Goodman, for the other five, and for the Government's initiative here. Anybody who assesses the situation to the contrary is miscalculating what the current situation is.  I urge the Minister to continue to do his utmost to rescue those who are such a vital part of our sales campaign abroad.  I think they are doing great work and I sincerely hope that this problem will be solved and that nobody will have to go out of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not detect the groundswell of support for Larry Goodman which Senator McGowan has detected, but I bow to his closeness to the grassroots which he boasted to us about a few minutes ago.  This is the first time in the last ten years that this House has been called back in an emergency session to rescue a major company in the private sector.  I think that the first one was PMPA, the second one was ICI and this time, whatever shadow-boxing, cosmetics or civil service protective language is put on it, we are here today to allow the Goodman organisation to seek the protection of an examiner tomorrow or the day after, and I think that is what is going to happen when this Bill is passed through.</P>
      <P>Whether it is right or wrong, I think we have got to realise that there is something very strange about the fact that history is repeating itself regularly in this country in that three large companies have had to be bailed out by the State in circumstances which in all three cases should not have been allowed to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally, I am not one for advocating <Col N="1112" /> constraints upon private enterprise, but there is something wrong with the workings and the runnings of our financial institutions and our indigenous industries if history continues to repeat itself in this particular way.  There must be a better way of running industry and commerce than allowing individuals or institutions to get so big that they are not properly policed but come cap in hand to the Government to be bailed out when they get into trouble.  This situation is unacceptable; it is unacceptable morally and it is unacceptable to the taxpayer. Although I know we are actually operating in the dark to a certain extent today, because we do not know the details of what has happened to Goodman International, we do know that in plugging another hole we are dealing with a sad, sorry tale for industry and private enterprise in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is the time, despite what Senator McGowan said, to go into recriminations against individuals in the company because we really are not in possession of the details of what has been done, what has been neglected, what wrongs have been done and what unwise investment decisions have been made. These are obviously going to emerge when the examiner gets down to his job in the next day or two.  We do know on a very general basis that the Goodman International group of companies was operating in extremely tricky terrain, in extremely difficult areas of business in an unsavoury country for doing business and was making very large profits as a result. We do know that the Iraqis were notably bad at paying on time, that that country was unstable, that it was a war zone during the Iraq-Iran war and is a war zone again.  We do know, morally, that we were dealing with one of the most repulsive regimes in the world and we were quite happy not only to allow it but to encourage it.</P>
    <P>My knowledge of the beef industry is almost zero, but we were also dealing with other countries who are not friendly countries to the State, and I include Iran and Libya in that.  So the whole beef industry, all the outlets for our exports <Col N="1113" /> of beef, were precarious to say the least. It was not just Mr. Goodman, if he was at fault, it was ourselves in this House and it was the people in the other House and the Government in particular who were undoubtedly encouraging and had encouraged Mr. Goodman to go after these very large profits regardless of whom he was dealing with and what the commercial practices were.  Mr. Goodman was encouraged by the Government &mdash; indeed, his empire was, I think, created by the Government &mdash; and now the Government have to pick up the tab. It seems to me that the export credit guarantees which were given to Mr. Goodman were very wisely withdrawn by Deputy O'Malley recently, but not before Mr. Goodman had put himself in a situation in the beef industry which, if it is not a monopoly &mdash; and we still do not really know but it may emerge whether it is a monopoly or not &mdash; was so powerful, that so many people depended upon him, that it was unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I do not know the extent of the knockon effect of the apparent collapse of Mr. Goodman's empire, but I do know that having created him, having put him in a position of such industrial and commercial power, it appears that he is now being abandoned and left high and dry by the Government.  We cannot in some ways blame Mr. Goodman &mdash; the Goodman Group &mdash; for going after the huge profits which he was encouraged to do.  We cannot blame him either for using some of those large profits or the credit which was extended to him in trying to build up a major food industries group in his purchasing of Berisford and Unigate shares.  It seems to me that those decisions were appallingly bad commercial decisions.  They do not appear to have had any particular industrial or commercial strategy behind them.  They appear to be fliers and to be motivated by a desire to get bigger willy-nilly and they appear to have been extremely extravagant and unwise.  We ought to have known in this country that if we were putting power and huge commercial muscle in the hands of one particular man, giving him access to liquid capital <Col N="1114" /> and cash, we were also likely to see that man over-expand with the large profits which he gained from the beef industry which we had encouraged.  It was a possible danger that this very thing would have happened, but it appears that before last week there were no warning signs given or seen by the Government who had created this particular problem by their incentives.</P>
    <P>I regret that we have not heard during this debate &mdash; and the debate has been so curtailed as to be absurd &mdash; about the plans for the beef industry in the post-Goodman era.  One only has to have a basic knowledge of the beef industry in this country to know that it is in trouble because of our trading partners, because of BSE and because of the changing eating habits in the western world.  It seems to me that, whereas the beef industry accounts for 10 per cent of GNP, there are no obvious new markets open to this country, that Europe will be dependent on intervention, that we are continuing, probably wrongly, to try to push beef with Iran and that we want to see more plans for diversification if it is possible to rescue the industry from the appalling state it is in.  What I regret in this Bill is that it raises more questions about the future than it answers and it is fraught with lack of information about the specific company that we are here to rescue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to say that I am glad the Oireachtas was recalled on this occasion.  I disagree with the observation that it was a piece of hypocrisy to have the Oireachtas recalled in order to bail out a particular individual. That is far too simplistic an interpretation and also underestimates the opportunity we have, even in this very brief period, of turning our attention to the wider context which we will be doing in the afternoon. I, for one, was glad to be plucked from the bosom of a reluctant family in the sunny south, whatever about other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not, as has been observed, just bailing out an individual, even if we are not strictly speaking bailing him out.  We <Col N="1115" /> are expressing concern and mounting a rescue operation for a vital industry.  As has been said, by Senator Norris among others, it is about time we began to take stock of the beef industry as our mainstay in view of the changing world and changing habits.  All I want to do is make some general reflections on the situation that this Bill now represents and the contrast between the euphoric situation two years ago when Mr. Goodman's genius was launched in a flurry of euphoria by the then Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, and the shambles we have today.</P>
    <P>First, as has been said, one is astonished at the apparent gullibility of the banking business in contrast to their rigour and severity when they deal with the ordinary punter.  There is a parody of Longfellow which says:</P>
    <P>Lives of rich men all remind us</P>
    <P>We can make our lives a blank,</P>
    <P>And departing leave behind us</P>
    <P>Lots of money in the bank.</P>
    <P>Apparently, Mr. Goodman did not even put money in the bank to begin with.  Those of us who are sometimes mystified by the economy should reflect that economistsin the end may not know very much at all &mdash; to adapt the famous remark of the Swedish Chancellor in the 17th century: &ldquo;you do not know, my son, with what little wisdom the economy is governed&rdquo;. Sooner or later, whether or not this Bill will stave off disaster, there will be a day of reckoning for those in the beef industry.  The farmer will pay and the taxpayer will pay but what concerns me is, will Mr. Goodman pay?  What is his personal financial empire?  Will that be immune from the general retribution?  Is he personally fire-proofed in respect of his jets, helicopter and lifestyle against the loss of personal fortune?  If there is to be a sworn inquiry into all this business with its undertones of fraud, scandal, incompetence, ruthlessness and obsessive empire building, then let that inquiry take in Mr. Goodman's own personal fortunes as well.</P>
    <P>In this country, we take for granted that a person has a right to accumulate <Col N="1116" /> personal fortunes.  Indeed, far from the stereotype that we are all a nation of begrudgers, we are all a nation of servile and facile admirers of the cult of the rich, including journalists in every Sunday newspaper, and there is this vulgar, peasant idea at large that a man cannot do any good for you unless he does good for himself.  That has been the peasant wisdom to justify the as yet hitherto unexplained accumulation of the Taoiseach's personal fortunes.  I suggest that in the light of the trials and tribulations of rich men in the last few days in this and the neighbouring island, we should begin to ask ourselves how fortunes are made.  I do not believe that a man makes millions by the sweat of his brow.  There is no brow so superior that it will make millions.  It is somebody else's brow that is sweating for that kind of fortune.  Let us also remember that it has been wisely observed that behind every fortune there is at least one great crime.</P>
    <P>Finally, the moral we should draw in the terms of the economy is that we should begin to re-examine the cult of the entrepreneur.  I know that is the essence of the doctrine of some parties of this House.  Some years ago I was slammed for being totally naive, if not idiotic, for talking about nationalising the land and the agricultural economy.  I do think if we had nationalised the agricultural economy we could not have done any worse than give it to an entrepreneur who has made a total mess of it.  My last line would be another adaptation of a biblical statement, put not your trust in entrepreneurs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with some of my colleagues.  I welcome the brief opportunity to speak on this Bill and congratulate the Minister on the decisive action he took.  On too many occasions Ministers have failed to move when they should have but not on this occasion.  Over the last number of years, the Minister has signalled difficulties in the beef industry and when he was in a position to do something about them, he moved decisively to take Iraq off cover. We reap the benefits of that action today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> I would like to pose one wider question that has not really been touched on in today's debate.  It is one which has been bubbling under the surface over the last number of years and it is our failure to take action to control the growth of companies in many different areas of industry. As has been pointed out, this is not the first time that the Seanad and Dáil have been recalled.  In the last two to three years in other industries the growth of companies has been such that they effectively control the whole sector.  That is extremely dangerous and that is why we are here today.  At the outset when companies begin to grow, we all want to get on the band-wagon, wish them well and hope that they are the knights in shining armour that will bring an industry into healthy profits and grow.  The problem is that if one company eventually controls the whole industry and anything happens to that company then the whole industry is effectively undermined and we arrive at the situation we are in today.</P>
    <P>We are all at fault for not moving in this area.  I would hope that the incumbent Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has expressed views on this question in the past, will be keen to move in this area.  After all if we do not set down the ground rules of how businesses should operate we cannot then blame people for bending the rules or sailing close to the wind in how they operate their companies. That failure must be shared by all of us.  There is no point in us standing here today berating one or two individuals and hoping that because our failures can be put onto somebody else we are all excused.  I do not take that point of view. I do not agree with berating Mr. Goodman in his present situation.  That will not solve anything.  The fact is that the company grew over the years and the question marks that have been raised as to how that happened will be answered more fully in due course.  The initial question of the need for this legislation, and the introduction of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill in 1987 has once again been highlighted.  The sooner that that Bill in its entirety is passed by both Houses the better.  It has taken too <Col N="1118" /> long and painstaking a course to get to the stage it is at now.  Taking out this section and making it law indicates the urgency and importance of having the full Bill as part of our legislation.</P>
    <P>The other question I would like to pose relates to the lack of development of a brand image of our beef.  We have taken the easy option and allowed a company like Goodman International to take the easy options in getting markets for this product.  We have totally and abjectly failed to develop the European market for Irish beef and yet we pride ourselves on our environment and on the wholesomeness of our agriculture.  There is a demand for products produced free from chemicals.  Yet, one of the largest industries here has failed to develop an image for its product.  That is a failure on the part of the IFA, the farm leaders, companies and the Department of Agriculture. If some attempt had been made over the preceding years to develop the beef industry in terms of a quality image the European markets could have been developed and we would not have had to depend on the Middle East markets. These markets have always been extremely volatile and open to question. In the circumstances pertaining in the Gulf they will be so for at least the next decade.</P>
    <P>Today's debate has been brought about because of the serious problems in the Goodman organisation.  What are we proposing to do in the immediate future to develop this industry?  Shoring up one company, as this legislation may do &mdash; hopefully it will not be the demise of the company but may change how it operates and is now constituted &mdash; will not be sufficient to develop one of our most important industries, the beef industry. Decisions will have to be taken by the leaders in agriculture in the private and public sectors and in Government to develop this industry.  If we fail to take this opportunity to address this issue in all seriousness, then we can talk about the demise of the beef industry.  Those involved in the debate should be thinking about the development of the beef industry <Col N="1119" /> and where it goes from here.  The dairy industry has successfully developed an image but the beef industry has not done so.  A leaf could be taken out of their book.</P>
    <P>I accept that it is difficult to limit the growth of various companies in their market share.  Nevertheless, some mechanism will have to be found to achieve this otherwise we will end up in a situation where one dominant company can effectively control our industry.  In Germany, for instance, when one supermarket in the retail trade tried to grow beyond 8 per cent of its market share, the Government refused to allow it to open another supermarket because they felt that 8 per cent of the total market was enough and that anything beyond that would be dangerous.  Here two supermarkets control 52 per cent of the business.  Over the last number of years they have attempted to control sections of the supplying industries to the retail section.  That is extremely unhealthy.</P>
    <P>In the long term, for companies to develop outside this country we have to have a margin of flexibility.  It is obvious in the dairy sector, where amalgamations are going on at present, that this is necessary. Companies wishing to compete with the great European conglomerates will have to have a turnover in the region of between £1 billion to £2 billion if they are to have a say in how the industry develops.  Questions have to be asked and answers have to be given.  The Legislature and the Department of Industry and Commerce will have to take the lead in this area by coming up with answers. We have asked questions over the last number of years but all Departments and many Ministers have failed to deal with them.  What happened in the Goodman International Group has prompted this question.  It must now be answered and effective measures taken.</P>
    <P>Ireland needs entrepreneurs.  I would hate to think that, out of this debate, we, as politicians, would be seen to be berating people who have the foresight and ability to develop industry because by their foresight they create many needed <Col N="1120" /> jobs.  I congratulate any Irish entreperneur who invests in this country, who sticks his neck out, and helps our young people to remain at home.  What we must have is responsible development and action by the Government to control the type of development that takes place. There are not enough controls or legislation in this area at the moment and we need that type of legislation to come onstream soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cullen for sharing his time with me.  There are precedents for this type of legislation, not just in Ireland but in other parts of the world.  It usually comes about in the case of large companies which might damage the national interest.  I recall the Chrysler case in America and the Rolls Royce case in Britain.  Here we had the famous cases of the ICI and the PMPA, two cases I, being in the insurance business, had a particular interest in.  I can recall listening to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce very attentively on the morning of the PMPA debate.  His first few words were &ldquo;the chickens have come home to roost&rdquo; and he went on to explain his thinking on that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are talking about here is legislation which will apply to all companies which might find themselves in difficulties. When the Companies (No. 2) Bill was discussed in the Seanad it was welcomed by business people and by the political parties.  Basically what we are doing here is bringing forward Part IX of the Companies (No. 2) Bill and making it a Bill on its own.  The reasons given have been many.  It was said that if a <Col N="1121" /> company is not able to solve its own financial problems, it should get help. Goodman has, of course, been mentioned, I would make the point that when this Bill was being discussed, in particular part IX, the name &ldquo;Goodman&rdquo; was never mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is true that Mr. Goodman is now a big player in this business and the companies are in a critical situation because of events in the Middle East.  They have other difficulties as well.  While stressing that the Government are not bailing out Mr. Goodman &mdash; that has been said by many Government speakers &mdash; what we are doing is passing all Stages of a Bill to enable the company to bring about a restructuring or refinancing.  It gives them a chance to sort out their financial and other problems.  The underlying assumption is that the Goodman company are in a position to trade out of their difficulties. What they need is a breathing space to allow them to bring about this restructuring or financing.</P>
    <P>Mr. Goodman has been mentioned many times.  I do not know Mr. Goodman personally.  The fact is that he is a very big player in the business world.  His business and his company are important to our economy.  The Government have a clear duty to help, not to bail them out but to help and they are doing this in what they see as the most effective way by bringing forward the Part IX of the Companies (No. 2) Bill for debate in this emergency session of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government are right to move swiftly.  They have a duty to ensure that there is no disruption in the beef market in the critical autumn period when cattle are being sold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many things I would like to say about the Bill but I will confine myself to what I would see as the immediate situation we face. It would appear that there is a huge problem in the beef industry particularly in relation to some of the bigger processors. The consequences of not passing this legislation would be that the people most severely affected would be the employees, the small suppliers and the <Col N="1122" /> unsecured small creditors.  It is to protect these people that this legislation is needed.  I welcome the Bill and also the provision under section 33 (2) (a) and (b).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions on this Bill and for the universal support which it has got in this House, for which I am grateful.  I cannot, in the very short time at my disposal, deal with all the points that were raised but I will try to deal with some of them and in particular those that were raised by a number of Senators.</P>
      <P>Senators McDonald, Upton, Staunton and one or two others talked about the possibility of holding an inquiry.  I see no great objection to an inquiry but I have considerable reservations about the holding of a judicial inquiry particularly of the kind that we have known in this country over the last five or ten years where on a number of those occasions very prolonged inquiries went on for 60, 70 and 80 sitting days, enormous sums of money were spent running into millions of pounds on some of those occasions, and where very tenuous conclusions, to say the least, were drawn at the end.  One had to question whether it was worth holding the inquiry at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have looked for some time at the provisions of section 165 and the following sections of the Companies Act, 1963, in relation to certain companies about whose activities I was not terribly happy.  I considered whether I should put in an inspector or inspectors under those sections to carry on an inspection into the company or group of companies about which I had certain reservations.  I had to fall back on my experience in the Department of Industry and Commerce on a previous occasion when, against the advice of the Department, I put inspectors into a number of companies where flagrant misconduct had gone on.  The Department advised me not to do it <Col N="1123" /> because it was a waste of time and that the provisions of section 165 and the following sections were of little use as they were unenforceable.  I regret that events proved the Department right, but nonetheless I did not regret putting them in because I hoped thereby to demonstrate my disapproval of what was going on or what had gone on.</P>
    <P>Under the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, which I hope will be passed in the Dáil in November and which this House has already passed, there are ample provisions under Part II, sections 7 to 23, inclusive, to hold proper and meaningful inquiries into things that go on internally in companies.  When that becomes law, as I expect it will in the autumn, I will give consideration to an inspector going in to investigate internal activities in some companies that it is impossible to look into at the moment.  That might be the most useful, expeditious and the least expensive way of approaching this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald raised the question of whether non-payment to PARC in Baghdad at the moment would cause problems for Aer Lingus.  I would like to assure him and the House that it will not, for reasons I need not go into here, cause any problems for Aer Lingus.  Senators McDonald and Upton in the course of their speeches said that the Minister should withdraw the action he has taken in respect of export credit insurance and should pay the Goodman organisation the £70 or £80 million in question, that it is no good paying them in five or six months time when it might be too late.  I do not want to get into this in great detail but I want to assure Senator McDonald and anyone else who thinks along those lines that I did not initiate the action.  I cannot withdraw it.  It was taken against me and I have no intention unless I am ordered by the High Court and subsequently the Supreme Court to whom I would appeal, of paying any money in respect of insurance policies where written declarations were made that all the goods were of Republic of Ireland origin and where it transpired that 40 per cent or <Col N="1124" /> more of the goods were not of Republic of Ireland origin.  It would be wrong of me to do otherwise.  Senator Norris and others who call on me to act in accordance with sentiments I expressed in the earlier part of 1989 should look at my actions over the past 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything I have done since assuming office in regard to certain matters are very much in line with the sentiments I expressed in the Dáil when in Opposition in the early part of 1989, both with regard to export credit insurance and also with regard to the matter that Senator Cullen raised of the undue dominance or possible monopoly situation of one group in trying to acquire further companies in the same section to bring their percentage of that sector up to an unacceptably high figure.  I am glad to say that pending legislation will deal not just with any specific company, but in general terms, with the problem of the creeping monopoly, the possible abuse of a dominant position and so on.  That is the Competition Bill which is with the draftsman now and which I am promised will be completed before October to enable me to introduce it in the Dáil at that stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross referred to the fact that this was a bailing out Bill.  It is not.  If some companies which have run into difficulties want to avail of its provisions, then that is fair enough, but it is legislation that was before this House more than two years ago and which is part of general legislation.  If there is any Bill that I want to see enacted it is the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, and for a very good reason; there are an enormous number of potential malpractices that can go on in Irish commerical life today which we can do nothing about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people talk today about the credibility of Irish business being affected in some fashion <i>vis-a-vis</i> foreign banks and others, then one of the reasons why its credibility might be affected if that is the case, is because we have not got the legislation that we should have.  This <Col N="1125" /> legislation covers the various points.  It is not a criminal offence in this country to indulge in insider dealing.  That is regrettable. It is not wrong legally, whatever about morally, to engage in a phoenix syndrome company creation and leave loads and loads of creditors and small people to whom you owe money high and dry.  That is permissible at present.  There are many things that this Bill will get to grips with and that is why it will have to be given priority in the Dáil.  Then it will come back here with more than 300 amendments made since it passed through this House on 4 October 1988.  I look forward to the co-operation of the House in dealing with those amendments in order that they may be adopted and the Bill signed into law.</P>
    <P>It is only inevitable that we should contrast our lack of control with events in a court in London yesterday. We will give our own businesses and entrepreneurs credibility and better respect when they work within certain parameters rather the way it is at the moment.  I am all for encouraging freedom of enterprise but it has to be freedom within certain parameters of conduct.  We have failed to lay that down so far and I think we should do it now.  This Bill is not so much about conduct as about rescue and trying to bring about a situation where companies, as I put it in the other House, that are judged not to be terminally ill are given <Col N="1126" /> an opportunity to resuscitate themselves. There should be some alternative between just carrying on as normal and going into receivership or liquidation. There should be some middle course.  We lacked that in this country but it has been used beneficially in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Bill before you today may not be perfect but if there are problems in regard to it we can, when we come back in the autumn with the main Bill, take the opportunity then to rectify any deficiencies or defects that come to light at that stage.  I again thank the Seanad for its reception of the Bill and ask the House to pass it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Gerard Collins, Minister for Foreign Affairs, outlined in Dáil Éireann this morning Ireland's position on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  I am glad to avail myself of the opportunity to reiterate to this House that position.</P>
      <P>With the ending of the cold war, which had bedevilled international relations for over 40 years, we had all hoped for the possibility of a more reasonable world order.  Such an order is not possible if actions such as those of Iraq in invading and annexing Kuwait are not rejected utterly.  The invasion and subsequent annexation of Kuwait by Iraq have served to remind us of the paramount need for respect for international law and the central place it must have in any acceptable world order.  The invasion and annexation of Kuwait have shocked the world community.  They represent the most flagrant violation of the UN Charter since the end of the Second World War.  Iraq's action amounts to snuffing out a small State; it aims at no less than the disappearance of a member state of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>When, on 2 August, Iraq invaded Kuwait on the pretext that a popular uprising had taken place and that the provisional Government had requested Iraq's assistance in the maintenance of law and order, Iraq set itself on a collision course with the rest of the world.  It is estimated that over 100,000 Iraqi troops were involved in the invasion.  They met little substantial resistance.  The Emir of Kuwait and a number of the Kuwaiti Cabinet fled to Saudi Arabia.  On 8 August Iraq purported to annex Kuwait. It is noteworthy that no evidence of a popular uprising has been presented and that, up to the time that complete annexation was announced, no Kuwaiti of any kind could be found to lend himself or herself to Iraq's charade of setting up an &ldquo;independent&rdquo; Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which feared further aggression, requested assistance in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, which upholds the <Col N="1129" /> inherent right of states to individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations.  Some countries have provided this assistance, most notably the United States and the United Kingdom, together with Egypt, Syria, Morocco, Bangladesh, Pakistan and most recently, France. Some of these have also agreed to send vessels to the region, as have a number of other countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, West Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the USSR.  The tasks of all of these are not absolutely clear: some vessels are in the region for general surveillance purposes, while others intend to help enforce the UN embargo.  Some other countries &mdash; including members of the WEU which have not yet acted, and Japan &mdash; are considering taking action.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Charter, member states of the United Nations are providing support for the deployment of these forces.  In our case, the refuelling facilities given at Shannon are within the bounds of established policy in the event of an international crisis.  Such facilities are in keeping with our commitment to uphold the UN Charter and to ensure that it is respected in all its aspects.  The UN Security Council, in its Resolution 661 response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, specifically cites Article 51 of the Charter, which provides for the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence of all member states.  The troops transported through Shannon were provided in response to a request for assistance from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  Our action in this matter is consistent with our support for action under the Charter.  I might add that another neutral state, Austria, has provided overflight facilities for these flights.</P>
    <P>The UN Security Council has taken action which is both decisive and unprecedented in the history of the Organisation. It is important that this UN approach should be effective.  This calls for full support for the Decisions of the Security Council which, of course, are mandatory on all states.  Under Article 42 of the UN Charter, there is provision, <Col N="1130" /> if necessary, for further action amounting to a blockade.  Ireland would support such further action if decided by the Security Council.  International solidarity is absolutely essential to deal with this threat to the international order.  Short of military force, only an effective international embargo offers a prospect of a solution.  It is very important that the determination to avoid the use of force and to seek a peaceful solution be maintained.</P>
    <P>Iraq will have to withdraw from Kuwait and the legitimate Government of Kuwait will have to be restored.  These are the basic requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions which are as follows:</P>
    <P>Security Council Resolution 660 of 2 August calls for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Iraq's forces from Kuwait, the immediate start of negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait, and support for Arab League efforts in this direction.</P>
    <P>Resolution 661 of 6 August, imposing sanctions on Iraq, is an unprecedented example of the potential of the UN to act.  It was subscribed to by all the permanent members of the Security Council &mdash; USA, UK, USSR, France and China.  The sanctions which have been imposed cover trade in all commodities and products with Iraq, excluding those supplies intended strictly for medical purposes and, in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Resolution 662 of 9 August, adopted in response to Iraq's declaration of a &ldquo;comprehensive and eternal&rdquo; merger of the two countries, declares that the annexation of Kuwait by Iraq is null and void.</P>
    <P>Resolution 664 of 18 August demands that Iraq permit and facilitate the departure from Iraq and Kuwait of all third-country nationals and, in the interval, do nothing to jeopardise the safety of such nationals.</P>
    <P>Resolution 665 of 25 August calls <Col N="1131" /> upon those Member States with maritime forces in the Gulf region to &ldquo;use such measures commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be necessary&rdquo; to enforce the embargo on trade with Iraq.  This resolution provides the UN cover which the multi-national force was seeking for its enforcement of the trade embargo.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a member state of the European Community, has sought from the outset to co-ordinate our policy in relation to events in the Gulf as closely as possible with our Twelve partners.  In European Political Co-operation this happens automatically.  Given the position of our citizens and those of our EC partners in Iraq and Kuwait, the need for the closest possible co-operation in this field has become ever greater.  Since the invasion, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has attended two extraordinary ministerial meetings with our Community partners and participated in a ministerial troika visit to the region, in which they had valuable discussions in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.</P>
    <P>In a statement on 2 August, the Twelve strongly condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, supported UN Security Council Resolution 660 and called for immediate withdrawal of Iraq's forces.</P>
    <P>On 4 August the Twelve reiterated their condemnation and went on to agree, <i>inter alia</i>, an oil embargo on Iraq and Kuwait; the freezing of Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets; and the suspension of military sales to Iraq.  The Twelve also indicated firm support for any UN Security Council resolution introducing sanctions against Iraq should it not withdraw from Kuwait. These decisions were implemented by Community action on 7 and 8 August and by national actions by the Twelve.</P>
    <P>On 10 August, the Twelve recalled again their condemnation of Iraq's invasion and rejected its annexation of Kuwait.</P>
    <P>At a meeting in Paris on 21 August, Ministers recalled their condemnation of Iraq's aggression against Kuwait.  Further, they focused on the position of <Col N="1132" /> nationals of the Twelve in Iraq and Kuwait; called for their immediate release; and warned Iraq that any injury to such nationals would provoke a very strong response from the Community.</P>
    <P>Ireland has participated in making and implementing these decisions and our position is fully reflected in the stance adopted by the Twelve.  We support the Community's willingness to assist those countries which are confronted by special economic problems arising from the carrying out of the UN measures. Already, we have joined with the Commission and our partners in providing assistance for evacuating from Jordan a large number of Egyptian refugees who were stranded there after fleeing from Iraq.</P>
    <P>The invasion of Kuwait has caused a crisis in the Arab world.  The Arab League adopted a resolution condemning the invasion and annexation on 10 August.  Strenuous efforts are being made to resolve the crisis within an Arab context.  The Twelve have declared themselves ready to support Arab efforts to restore international legality in the framework of the resolutions of the Security Council.  One of the purposes of the troika mission was to signal clearly that support.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives are under way to find a peaceful settlement, notably the meeting of the United Nations Secretary General with Iraq's Foreign Minister in Amman tomorrow.  Mr. Perez de Cuellar will be basing his approach on the need for strict implementation of all the Security Council Resolutions, but particularly of the resolutions calling for withdrawal of Iraq's forces from Kuwait and calling for the release of all foreign nationals.</P>
    <P>King Hussein of Jordan and Chairman Arafat of the PLO are trying to promote an &ldquo;Arab settlement&rdquo;.  The Twelve are prepared to work with the Arab countries to achieve a settlement on the basis of international legality as set out in the UN Charter and in the resolutions of the Security Council.  Any settlement must, of course, take into account the fact that the issue, crucially important as it is for the future world order, is one of concern <Col N="1133" /> to the world community in general and not just to the Arab countries.  Accordingly, any effort at finding a settlement has to have the prospect of finding a just and lasting one in the framework of the resolutions of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the sense of frustration and helplessness which is felt by many people who have family in Kuwait and Iraq.  We are doing everything in our power to deal with the difficulties caused to Irish citizens by Iraq's actions.  The safety and welfare of our 350 or so citizens in Kuwait and Iraq have been, and will remain, the Government's first priority.  All the Irish citizens in both countries are safe.  No Irish nationals have been detained or moved to other locations, as has unfortunately happened to some nationals of the United Kingdom, the United States, France and the Federal Republic of Germany.</P>
    <P>We insist that the rights of Irish and other citizens be respected.  These rights include the right to leave Iraq and Kuwait for destinations of their choice.  It is not, however, within our power to bring our citizens home without the acquiescence of the Iraqi authorities.  We will continue to bring all pressure to bear to achieve this end.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, have directly involved ourselves in co-ordination of the national response to the plight of our citizens in the two countries.  Efforts to secure their release have been conducted at several levels: bilaterally &mdash; our ambassador to Iraq has made numerous representations to the authorities in Baghdad, both nationally and as a member of the Twelve to seek the release of our citizens; the UN &mdash; the Secretary General will meet Iraq's Foreign Minister tomorrow, when the issue of foreign nationals will be one of the main items on the agenda; the Community &mdash; there is very close co-ordination and mutual co-operation of all Twelve; and the International Committee of the Red Cross &mdash; the Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed the matter with the President of the committee on 21 August.</P>
    <P>We are very grateful for the very valuable <Col N="1134" /> assistance we are receiving from our Community partners in looking after the welfare of our citizens trapped in Kuwait. Despite the declared intention by Iraq to close all embassies in Kuwait on 24 August, their embassies are staying in Kuwait as long as possible in order to look after the welfare of their &mdash; and our &mdash; citizens.  They are determined to do this &mdash; at some personal cost &mdash; despite Iraq's harassment, such as interference with water, electricity and gas, prevention of exit from, or access to, the embassies and a purported withdrawal of their diplomatic immunity.</P>
    <P>It is a regrettable fact that the Iraqi authorities are playing on our concerns for the welfare of our citizens in order to erode the solid stance of the whole international community aimed at reversing the illegal annexation of Kuwait.  The right of foreigners to leave the country they are in, for destinations of their choosing, is firmly anchored in international law.  We call on the Iraqi authorities to fulfil their international obligations in this respect.  These obligations apply to all foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait; we refuse to accept that one illegality, the invasion and annexation of Kuwait, should be compounded by another, affecting the rights and welfare of our citizens in Iraq and Kuwait.</P>
    <P>I would like to recall in this connection the statement of 21 August in which the Twelve warned the Iraqi Government that any attempt to harm or jeopardise the safety of any EC citizen will be considered as a most grave offence directed against the Community and all its member states and will provoke a united response from the entire Community. Further, the Twelve warned Iraqi citizens that they will be held personally responsible, in accordance with international law, for their involvement in illegal actions concerning the security and life of foreign citizens.  The responsibilities of Iraq in regard to our citizens are grave.</P>
    <P>Only international solidarity, as expressed in the UN Resolutions, can bring about a peaceful end to Iraq's violation of international law.  Such a resolution <Col N="1135" /> would also safeguard the welfare of our citizens now trapped in Kuwait and Iraq.  In Kuwait, we are totally dependent on the assistance of our Twelve partners to look after the welfare of our citizens. There is no evidence that, by separating ourselves completely from the Twelve position, we would obtain more favourable treatment for our citizens.  If all countries were to follow an individual path, the result would be international anarchy in which no act of illegality could be reversed and no concerted response to the violations of our citizens' rights could be sustained.</P>
    <P>In order to cope with the extra demands being placed on them, the staffing of the two Irish embassies in the region has been increased.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also asked officials in the Department to work extra hours, both in overtime and through the cancellation of summer leave.  I can say from my own experience that the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs, both at home and in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, are unstinting in their commitment to looking after the welfare of Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully aware of the distress and frustration which the present situation causes to relatives of Irish nationals trapped in Iraq or Kuwait. These relatives can be assured that the Government will not cease their efforts to secure the rights of their family members to leave these two countries.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that relatives are as fully informed as possible, the Government formalised the provision of information with the establishment of the special information service on the Middle East.  This service collates all available information from our diplomatic missions, from our EC partners and from other sources.  It has provided regularly updated information to relatives of those in the Gulf region for 17 hours daily, from 7.00 a.m. to midnight.  At its peak, the service provided valuable information and a sympathetic hearing to almost 200 callers per day.  Demand has declined substantially in recent days, most noticeably in the early morning and <Col N="1136" /> late evening.  Therefore, the service will in future operate for 12 hours a day, from 9.30 a.m. to 9.30 p.m.  The infrastructure for the service will remain in place so that, if there should be any increase in demand for any reason, an extended service can be resumed immediately.</P>
    <P>In addition to telephone contact, we identified quickly the need to be available for meetings with groups of relatives.  The Department have readily agreed to provide a venue for the weekly meeting of the Gulf Relatives' Support Group. Departmental officials have met with the relatives' support group on four occasions and provided comprehensive briefing.  I am pleased to see that this type of information exchange has been welcomed. The most recent meeting of the Gulf Relatives' Support Group, held in the Department on 27 August, attracted an attendance of over 130 people. Representatives of PARC and the Department of Health were also present to answer relatives' questions.</P>
    <P>In order to reach as many people as possible, the special information service also circulates names of members of the relatives' support group who are willing to talk to other relatives unable to attend the group's meetings.  A small committee of the group have now been established and the Department will continue to keep in close touch with the committee between the weekly meetings.</P>
    <P>The committee of the relatives' support group asked to see the Taoiseach and he met with them this morning.  This meeting was another in a number of steps the Government have taken to keep the public informed and to allay the fears of relatives.</P>
    <P>As was discussed in the Dáil yesterday, and I understand it was discused here this morning the crisis has impacted severely on our exports.  The sanctions imposed by the United Nations cover trade in all commodities and products with Iraq, excluding supplies intended strictly for medical purposes and, in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Irish exports to Kuwait amounted to £11.2 million in 1989.  Irish exports to Iraq amounted to £47.4 million in 1989 <Col N="1137" /> of which £42.4 million was beef.  Adding export refunds, the trade was worth £90 million to £100 million annually.  Ireland's dependency on this trade is relatively the highest in the Community.  Between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of Iraq's beef imports come from Ireland and beef represents 10 per cent of total Irish exports world-wide.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in a television interview on 23 August, there is a need to develop alternative markets for beef and cattle and we have been concerned to remove any obstacles in the way of exporters.</P>
    <P>We are pleased that, following a lot of pressure on our part, the Twelve have agreed that the ban on high-level visits to Iran should be modified to permit visits by Ministers dealing with &ldquo;technical&rdquo; portfolios.  In relation to the question of the ban on the import of Irish bone-in beef because of fears of BSE, the decision allows the Minister for Agriculture to visit Iran.  His visit will, I hope, clear the way for the full acceptance of our beef on the Iranian market.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs also used the opportunity of his recent visit to Egypt as a member of the EC Troika to impress on the Egyptian Minister for Agriculture the quality and disease-free status of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>To return to the main subject of the debate &mdash; Iraq's invasion of Kuwait &mdash; I would like to underline once again the great importance of the international community making clear the absolute unacceptability of this kind of behaviour.</P>
    <P>Without respect for international norms none of us is safe.  To bring about a return to legality is, of course, not just a matter of speeches and statements, but also a question of the international community re-asserting the rule of law and being determined that violations of international order, such as we have witnessed in recent weeks, will be redressed.</P>
    <P>We now have an important opportunity to take a collective stance in order to demonstrate this unacceptibility and thus set out the parameters for the kind of order which will make for a more secure and stable world, now that the Cold War can be assigned to history. A good beginning has been made.  The <Col N="1138" /> reaction of the Security Council &mdash; the highest organ of the United Nations &mdash; has been unprecedented in its speed and in its scope.  The capacity of the UN to act in such situations is the central element in a future world order which can provide the assurances we all need.  Hence the need for international solidarity in support of the condemnation of Iraq's action.</P>
    <P>The Twelve, too, have been able to act effectively in support of one another, particularly in seeing to the welfare of our citizens in Iraq and Kuwait, and in support of the action taken by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to continue to act in solidarity with our Community partners in total commitment to the measures adopted by the UN.  Now that the last vestiges of the Cold War between East and West have been removed it is our sincere hope that this first test of the new world system can be resolved in a peaceful manner in accordance with the UN Charter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank the Government for providing time for a debate on the situation in the Middle East.  I must compliment the Minister on his very full statement on the situation outlining the Government's point of view.  In this debate we should focus, in particular, on the illegal detention of Irish people and of the people of many other nationalities in Iraq and Kuwait.  I hope that last night's announcement by the Iraqi Government that non-Iraqi women and children will be allowed the freedom to decide whether to stay in Iraq or to leave is given effect.  I hope that that anouncement represents the beginning of a change of mind on the part of the Iraqi Government and a move away from a line of action which flouts all principles of international law and practice and which has been, rightly and universally, condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must make it clear that we maintain our demand that non-Iraqi men, too, must be given the freedom to leave that country, if they so wish.  It is for that reason that I, too, call on the Government <Col N="1139" /> to summon the Iraqi Ambassador and inform him in the clearest possible terms of this country's abhorrence of his Government's illegal action in detaining Irish citizens, men, women and children, and other non-Iraqis; against their will and in depriving them of the liberty to leave Iraq, if that is what they want to do.  That is also the reason why I believe the House today should explicitly support the United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, in his insistence on highlighting the United Nations Security Council Resolution in his meeting with Iraq's Foreign Minister later this week.</P>
    <P>In taking these steps we will be stating very clearly the opinion and belief of this House, as I see it, and the wish of our people in general. We will be adhering rigidly to the terms of the resolutions agreed at the United Nations and we will be making it clear that on this issue there is no such thing as a balanced position; there is only a right and wrong and we should encourage governments of other concerned countries to take the same steps and in doing that, in asking the UN states to insist on this point, we will be making it clear that this kind of interference with the liberty of citizens cannot be tolerated.</P>
    <P>We will also be contributing to what is in my view the best way of ensuring a speedy and complete change of heart on this issue by the Iraqi authorities.  I have come to the conclusion that the best hope for the restoration of liberty to those unfortunate people is to ensure that the Iraqi Government are faced with the full weight of international opinion on this issue.  I believe that every concerned country must make its position crystal clear; they must make it clear that they are working together in a united fashion to achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>I feel that I should compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the Trojan work he has undertaken with his other EC colleagues, with a certain amount of success over the last number of weeks.  I wish their efforts continued success.  The only reservation I have on <Col N="1140" /> the whole policy as put into force by both the Security Council and our EC partners is on the question of the embargos in 1990.  Is it in keeping with the wishes of the people of this country that food supplies, apart from the economic effect of our trade being disturbed, be included as part of a war, whether the war is cold or hot?</P>
    <P>We all have a very genuine abhorrence at the thought of the use of either atomic or chemical weapons in any conflict if that were to arise, but we are a Christian country with certain traditions and with a folk memory going back to the Famine days in 1840, which is almost 150 years ago.  I think the ordinary Irish person in the street would feel quite unhappy about participating in a cold war in an embargo which had the effect of starvation for people, whether they be Iraqis or our own people who have chosen to go to work in foreign countries.  I was slightly disappointed that our Minister for Foreign Affairs did not advert to the fact of the right of these people to food when that particular policy was being formulated.</P>
    <P>I hope that this course of action will quickly bring about the result that we want.  Until it does I believe there are other measures we should take.  Like every other Member of this House I have spoken with individuals who have sons or daughters, brothers or sisters and other relatives in either Iraq or Kuwait.  I can fully understand their fears and their emotions.  They need every support, both moral and physical, and we should ensure that we, and the Government on our behalf, will support them in every way possible.  The actions that I would like to see getting political support would meet the wishes of every Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>One of the great needs, I think, is information and I compliment the Department of Foreign Affairs on their efforts in that regard.  Many of the families are not within easy reach of the Department of Foreign Affairs, or indeed of the PARC authorities, and many of them are already feeling the burden of travelling for news of their <Col N="1141" /> relatives or of making long distance telephone calls for news of what is happening. There is a very simple and practical measure that I think the Minister should consider as an extension to the excellent work they are already doing in Iveagh House, and that is simply to set up a communications centre in which relatives themselves would be able to play a part.  We should provide free phone facilities in order to put the parents at home at ease.  I think it would be very beneficial for a distraught parent, whether a mother or a father, to be able to phone one of their children either in Baghdad or Kuwait and just talk to them for two or three minutes.  It would ease them considerably.  Getting information second hand leaves them in a cloud.  I do not know what that would cost, but I know it would not be very expensive. From newspaper reports one learns that some difficulty is being experienced by those people working in Baghdad in being able to have access to telephones and to have either the money or the change to phone in this direction.  That is a point I would ask the Minister to examine seriously to see if we could help.</P>
    <P>It is almost 51 years since another régime tried to annexe smaller countries. Irrespective of whether Kuwait is an oil rich or mineral rich country, I think the United Nations have certainly done the right thing.  We recall that we had Irishmen and women serving in Namibia for a considerable time.  That is not an oil rich country; it has no great wealth of mineral rights, but they had a problem and the United Nations responded to that.  In this particular situation the United Nations have almost unanimous approval from both East and West for the actions they have taken.  That, I think, must surely give those of us who have always believed in democracy and democratic rights a great hope that at last all countries have come to a realisation and respect for democracy and it is going to be extremely difficult for new, up coming dictators to advance.  Whether the countries being annexed are big or small, whether we trade with them or not, if it was appropriate for the League <Col N="1142" /> of Nations in the twenties and thirties to take a very determined stand for the rights of small nations, it is even more important now, with the modern technology at the disposal of people with evil designs, that we should stand together and be prepared to make sacrifices.</P>
    <P>At the same time, however, it is difficult to say that to the parents of a young Irish person who may be caught in Iraq. Our Government must leave no stone unturned to ensure that every last one of our nationals should be reunited with their families whenever they wish.  I would hope that the efforts of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the wonderful work the officials are doing continue and that they will be allocated whatever additional manpower resources are necessary so that they can effectively and efficiently fulfil the role they are given.</P>
    <P>I would like to support the Minister of State in his view that the Iraqi authorities are playing on our concerns for the welfare of our citizens in order to erode the solid stance of the whole international community aimed at reversing the illegal annexation of Kuwait and the right of foreigners to leave that country for destinations of their own choosing.  As the Minister said, that is a condition which is firmly anchored in international law and I think this House should call on the Iraqi Government and authorities to fulfil their international obligations in this respect. It is quite clear that their attempt to flout almost the unanimous wishes of the rest of the world cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>With those few observations on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I wish to compliment the Minister on the progress that has been made so far, but at the same time to call on the Government to leave no stone unturned to ensure that all of our citizens are given the opportunity of leaving for home whenever they so desire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the first time that we have discussed problems in the Middle East in this House and it is not the first time that I have risen to speak <Col N="1143" /> to the House in relation to, in particular, the problems of Palestinians.  I have spoken in general terms of problems associated with the Middle East for many years.  I am glad to see Minister of State Gallagher here with me, because he visited Iraq at one stage during the war and saw at first hand the depredation that war caused to that country, both physically and mentally, and in every other way.</P>
      <P>I totally agree with the condemnation that has been expressed against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  It is an invasion that should not have taken place.  There was absolutely no way that it could be condoned and I stand behind every statement of condemnation that can be made against the regime of President Saddam Hussein for this invasion.  Before I go into the subject in more depth I would like to pay particular tribute to the Department of Foreign Affairs, the officials of that Department, the Minister, Ministers of State, in particular our two excellent ambassadors, Ambassador Connolly and Ambassador MacUnfraidh and their staffs in Riyadh and Baghdad, because they are doing a fantastic job under difficult circumstances.  The embassies in both Riyadh and Baghdad have been inundated with queries and these queries have been dealt with in a human manner, and everything possible that could be done by our dimlomatic representatives in attempting to help the Irish citizens, whether in Kuwait, Iraq or Saudi Arabia, has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the concern that parents or relatives of those in the Gulf area must have.  I understand totally the frustration that quite a number of these are feeling because of the lack of communication with their families.  Their is concern being expressed that the Government are not doing enough to alleviate the problems that are being experienced in this communication area. I must say that quite a number of these problems are not problems that the Government or PARC or any other company can adequately deal with because I have tried on numerous occasions to ring <Col N="1144" /> Iraq, but unfortunately the message is always that the international telephone lines are not in operation.</P>
    <P>You try to go through the operator but you are told that the lines are not available.  In the last ten days I have only been able to get though once and when I did the line was cut off abruptly.  That applies in particular to Baghdad.  The lines to the embassy in Riyadh have been open and manned for up to 15 hours a day.  At times they were not manned, because there were only two or three people in the embassy at the time, and some people found it extremely hard to get through.  Nevertheless, I feel that as much as is possible has been done by our staffs out there.</P>
    <P>The concern expressed about lack of communication is one I have heard of before during the war between Iran and Iraq.  On visits to Baghdad we had meetings with representatives of the staff of the Ibn-Al-Bitar Hospital who expressed fears as to how they could be got out of Iraq if the war happened to reach the Baghdad area.  I am sure at present the same fears are being expressed as were expressed then.  I would go along with the suggestions and I know that the Minister, the Minister of State and the Taoiseach will take into account the problems associated with the families and their lack of communication.  It is a traumatic experience to have somebody in a war zone and not be able to communicate with them.</P>
    <P>The question as to the use of civilians as hostages has been raised again and again.  Of course, it is totally wrong that citizens should not be allowed freedom of movement from whichever country they happen to be working in.  We must look at the holding of hostages in perspective. It is not too long ago since we in this House were condemning the USSR because they would not allow their Jewish people to leave, and it is only in recent years that those who wished to leave the USSR have been allowed to do so.  So people should not forget what happened in the past.</P>
    <P>I agree with suggestions made that food should not be used as a political <Col N="1145" /> weapon and I am afraid that there are cries throughout the world at present that food should be a political weapon and that the best way to deal with this problem apart from war, would be to starve the people in Iraq.  Food is a political weapon.  We have seen in the Third World how food is a political weapon.  I sincerely hope that the Irish Government, in their total commitment to the United Nations embargo, do not go along with the argument that food should be part of the embargo.  It is necessary that food should be allowed in because a nation cannot be starved out; it has been tried before and it does not work.  There is also a moral side to this and it should not be even attempted.</P>
    <P>There have been moves afoot to suggest that this is an Arab-only conflict and it is up to the Arabs themselves to resolve their own problems.  That is too simplistic a view, but nevertheless the Arab leaders should be allowed to get very much involved in negotiations to attempt to resolve the crisis.  The first issue that has to be addressed is the withdrawal by Iraq from Kuwait.  That has to be the first step in any movement whether it be by Arab negotiators or by negotiators under the auspices of the United Nations.  I do not believe in the King statement or the Thatcher statement that no negotiation is possible in this area.  Negotiations have always to be possible and should be allowed take place.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate too little emphasis has been placed on what is happening in Iraq and Kuwait and the Gulf area, on the fact that within these communities, right throughout the Gulf, there is potential for conflict at present at all times.  I am surprised that the conflict did not come from internal sources in Kuwait, possibly in the United Arab Emirates or in Saudia Arabia and various other places, because of the fact that so few, and in particular you can take it when I say so few I mean that families control the territories that were allotted to them by the British in 1922.  Iraq got rid of the ruler placed in position in 1922; but, apart from that, it can be said that the lines drawn by the British in 1922 are <Col N="1146" /> still the lines that are operative in that area.  When I say that I thought the conflict would arise from within, it is because of the holding of total control by certain small numbers of families to the exclusion of the rights of people working in these countries.</P>
    <P>The real losers in Kuwait are the Sabba family in terms of their loss of their oil resources.  The 300 Palestinians who were actually running that country are possibly bigger losers in the sense that they now, not having citizenship, are again thrown on the world's scrap heap.  Quite a number of them are now in Jordan. Jordan is becoming a destabilised country because of the huge emigration from the Gulf area.  If the destabilisation of Jordan continues, the West and the East will be sorry.  Of course, the only people who are sitting on the sidelines at present, suggesting that it was an unstable state anyway, are the Israelis.  Within Israel itself there is a debate taking place as to what should be done, whether they should attack now or wait to be attacked. Within the state of Israel there are hawks who would like to exacerbate the situation in the Middle East.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations, for the first time in many years, has got its act together in uniting itself to deal with a particular problem.  I sincerely hope that the United Nations will follow up on its present strength.  It has the virtually unanimous support of all the world states in its condemnation of the Iraqi military invasion of Kuwait and it also has virtually unanimous support for the economic sanctions that were imposed.  The United Nations Security Council were in fact the people who suggested that the sanctions be extended.  We are not members of the United Nations Security Council, so we did not have a vote in that body as to whether we should go along with resolution <Col N="1147" /> 665.  Nevertheless, as a member of the United Nations, we go along fully with the United Nations Security Council resolution.</P>
    <P>The destabilising effect of what Saddam Hussein has done in his invasion of Kuwait will have long term effects throughout the Middle East.  The international community is going to have to be careful in how it continues to react. The international community is going to have to look carefully at the makeup of the states in the Gulf.  The leaders of the states in the Gulf area are going to have to look at their own internal security situation, their own economic situation and their treatment of people who work in those areas.  If they do not, we will see a continuity of problems in the Middle East, more dangerous than the present confrontation, if there could be a more dangerous confrontation than exists at present.</P>
    <P>We are being preached at by the media.  It is unfortunate that we seem to accept that CNN, through Sky News, is the best news agency that is coming out of the conflict area.  CNN is a CIA controlled body.  It is a fact that much of the media reportage being carried here is media reportage which has its origin in the British television stations.  We do not have experienced Middle East reporters involved in this conflict.  Our reportage is not, from an Irish point of view, good enough.  There are people from RTE and possibly from one of the other stations out there, but their knowledge of the area is not good and their reporting is, I think, worse.</P>

      <P>The situation is that we are not getting a balanced reportage.  But I also think that the efforts by Saddam Hussein to bolster up his image in the Middle East by producing his &ldquo;Guest Nights&rdquo; is not doing any great good to his situation either.  He has a total lack of knowledge as to the western mentality in terms of its acceptance of fed reporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to speak for a few minutes <Col N="1148" /> on the question of the reason for the huge international intervention in the area. The huge international intervention is because it is an oil rich area.  If there were no oil in Kuwait, if there were no oil in Saudia Arabia, if there were no oil in the United Arab Emirates, there would not be one single sinner in the international community who would bother.</P>

      <P>Between the years 1973 and 1978 oil prices quadrupled and between 1978 and now there has not been any movement in oil prices.  The price of a barrel of oil before August 1 was about $17.  It was $30 a barrel in 1978.  If it went to $30 a barrel at present, I would like to know what the equation is between the value of $30 in 1978 and the value of $30 now.  I would suggest that the value of $30 in 1990 as against 1978 would be possibly a quarter.  Therefore, oil prices in fact have gone down and there is a very cheap resource there.  The cheap energy resource is what the international community are looking at, the protection for the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the first time the west decided to protect its source of cheap energy.  The &ldquo;seven sisters&rdquo; controlled that area for too many years; and, unfortunately, the &ldquo;seven sisters&rdquo; look as if they are going back in again.  The seven major oil producing or oil selling companies are going to be the big winners in this if they get control again of that area.  It looks as if Saddam Hussein has given them the opportunity to so do.  In regard to oil, which is a non-replaceable commodity, if the world cannot look at alternative means of energy-sourcing, than the world is a very bad place.  If one takes 1980 as a base and say that the usage of oil in 1980 was 100, that has gone down to 63 now so that the use of oil as a means of energy production has reduced.  This is one of the reasons why many people are <Col N="1149" /> not worried about what is going on in the Gulf at present.  There is an abundant supply of oil in the world.  It is different from 1973 or 1978.  There is 100 days supply of oil in strategic places at present whereas in 1973 there was no oil at all.</P>
    <P>I was reading a book by David Fromkin called &ldquo;Peace To End All Peace. Creating the Modern Middle East 1914 to 1922&rdquo;.  It could be said that the attitude of the British at that stage through its Encylopaedia Britannica has not changed since.  It states:</P>
    <P>Physically the Arabs are one of the strongest and noblest races of the world.  Thus physically they yield to few races, if any, of mankind.  Mentally they surpass most and they are only kept back in the march of progress by the remarkable defect of organising power and incapacity for combined action.  Lax and imperfect as are their forms of government it is with impatience that even those are borne.</P>
    <P>This coming from the people who created the stateless in 1922 by arbitrarily drawing lines around certain areas in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Gertrude Bell who worked in the British Foreign Office under Lloyd George stated that:</P>
    <P>You are flying in the face of four milleniums of history if you try to draw a line around Iraq and call it a political entity, as Syria always looked to the west and east and north and Babylonia to the south.  They have never been an independent unit.  You have got to take time to get them integrated.  It must be done gradually.  They have no conception of nationhood yet.</P>
    <P>They have a conception of nationhood which includes Kuwait.  I am not too sure whether an arbitrary line that is drawn by Saddam Hussein has any more relevance than the arbitrary lines drawn in 1922 by the British.  The Arabs are a nation.  The European imperial intervention in the Middle East has been a sad one.  It is very sad that the lines drawn in 1922 are becoming lines of contention in 1990.  We have to be careful that what is happening <Col N="1150" /> in the Middle East does not have a major impact outside that area.  We are seeing the crocodile tears of the British, German, French,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the United Nations, in their attitude towards the threat of chemical warfare.  It has to be understood that there is chemical warfare going on in the world at present.  Anyone who visited the West Bank and Gaza will have seen United States made chemicals being used against children and that cannot be gainsaid.</P>
      <P>The supply of technical information came from Europe.  Whether it came from Austria or Germany does not make any difference.  Their military capacity has come from the USSR, Britain and France.  Britain is still prepared to sell arms to the Middle East but not to Iraq. It is building up the armies.  This week it sold planes to Saudi Arabia.  The British are still selling technology into the area which the Iraqis have got hold of.  They have sea mines which have the capacity to escape the dragnets of the ships in the Gulf.</P>
      <P>Crocodile tears are being shed by major Governments when they talk about chemical weapons and the buildup of weaponry in Iraq and other states in the Middle East.  The major States have been selling those arms to them. There is no point in crying about the use these arms might be put to because when arms are sold, they are only sold for one reason, for use in a war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate gives the Government an opportunity to reiterate their total support for United Nations sanctions but there are questions that have to be asked in relation to the embargo on food exports to that area and in particular to the Iraqi area.  I have no doubt that food should be allowed in.  I am not talking from an Irish commercial point of view. I do not want to see people starved into submission.  These people had nothing to do with the decisions made at the highest level by Saddam Hussein.  The Iraqi people do not deserve to be starved <Col N="1151" /> because their leader has the same type of colonial aspirations as had the British, the French, the Germans, the Russians and the Dutch in that area for many years.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the Palestinians. They are the biggest losers in the long term as a result of what Saddam Hussein has done.  I hope that this is recognised. There are other losers too &mdash; the Filipinos, the North Koreans and the Egyptians who are working in the Gulf area. Their situation is bad.  There are people in Jordan who, having fled from Iraq and Kuwait, are penniless, and they will go back into penury in their home countries. From one point of view, I am not saddened to see certain Filipinos get out of the Gulf area.  They ran the households but they were treated as slaves.  That is an area we must look at when this conflict is over.  The misuse of people from Third World countries by richer nations must be questioned and whether it be in Paris, Baghdad or Kuwait the world has a responsibility to look at the problems associated with slave labour.</P>
    <P>We wish Perez de Cuellar well in his efforts today with Aziz, the Foreign Minister of Iraq to get a basis for negotiations. I do not believe in the thinking that might is right.  I believe that all conflicts are resolved by discussion and negotiation. There is only one abiding principle that must be addressed, that is the Iraqis have to leave Kuwait.  After that we can talk about the problems associated with the political situation in the area.  The primary concern must be that no negotiations take place until the Iraqis leave Kuwait.  I am glad that this very relevant debate is taking place.  I am also glad that the Seanad was recalled and that we were able to debate the matter in a calmer manner than it has been debated in the media over the past number of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must observe that it is highly regrettable that our debate should take place in the total absence of the media.  I know that our contributions will be recorded, but we had to protest about this kind of thing before.  It is very <Col N="1152" /> unusual that there is a total absence of the media and there should be a better arrangement in the Press office.</P>
      <P>I would like to endorse much of what Senator Lanigan said about the good work being done by the Department of Foreign Affairs, by various Ministers and public servants, ambassadors and so on. In particular, let us sound a note of unallayed and unconfined joy on the release of Brian Keenan.  It is an event which should not be clouded by any controversy or reservations.  Everybody involved is entitled to our congratulations, and perhaps we should put on record a special commendation to our colleague, Senator Eoin Ryan, who was one of the parliamentarians involved in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>On the general matter of the Gulf, it goes without saying that I, like everybody else, regard Saddam Hussein as a &ldquo;baddie&rdquo;.  I am not sure he is a &ldquo;maddie&rdquo;, which is the impression given nightly on the western media.  It should be remembered that he is a Frankenstein created by the West to a large extent.  That is only one of the many respects in which the analogy with Hitler breaks down.  Whatever about the victorious allied powers being responsible for the rise of Hitler, they certainly did not supply him, as far as I know, with the appalling sinews of war as the West has done with Saddam Hussein.  He is, to some extent, a Frankenstein created by the West and most major western nations have their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to a slanted western point of view in the media coverage. Senator Lanigan referred to a partisan view.  What are deplorable, night after night, are the strident and bellicose tones on channels like the BBC.  Even in the suave tradition of the BBC, there is the strident note, continual disparaging remarks about the Iraqis in general and Saddam Hussein in particular.  That reflects the abusive stance of people like President Bush and Margaret Thatcher who not only use the terminology of demons when they apply it to Saddam Hussein but have virtually given up hope, <Col N="1153" /> if they ever had it, that the problem will have a peaceful outcome.</P>
    <P>The difference in emphasis between the British and the Americans on the one hand, say, and the Soviets on the other, is interesting in this regard.  Mr. Gorbachev says diplomacy has not been exhausted and the others are virtually saying there is no point really in hoping that this will bring any real solution.  It seems to me, unfortunately, that the Anglo-American alliance is geared for war.  We sometimes hear this expressed in very extreme terms indeed.  Last night there was a clip of a United States Republican Senator who in effect said, &ldquo;let us go in and take them out; I will take them out myself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apart from the deterioration of the situation that this bellicose rhetoric represents, there is the failure to realise that Saddam Hussein is, in many ways, something thrown up by the Arab world.  If this Saddam Hussein disappeared, there might well be another Saddam Hussein. He is, in fact, a symbol and a symbol of the turmoil in the Arab world.</P>
    <P>The fact that Arabs are divided among themselves about the events that have taken place since 2 August should not make us blind to the fact that the Arab world as a whole is hostile to the western intervention, except those brokers of power who have a vested interest in being shored up by the American intervention. The military build up by the West has provoked extreme Arab hostility.  What is now facing the world is a confrontation and a polarisation that has been obscured for a long time by the Cold War. In many ways the polarisation, the Cold War, was within the western family. Marxist Leninism was a heresy within western philosophy.  What we are now seeing is the West versus Islam, something much more ancient and fundamental &mdash; a confrontation between Islam and Christianity, a conflict between West and East, between rich and poor and between mutually uncomprehending cultures.  Much of the abusive language used by people like President Bush and Margaret Thatcher is due to total <Col N="1154" /> inability to understand a radically different culture and a radically different civilisation.</P>
    <P>Even those Arabs and Middle Eastern powers who gave guarded support to the West in this area have their doubts about the motivations of the Americans, for example.  The last time I was in the United States petrol hovered around the $1 a gallon mark and there was universal panic that it could possibly go over $1 a gallon.  The Americans, as a people, are as undertaxed as we are overtaxed.  There is no doubt but that the phrase &ldquo;national interest&rdquo; on the lips of President Bush means among other things, continued access to a source of cheap fuel and energy which will continue to shore up a luxury standard of living.  The Arabs are cynically aware of this less than perfect motivation of the West and, of course, the occupation of territory, which is the crime held against Saddam Hussein since his invasion of Kuwait, was not something that troubled the West unduly when used by its own supporters in the Middle East, particularly by Israel.</P>
    <P>There are, as Senator Lanigan rightly pointed out, considerable hypocrisies in the whole story.  Saddam Hussein has, unwittingly or otherwise, also exposed a division of social and economic classes within the Arab world, in other words, he parades himself as a champion of the Arab underdog, even as an exponent of socialism.  No matter how fraudulent we may think these claims are, his action has definitely thrown up and exposed the division between the haves and the have nots in the Arab world.  Anyone who thinks that Islam is a homogeneous socioeconomic unit has only to think of the richest man in the world.  King Fahd on the one hand and the most miserable of the dispossessed, let me say among the Palestinians on the other.  Indeed ranged alongside King Fahd are those other potentates who have a vested interest in the <i>status quo.</i>  At the risk of being facetious may I say that they are no great shakes.</P>
    <P>Saddam Hussein has disturbed a nest of hornets there.  When the immediate crisis is over let us hope peacefully over, <Col N="1155" /> all that is something to be considered by the West, and by the European Community in particular.  They have to decide how to deal in the long term with that enormously complicated and, in many ways, alien and alienated Arab world. There is much truth in the stereotype that is drawn of Hussein but the reaction of President Bush is that Hussein's suggestions are universally wacky &mdash; the latest being that there should be a cosy tripartite discussion on television between himself, Thatcher and Bush.  But, when Saddam Hussein suggested that this whole conflict was a matter for a universal round table consideration of the whole Middle East situation, when he said, for example, that disengagement from Kuwait should be linked to Israeli disengagement from the occupied territories and American withdrawal from Saudi Arabia, it may have sounded outrageous but there was a core of truth at the heart of the whole thing.  Whatever solutions are arrived at in the next few months can only be a temporary solution until there is a total global solution of the Middle East.  Through his mad and aggressive actions he has thrown that chestnut into the fire, he has put that on the table, on the long term agenda.</P>
    <P>It may take a long time before the morale of the Iraqis is broken by United Nations economic sanctions.  We have no escape from that dilemma.  Even when general supplies and food run short it will not bring Iraq to its knees overnight. With respect to food in particular, and with respect to rationing in general, let us remember that a national population under wartime siege may have its morale enhanced from food rationing and from shortages.  That was the case in the United Kingdom during the Second World War.  It was the case in neutral Ireland during what we call the Emergency. Hardship is not necessarily a quick determinant of a political situation.  The danger there, of course, is that being so, there will be the strong temptation from these massed forces along the Saudi Arabian-Iraqi border to try out the quick solution, the dangerous and bloody solution. <Col N="1156" /> We have enough trigger-happy people among the politicians and military who want to take that solution.</P>
    <P>Our own position in all this has been much discussed because of the hostages. Today there was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Mary Holland, which should be read perhaps in conjunction with one a week ago by Fintan O'Toole, suggesting that our foreign policy is in a shambles and that, essentially, we are following different, and sometimes contrary, lines of action.  If our foreign policy is in a shambles one reason for it is the lack of parliamentary control of foreign policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and specifically &mdash; we will continue saying this until something is done about it &mdash; the absence of a joint committee on foreign affairs. Sooner or later foreign policy must be accountable to public and parliamentary control.  There is a sense in which our foreign policy is inconsistent and contradictory. There is no doubt about that. This is so because we have inherited two different foreign policies from the history of the last 30 or 40 years.  The conflict between those two strands of policy is the conflict between the ghosts of Seán Lemass and Frank Aiken, between an Ireland orientated towards Europe wishing to be accepted as a member of the European Community, wishing to behave itself well within that Community on the one hand, and on the other an Ireland following the shades of Frank Aiken which sees itself, rather or as well, as, I am not sure which &mdash; a member of a world community having a rapport and sense of indentity with the lesser nations because of our history, our neutrality during the war and our colonial experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our foreign policy is in uneasy conflict between those two different strands and, of course, there is another element which compounds it further.  There is also our need as a state with great problems of unemployment and emigration, to be nice to the United States.  That is yet <Col N="1157" /> another component: to be nice to the United States and not to offend the United States and as well a genuine sense of kinship with the United States.  All that again, of course, reinforces the need for a discussion on foreign policy not as an <i>ad hoc</i> response to a crisis but as a long term part of the personality of this State.</P>
    <P>The big question is, can we follow these two lines at the same time.  Can the gobadán freastal ar an dá thrá, can we run with the United Nations hare and follow the European Community hound?  I believe we can.  That is what the art of diplomacy is about.  It is quite obvious from the present crisis that individual members of the European Community, the EPC and the aim of having a common foreign policy notwithstanding, have different world interests.  They have different national interests.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan's speech is a very good example of that.  He referred to the British as virtually an evil genius in the genesis of this whole Middle Eastern problem.  He referred to one of our Community partners as being one of the baddies in the present situation.  What he is actually saying is that Britain had its own national interest in the Middle East which would be quite different from our national interest, and Britain still pursues that national interest.  It seems to me that the reaction of the British, the French and the Italians over the last month to unfolding events has been, on the whole, very much an individual national response.  What I am saying is that if the European Community is about diverse cultures, cannot it also, within reason, be about different nuances of approaches to international affairs?</P>
    <P>As far as we can, we must pursue our own national interests within the constraints and conflicting inheritances of which I spoke.  If the green passport helps, then we should play it for all it is worth. The green passport is a symbol of a remaining national identity in the international community.  I still possess, and hope to for as long as possible, a green passport but that is an individual preference. What I am saying is that if we <Col N="1158" /> can play the green flag and the green card in the Middle East then let us play them provided it is not in flagrant contradiction with whatever common policy is resolved by our European partners.  There are inevitable anomalies and inconsistencies here.  They have not yet been resolved. Until they have been resolved and we have a clear policy we have to pay homage to Aiken and Lemass at the same time, as it were, or whenever it suits our purpose.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister's point in which, very diplomatically, there is a reply to those distressed relatives &mdash; understandably very distressed relatives &mdash; who have their families locked up and trapped in this crisis and who are demanding that we should do something dramatic about it.  That the Taoiseach should go to Baghdad, for example is a most extreme demand.  The point made by the Minister is that that would make matters worse. For example, we cannot pursue the interest of our nationals in Baghdad at the expense of our nationals in Kuwait where we have no direct representation, where we are beholden there, and in other places, to the diplomatic delegations of our Community partners.  We cannot afford to go it alone in that respect but, that being said and that dramatic alternative not being open to us there is definitely a case for pushing the same kind of pressures that got Brian Keenan released and playing the green card as far as possible in these matters.  Meanwhile, what we certainly must do is support the United Nations policy as distinct from any more belligerent attitudes building up in the Gulf crisis.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that there are two different attitudes yet, two different kinds of presence in the crisis, that there is the United Nations policy on sanctions and the more belligerent attitude of the United States and Britain and so on in terms of the military build-up.  Perhaps as of now the bellicose context is being harmonised somewhat uneasily within the United Nations picture.  If there are two scenarios, and if there are two lines <Col N="1159" /> to be pursued then we must give no comfort to the warmongers or to the sabre rattlers.</P>
    <P>We must follow the United Nations line, we must put our trust in Perez de Cuellar and pray him every success in his immediate mission because, of course, the great hope that is coming out of this agonising crisis is that the United Nations will emerge for the first time since its foundation 45 years ago with a chance to breathe and to have a new status and respect.  In many ways the most important issue now at stake in the Gulf crisis is not who will win or who will lose in terms of the protagonists but whether the United Nations will finally steer us all to a new post Cold War order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with speakers in this House, in the other House and probably throughout the world in condemning the actions of Iraq in its invasion of Kuwait some weeks ago.  This has precipitated a world crisis on an enormous scale and of potentially enormous consequences for all of us, not just the Western world.</P>
      <P>One of the things that has been said in this debate which surprises me is that the West would not have the slightest interest in Kuwait if it was not for its oil reserves. That is true.  However, Saddam Hussein would have no interest in Kuwait either if it was not for its oil reserves and to fuel his megalomania in building what I believe is now the fourth or fifth largest military power in the world.  We have got to put things somewhat in perspective. We do not have to berate ourselves too much in the West about the actions that have been taken on a united world front to deal with the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Murphy said.  One of the most important things at the moment is the re-emergence of the United Nations.  That body ceased to function in any real crisis for a long number of years because of the existence of the Cold War.  It did not have within it the capacity to deal with world crises because of the veto situation which was simply invoked due to the differences in ideologies among many countries.  Its <Col N="1160" /> inability to act rendered it in many ways a meaningless body.  However, the present crisis has given great hope for the future in that if the efforts of Perez de Cuellar are to be successful over the coming days and weeks, and it is seen that it is primarily as a result of United Nations efforts that the Middle East conflict can be resolved, then a truly new era in international relations will have been born. Because of the end of the Cold War, which we all welcome so warmly, it is vital that some body with world-wide support, that is, the UN, is strong enough in a crisis to take the initiative and prevent the global disaster which indeed we may still be faced with.</P>
    <P>The West, of course, has a lot to answer for in its avaricious and hungry desire to sell weapons wherever it can to build up armaments throughout the world.  It has always puzzled me why these weapons continue to be produced when already throughout the world there are enough to blow us all to kingdom come I do not know how many times over.  Yet so many economies, particularly the American economy, have such a dependence on their defence industry. The US are not alone in that.  France, the UK, Germany and other countries tend to obtain much of their income from the production of weapons.  However, when the day arrives, as it has now, that those very weapons that were created in the West may be turned against the West, the situation changes.</P>
    <P>I have held the belief for many years that the really big conflict that will occur in the world will be an economic one and probably fuelled by the need for oil as a source of energy.  Whether oil is at present a cheap source of energy or a dear one I do not know, but it is certainly legitimate for the world to want to stabilise the situation.  The world economies, the employment of peoples throughout the world, depends on stability, and the cost of energy is one of the key components in most industrialised economies. If that source of energy is allowed to be controlled primarily by one man, one country or within one area, then the <Col N="1161" /> rest of the world and its economies can be held to ransom, can be hugely destabilised and the crises we saw in the seventies will seem like passing anomalies in comparison to what the potential would be if Saddam Hussein is to achieve which I believe is his real ambition, control of not just Kuwait but, indeed, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and anywhere else that might just fall into his clutches.  He has not built up this massive military might simply to protect his own country or to annex a country like Kuwait which is obviously incapable of defending itself, as is Saudi Arabia.  Without the intervention of Western and Arab forces it would have disappeared very quickly.</P>
    <P>The question of whether food should be used as a political weapon in relation to sanctions was also raised.  The resolve of the Iraqi people will be unstinting against sanctions and it will be a long, difficult and slow process.  Whatever means can bring that process to a conclusion should be used.  If food is to be part of that process, then so be it.  If we are to have meaningless sanctions or if they are to work in some ways and not in others, we will all be watching the Middle East for the rest of this decade and probably beyond.</P>
    <P>The taking of hostages, be they Western or from whatever country, by the Iraqi regime is contemptible.  The efforts of Saddam Hussein, parading himself on television using children to show the world that his guests, as he calls them, are in good health, was appalling.  It was an absolute disgrace and made one want to vomit.  He is not the first ruler in this century to have utilised the same type of PR and we saw the results of that evil regime some 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that view that the problem in the Middle East is just an Arab problem.  I do not believe it can be solved by the Arab people themselves because it affects the rest of the world.  I cannot change that.  If we lived in an ideal world perhaps we could talk about different ideologies, the way we would like to see things done and how everybody should live happily together but the world is not like that.  Given the parameters within <Col N="1162" /> which we have to operate, it is legitimate for the world, through the UN, to take action where necessary.</P>
    <P>The invasion of Kuwait has raised, legitimately, the question of the Isreali occupation of the West Bank and other territories, the PLO and all the other questions that have been building under the surface over the last number of years. If we resolve the Kuwaiti problem tomorrow morning, next week or in six months time and the world is happy with the outcome, we should not sit back and forget about the other problems in the Middle East.  Those questions must be part of a longer term agenda for the Middle East.  The UN, which got &ldquo;teeth&rdquo;, as I said earlier, and are operating in a very forceful manner, should bring the same powers and will to bear on other important issues that are dominant in the Middle East at present.</P>
    <P>One of the points this conflict has raised, and which is a hobby-horse of mine, is our foreign policy.  In my view we have a schizophrenic foreign policy.  It has grown out of a mythological neutrality to which I do not adhere.  I do not believe, and never have as I have stated on many occasions, that we are a neutral country.  We are neutral in the sense that we do not have a massive army and are unlikely to ever have one.  We certainly will not be invading anybody because we do not have the means or more importantly the desire to do so.  The reality is that we are part of the western democratised world and our economy and the movement of our people depend on the western world.</P>
    <P>We can no longer be part of Europe as it is being constituted and then opt out when certain questions arise.  It was a great disappointment for me, and I am sure for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when he had to opt out of the EPC meetings in Europe in recent weeks.  Our present Minister for Foreign Affairs has done an enormous job on behalf of this country.  He has brought tremendous credibility and scope to the Irish point of view.  His achievements in gaining the release of Brian Keenan have been extraordinary.  He has made important <Col N="1163" /> contacts throughout the world and, obviously, is a highly respected figure in international diplomacy.  I do not see why, simply because we are a neutral country our viewpoint from a neutral standpoint cannot be put across at whatever levels we seem to be involved in.  I think we are somehow admitting to the world that we are second class citizens within Europe.  I have a great fear of this emerging if we opt out of some of the existing structures on the basis that we are neutral, a point of view I do not hold.</P>
    <P>If we truly want to be a neutral country in a military sense, there is a legitimate role for us to play; we can express our opinions and be party to all the developing structures that exist, particularly within the EC at present.  I dislike intensely &mdash; this is a personal point of view &mdash; our present stand, our present conditioning and the propagating of the different type of myths and strands of neutrality that we tend to adhere to.  I am fairly convinced that we are going to have to face up to this sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>We have played the green card, to use Senator Murphy's expression, fairly successfully over the last number of years.  I have no quibble with that.  The more successful we are at it the better.  I have no doubt that the crunch is coming for us.  We cannot be taking so much from various sources on the one hand and opting out on the other hand.  I have no problem with the fact that we are members of the United Nations, and that American transport planes going to the Middle East are refuelling at Shannon but I am sure there are many other people who do have a problem with it and I can see why.  Where does the line of neutrality that we are supposed to have begin and end?  We need to have a serious debate on this topic.  We need once and for all to clear our minds and our hearts and establish a proper perspective on where Ireland's future is to be in that area.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly agree with the formation of a joint committee on foreign affairs.  This was debated long before I entered the Dáil or indeed, this House but has come more to the top of the <Col N="1164" /> agenda is the last number of years for obvious reasons.  It is because we live in such an international environment and have such interdependent international economies, particularly in Europe, that it is inevitable that our foreign policy, our attitudes on many different topics are coming more to the fore.  It is my opinion that we as legislators in both Houses have a legitimate right as representatives of our people to actively participate in the formation of the foreign policy of this country.  The present position is ridiculous. In the past all Governments ran away from this idea.  I will be very disappointed if this Government, of which my party is a party, run away from the formation of a joint committee on foreign policy.  This is a very fundamental issue.</P>
    <P>I believe that, privately, Members of all parties and Independents see the need for having such a committee.  I do not mean that the legitimate right of the Government of the day would be negated or restricted because of the existence of a proper joint committee on foreign affairs but I believe it would be aided tremendously by the existence of such a committee. It is a great shame that we do not have such a committee.  I will continue to press within my own party and on this Government for the establishment of a joint committee on foreign affairs.  It is long overdue and there is an enormous amount of work they could tackle immediately.  There will be no shortage of things for them to do.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister, on their efforts to secure the release of Brian Keenan.  I want also to congratulate the embassies and diplomats who assisted in this matter.  The staff and diplomats working in those Departments should put the contacts they have built up at the disposal of other countries whose nationals are held as hostages in the Middle East.  That would be the correct course of action and would be welcomed by other countries.</P>
    <P>We cannot get directly and actively involved on behalf of other countries but the contacts that have been built up by the Minister and his staff should be used <Col N="1165" /> to the full to resolve that problem.  Of course, that problem has now been. superseded by the hostages being held in Iraq and Kuwait.  However, we should not forget those other people are still being held.</P>
    <P>The world must take an extremely firm line about taking hostages.  It is a weapon that has become fashionable over the last number of years and is a problem which is very difficult to resolve.  I agree that the Middle East crisis cannot be resolved by listening to every point of view, and that putting the hostages to the fore and then making decisions based on the fact that the hostages are <i>in situ</i> in the Middle East would be the wrong approach. Obviously, whatever decisions are made at United Nations level will take that into consideration.  It is a very difficult problem and the brakes must be put on now.</P>
    <P>In regard to the problem in Iraq, I hope the Leader of that country will stand back and listen to his own diplomatic corps who must be consistently bringing the same message to him: that the world utterly and totally condemns his actions and that under no circumstances &mdash; no matter how long it takes or what his obvious ambitions are &mdash; will he get away with what he has done in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>The Arab people are divided on this matter but it is not as simple as has been said; they are not simply divided on social class in terms of the haves and have-nots. One of my greatest fears with the Middle East crisis is this fundamental holy war type attitude, in other words, the attempt to &ldquo;stir-up&rdquo; the Arab population by the use of this holy war.  If that was to be the spark that lit the fuse in the Middle East, the consequences would be horrendous. We all know &mdash; it is no secret &mdash; that the Iraqis have the capacity to use chemical weapons.  We do not know the extent of the devastation that could be caused by them and it will be virtually impossible for armies, not to mention innocent civilians, to withstand the effects of a chemical war.  The consequences of the response from the West, in nuclear terms, that I see on some of our less favoured American television news <Col N="1166" /> broadcasts &mdash; on which I have heard tactical nuclear weapons spoken of &mdash; would be horrendous for the whole world.  I do not know what a tactical nuclear weapon is in comparison to a nuclear weapon; either it is or it is not a nuclear weapon. There are many flashpoints, danger signals and unexpected events that could spark this off.  I can imagine the feeling in America today where a plane crashed in Germany and 12 Americans were killed &mdash; I am not sure if that number is correct but they are the last figures I received.  Those accidents &mdash; or whatever they are &mdash; tend to fuel national pride and the hawks begin to get into full flow and before we know where we are war has started.</P>
    <P>The resolve of the UN should be broken.  That is the key to preventing a war in the Middle East.  The great Super Powers, America and Russia, are working together, no matter how tenuously and that must be encouraged.  If we can proceed down that road it can only be for the benefit of all.  I hope there will be no more hostage taking and that the recent announcements about women and children being free to leave Iraq and Kuwait are true.  I hope they get out as quickly as possible and that they will be immediately followed by the release of all hostages held in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>If Iraq were to take that course, the world would take a further step back from the brink and it would be a very encouraging sign for negotiations to get underway.  After all, negotiations must begin at some stage and at some level. Nobody is going to march in or out of Kuwait without some form of discussion taking place beforehand.  The sooner that process takes place the better.  This country is ideally suited to be active in many ways in trying to bring about peace in the Middle East, notwithstanding what I believe to be a number of problems with what we express as our neutrality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Murphy looked for an extension this afternoon so that we could address such an important issue.  I wonder &mdash; and I am not being cynical, but very honest &mdash; if <Col N="1167" /> we did not have the meat crisis would we be here today?  Before the weekend, we were specifically to speak on the Companies Bill and there was no reference to the Gulf crisis.  It came as a sort of second option &mdash; now we are here we might as well debate it.  I and Senators in the Fine Gael group were annoyed at the speed with which the Companies Bill was put through today.  It shows that expediency really is more important than full debate.</P>
      <P>Seanad Éireann must condemn that Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  Many speakers have put the complexity of the Middle East crisis before us today.  The Iran/Iraq crisis has been going on for the last eight years.  The general public are not very well informed on the Middle East crisis. I have heard a lot today from people who have an interest in it from an historical viewpoint, from today's viewpoint and from a military viewpoint, but I will be emphasising the human dimension, and not just of our own people out there which, of course, is foremost in our hearts.  They are working for a developing country and giving of their expertise.  The cynics will say they are well paid but the bottom line is that our people are there on an altruistic mission and they have continually supported infrastructural, educational and medical developments in developing countries.  I saw on television last night the thousands of poor refugees who are crossing into Jordan with nothing, a country that can ill afford to look after them.  One refugee camp had 17,000 people without money or food. There is the danger that the huge human dimension which is always forgotten in war will again be overlooked in this conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly I would like the Seanad to condemn the Iraqi Government's refusal against the principles of international law and practice to allow our citizens and other non-nationals to leave either Iraq or Kuwait.  Again we should affirm strongly our full support for the United Nations Security Council Resolutions Nos. 660, 661, 662, 664 and 665 that were mentioned in the Minister's speech and also the common EC position.  From what <Col N="1168" /> I can gather reading through reports over the last few weeks, the French seem to have done their thing, as did the Germans. I did not see any great cohesive EC strong feeling of a full European context in support.  It was rather piecemeal; it was rather individualistic.  Irish people wondered, to whom do we belong.  I will later look at the concept of our neutrality.</P>
    <P>Again, it is imperative that the Government summon the Iraqi Ambassador to tell him how much we abhor the illegal action of his Government. Perhaps all this has been done, but it is no harm to repeat it.  We should demand the immediate reversal of Iraqi actions.  I will be spending some time talking about the need for a communications centre with Freephone facilities for Irish families with relatives in Iraq and Kuwait.  Up to last Sunday, there were people in my own area who had actually no contact one way or another with PARC.  They were people who did not realise that there was an action committee in Dublin, families with children working with PARC as nurses and they had had no contact with anybody. They felt they were the forgotten number.  When PARC suggested that they would set up a communications liaison network they singled out Galway and Cork, and seem not to know about the geographical location of the mid-west. There is the notion that they have tabs on everybody who is directly involved but when it comes right down to specific families the areas of the mid west, North Tipperary, South Tipperary &mdash; which is not quite the mid-west but which is mid-west geographically &mdash; and Limerick are forgotten.</P>
    <P>Many of those people who are farmers have forgotten totally the importance of the meat industry.  Quite honestly, they are saying: &ldquo;forget it; our children are out there&rdquo;.  They, obviously, with world headlines about oil and meat think &mdash; excluding the humanity of Mr. Goodman who is a member of the human race &mdash; that we are talking about commodities. No wonder those people are cynical when they think of themselves <Col N="1169" /> and their needs.  All they see is the media coming and going in relation to commodities. All they hear is what the United States are doing, whether we are involved with them as has been said already, or whether we feel we should be supportive of the United States because of the close bond between us and butter our bread on occasions.  We hear about how oil is so important to us, but it is not important to them at the moment.  They are very upset over the whole consumerist approach to the problem.  That is their perception.  They met us today and they met with the Department of Foreign Affairs officials who are working day and night to resolve this with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that people are not working on their behalf.  We are very much aware of what is being done, but when we are talking about people's own flesh and blood they want black and white.  They do not want diplomatic statements; they do not understand them. They are emotionally on a &ldquo;high&rdquo; now. All they know is that over the last few days the black market calls from their relatives were made under stress conditions. They are suffering stress.  They have no money.  Food is disappearing. They do not have access to fruit markets and shops are closing before their eyes. When I said &ldquo;food&rdquo; I meant the food they had been used to.  There is still hospital food, but they have not access to fruit or markets to which they had been going. We find, obviously, that there is difficulty getting money out to them.  As we can understand, when money is routed through the country in the same way as post there is danger of sabotage.  There is the danger of the taxi man delivering the mail being attacked for money.  If those people were told that something can or cannot be done their fears would be allayed.  Fear stems always from the unknown, from secrecy and from being kept out on a limb.</P>
    <P>I am going off the point and what I am saying might seem a simple solution to something that was overlooked.  There is need for these people to come together and to have a communications centre. They must have free phone facilities and <Col N="1170" /> to converse.  We must keep the morale of the families up.  Another week to them is a life time.  It is essential to have the lines of communication open.  It is something that we, in Ireland, are good at and I would like to applaud the efforts being made in that regard.</P>
    <P>Irish diplomacy at the end of the day secured the release of Brian Keenan and that has to be applauded.  His release is seen throughout the world as being due to the good relations that exist between us, as a non colonial country, with the Middle East.  We should emphasise that over and over again.  It is what we are good at and have international respect. Therefore, it is something that we should pursue.  I do not think we should have any conscience one way or the other about what is neutrality or what is not neutrality or whether we should be going along the EC line.  We can do all those things simultaneously.  Emphasis has been placed on Kurt Waldheim's efforts. He is not in the EC but Austria would be very interested in being a member, as we well know.  However, he was able to pursue his policy of neutrality.  Our Irish people out there, if they see this happening from a neutral country, are going to raise the whole issue of neutrality.</P>
    <P>The next point I would like to make is that the Government should ensure that when Perez de Cuellar, the United Nations General Secretary, meets the Iraqi Foreign Minister he should stress the United Nations demand that Irish citizens, and other non-nationals in Iraq and Kuwait, be restored to full freedom. We are fighting for all.  We are not just fighting for Irish citizens, we are fighting for all non-nationals.</P>
    <P>We must hear in mind that wars start accidentally.  We do not understand the culture of the Iraqi people.  We must have the necessary contingency plans to prepare for the prospect of hostilities.  It is something that we do not like to think about but we must.  Since I came to Seanad Éireann I could not count the number of times we have called on the Government to set up an Oireachtas foreign affairs committee.  We looked for it before the end of the Cold War.  We <Col N="1171" /> looked for it before the Berlin Wall was dismantled.  We looked for it in relation to Northern Ireland, but the issues just flow through.  Every single week there is a demand for an Oireachtas foreign affairs committee.  I cannot understand the tardiness of the Government &mdash; it not even tardiness &mdash; but a complete blank wall in relation to having this committee as a permanent forum.</P>
    <P>So many issues were raised in the debate today.  The global context of our contribution was mentioned.  We are no longer an island that wafts away and can survive.  We are involved.  To quote John Donne, &ldquo;no man is an Island&rdquo;, but Ireland most certainly is now part and parcel of a global condition.  We talk about it, we talk about our Europeanism and our concern for all peoples of the world.  We wanted a foreign affairs committee set up in relation to the need for Third World aid when we had the Ethiopian crisis.</P>
    <P>The debates in Seanad Éireann since last November have centred on issues outside this country more often than on those here.  It is imperative that a foreign affairs committee should be set up immediately.  One of the first issues that should be discussed would be what exactly we mean by our neutrality.  We should face up to the issue.  Do we want it or do we not?  What do we understand by it?  Is it a sort of vague mythological thing that we hide behind?  Many people do not know what it is.  It is waved to and fro when appropriate.  It has to be discussed, whether it is going to upset us or not.  It has to be discussed openly by members of all parties.  We are not going to be able to get away with saying we are neutral or we are not neutral.  We do not know whether we are neutral or not.  Do we want it or do we not want it?  This has to be discussed immediately.  It should be one of the first issues to be discussed when we get an Oireachtas foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <P>Moving again to the human dimension, we can underestimate people's tolerance. People react in different ways to stress and crisis.  I will take the PARC Hospital <Col N="1172" /> and the case of a young nurse of 23 years of age as an example.  How has that nurse been helped through her education to cope with the problem she is now faced with?  We do not know the extent of the stress.  We met the various families today and saw that some of them reacted calmly but some of them reacted in a very volatile way.  It is important to realise the solidarity of those support groups.  They should be spoken to and should have access to every person from whom they feel they can get help.  We owe it to our citizens.  They feel they are not getting it. They felt they were voices in the wilderness. I am very much aware of the efforts being made by people in the Department of Foreign Affairs who certainly are not taking lunch or coffee breaks, they are staying until all hours of the night.  We know this, but the relatives do not know it.  These things should be told.  They should be told that all efforts are being made to help them.  All these people want is a reassurance.  They are ordinary people who are floundering. They were not ready to be catapulted into this crisis.  Again, I emphasise the human dimension.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech the whole of page nine is given to our exports in Kuwait.  I will not go through it because I know there are other people who wish to get in.  Our exports are in mega figures. Our dependence on our trade is relatively the highest in the Community.  I will not dismiss this as being of no importance. Of course, it is very important.  It could be argued forever whether we should have avoided the volatile area of the Middle East.  We did not.  We are in it and we have investment there.  There is a point where the Minister for Foreign Affairs said there is a need to develop alternative markets for beef and cattle.  He has been concerned to remove any obstacles in the way of exporters.  When one looks at the harsh reality of that, and having visited Japan not so very long ago knowing that they have not reached the affluence whereby they can actually look to meat for their diet rather than the traditional fish, I genuinely believe, despite the fact that the Japanese have markets with <Col N="1173" /> Australia and the United States that there is scope there for ourselves, if we take ourselves and look towards Japan for markets.</P>
    <P>We will have to do this at the end of the day anyway.  It is not enough to have a statement saying &ldquo;alternative markets for beef and cattle&rdquo;.  It must be spelt out whether it is viable to look for markets outside of the volatile Middle East.  The next step is to plan what we will do with our raw materials.  The farmers of this country are understandably upset.  They are wondering what sort of a winter they are going to have in relation to beef prices.  We always seem to react to crisis. We never seem to have a plan in anticipation. From now on there is nothing that we can be sure of.  There is a cycle of life.  We might have a United Germany or good relations with the USSR.  There may no longer be hostilities between the United States and the USSR, but the nature of the human psyche is such that there will always be crisis.  It is the pursuit of power; it is greed; it is a fact of life going back for thousands of years.  The conflict just moves from one place to another.  In these days it may be the West versus East.  If we go back in history we see that the Crusades, which lasted for a long time, were specifically concerned with this eternal conflict that was going on between West and East.  We must think in terms of that fact.</P>
    <P>I suppose there are many cards that we can play, but that seems to be a superficial statement.  Our immediate responsibility at this time is to our own people.  We are a small country.  We should be able to have every single one of the families who are directly involved on line with us.  We should have them on word processors. They should be given weekly, or daily, bulletins &mdash; because now the situation has become a crisis &mdash; in order to allay their fears.  I would hope we would have confirmation of Saddam Hussein's statement last night that women and children will be released.  He was close to his interpreter.  He looked the camera in the eye, whether that accounts for sincerity or honesty I do not know.  I would put a question mark on it.  I hope we have <Col N="1174" /> confirmation from the Department of Foreign Affairs that the women and children will be released.  That does not mean that the fight does not go on for men and the hostages of other countries.  I ask specifically that the points I have made will be taken on board by the Minister.  I also ask that when we resume we will have a foreign affairs committee which will set to seriously debating issues which are going to be with us for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say is by way of a few comments rather than a speech.  First, I am glad of the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerald Collins, his junior Minister and the Department on the manner in which they handled the Brian Keenan affair.  We also had one of our Senators who involved himself to some extent also.  As a Member of this House and one who is very proud to be a Member, I would like to take this opportunity to say I am always very glad to see a Member of this House involving himself in things of great importance.  In the same way as I am complimenting Senator Ryan I did some time ago compliment Senator Paschal Mooney on his involvement with the Guildford Four.  As one of the longest serving Senators here I take great pride in the fact that our Senators involve themselves in these matters. The manner in which the Minister, Deputy Collins, and his Department carried out this task was superb.  All of us are very grateful to him and to his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to condemn the invasion of Kuwait.  Saudi Arabia and the other Emirates would have been annexed were it not for the immediate action taken by Western forces and forces of other Arab States.  I did not think that I would see again in my lifetime anything remotely like the Hitler I saw when I was a young boy.  The President of Iraq claims that he merely entered Kuwait because there was a popular uprising and because he was called on by the Provisional Government to help in the restoration of law and order.  That is such a lie.  There is no evidence of that whatsoever.  There was <Col N="1175" /> no evidence then and there is no evidence now and there never will be evidence.  It was just a lie to the whole world.  He wanted to take over Kuwait and would have taken over other states too were it not for the fact there was such immediate action taken.  His propaganda on television is also the same type of propaganda that was used by Hitler in the days of the late thirties.  It is absolutely sickening to see him on television with the hostage children who were frightened.  The hostages must be very frightened out there dealing with such a person.  His attempt to make it a Holy War is so pathetic. From my point of view it shows that he, like Hitler, is trying to involve the Israelis.  All these mad, evil men try to lay the blame on the Jews: &ldquo;Let us bash the Jews&rdquo;, that has always been their policy.  That is the first thing they have always done.  It is so like Hitler that it is almost frightening.</P>
    <P>I had a long association with Kuwait. In fact senior people from Kuwait were my guests here in this House on two different occasions.  They have visited me here and I have visited Kuwait.  Kuwait has always been very well disposed towards Ireland.  Many colleges and research projects have benefited as a result of the generosity of Kuwait.  They have been very helpful to us always and very concerned about this country.  They have always indicated to me and to others their willingness to help in any way they could.  I remember on one occasion bringing one Kuwaiti visitor in to the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, and he impressed on us that whatever they could do for the Irish, they would do, as they felt we had so much in common.  They are a very lovable people and I got on very well with them.  One of the people that I introduced here is in the diplomatic service now.  I have been making inquiries about the other and nobody seems to know about his whereabouts.  What I think is happening now and what I feel is happening is something that would not be new to us in Ireland.  In this country we had the Elizabethan plantations and <Col N="1176" /> the Cromwellian plantations.  I believe now the plantation of Kuwait has commenced and there are Iraqi mercenaries and adventurers being moved into Kuwait to take over houses of Kuwaiti people and businesses.</P>
    <P>The Palestinians are being brought now from Jordan into Kuwait.  For a people who talk so much about the rights of their own homeland, it is difficult to understand how they now &mdash; and I believe this to be true &mdash; are moving in and displacing Kuwaitis out of their homes and are taking over the homeland of Kuwait.  This is not because the President of Iraq has any great love for anybody or those around him or that he is concerned about the Palestinians or their homeland. It is merely an attempt to build up a force within Kuwait so that when he is finished playing for time, which is the obvious thing he is doing now, perhaps in six months' time his plantation will be complete and he will then call on and agree to a plebiscite being taken in Kuwait and that hopefully, from his point of view, all these people he has planted in Kuwait will be the ones who will vote and agree to being joined with Iraq.  That, I believe, is his mission at the present time.  He will get away with it unless action is taken. We know from history what evil men can do.  Some of us know from our own history what evil man are capable of in the pursuit of power.  I believe that Saddam Hussein, President of Iraq is such a man.</P>

      <P>This is an appalling situation for the 400 Irish people stranded in the Gulf.  They are hostages.  There is no point in calling it anything else.  It is a time of tremendous anguish and pain for their families.  Everybody in this country would extend to them their sympathy on the ordeal they are experiencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> The background to the problem can, to some extent, be explained by a failure of foreign policy.  It is primarily a failure of foreign policy on the part of the major powers, an inability to understand the way things were going to work out or could work out down the road arising from their anxiety at that stage to curb the march of Iraq.  It is also an element of failure on our own part to understand the risks.  If it is not the failure to understand the risks, then I would suggest that there has been a failure to explain the risks.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the people who now find themselves trapped in Kuwait and Iraq fully understand the risks to which they were exposing themselves when they went to those countries.  I would question if it had been made clear to them the type of environment into which they were going.  It is easy to be wise with the benefit of hindsight, but certainly when you look back at this, by any standards that situation was a dodgy one.  I am not saying that they would not have gone.  I am not saying even that they should not have gone, but I wonder if the full extent of the risks they were taking were made clear to them before they left.  In medical circles, they talk of informed consent.  I wonder if these people who did consent and, indeed, some of them were anxious to go, went with the full information of what the prospects were.  Again, I emphasise that it is easy to be wise after the event.</P>
    <P>It might also have been a factor that some of the nurses left because of the cutbacks at home and the problems in the health services.  There is no use going over the failures and harping on them. We must now try to come up with some solution to the problem.  There is no doubt that it is a difficult situation.  It is foolish to pretend otherwise.  I certainly do not want to start pretending that there is an easy way out.  The restraints and restrictions on this country in relation to this problem are undoubtedly enormous. Some of the things we should avoid are fairly straightforward.  We should avoid support for militarism on the part of the United States.  It is important that we <Col N="1178" /> strive, and keep pushing all the time, for a non-military solution to this problem. The consequences of military intervention are almost unthinkable.  It is important also that the relatives of the people trapped in Kuwait and Iraq be given every facility and support.  I am pleased to hear that there are some developments in this area.  Facilities should be made available for these people to be able to travel to and from Dublin. They should have accommodation available for them here.  They should have transportation available to them to get them to Dublin for the briefing sessions. These families should be provided, as far as possible, with an objective evaluation of the information available and an objective evaluation of the situation that now exists, whether pleasant or unpleasant. In the long run everybody is better by levelling and telling the truth than by trying to gloss the thing over and saying it will be all &ldquo;hunky-dory&rdquo;.  I am anxious that these people would be given an objective, straight from the shoulder account of the situation rather than having the people hoping the whole thing will go away.  It may not go away.  It is better that the people know of the situation and what the likely outcome is and what the risks are.</P>
    <P>There may be a role here for a parliamentary delegation from this country seeking to involve itself on behalf of the trapped people.  I would hope that that would be an all-party delegation.  I am confident that our own party would be pleased to participate in it.  I am confident that my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, would be anxious and prepared for and, undoubtedly would have a great contribution to make to such a delegation. I have no doubt either that some of the people on the other side of the House, some of whom have undoubtedly distinguished themselves in this Foreign Affairs area, would like to be on such a delegation.  Senator Hanafin has already mentioned some of the people who have had successes, including the acting Cathaoirleach and various other Senators.  The same would be true of <Col N="1179" /> people on this side of the House and, indeed, some of the people on the benches behind me.  I hope that the Minister would consider my suggestion and see if anything could be done to develop something out of it.</P>

      <P>I dtosach báire agus an t-ábhar tromchúiseach seo á phlé, is dóigh go mba cheart dom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Taoiseach, leis an Rialtas agus leis na taidhleoirí a bhí ag plé le cás Brian Keenan.  Is iontach an gaisce a rinne siad é a fháil saor ag an am seo, agus is dóigh go ndéanfaidh an beart áirithe seo méid éigin, más beag féin é, leis an deighilt taobh istigh den tír seo a leigheas.  Tá fáilte faoi leith roimhe gur sheas Rialtas Éireannach le saoránaigh iomlán na tíre sa chás seo.</P>
      <P>In the case of Brian Keenan it is important for us to realise that the recognition by the Government of Iran of Ireland as an honest broker was a great help in his release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Gulf crisis it has to be recognised that most wars are fought because of greed.  Most wars have an economic backdrop to them.  It is obvious in the Gulf that this is so.  The greed for the control of oil, which is a commodity in world demand, is more than likely at the back of the original invasion of Kuwait and the danger of invasion in neighbouring countries.  However, in recognising that we should also recognise that the response of some nations might be more determined by the protection of their interests than by some basic moral code.  We all condemn the invasion of any country by any other country and we must continue at all times to speak against all acts of aggression particularly when they are perpetrated by the strong against the weak.  We must do this irrespective of who perpetrates the aggression.  Too often in recent years countries have considered it in their interest to annexe small neighbours.  We, with our history, being a small country, recognise how we suffered due to that particular syndrome.  However, it is also important to recognise that in this <Col N="1180" /> instance, for the first time in a long while, the United Nations Organisation has taken a stand and has passed resolutions which bring some semblance of world order to the resolution of these types of dispute.</P>
    <P>There is a saying in Irish, &ldquo;Ni hé lá na gaoithe lá na scolb&rdquo;.  It is very important to recognise that the UN structures as they stand are defective and that to ensure that this situation does not repeat itself they need reform.  The idea of five countries having a veto over any resolution is not satisfactory, five countries on a purely historical basis.  There is a need for some type of world judicial procedure to resolve disputes between nations and, having made their findings, to have some agreed procedure to enforce such resolutions.</P>
    <P>Another point we would have to look at is the whole question of democracy &mdash; the rights of people to pick their own governments free from outside interference and the total unsatisfactory nature of any type of autocracy or dictatorship. We rejoiced quite rightly last autumn at the coming of democracy to Eastern Europe and we must once again dedicate ourselves through international organisations to democracy and also to the principle of self determination for all peoples.  Only on those foundations can true world peace be formed.</P>
    <P>There is a danger, as we are carrying on this debate, of war breaking out on a scale that is hard to imagine.  The idea of limited war is no longer tenable.  The consequences of a war in the Gulf are too ghastly to consider, a war that could entail both chemical weapons and nuclear weapons on a scale that has never been used in the history of mankind.  We must in our small way, as a small democracy with no large vested interest throughout the world, continue to speak out against war as a method of resolving disputes, because when the war is over people have to talk.  We must continue to promote the peaceful resolution of disputes, that war in this modern world cannot be justified because the damage and harm it does far outweighs any benefits.</P>
    <P>We must avoid also what is a common <Col N="1181" /> syndrome &mdash; the idea of creating hate for people of various countries.  Twenty years ago it was the Soviet bloc and all its population.  Iran then were the baddies and now the people of Iraq.  People throughout the world are much of a muchness.  There are good and there are bad; but the vast majority of the ordinary people of any country want to go their way, earn their living, rear their children and so on.  We should never lose that human dimension.  What has happened in Eastern Europe, where democracy has come with minimum violence, should become an example of how the world order can be changed without resorting to military violence.</P>
    <P>I would have great personal difficulty with the concept of a food or medical blockade.  The idea of starving 16 million people into submission abhors me.  Those 16 million people cannot answer or be answerable for the wrong deeds of a small ruling clique in one country.  We should never forget that within that 16 million people there are people who have suffered, in a way that we have not suffered, at the hands of Saddam Hussein.  We should never forget that such a blockade would also include Kuwait, the Kurds and all the ordinary people of Iraq. Therefore, we should through the international fora insist that humanitarian demands would say that people should not be starved for the doings of a small ruling clique.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the people being held hostage in Iraq.  It is a despicable use of people to hold them hostage.  It would be a fair comment to say that basically the whole Iraqi population are hostages in this situation, but obviously we have particular concern for those of our people who went to the Middle East to provide services and to earn their living and who have now been denied that basic fundamental right to leave when they wish.  We support fully all the efforts our Government have been making through their diplomatic channels to ensure the safety, well being and ultimate release of these people.  We can only pray at this stage that it will not be long until they are given the fundamental <Col N="1182" /> right to leave these countries and return home to their people safe and well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I will certainly try to be brief.  I have a lot to say and wish to get it on the record.  The first thing I would like to ask is why we are discussing this whole question of Iraq and Kuwait.  I wonder when it was that the western powers woke up to the question of Saddam Hussein.</P>
      <P>I have in front of me &mdash; unfortunately, I will not have the time to read it entirely into the record &mdash; briefs from Amnesty International.  &ldquo;There have been over 10,000 &lsquo;disappearances&rsquo;.  Torture is widespread and common.  Trials are grossly unfair and come nowhere near basic international standards.  In September 1988, Amnesty called on the UN Security Council to act immediately to stop the massacre of Kurdish civilians by Iraqi forces.  By this date it had already been estimated that over 55,000 Kurds had fled across the Turkish border&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt you, Senator, but perhaps you might for the benefit of the Editor of Debates give the quotations and references if possible please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will indeed.  It is <i>Amnesty International Nuacht</i> and I can make it available to them.  In other words, there is a track record here.  I would like to ask &mdash; I am sure the Minister is aware of the fact that Saddam Hussein was installed by the CIA &mdash; what guarantee do we have that whatever the CIA and the American Government replace him by is going to be any better?  The Minister, I have no doubt, is probably as aware as I am that when Hussein was installed the CIA supplied him with the names and addresses of members of the Iraqi Communist Party, the Opposition which might now have led to a front against Hussein, and they were obliterated.  I wonder how clean our hands are in this situation.</P>
      <P>I would like to say, with regard to the poison attack on the Kurds, I was not astonished but I was sad to hear Senator Lanigan equate gas attacks which eliminated in three minutes flat 5,000 people, Kurds on Iraqi territory in the village of Halabta, with the use of tear gas by the Israelis.  That tells us something about the level of balance in that issue with Senator Lanigan.</P>
      <P>I would like to address another question, which is the Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights and so on and an attempted equivalence between this &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; and the attack on Kuwait. Kuwait was a non-aggressive state.  It was attacked, it was seized, it was invaded. The reason the Israelis are in the Golan Heights and in the other Occupied Territories is that in 1967, as the Minister knows, they were the victims of an aggressive war waged by Syria and Egypt in which Jordan joined opportunistically. That is how they lost the territory.  That is recognised in United States Resolution 242, which calls upon all participants to talk directly.  Only one Arab country, Egypt, has done that, and the reward was that the territory was transferred back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say one thing with <Col N="1184" /> regard to Hussein's statements and proclamations. He has put an offer to negotiate on the table.  He has said everything should be out there to be looked at.  I think that was probably the most intelligent thing he said.  If the West had had their wits about them what they would have said is &ldquo;Let us have everything on the table, because at the end of the day the entire situation in the Middle East has to be resolved, complex as it is.&rdquo;  But I would have said &ldquo;Fine.  There is only one precondition.  We will all come to the table, but in order to come to the table all the states have got to be recognised. Therefore, all the participants, all the Arab States have to recognise the existence of the state of Israel.&rdquo;  Then you would have had a move towards peace.  I am sorry that that possibility was not taken up by the world community.  I think it was something that should have been done.</P>
    <P>I do not share the reservations about neutrality that some Members of this House seem to.  It is important that Irish neutrality be retained.  It is very valuable. It has been squalidly treated a little bit in the last few weeks, because it was obvious that American transport planes were being refuelled at Shannon.  That is, in my opinion, a breach &mdash; at least morally if not technically &mdash; of neutrality.  I know the Minister is shaking his head, but I believe it is &mdash; and I said morally, not technically.  Morally it is a breach of that neutrality.  The Minister will remember the attitude, for example, of the Taoiseach's chum, Colonel Gadafi, when the bases in England were used by the Americans. He did not like it very much, he certainly regarded it as an aggressive act and as a result he sold a very considerable amount of arms to the IRA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>No comparison, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Ask Saddam Hussein if he thinks there is a comparison.  You will find that he and Mr. Gadafi would agree quite clearly on that.  I think there is a point in a principled neutral stand for <Col N="1185" /> Ireland.  It is extremely important.  I would like that neutrality and balance to be part of our foreign policy.  We have an ambassador to Iraq.  We know the human rights record of Iraq.  We know that they have systematically tortured children, that they have executed children, that in Kuwait already one of the first things they did was to execute a 30 year old, a 16 year old and a 20 year old.  We know what their human rights record is, yet we have an ambassador there.</P>
      <P>What about the Iranians?  We know what their human rights record is.  Again, I have further briefing documents from international human rights organisations with regard to Iran.  What have we done in the last week or so?  We have appointed an ambassador resident in Teheran. Which is the most significant player in the Middle East that is being systematically denied this?  Israel.  Is that not interesting? Does that suggest balance, or a lack of balance?  Is that not a cogent argument for a foreign affairs committee where all these matters would be ventilated? One of the most important things that happened here today was to hear the Progressive Democrats Senator saying that he and his party thought there should be a foreign affairs committee.  I would like to put it on the record that that now shows there is a majority of Members of the Oireachtas in favour of a foreign affairs committee.  I hope there will be a response.  Item 105 on the Order Paper, in the name of Senator Ross and myself, makes this point very specifically and looks for such a committee.</P>
      <P>I just want to make one or two more points, because I do not want to take all the time, I wish we could have expanded the time.  I have a lot to say and I very much regret that I have to rush it.  I am sure the Minister would not wish this either; but those, I suppose, are the rules of the House and we have got to abide by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make this point.  I am very glad Brian Keenan got out, but I am sure there was a deal.  I regret it.  I think it was a pity.  The Minister is shaking his head.  Why are we having a visit by the <Col N="1186" /> Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, to Teheran?  There has been some little negotiation inside the European Community that has allowed us to do this.  I wonder if we are still bearing in mind Salman Rushdie, who is a hostage at the behest of the Iranians, who have sought to impose a death penalty on a citizen of the European Community.  I think that is unacceptable. When we are thanking the Iranian Minister and the Iranian Ambassador for their help why do we not ask where this business of hostage taking started, because the Minister knows as well as I do, it started with the establishment of the Hezbollah financed directly from Teheran.  I think there is something lamentable about thanking the very people who oppress, because that is the source of hostage taking and we are now grovelling and thanking them.  They do not have my thanks.  I think we should question very much indeed their bona fides.</P>
    <P>The final point I am going to make &mdash; I have more I would very much like to say but perhaps there will be another opportunity &mdash; is about oil.  I am amazed when I hear people on the wireless talking about &ldquo;our oil&rdquo;.  How is it our oil?  It is under the feet of the Arabs.  We may not like it, but it is theirs; and, as one of them said on the radio the other day &mdash; and I agree with him 1000 per cent &mdash;&ldquo;If we were growing carrots in Kuwait nobody would give a damn&rdquo;.  I am afraid to say he is absolutely right.  It is a cynical situation.</P>
    <P>One of the other speakers said we should be developing other resources. We should.  A distinguished Member of this House, Senator McDonald, has demonstrated with his remarkable motor car that you can actually run a motor car for a year on an acre of rapeseed which will produce oil.  Again, I am sorry that I have to curtail my remarks but I would like to allow other Senators to contribute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  We are all concerned about the troubles in the Middle East.  Senator Norris mentioned that oil was the cause of it, but I think we should be more concerned about people rather than oil.  I believe there are 50 Irish nationals in Kuwait and one of them is from my parish.  That is what I am concerned about.  She is a nurse there.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and his junior Minister have done everything possible to ensure that she will arrive home safely in Ireland whenever she is allowed to get a visa to go.  The family appreciated the efforts made by the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs in contacting her in Kuwait. There are many more in Baghdad that we are concerned about.  I would like to put on record that I was speaking to that girl's mother an hour ago and she said she definitely appreciated the efforts being made to contact her daughter in Kuwait. We must admire these nurses who go out to these countries.  They are trained here in Ireland and they go out to these countries to help these people and to ensure that their health is preserved.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the embargo on food.  People have a right to live and food should be allowed into these Middle Eastern countries to ensure that people can live.  Because of a decision made by a ruling prince or a dictator, people under his regime should not be victimised and deprived of their essential needs to ensure living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many things have happened over the past week.  The release of Brian Keenan <Col N="1188" /> is something we are all very proud of. I would like to congratulate the people involved, especially the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerry Collins, who displayed his diplomacy in ensuring the release of Brian Keenan, about which we were all elated last weekend.  I would also like to commend the other people involved &mdash; my colleague, Senator Eoin Ryan, with whom I share an office, and the Andrews brothers &mdash; on their efforts to ensure the release of Brian Keenan.  I would also like to commend you, Sir, for your efforts to ensure that travesties of justice are rectified, especially your efforts on behalf of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six.  All this is something to be admired and something we should be proud of here in this House &mdash; that we have Members who will ensure that travesties of justice are rectified, whether it is on this island, across the Irish Sea or in the Middle East.</P>

Let us hope that it is the beginning of the end of their long sentence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, our immediate national, domestic concern must be the welfare of our hostages and what kind of efforts we are making for their release. It strikes me at the moment that the position of our hostages calls into question the whole neutrality issue and our use of neutrality.  It would appear to me that the Taoiseach may not be fully exploiting the value of our neutrality, if we are on the one hand neutral and if, in contrast to the Austrians, we are not in a position to take our people out of Kuwait and Iraq.  My point there is that it does call into question how we are effectively using our neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of a communications centre and telephone contact with our hostages, I would be urging the Minister to put into immediate effect the proposal <Col N="1189" /> of my party to set up, or attempt to set up, a communications network to establish telephone contact between the families here and the hostages in Iraq and Kuwait. If our neutrality has any teeth, then that should be a minimum achievement.</P>
    <P>There can be no question of this House condoning the action of Saddam Hussein. There can be no question of us believing that the form of regime or the occupation in dubious circumstances of Kuwait, is in any sense justifiable.  That could not possibly be a tenable position.  It is the action of a dictatorship.  It is the kind of action that brought Ceausescu down in Romania; and ultimately this type of behaviour must bring about the destruction of any country and any regime.  It is unacceptable behaviour. But, having said that, I think the point was well made earlier, and must be reiterated, that in many respects the problems of the Arab world have a post-colonial character, have their roots in imperialism in the past, in colonialism, in artificial boundaries drawn up on divide and rule principles.  For that reason a particular international sensitivity to the Arab situation must be displayed, a particular sensitivity to the self-determination rights of these people and the aspirations of the Arab people.</P>
    <P>I would submit that it should be an international position, and indeed an Irish position specifically, to achieve to the greatest possible degree a situation where solutions come from within the Arab countries through mechanisms defined by the Arabs themselves.  That is the ultimate centre where we should look for solutions and it is only when we have exhausted potential to solve the problem in an Arab context that we bring international forces into effect.</P>
    <P>We cannot lose sight of the fact tonight in Seanad Éireann that, were it not for the fact that the Americans and the Russians willy-nilly sold arms to the Iraqis, that they exploited the Iraqi desire for military might to sell arms and to appease war mongering elements in their country, basically to appease certain commercial <Col N="1190" /> and capitalist interests in their own particular countries, we would not have the problem today.  It should reaffirm us in our commitment to bringing the arms race to an end.  I look forward in the Minister's reply to his making the point and on every available public opportunity making the point clearly that were it not for the Americans and the Russians supplying the arms to fuel the Arab conflicts in the Middle East there would not be such conflicts.  We can never escape that responsibility in the West.</P>
    <P>I think at the moment we have a second domestic concern.  We must also adhere to our principles in that we want to achieve peace and a reduction of the arms race.  That is our philosophical international position.  Our immediate domestic concern is the hostages, but our second domestic concern must inevitably be the question of the beef industry. There can be no doubt that this represents at the moment the most perilous time, the most extraordinarily difficult time, in recent history for the farming community.  That is a view accepted by commentators right across the board. Because of the specific difficulties of the farming community at the moment the problems in the beef industry have massive implications.  For that reason I welcome the section in the Minister's speech specifically making the point that there will be an opening up of trade with Iran at the moment.  I do not share &mdash; and I have great respect for my learned colleague &mdash; Senator Norris's quibbles on that issue.  I truthfully believe we have no option but to start doing business with Iran at the moment because of the precarious situation of our farmers.</P>
    <P>I have another general point to make. I do not believe, could never believe, could never accept, nor should this House accept, that it would be right, that it is right, that it can be right to make food a part of the sanctions against Iraq.  They cannot be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are not sanctions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;international sanctions against Iraq.  It cannot be acceptable <Col N="1191" /> that we in any sense would concur with the introduction of sanctions involving removing food from young babies and removing medical supplies.  I do not believe that that is right in respect of a vulnerable population who are no doubt exploited by factors outside their control all the time.  In conclusion, my essential view &mdash; and I am conscious of the time factor and your accommodation in that respect.  Sir &mdash; is that we must keep pressure on for the release of our hostages and at the minimum establish direct telephone contact with them for the families. We must make our neutrality meaningful. It is my submission to the Minister that we have not so done today or we would be in the Austrian position.  That is the first point.  The second is that we must pursue the beef business with Iran and the third is that we must urge the removal of food as part of any international sanctions.  The last point is this, I do not believe that this House should endorse a position where we will do anything other than concur with general United Nations approaches.  We should not become part of any belligerence in the West or among Western powers.  We should never, never become part of an international diplomacy, an international approach to politics that would be instigated or conducted by <i>The Sun</i> newspaper or the <i>Daily Mirror.</i></P>

      <P>Before moving the Adjournment, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs for his statement to the Seanad this evening on the problem of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and other problems and, indeed, all the Senators who took part in this debate.  I would like to mention briefly that some weeks back when we had an expectation of the release of Brian Keenan, we were ready for a debate but it did not happen.  I share the joy and the delight of so many thousands of people, his family and friends, and not forgetting people like Senator Eoin Ryan and Senator Michael Lanigan, who in a quiet way over the last number of years have all been involved in many ways in helping the release of Brian Keenan.  We are very pleased with this and we look forward to the release of further hostages in the future.</P>
      <P>The debate has been worth while.  It was extended by one hour and we gave as much time as possible to it.  It was a good debate and I would like to thank all concerned.  I now move that the House stand adjourned <i>sine die.</i></P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.35 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
