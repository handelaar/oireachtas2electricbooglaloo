      <P>I have notice from Senator David Norris that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>Following the recent resolution tabled at the European Parliament, the need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take an active interest in the case of Raoul Wallenberg.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is: item No. 1, the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989; item No. 2, the Industrial Relations Bill, 1989, Second Stage and Committee Stage to 7 p.m.  At 7 p.m. we will have a sos to 7.30 p.m.  There will also be a sos from 2 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. From 7.30 p.m. until 9 p.m. we will take the Private Members' Bill dealing with farm incomes.  From 9 p.m. to midnight the Shannon Navigation Bill, Second and Committee Stages, will be dealt with and, hopefully, we will be able to finish that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some clarification from the Leader of the House. When he says we will be taking the Industrial Relations Bill, Second and Committee Stages to 7 o'clock, there is no <Col N="3" /> question of there being a forced conclusion of the debate at 7 o'clock or of the Shannon Navigation Bill at midnight? There is no question of any closure or guillotine procedures being brought in here?  There was some confusion yesterday. There was an understanding on the far side of the House that this was what had been agreed in the Order of Business.  We would not agree to any closure motions, for a variety of reason which I need not go into now.  I would just like clarification on that.</P>
      <P>May I also repeat the appeal I made yesterday to the Leader of the House to ask the Government not to bring in the Broadcasting Bill tomorrow.  An amendment to that Bill yesterday means it will not now come into effect until October.  It would be in the interests of the legislation and of the Oireachtas if the taking of that Bill were postponed until September so that there would be time for reflection on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a question with regard to item No. 7, the Interpretation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1989 and item No. 9, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 1989. I asked about these before and the Leader of the House indicated he had no intention himself of advancing these Bills.  Since I think they are non-contentious and I believe the Government would agree with the principle of them &mdash; even if they want to take them over themselves it would be a good thing &mdash; perhaps the Leader might ask again what is the intention of the Government with regard to these two Bills and report back to the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House whether he intends to take before the summer recess the motion on the Order Paper regarding Ireland's term of the Presidency of the European Community.  I had a view that the Irish Presidency of the EC discharged <Col N="4" /> its duties with the utmost efficiency.  The Taoiseach, his Ministers and the Ministers of State performed their tasks magnificently during this period while many important developments were taking place in Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House what was the outcome of the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges last week regarding the establishment of the committee to investigate the extension of Seanad voting rights to universities other than NUI and Dublin University.  I would consider it a high priority on our list. Everybody on all sides of the House, with the exception of a few, thought it was high priority at the beginning of this session. Because of its discriminatory nature, I would like to know the position from the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to place on record the fact that the Waterford Glass strike is over and to welcome that, which cost the city of Waterford £1 million per week and up to £14 million or £15 million in the period it lasted.  I would also like to congratulate all those concerned, the trade unions, the Department of Labour, the Minister for Labour and the officials who were involved in it.  It is good to see that coming to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Broadcasting Bill, I would like to know the intentions there, considering the length of time it was debated and the number of amendments. It would certainly be very short notice if it appears in this House first thing tomorrow morning without allowing us an opportunity to see the effects of the <Col N="5" /> amendments on the Bill as originally initiated in the House.  I think it would be proper to have the matter dealt with at a later time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the points raised by Senator Manning, the position is as I indicated.  It is the Second Stage and Committee Stage of the legislation I referred to.  I indicated at the outset that in regard to the Bills I mentioned &mdash; the Industrial Relations Bill and the Shannon Navigation Bill &mdash; both those Bills are at Second Stage and Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of those being completed at 7 o'clock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not at 7 o'clock.</P>
      <P>On the other point of the Broadcasting Bill, raised by Senator Manning and others, it is still with the other House.  It was indicated to the Whips last week that it would be taken in the Seanad on Thursday and that still seems to be the position.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to two Bills.  It is not possible to take those Bills during this term.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton raised the question of the Broadcasting Bill and I have indicated the position, and the Whips know the position since last week.  It is still the intention to take the Broadcasting Bill in this House tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Senator Dan Kiely raised the question of the EC Presidency.  It is not my intention to have a debate on that prior to the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jackman raised a question on the franchise of the Universities of Limerick and Dublin City.  The CPP discussed this matter and they decided that since this matter involved legislation it would primarily be the concern of the Minister for the Environment.  The House could be involved, if one of the groups so wished, by having a debate on the relevant motion on the subject matter but it was felt it was not an appropriate matter for the CPP to be involved in. There is a motion on the Order Paper, Motion 77, and whether to have a debate on that is something the Member should <Col N="6" /> consider.  Obviously, the Minister for the Environment could be present and it could proceed from there if that is the wish of the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to the Waterford Glass problem.  Certainly, we all join with him in congratulating all those concerned.  We are all delighted that the strike at Waterford Glass is concluded. He also referred to the question of the Broadcasting Bill and I have outlined the position on that.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill that has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and it is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration,&rdquo; the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of these amendments.</P>

      <P>The Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989, has been passed by Dáil Éireann, with amendments. I propose to explain briefly the nature and purpose of those amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="7" /> Amendment No. 1 inserted in section 2, new definitions of &ldquo;aquifer&rdquo;, &ldquo;combined drain&rdquo; and &ldquo;sewer&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Aquifer&rdquo;, which is already in section 1 of the 1977 Water Pollution Act, was redefined so as to cater more fully for the requirements of an EC Directive on the protection of groundwater against pollution.  &ldquo;Combined drain&rdquo; and &ldquo;sewer&rdquo; were redefined following a more detailed review of the complex legislation on sewers and drains. The new definitions are intended to ensure the effective operation of the provisions of section 22 of the Bill which will allow sanitary authorities to exercise greater control over trade effluent discharges by issuing licences for individual discharges in situations where up to now only one licence could be issued for the combined effluents from a number of premises.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 substituted a revised version of the &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; provision in section 3 of the 1977 Act in line with a similar provision contained in the more modern Air Pollution Act.  This will entail the application of the best practicable means concept so as to prevent water pollution.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; maintains a heavy responsibility on persons who have control of polluting matter to take steps to prevent water pollution from their activities.  The amended good defence makes it clear that it is not sufficient to instal appropriate facilities to prevent water pollution; it will also be necessary to use and maintain these facilities so that pollution does not occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand we did not get sufficient copies for everybody but they are being photocopied at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be normal to wait for that and the Minister has indicated that they are being photocopied. I am sure that as soon as they are available they will be presented to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Senator.</P>
      <P>In some situations, taking appropriate measures may entail providing and using facilities such as sufficiently large and well constructed effluent or slurry storage tanks; in others, it may involve complying with the norms of good agricultural practice in relation to quantities and timing of slurry spreading on land.</P>
      <P>The amended good defence requires the defendant to prove to the court that the defence provision is applicable in the particular circumstances pertaining to his case.  I believe the amendment strikes the right balance and I am confident the courts will apply this provision in a manner such that only absolutely genuine cases will avoid conviction.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 18 also relates to a good defence provision.  It deleted the provision in the Bill inserting a good defence in respect of water pollution offences prosecuted by fisheries boards under section 171 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  This was done because it became clear during the debate in Dáil Éireann that a number of Deputies were concerned that the introduction of such a provision in fisheries legislation might lessen the effectiveness of the boards in protecting water resources.  The decision also took account of the views of the Minister for the Marine who considered the case presented by the fisheries boards on the subject and considered it best not to proceed as originally proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other provisions of the Bill, as passed by the Seanad, will safeguard the powers of the boards to prosecute local local authorities and others under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  Senators will be aware that the 1977 Water Pollution Act included a provision to repeal these fisheries board prosecution powers, but that provision was never activated.  The <Col N="9" /> Bill will repeal this provision of the 1977 Act entirely.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is a drafting amendment intended to clarify exactly when the decision of a local authority on an application for an effluent discharge licence under section 4 of the 1977 Act will take effect.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 deals with water quality management plans.  Its main purpose was to provide for an additional amendment to section 15 of the 1977 Act, relating to subsection (6), which concerns the circulation of water quality management plans.  Other changes relate essentially to drafting.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are related drafting amendments intended to clarify exactly when the decision of a sanitary authority on an application for an effluent discharge licence under section 16 of the 1977 Act will take effect.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 was also an amendment to cover drafting points.  The purpose of amendment No. 8 was to clarify that only a party from whose premises or lands the cause of the pollution originated will be liable for damages under the statutory civil liability provision in section 20. On a literal interpretation of the wording in the Bill as passed by Seanad Éireann, a person who was not in any way responsible for pollution could have been held liable for it simply because the cause of the pollution, though coming from another's property or premises, managed to reach waters via the person's premises or property.  Clearly this was never the intention.  The amendment rules out the possibility of an innocent party being held liable for damages.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 was also a drafting amendment; &mdash; the reference to section 4 (2) in this provision was misleading and superfluous.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 related to the by-laws provision in section 21 of the Bill which deals with controls on agricultural activities responsible for water pollution. On further examination of the wording of this provision as passed by the Seanad, it was considered that certain legal problems might have arisen if by-laws came into effect immediately on their making <Col N="10" /> by a local authority and while an appeal to the Minister was still undetermined. In such a situation, and if the by-laws were subsequently amended or annulled, an inequitable situation might arise in relation to any enforcement action taken by a local authority in the meantime.  The amendment provides a more workable way of making and approving by-laws.  It will ensure that by-laws will not come into effect until approved by the Minister, who will also have power to refuse to approve them or to direct the local authority concerned to amend them in a specified manner.  The amendment also provided that the Minister will be deemed to have given his approval to the proposed by-laws after a period of six months has elapsed since the last date for representations on the proposals in the absence of a decision before then.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 11 to 15 were all related drafting amendments to section 22 which allows a sanitary authority to make an order declaring a combined drain to be a sewer.  As I stated when dealing with amendment No. 1, the section will allow sanitary authorities to exercise controls on an individual basis where trade effluents discharge to combined drains.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 were amendments to rectify errors in drafting. In the case of amendment No. 16, the reference to the Act of 1959 was not necessary as the provisions of section 23 of the Bill are already applicable to offences under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, by virtue of section 311 of that Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 provided for an extended time limit for prosecution of summary offences where evidence of the offence only comes to light some time after the event.  At present the time limit for initiating summary proceedings is six months in all cases.  This six month limit will continue to apply to the vast majority of offences, most of which are detectable within a short period of the incident. However, in certain types of cases the pollution may not be detected for some time.  An example of the type of case involved might be where groundwater <Col N="11" /> was being polluted.  In this type of incident evidence of the offence might only come to light months or years later.</P>
    <P>This amendment ensures that the six month time limit will only begin to run from the time evidence comes to light enabling a summary prosecution to be taken, even though more than six months may have passed since the offence was committed.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 20 was to allow local authorities, sanitary authorities and regional fisheries boards to recover the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by them in preparing for all prosecutions, whether summary prosecutions taken by those authorities or boards themselves, or prosecutions on indictment taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The section as passed by Seanad Éireann provided only for the recovery of costs and expenses incurred by these authorities when prosecuting summary offences.  It is obviously desirable to widen the provision to provide for recovery from the convicted person or body of the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the local or sanitary authority or regional board in preparing for prosecutions on indictment.</P>
    <P>The last two amendments, Nos. 21 and 22, deal with the commencement section. They will ensure that this legislation, apart from the particular sections mentioned, will come into operation as soon as it is enacted.  The sections involved relate to three areas only, involving effluent discharge licence applications, reviews of licences, and procedural matters concerning appeals to An Bord Pleanála.  The number of sections listed in the amendment reflects the existence of separate, though essentially identical, legislative provisions for effluents discharged to waters and effluents discharged to sewers.</P>
    <P>It is not feasible to bring these various sections into effect immediately.  If we were to do so, regulations made under the sections of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, which are being replaced by the Bill, including such fundamental ones as <Col N="12" /> those dealing with procedural aspects of appeals to An Bord Pleanála, would cease to apply.  It will be necessary, accordingly, to prepare revised regulations in anticipation of the coming into operation of these sections.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of the Bill is to strengthen the powers available to local authorities to prevent and deal with water pollution.  It should have an immediate effect.  The provisions catering for increased penalties, measures to mitigate and remedy the effects of pollution at the polluters expense, civil liabilities for pollution damage, greater controls on agriculture, improved access to relevant information by local authorities, recovery of their costs in taking prosecutions and provision for individual controls on industrial effluents discharging to combined drains, are the major items of this new legislation and they will all come into operation once the Bill is signed by the President.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large I welcome the amendments.  It is right and proper that the amendments should have been made to this legislation.  None of us can condone pollution of any type which, undoubtedly, in the past has done tremendous damage to our rivers and lakes.  All too often, particularly in the eighties, tremendous damage was caused to our fish stocks as a result of water pollution.  No one can condone that situation.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 strengthens the powers of the local authority with regard to dealing with farm effluent and slurry storage in particular.  That is an area which has caused problems in the past. Nobody can condone the way in which some farmers dispose of slurry or effluent. It is right and proper that adequate provision should be made in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, having said that, I think there must be a balance.  It is important to hit the right balance because it was never envisaged that local authorities should be hounding farmers day in, day out, with regard to pollution problems.  Nobody <Col N="13" /> can condone pollution, but there has to be a balance between allowing people to carry on their industry or business.</P>
    <P>One of the areas that causes me some concern is in relation to spreading slurry on land and that has been mentioned. While it is important that due care and attention be paid to the proper timing for the spreading of slurry, nevertheless it is now causing major problems for many farming communities.  Whether we like it or not, the present system of farming was one that was highlighted, emphasised and encouraged by the Department of Agriculture and Food and by different Governments.  Grants were given for the building of slatted houses or sheds with cubicles and all of this has caused major problems with regard to the spreading of slurry.</P>
    <P>In my own county &mdash; the Cathaoirleach is aware of this &mdash; we have ten group water schemes that are polluted and this is believed to be as a result of the spreading of slurry.  Unfortunately, the spreading of slurry is part and parcel of agricultural life; it is part and parcel of the type of farming in rural Ireland today. Due recognition must be taken of that fact of life.  Nobody can condone the indiscriminate spreading of slurry or the discharge of slurry into our rivers and lakes, but nevertheless a balance must be held and we should never forget that.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is also welcome, as is amendment No. 4.  Those amendments will strengthen the legislation and will strengthen the hands of local authorities to deal with the pollution problem. It is something that all of us should support. By and large, therefore, I welcome the amendments which have been introduced.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate her on her personal input into this Bill.  Like Senator Naughten, I welcome the amendments to the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989.  There is no doubt that they will strengthen the legislation. As already stated, this Bill forms <Col N="14" /> a key element in the Government programme to combat water pollution.  It is designed to strengthen the controls contained in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 and the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 and generally to update the provisions of the 1977 Act in the light of some ten years' experience of its full operation.  I congratulate the Minister for her personal contribution in this case.  She has taken a personal interest in this legislation since taking office and I congratulate her on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to welcome the Minister to the House.  I have great respect for the Minister; her bona fides in regard to the whole question of the environment cannot be questioned and the efforts which she personally has made to bring in very worthwhile legislation deserve congratulations.</P>
      <P>The Water Pollution Bill certainly received a great deal of good publicity. There was a good deal of PR and a great flurry of excitement and we were given the impression that the Government were serious about the whole area of pollution.  I believe water pollution is one of the most serious problems.  Every Senator here knows the damage that is being done to the image of this country abroad by extensive and very serious ongoing pollution.  We have Bord Fáilte endeavouring to promote tourism, particularly concentrating on areas such as fishing and, generally speaking, promoting the image of a clean and green environment.  We all believe that is important.  The Water Pollution Bill was a great step forward.  It introduced substantial improvements to the 1977 Act and there were very considerable increases in the fines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only amendment I wish to comment on is amendment No. 2 to section 3 of the Bill.  When this Bill went to the Dáil it was considerably watered down. In this section the guts were torn out of the Bill.  This has made it a very much weaker measure and it is going to be extremely difficult for local authorities to take effective action against serious polluters.  The Minister brought in this <Col N="15" /> amendment to section 3 and I think that is going to make it relatively easy for farmers who are causing pollution to wriggle out of that.</P>
    <P>We all know how difficult it is to get prosecutions in the court.  The wording of the section was changed from what was in the original Bill, which seemed to me to be very satisfactory.  It would be a good defence to prove that someone could not reasonably have foreseen that the act or omission might cause or emit pollution.  That seems to have been very forceful and it meant that if some extreme eventuality took place obviously the farmer was not to be held responsible, but that in anything less than that if the action he took was not adequate, he could have been charged and fined.  It has now been watered down to stating that the person took all reasonable care.  Perhaps if the person made some mild attempt to take care that might be construed in court as being adequate but, in fact, it would be quite obvious that the action taken was not adequate to prevent the pollution occurring.</P>
    <P>I greatly regret the wording of the section has been watered down.  I believe some local authorities are more determined than others to stamp out pollution but they need every possible support.  I believe that section is going to make it virtually impossible and it means that the fines which were introduced will be of no value because if you cannot get a prosecution, it does not matter what the fines are, you will not be able to have the fines imposed.  I regret that that section of the Bill was changed.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I welcome the Minister, Deputy Harney, to the House.  I am glad to see our party colleague here and may I also say that the amendments to the Bill are greatly welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Bill has been very much improved by the amendments.  It is a very difficult matter to balance the need for jobs, particularly in the rural areas, with the need to protect the environment.  The two things are not contradictory and by <Col N="16" /> protecting our environment we will, in the long term, create jobs and make the countryside the attractive place which we wish it to be and one we can market successfully for tourism.</P>
    <P>My fishing career started on Lough Ennel but within a few years that lake was virtually dead because of the actions of a local authority.  Then we went to Lough Sheelin to fish and within a few years that take was virtually dead through the actions of intensive farming and through sheer negligence in relation to how slurry was not spread but discharged. The point that needs to be made is that they were two resources of immense national value worth many millions of pounds to the areas concerned.  Both those lakes could bring tourists to the midland region.  These valuable resources have been there since the Ice Age, renewing themselves from generation to generation, and I cannot understand how this generation, through avarice and greed, can decide that they are expendable.  I do not think even the most selfish people in past generations took that view of what they could do to the environment; it is a matter of very deep regret.  I am glad to say that in the case of Lough Ennel it appears now to be recovering and, hopefully, Lough Sheelin will go in the same direction.  It is appalling to think that a hotelier who invested a lot of money in a premises on the shores of Lough Sheelin should be forced to close his hotel, to sell his boats and move out of the area when that lake was regarded as one of the best fisheries in Europe.  It is nothing short of a national scandal what happened to Lough Sheelin.</P>
    <P>I recall meeting an intensive pig producer several years ago at a function in that part of the country and he laughingly told me that given five years he would have Lough Sheelin reclaimed; he would have put enough slurry into it to make dry land out of it.  That was his attitude and it was appalling.  People who have that attitude and people who wilfully pollute the environment should pay a very heavy penalty.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I realise that during the seventies when we were in a period of <Col N="17" /> very rapid agricultural expansion, people were encouraged by state agencies and by others to invest in intensive cattle sheds and in rotary milking parlours and to concentrate livestock into large units and that, in itself, of course caused problems. I believe that the people who did that in good faith at a time when possibly we were not quite as environmentally conscious as we now are, need to be assisted in every way to make sure that those facilities are environmentally friendly, so to speak.  I believe the State, having been the agency which originally encouraged them to make that investment, has a responsibility to help them make sure that those facilities are operated in a proper and good manner.</P>
    <P>In relation to the slurry question, we need to be very careful in relation to the times of the year when slurry is spread. One of the things that has emerged from research abroad in regard to the problem of nitrates in water, which is a very serious problem, is that inorganic fertiliser is an agent but it is not necessarily the primary agent of that type of nitrate pollution, and spreading slurry on to bare land at a time of the year when there is likely to be heavy rainfall, will undoubtedly put nitrates into nearby waterways.</P>
    <P>I have just returned from a vist to Bavaria.  In 30 areas within Bavaria the nitrate levels in ground water are above the EC guidelines.  It has got to the point that it has become very difficult to farm in those areas.  We are a long way from that position, and I hope we stay a long way from it, because it will not be in the interests of our farmers if we are to get into that position.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has been mentioned is good defence.  The amendment is an improvement.  There will, unfortunately, be accidents, that is in the nature of things.  I do think that, provided people have been shown to take reasonable care, they should be protected in some way.  That is not to say that any wilful pollution should not be prosecuted to the ultimate and a very serious view taken of it.  I welcome the Minister's statement that an amended good defence makes it clear that it is not sufficient <Col N="18" /> to instal appropriate facilities to prevent water pollution.  It will also be necessary to use and maintain these facilities so that pollution does not occur.  I do not think we are giving anybody a licence to go out and wilfully pollute waterways.</P>
    <P>It has been proven that one of the big polluters are the local authorities, not just farmers and industries, and the local authorties have a role to play to prevent pollution.  It was a matter of grave disquiet within fishery circles when it was proposed originally some time ago that the local authorities should be almost self-regulating in respect of monitoring pollution.</P>
    <P>The fisheries boards have shown quite conclusively, and very tragically, during the past week their commitment to their job by the unfortunate incident that happened in Cork.  The fisheries people are the people on the ground.  The fisheries people have done a marvellous job in the part of the country I come from in ensuring that pollution is kept to a minimum, in ensuring that when it does occur the law is brought to bear on it and in keeping our waterways clean.  The provision in the Bill to safeguard the powers of the boards to prosecute local authorities and others under the Fisheries Consolidation Act, 1959, is very welcome and I certainly welcome it.</P>
    <P>One of the things that was of major concern to farmers, and understandably so, was that if I were living several miles downstream of a source of pollution, under the original proposals I could be prosecuted.  I think the person who causes pollution should be the person who is prosecuted, and it should not be up to me to prosecute my neighbour upstream and for him or her to prosecute their neighbour and so on up along the line until we come to the source.  Apart from anything else it would lead to problems between neighbours.  For that reason alone we should go back to the source of the pollution because that is where the problem lies and where the solution should be found.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that local authorities can recover costs.  I happen to be a trustee of the local angling club which fishes on <Col N="19" /> the River Liffey and on one occasion we actually sued the county council and won. We had to go through the civil process. It should be open to people to recover the costs for that type of activity.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to ground water pollution, that is probably the most insidious form of pollution.  The pollution of a river or water course is quite dramatic but it can take quite a while for the ground water to become polluted.  That has very serious consequences for the quality of the drinking water and health within an area.  I am glad that &mdash; even some time after pollution may have occurred &mdash; there is resource to prosecute people who are responsible for ground water pollution and long-term damage.</P>
    <P>To come back to the original point, one of our greatest assets is our image as a green, unpolluted, clean country, and that can be made an enormous economic asset, because with increasing leisure and mobility, more and more people will be attracted to this country.  The country must be made a clean attractive place for tourists to come to.  Litter is another matter but that is an issue for another day.  I congratulate the Minister on her initiative and I support the amendments before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We all must face up to the fact that one of the greatest problems facing modern civilisation is the disposal of the increasing amounts of waste, be it human, animal or industrial.  Basically this Bill is part of the armoury of the State in terms of orderly disposal of waste and the protection of an essential part of the our natural resources, a clean fresh water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to stand up &mdash; indeed I am sure I have fallen prey to it in years gone by &mdash; and blame local authorities.  Local authorities are operating on behalf of all of us in trying to dispose of the waste in their local authority area with the limited resources successive Governments have provided for them.  The local authority is as good as the Government of the day and the Governments that have gone before it.  If we have as a nation decided <Col N="20" /> to spend our money, our hard earned Exchequer resources, on other projects and on other capital schemes, we must accept the fact that we have not funded local authorities, we have not given them money, for the capital schemes necessary for the proper treatment of waste generally.</P>
    <P>The fisheries protection people have always baulked at the idea of local authorities policing the rivers, or indeed any of this type of environmental legislation, because the finger has very easily been pointed at local authorities and I think it is a cop-out on all our parts.  The local authorities are only disposing of all our waste as best they can given the limited moneys they have been provided with over the decades.  We have to face up to that.  If collectively we wanted to stop the disposal of any more untreated waste of any kind either directly into our harbours and seas or into rivers or lakes, we have to put our money where our mouth is and ensure that the local authority in question can complete the capital schemes, the plans for most of which are sitting on the shelves in the Department gathering dust, because they have not been financed by different Governments over the years.  So we now finance the local authority and we stop shouting and pointing the finger of blame at the local authorities. We have to be responsible as we now know the facts and appreciate the situation.  Europe is very receptive towards funding for any environmental issues or any schemes that will protect our environment &mdash; rivers, waters and lakes in this instance.  I would like to say that quite clearly.  It is a cop-out.  We have all done it but if we stop and think they are only doing the best they can given the resources they have.  They are the facts.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would have no fears of Wexford County Council being allowed police the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989.  They have done a marvellous job, much to the ire of many farmers under the 1977 Act.  I risk standing corrected by the Minister in saying that Wexford County Council have had the greatest <Col N="21" /> number of prosecutions over the years since the introduction of the 1977 Act or, if we are not at the top, we are very close to it.  From an environmental point of view the rivers, lakes and coastline in Wexford are safe in the hands of our county manager, Mr. Noel Dillon, although the IFA in Wexford and the other farming organisations may not be happy with it.  Senator Dardis expressed fears about this.  Have no fear about Wexford; whatever the farmers view of it may be, from an environmental point of view, they are doing an excellent job.  I would like to put that on the record.</P>
    <P>In Wexford, I am very proud of our sourcing of water from ground water, and aquifers.  If you look at the local authorities around the country, I think we have, if not the greatest percentage of our water sourced from ground water aquifers, we are virtually at the top of the list.  We have had extremely forward thinking county engineers, Mr. Gerry Forde and now Mr. Phil Callery, and a large proportion of our water in Wexford is from ground water.  The protection and prevention of the pollution of ground water supplies is head of the list when it comes to our environmental policy in Wexford and, again, Mr. Noel Dillon and his team of environmental engineers are to the fore in this area.  I must applaud them.  We give out from time to time, let us be honest, we all have our toes stood on and sometimes we feel there are excesses when people are doing jobs we do not like.  It is the Nimby principle again &mdash; in theory, we all agree that this should be done but not in my backyard; do not impinge on me, do not criticise what I am doing.  Look at the fellow over the fence or over the ditch.  When we look at it, if we are honest in our hearts, these are the public servants doing what we would like to be done, and certainly our children will thank them for what they are doing even though we may squal occasionally if it gets a little too close for comfort or if the finger is pointed in our own direction occasionally.  We must recognise when a good job is being done and commend it as such.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> I welcome the Minister here this morning and most of the amendments she has here before us.  What caught my ear as she was addressing us this morning was her reference to the application of, and I quote, &ldquo;best practical means concept.&rdquo;  I would like to ask the Minister whether the best available technology concept would be too restrictive.  There is ongoing debate among environmentalists and those in this area as to whether it is BPM or BAT we go for.  I am sure Europe and the European directives are requesting BAT.  Would that be too restrictive given our present stage of development and the development of most of our farms and industries round the country.  Why can we not go for the ultimate system?  I look forward to the Minister's answer because ideally if we wanted the ultimate that is what we would be looking for.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a pragmatic person and there are obviously reasons that she opted for BPM rather than BAT but I would like her to develop that because we will be back here in a number of years insisting that only BAT will be the good defence rather than BPM.  We will no longer be able to accept: &ldquo;I did the best I could with what I had available at the time and the advice that was available to me&rdquo;.  We must be in a position to put in place the best available technology to prevent pollution be it in terms of this legislation or any other; when we can do that is the question but I am not sure if it would be pragmatic to insist on it now. Ideally that is what I would like because how loose can you make a good defence?</P>
    <P>I think it will have to be accepted as a reasonable defence for a farmer to stand up and say that he located his silage pit not quite on the banks of the local stream or river but very near because that was the advice that was being given up to a few short years ago by the ACOT officers, as they were then, but they are now part of Teagasc.  With the knowledge that was available to the advisers, to farmers and to the community generally, they thought they were doing what was right.  They were grant aided for locating slurry talks and silage pits in places we would now reject, in fact we would say <Col N="23" /> they were downright dangerous and threatening our water courses generally. If they say they built according to the instructions of ACOT as it was at the time, even though it is in a totally unsuitable location now and could be causing pollution, will that be accepted as a good defence?  I think if people complied with the rules and regulations of the State of the day it will have to be, even though it could be causing pollution.  There is a dilemma here with BPM.  Maybe they would get away with it but not under BAT.</P>
    <P>It comes back to the overall point I was making.  We have to be reasonable, particularly if the State was grant aiding farmers to erect silage pits and slurry tanks etc, and they may have done so inadvertently in the totally wrong place. It will probably have to be accepted as a defence though where you go from there in terms of insisting that the farmer relocates the offending slurry, tank or whatever, I am not sure.</P>
    <P>Again the higher farm environment grants throughout the entire country will help but I think some of the conditions attached to the overall development plan are too restrictive in terms of the environmental grant aid that is avilable, and I would ask the Minister, through her colleague, to look again to ensure that the farm environment grants are being used where they are needed.  Originally the higher rate of grant aid was only in the disadvantages areas or under the western package scheme, perhaps where they were least needed, because the intensification of farming and the intensification of livestock is on the east coast and the midlands rather than in the west. To generalise, anyone can point to exceptions but that is where the larger grazing areas and the more intense winter fattening systems were originally located.  It is spreading now but the first problems arose in the east and south-east, south coast and southern regions.  Yet they were the areas, ironically, that did not benefit for the higher grant and we must ensure now that they can get a good rate of grant and that the plan they are tied <Col N="24" /> into is not too restrictive to allow them to avail of the moneys that Europe is so kindly providing for this.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis mentioned slurry spreading and the timing of it.  This is a very vexed question because Teagasc have now tied down farmers to certain months of the year for slurry spreading. We have done that sitting at a desk, saying: &ldquo;Normally speaking, these months would be suitable and those months would not&rdquo;, but with the very mixed weather we have had, both winter and summer, for some seasons farmers have found themselves looking at ideal conditions in which to spread their slurry or empty their effluent tanks into their land while at the same time they are not quite within the month dictated by Dublin or by the local Teagasc office. Again when it comes to a good defence, if they spread outside the months that have been laid down at the desk in Dublin, regardless of how ideal the conditions may have been weather wise and land wise at the time, they could be in trouble.  We must look at this again because commonsense must apply to the spreading of slurry above all else.  You cannot do it with rules and regulations that are set down in black and white, because it has not worked in the last two years.  Farmers have been looking at ideal conditions and questioning whether they should move.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that we can safely dispose of as much waste as possible without increasing the burden on the local authorities.  Let the farmers do it as long as they can do it safely.  Let us have a little flexibility and avail of the weather conditions and land conditions that prevail in any one spring or at any time of the year.</P>
    <P>I welcome amendment No. 20 in terms of the local authority financing of the Bill or collection of moneys for costs incurred.  I am a little concerned about this whole area of local authorities and financing them.  All of us, recent Governments in any case, have increased the burden of legislation and the responsibility of the local authority in terms of carrying out different duties but none of <Col N="25" /> us has actually provided them with the extra finance to do so.  I do not think we are doing it yet.  We have all sat down and given out about this again and again. We have never made a concerted effort to ensure that the local authorities are funded to carry out the responsibilities we in these Houses charge them to do. The Minister is allowing them to recoup costs here.  For the miles and miles of river banks, lakeshores and farms they will have to walk, and the vigilance they will have to put into operating this Bill, this amendment of the 1977 Bill &mdash; the number of prosecutions thankfully will be miniscule in most counties where there are law abiding citizens &mdash; they will not be in a position to recoup the monitoring costs of trying to find the few who are breaking the law.  When you catch and prosecute successfully you will be able to recoup costs, but from our example as a local authority that has operated very vigilantly the legislation in very difficult and financial circumstances, I know the drain properly operating the law can be on local authorities.</P>
    <P>We want them to implement this legislation fairly but firmly, but we want them genuinely to be in a position financially to do so.  Whether it is too late now to actually look at funding the local authority to take on this extra burden of legislation that we all want to do or whether it should be a very important issue when you talk about local government reform the whole concept of not increasing the burden of legislation on local authorities, such as this legislation, without funding them to do the work we all want them to do, should be stitched in.</P>
    <P>Generally I welcome this Bill.  The whole point in operating it will be firmness but fairness for all sectors of the community.  Farmers generally have gone through a couple of very difficult years and I am afraid, given the complexities of the CAP and the ever threatening outcome of the GATT negotiations, the next few years in terms of primary production do not look good for the majority of our farmers, particularly those who are indebted to the banks.  They have a double problem, apart from producing <Col N="26" /> enough from the land to live they have to produce enough to pay the bank manager. It is looking very difficult.</P>
    <P>We must do everything we can do to help increase the environmental grants to ensure that farmers are funded to carry out the improvements to their premises that will protect the water supply and the water source in the area for all the citizens.  Perhaps we could look again to see if the controls in terms of the conditions under which grants are given are too restrictive and whether the high rate of grants to those farmers in those areas that need them most.  When you draw up a scheme at a desk it is very difficult to take into account the practical operation of a scheme on the ground and it is very hard to have the pragmatic effect of it fully understood.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill generally and I will look with interest at its operation.  We can really only tell as the years go by whether it is doing the job the Minister and all of us in this House and in the Dáil want it to do.  I do not think any Government, no matter who is in power, should be afraid to come back at any stage and further amend this legislation if it should prove necessary as we learn from the operation of what we are discussing here today.</P>
    <P>The disposal of waste is an increasingly critical problem for all authorities, both local and national.  It is a direct result of modernisation and industrial policy and because of the flight from the land in rural areas into the bigger towns and cities pressure is being concentrated on certain areas and neither the local authorities nor the national authority have provided the resources to cope quickly enough.  That has to be done.  We have to recognise that the dilution factor of water as a receptacle for waste is not infinite and we cannot continue as we are doing now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to warmly welcome the Minister of State to this House.  I think we came in here together in 1977 and I am delighted to see her back here with us.  I am a firm believer in amendments to legislation.  Here we have an extraordinary number of amendments <Col N="27" /> to a Bill.  It is an example of how a Minister and his or her advisers will listen if changes have to be made to a Bill but when I see 22 amendments I wonder what kind of a Bill was passed through this House on the first day.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis referred to pollution and what we are doing today.  I do not know whether we have had as Senator Doyle said, that extraordinary amount of pollution in the past or whether all of a sudden it is being highlighted to such an extent that we have to deal with it.  This legislation is before us again today to do that.  We made very powerful addresses during our Presidency of the EC about being a green island and having a Green Presidency.  I hope what is being proposed will enable us to take the necessary steps to protect our environment.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle referred to the situation where farmers got advice from ACOT, now Teagasc.  What will happen to them with regard to fines?  In fairness to them, they took the advice at the time of experts from the Department of Agriculture and they could now find themselves in trouble.  Equally, in fairness to advisers in the Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture, I am sure that will be corrected.</P>
      <P>I do not like strong criticism of local government and local authorities.  We pass all sorts of legislation and on the ground we are giving county councils instructions, we are giving them new legislation but we are not giving them money whatsoever to implement the measures.  Again, I suppose that will be corrected.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to fisheries and the excellent job they are doing.  I do not intend to delay the House.  I welcome these amendments.  I am a firm believer that if any Bill before this House or the other House needs to be amended that should be done and comments and suggestions of Members of both Houses should be considered by the relevant Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would <Col N="28" /> like to thank the Senators for their contributions, and indeed for their very complimentary remarks.  Senator Honan is indeed correct, we came into this House together 13 years ago.  I have gone elsewhere and she has been lucky enough to stay in this House.  I am sure she is much happier being here than having to stand before the general electorate every few years.  I am told it is much easier in a Seanad election.</P>
      <P>I welcome the supportive remarks of all the Senators and their willingness to accept the amendments made in the Dáil. I will not comment in detail on the various contributions made but there are a couple of points I would like to take up.  First, I want to say to Senator Doyle that if it is not correct that Wexford are at the top of the list then they are not very far from the top.  We do not have the precise statistics but I agree with her that Wexford is an exemplary county as far as environmental protection is concerned. In particular, I would like to join with her in paying tribute to the County Manager, Mr. Noel Dillon, for the management skills he uses to spearhead the effort in County Wexford which is an example indeed to other local authorities.  At the Department of the Environment one gets an opportunity to examine very closely the performance of local authorities and, in my experience, it is very much related to the quality of the management at the top.  I have to say that the management in Wexford are exemplary in their commitment and in the way Mr. Dillon and his staff set about putting in place the legislation that comes from this House and from the Oireachtas generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Honan said, we have a lot of good legislation.  Perhaps we do not always give local authorities the resources to implement some of it but, generally speaking, where there is a commitment, where there is good management, where there is a will, local authorities, by putting the legislation into effect, can ensure that their area is free from pollution, or is as free from pollution as possible, that those who commit serious pollution offences are prosecuted <Col N="29" /> and that that prosecution acts as a deterrent to others.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Doyle's query about the best available technology as opposed to BPM, this is something into which I have put some thought and I have read a number of pieces of research from other countries.  Generally, the concept in Europe is the best available technology not involving excessive costs, the BAT principle.  That is somewhat behind the United States where it is the best available technology.  The reason why it would not be desirable in Ireland to proceed with the best available technology is quite simply that we would place Irish industry in an unfair position from the competitive point of view.  If Irish industry were to put in place the most expensive technology, which generally is the best available technology, it would mean that you would add to their industrial costs and you would place them at a disadvantage in comparison to their European competitors. The general view within the Community is that we should move together on this issue.  The best available technology not involving excessive cost is certainly the thinking now and, as far as the Environmental Protection Agency legislation is concerned, that will be the principle adopted there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Many would argue that BPM is not too far off the best available technology not involving excessive cost in that it takes into account the actual financial circumstances of the venture.  It would be argued, and rightly so, that there are certain forms of technology that would, perhaps, totally eliminate any possibility that farming would offer to pollute, but the cost of such technology is such that it would put the farmer out of business if he had to spend £1 million on a piece of technology to prevent his slurry or his silage effluent causing pollution. Obviously, there would not be much point in him staying in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have a sense of balance.  We want agriculture to thrive and succeed. Indeed, it is in the interests of farmers <Col N="30" /> that the environment should be as clean and green as possible.  The food industry, which is one of our growth industries worth about £3.5 billion annually, accounts for 40 per cent of our net export earnings, a quarter of all industrial jobs and that industry is very much dependent on a clean, green environment if it is to succeed.</P>
    <P>The company that sells Kerrygold butter in Germany, for example, have been able to market very successfully in a declining butter market, the sales of Kerrygold have doubled over the past four years, and are now worth about £50 million per annum.  That has been done by selling the product as coming from a clean, green country, Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are huge advantages and farmers generally realise that.  By and large the vast majority of farmers in my experience want to operate their farming to the best possible standards and in accordance with good agricultural practices, but because farming is not regulated generally by any kind of planning restrictions &mdash; traditionally planning permission was not required for many farm buildings and activities &mdash; it is necessary now to introduce some controls and regulations to try to minimise and remove the potential agriculture has to pollute.</P>
    <P>When one realises that milk, for example, is 400 times more potent a pollutant than raw sewage, or that silage effluent is 200 times more potent than raw sewage, and slurry 80 times more potent than raw sewage, one quickly sees just what the potential of agriculture and agricultural practices have to pollute. That is why the provisions in the Bill relating to the making of by-laws and so on are extremely important.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle wondered if somebody who had taken advice, erected his or her facilities close to the water course and pollution occurred could avail of the good defence provisions?  Obviously, at the end of the day, it would be a matter for the courts.  The important thing to realise about the good defence provision &mdash; Senator Hederman referred to it as well &mdash; is that it is not just a question of taking reasonable care and providing the <Col N="31" /> facilities, the person has to maintain the facilities, operate and supervise them and employ practices or methods of operation that were suitable for the purpose of such prevention.  Obviously, if it was clear that by virtue of its very location it was not possible for the facility to be operated to such an extent as to prevent pollution, then I do not believe that could be held to be a good defence.  At the end of the day it would be a matter for the courts.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Teagasc advice &mdash; Senator Honan referred to this &mdash; the staff at Teagasc have been doing some excellent research into soil use.  I visited Johnstown Castle on more than one occasion to see for myself the nature of the work that is going on there.  It is possible now, as a result of the research, to give very clear and definite advice to farmers on the best time to spread slurry in various locations, taking into account weather conditions, soil quality and so on.  That is very important.  What might be appropriate in one area may not be appropriate in another because of particular soil conditions.  We must ensure that that slurry is spread at a time and in a way that is suitable to the particular location.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten referred to the pollution that has occurred in County Roscommon to ten group water schemes as a result of agricultural activities.  I was not aware of that, and I am distressed to hear that that is the case.  There is no justification for that.  There is no justification for agriculture as it is practised being allowed to pollute the public water supply that it provided at huge expense by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the need to have new and improved sewage facilities around the country, and I would agree with Senator Doyle.  Over the next decade the Government have committed themselves to provide £1 billion for the provision of new and improved water and sewage treatment facilities.  About £300 million will go on improved water supply facilities, about £430 million on the provision of sewage treatment facilities for our coastal towns and about £230 million <Col N="32" /> to provide the remaining sewage treatment facilities that are required to prevent the pollution of our inland water courses.</P>
    <P>We have 12,000 kilometres of river, an awful of river.  According to the last water quality management study conducted by An Foras Forbartha in 1986, only 2 per cent of that water was regarded as seriously polluted, 74 per cent of it unpolluted and the remainder was in the category known as medium pollution.  I am not certain what that means.  Our rivers come second to Scotland.  We have to improve on that position where possible, and keep our water quality as high and as clean as possible.</P>
    <P>It is a major national asset.  I have said before in many places that there are parts of the world where they would give their right arm to get some of the fantastic water facilities we have virtually on all our doorsteps.  It is our responsibility for this generation and the next generation to appreciate those natural facilities, to use them to the full, to keep them as clean and as pure as possible, not to misuse or mistreat them and so seriously pollute them.</P>
    <P>It takes seven years, if it is at all possible, to restore a river or a water course to its pure state if it has been seriously polluted.  We all know about the huge efforts and the expense that have gone into trying to restore Lough Sheelin, which was heavily polluted as a result of agricultural activities in that region.  I am happy to say that the reports I have indicate that the quality is improving, but it will be a long, slow, painful process, and not without considerable expenditure by the taxpayer, albeit through the local authorities or the State.  It is in all our interests, financially as well as from an environmental point of view, to ensure that that kind of activity does not happen again.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred to the difficulties local authorities experience, and I share their concern.  As Senators know, the Government have established a cabinet sub-committee to look at local government reform and they have also appointed an expert group of nine people <Col N="33" /> to come forward with recommendations on how best to reform local government to ensure that we have a system that is responsive to the needs of the community, that is as democratic as possible, and that allows the community to participate in local Government, which is extremely important.  Although we have many authorities and we have a lot of structures, they are not always as responsive as they could be nor are they always seen to meet the needs of the community as one would wish.  It is my view, and that of the Government, that anything that can be devolved to local government should be so devolved and that activities should be supplied at the lowest possible level.</P>
    <P>One would have to take account of the efficiency of providing the activities in a particular way but if something can be provided efficiently locally that should be done.  It should not be necessary, for example, for the Minister for Energy to give permission to fell trees or for many of the things that come to Departments, particularly the Department of the Environment to be decided nationally in Dublin.  It would be much more sensible and efficient if it were done at local level and if local councillors were given real teeth and real muscle, which many of them have lacked for quite some time.</P>
    <P>It is not true, as Senator Doyle said, that Europe is receptive to suggestions for giving money for environment projects. I can assure her that is not the case. If anything, it is the opposite.  Money is only given if it is for environment projects generally and if it is development related so if money is given towards a sewage treatment facility in one town like Greystones, it will not be given in another area close by because it would be considered unnecessary.  Unless the money can be shown to have development potential then unfortunately moneys are not forthcoming for purely environmental projects.  That is a disappointment because as a Community, in particular the poorer regions like ours on the periphery, need to get additional resources if we are to provide the kind of modern <Col N="34" /> facilities and infrastructure that is necessary to prevent and minimise the risk of pollution.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Senators again for their contributions.  It is the first opportunity I have had to come here in relation to a Bill.  I was here before talking about the roads in Cavan-Monaghan.  I hope they have improved since then.  I look forward to coming back again.  This Bill was initiated by the last Government so to pay any great tribute to me for any aspect of the Bill would be wrong, not that politicians do not like getting compliments. To be fair, this Bill was very much initiated by the previous Government, by Minister Flynn, as a result of the awful pollution incidents in 1986 and 1987.  The farm surveys that were carried out in those years indicated that about 45 per cent of the farms surveyed posed a medium to high risk threat of pollution and it was felt essential that the Water Pollution Act, 1977 would have to be amended in order to increase the penalties to give additional powers to the local authorities to ensure that polluters pay the full cost of taking actions which are expensive, and that they could be held civilly liable as well to make good the damage or to provide resources in lieu of the damage caused.</P>
    <P>It is a good Bill.  I hope local authorities will enforce this legislation vigorously in every county in Ireland &mdash; after it is signed by the President, which we hope will be very soon.  Unfortunately, it has taken too long to go through the Oireachtas but because of the procedures we operate in the Oireachtas things take an unduly long length of time to be processed. This Bill came before the last Seanad and was passed I understand prior to last July and it is only now coming back with the amendments.  That is an unfortunately long delay.  I think it is a pity because we could have done with having it enacted much sooner.</P>
    <P>However, we have the Bill now and I urge local authorities to use it as vigorously and as aggressively as they can. There should be no excuse for local authorities to tell us that they do not have sufficient powers or they do not have the <Col N="35" /> resources.  This Bill equips them well in relation to water pollution in particular.</P>

      <P>I want to make two comments. It is regrettable that, because of the fact that this Bill had its major debate in this House during the last Seanad, and in the meantime has been in the Dáil, that those of us who have jumped Houses, have not had the opportunity to give it the attention it deserves and debate it at length as we would have liked.  That is beyond all our control. However, we welcome the opportunity this morning to make a few comments on it.</P>
      <P>May I suggest that the Minister gently squeeze the arm of her senior colleague Minister Michael O'Kennedy because I believe there is money in Europe for what is generally termed environmentally-friendly farm practices so while it might not come under the environment Vote as such, it goes through the Department of Agriculture.  Perhaps we could look at extending more schemes that are strictly agricultural but to enhance the environment in terms of the farm practice in use.  That is what I had in mind when I said I feel there is money in Europe for environmentally-friendly farm practices, if not specifically for the capital schemes we have been speaking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also compliment the farmers of Ireland for their investment of over £200 million in the past few years.  I know they need to spend the same again to get to the stage we, and Europe, would <Col N="36" /> like their operations to be in as regards protecting our environment.  That is a major investment by the farmers of Ireland in difficult times.  If progress continues to be made, we will be looking at the green, clean Ireland we all want and our children will thank us for it.</P>

      <P>I would like to extend my welcome again to the Minister and thank him for being with us.  He sets a headline in his approach to the Seanad which could be followed by some of his colleagues. He is to be complimented on that.</P>
      <P>During my contribution on Second Stage last evening I referred to the context in which the Bill is introduced against a background of rising unemployment and massive emigration.  I also referred to the effect the economic climate has <i>vis-á-vis</i> the aims of the employers and the employees, and the employers and the unions.  It is necessary to identify the importance these elements have in the industrial relations milieu and in the context of operating the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the industrial relations scene.  The management of industrial relations should not be seen in isolation from the personnel managment function.  Personnel management is synonymous in too many organisations with industrial relations and is seen as a fire fighting function to head off union trouble or to settle it.  Irish industry and commerce has too often seen personnel management in this way rather than as a function concerned with obtaining, organising and motivating the human resources required by the enterprise, with developing a management style that will promote co-operation and trust between all the people working in the organisation <Col N="37" /> and in helping the enterprise to meet its legal obligations and social responsibilities towards its employees with regard to there conditions of employment and to their quality of life in the firm.  It recognises that the effectiveness of the organisation is directly related to the physical and psychological well-being of its employees.</P>
    <P>Personnel management achieves its objectives by an organised and systematic approach to the management of the human resources including, but not exclusively, industrial relations.  The popular misconception that personel management is solely dealing with industrial relations problems must be dispelled. Management have suffered because of this.  Industrial relations and the role of this Bill must be seen as part of the professional approach to enterprise, to managing and motivating the people.  Industrial relations is part of and complementary to the work of the whole personnel function.  Personnel management ensures that the qualifications of employees recruited meet the identified manpower needs of the organisation.  Too often this is done in a haphazard and unprofessional manner.</P>
    <P>Good industrial relations cannot be achieved if people suitable to fill the vacancies are not recruited.  Personnel management must facilitate the proper introduction of such employees into the organisation by suitable induction programmes and thereafter to administer the training and development function of the organisation.  Not enough emphasis is placed by industry on training and development in the area of Personal relationships.</P>
    <P>A systematic approach must be taken to identify the training needs of an organisation, to organise plans to suit those needs and to review and evaluate the success of such plans.  A proper management approach to the whole area of training and development should be the cornerstone of every organisation's personnel policies.  I pay tribute to the Irish Management Institute, to FÁS &mdash; formerly AnCO &mdash; and our own personnel at <Col N="38" /> the Plassey Management and Technology Centre at the University of Limerick with which I am involved, and to many others who have contributed to the development of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>People like to know how well they are doing in an organisation.  Organisations should have in place performance appraisal systems to review on a regular basis on individual's performance and progress on the job and to assess his or her potential for future promotion. Organisations must be concerned about the personal welfare of their employees, not a popular thing to say today.  Advice should be available for assistance with health problems.  Preparation for retirement is very important and so on.  This recognises that in exchange for work an employee is entitled to rather more than his pay.  It also recognises his entitlement to be considered as a human being.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to outline the organisational climate which should be developed to create a climate of trust and understanding which will prepare the ground for good industrial relations in which the Bill before us has a role.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill changes the approaches to picketing.  Picketing &ldquo;at or near&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;at, or where that is not practicable, at the approaches to, a place where their employers works or carries on business,&rdquo;.  The Minister has not on this occasion taken the opportunity to deal with the effect of picketing outside multi-employer establishments, such as ports, shopping centres, airports and industrial estates.  Serious disruption can take place when pickets are placed on the entrances to these estates in furtherance of a dispute between the union and just one employer in that estate. &ldquo;Attend at&rdquo; the place of picketing under the Act should accommodate picketing outside the entrance to the place of employment if it is a place used by the public but is in private ownership.  We suggest that the exception to this should be where the owner of the private property indicates in writing that he objects to such attendance on his property.  This will satisfy the constitutional problem <Col N="39" /> which would rise if direct access to picketing on private property was granted.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 14 which says that the rules of every union will contain a provision for secret ballots for strike or industrial action.  Too often we have seen strikes take place following a vote which took place in an emotive and intimidating atmosphere.  Pseudo-secret ballots were conducted around a table with intense pressure to vote in favour, and people were forced to do so under the threat of social sanctions.  This was hyped up on many occasions by a strong vocal minority within the organisation.  In flash disputes a properly organised secret ballot will sideline the often highly vocal minority and allow the true wish of the work-force to take precedence.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>However, section 14 as worded is a minefield for potential problems for managers and trade union officials.  Under this section a secret ballot is required for a strike or other industrial action.  This is too broad and can be interpreted too loosely.  Small insignificant problems that arise on the shop floor can be interpreted on many occasions as industrial action in the broadest sense.  I will give some examples to illustrate this.  If employees complain that the quality of food has been lowered in the canteen and refuse to use it, can the employer interpret this as industrial action?  Must the unions insist on a secret ballot without sanctioning or agreeing to such action?  Under the Act, as I see it, this may be the case. I will give another example I experienced during my days when I may involved in industrial relations.  During a severe frost employees complained to their supervisor that they were unable to work because of the cold.  It was a genuine complaint.  The supervisor refused to listen because of the usual pressures of production.  On investigation it was accepted that no human being should be asked to work under the conditions.  The employees, in frustration informed the supervisor that they could not physically work in the environment and told him that after lunch they would refuse to do <Col N="40" /> so.  The supervisor responded by introducing a temporary heating arrangement. Under the Act before us will this supervisor who is hard pressed to achieve production targets be less than responsive because he realises that a secret ballot must be arranged by the union before the action is taken?</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to a very important and interesting area with regard to the interpretation of industrial action.  Work to rule and overtime bans are without doubt industrial action.  Will the result of this section be that workers will take action against the advice of their union?  Will they be alienated from their representatives?  Will management find that the control exercised by the union over their members will be undermined? This section will be counterproductive. The Minister must consider amending it on Committee Stage to have secret ballots before strikes or other major industrial actions, such as overtime bans, go-slows and so on.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the reference that all members concerned must ballot before strike and on this I should like to quote from the Irish Conference of Professional and Services Association who state:</P>
    <P>This section also states &ldquo;that all members whom it is reasonable for the Union concerned to believe at the time of the ballot will be called upon to engage in the strike or industrial action be given a fair opportunity of voting.&rdquo; The interpretation of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; would most definitely lead to problems for Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>This was discussed in the Dáil and I would like the Minister's view on the concerns of the unions and of general bodies like the ICPSA on this.  Concern is also expressed at the fact that the result of the ballot must be released and the Act states &ldquo;as soon as practicable after the conduct of a secret ballot the trade union shall take reasonable steps to make known&ldquo; the result.  The unions are very concerned about this because it shows their hand to the employer or the employer's representative. For example, where there is an <Col N="41" /> almost a 90 per cent majority in favour of strike action and where there is 51 per cent majority for a strike, an employer may have a totally different approach to the negotiating process in those two cases.  Section 14 (f) should be closely looked at in the context of negotiation.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (e) caters for the involvement of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in sanctioning strikes.  This is welcome in that it addresses the freedom of ICTU members to take action outside the policy of Congress.  The section, however, is defective in not addressing itself to the involvement of non-Congress unions.  This is especially the case where non-Congress and Congress unions represent workers in the same firm.  Non-Congress unions have a right under the Constitution to the same recognition by the Minister as Congress unions.  They have a right not to organise themselves or organise themselves in a different body to ICTU and the Minister should recognise this in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also clearly defective in its failure to address the problem of inter-union disputes.  Under the Constitution, workers have a right to associate or not to associate.  It is conducive to good industrial relations that all employees in the same category of employment should be members of the same trade union. This, however, is unconstitutional but in practice in most organisations employees are organised in the same union. However, where this is not the case, serious disputes between unions can arise and I believe the Bill fails to address this. There is need for clear provisions to deal with inter-union disputes as well as for balloting in multi-union employments where non-Congress unions are involved.</P>
    <P>Under section 19 where the union gives one week's notice to the employer, the employer may not apply to the court for an <i>ex-parte</i> injunction.  The court should play as small a role as possible in the management of disputes.  A period of one week's notice is a bit short and a longer period would provide an opportunity for contacts to be made in an endeavour to head off the dispute.  In this respect, the Institute of Personnel Management <Col N="42" /> states that a period of one month should apply.  I believe this may be a little long, but certainly there should be more than a week.  I found two weeks to be effective. A month is too long because if a strike is inevitable and nothing can be done about it, it is better to commence negotiation and resolve the dispute.</P>
    <P>I have problems also with section 21 which increases the maximum membership for the grant of a negotiating licence to a trade union from 500 to 1,000. While the concept of union rationalisation is welcome, the provision excludes the granting of licences to small, unique groups whose positions would be buried in a larger union.  There has been a long tradition of employees organised in staff associations who do not have a negotiating licence but who are recognised by their employers as representing their members.  These tend to be small in number and represent a section of the workforce who choose not to be in the mainstream union area.  With present developments in organisations, such groups may need in the future protection under the Bill while maintaining their independence.  The Bill does not allow for that.  The Minister should consider including a provision in the Bill to cater for the registration of staff associations as unions under section 21 which are in existence at the time of the passing of the Bill.  Proof of operation and of their existence prior to the passing of this Bill can be easily ascertained by minutes of negotiations, correspondence with employers and so on.  I ask the Minister to consider this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask a question with regard to section 23 on the definition of a worker.  It is a simple question and one that has been asked in the other House. Why is a psychiatric nurse employed by a health board included but a general hospital nurses is excluded.  Why should general hospital nurses be excluded from protection under the Bill?</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of a Labour Relations Commission under section 24.  The proposed body will have six members &mdash; two employer nominees, two worker nominees and two ministerial <Col N="43" /> nominees.  The two worker nominees will be appointed following negotiations by organisations representative of trade unions.  Will the Irish Conference of Professional Services Association be represented? This body represents a significant number of non-Congress associations, including the Irish Bank Officials Association and a comprehensive body of staff associations.  If the reply is that Congress represents a majority of employees nationally, the Bill should be amended to allow the Minister to nominate three member's from workers' associations, from the ICPSA.</P>
    <P>I wish to place in record my tribute to the Labour Court.  Since its establishment in 1946, it has responded well to the changing times, likewise, the conciliation service of the court.  The industrial relations officers of the service have done marvellous, often unrecognised, work in the industrial relations area.  The new commission must immediately embark on a comprehensive training programme to be available to new entrants to the service.  This will assist in maintaining consistency of approach between officers of the service.  One can often find inconsistency of approach, and, indeed performance, between conciliation officers. A comprehensive training programme, leading to an official qualification, should be considered by the commission.</P>
    <P>The increased use over the years of the Labour Court service reflects two aspects of the involvement of the court: first the consolidation of the service as an integral institution with employers and employee associations and secondly, the misuse by employers and trade unions of the role of the court in industrial relations.  The court was established as a court of last resort but too often it is used now as an easy option when a dispute arises over an issue.  Trade union officials are inclinced too often to refer matters to the court rather than attempting to solve the problem and convey unpalatable information to their members.  They go to the court knowing that the outcome cannot be in their favour but get the recommendation <Col N="44" /> from the court as a tool to sell the unpalatable message to their members.  It is an easy option rather than telling their members the facts of life.  Similarly, employers when faced with a grievance too often send it off to the court rather than deal with it.  The attitude can be to get if off the local agenda, refer it to the employers organisation representative and let it take its course from there.  This often causes frustration on the shop floor or in the office and leads to unofficial disputes.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Bill attempts to address the problem by providing an industrial relations advisory service, which I assume will be free of charge to employers and unions.  It also provides for a code of practice relevant to industrial relations.  While this is welcome, I wish to ask the Minister if this is to be a general document referring to all industry and commerce or will different codes of practice apply to different industries? Cognisance must be taken of the structural determinants of industrial relations. Not all organisations are the same.</P>
    <P>The industrial relations climate is determined by many influences, including the history of relationships within the organisation, the levels of management and the physical environment of the enterprise.  There are different climates of industrial relations between, say, a factory or an organisation in the centre of Dublin and a factory or organisation based in a rural area.  Similarly, the type of enterprise affects the industrial relations climate.  The climate of industrial relations and inter-personal relationships are different; for example, between an office environment in a bank or insurance company and that on the factory floor of a company manufacturing wire products involving furnaces with a high level of temperature and heavy work.  The commission must be careful that it does not over-generalise when outlining codes of practice.</P>
    <P>There is in existence a code of practice from the Institute of Personnel Management and I would like to place it on the record for the attention of the commission when it discusses this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> The IPM believes that the management of people must form part of every manager's job.  Personnel practitioners who are IPM members provide professional knowledge, advice and support to their employers on the most effective use of human resources. Their concern is for the achievement of the goals of the organisation as an industrial, commercial or public enterprise and as a social entity.  They must have a clear understanding of the economic, financial, political and other factors which affect the success of an organisation so that, as members of the management team, they can take an active part in decision making.</P>
    <P>The primary responsibility of personnel practitioners is to their employer, though they also have obligations to the employees in respect of their working conditions, rewards and development.  They are the privileged recipients and guardians of personal information and confidences.</P>
    <P>In carrying out their responsibilities, IPM members are expected to adhere to the following principles of behaviour. Personnel practitioners will respect their employer's requirements for the confidentiality of information entrusted to them, including the safeguarding of information about current, past and prospective employees.  They will also ensure the privacy and confidentiality of personnel information to which they have access or for which they are responsible, subject to any legal rights of employees in respect of information relating to themselves.</P>
    <P>Personnel practitioners will promote non-discrimination employment practices in line with current legislation.</P>
    <P>Personnel practitioners will establish and maintain fair, reasonable and equitable standards of treatment of individuals by their employer.</P>
    <P>Personnel practitioners will continuously update their skills and knowledge in respect of developments and legislation in the personnel field and the impact of technical, economic and social change on people at work.</P>
    <P>Personnel practitioners will seek to <Col N="46" /> achieve the fullest possible development of the capabilities of individual employees to meet present and future requirements of the organisation and encourage others to develop themselves.</P>
    <P>Personnel practitioners will maintain high standards of accuracy in the advice and information given to the employer and employees in the fields for which they are responsible.</P>
    <P>Personnel practitioners will be prepared to act in a counselling role to individual employees, pensioners and the dependants of deceased employees in fields where they have competence and, where appropriate, refer to other professionals or helping agencies.</P>
    <P>Personnel practitioners will at all times act in accordance with this code of conduct and the duties that they owe to employers and employees.  Where there is a conflict between those obligations, the practitioners will make a personal decision after considering the options, of which resignation may be one.</P>
    <P>Personnel practitioners will not act in any way which would knowingly countenance, encourage or assist unlawful conduct by either employer or employees.</P>
    <P>Personnel practitioners will at all time endeavour to enhance the standing and good name of the profession. Adherence to the principles of the Institute's codes of practice is a prerequisite of this aim.</P>
    <P>I should like to briefly refer to the employment appeals tribunal and its role. I will make very little reference to this because, as a member of the tribunal, it is fair that I would just deal very briefly with it and not go into detail.  In relation to the tribunal, is the promised legislation onstream?  Will the Minister comment on that?  The Labour Relations Commission will have responsibility for providing an advisory service on industrial relations. This service at the moment is provided by private consultants and, in particular, the Irish Productivity Centre.  This is a body which has done excellent work over <Col N="47" /> the years for industry and commerce and indeed the public sector.  Will the Labour Relations Commission now provide that service and will it also include in that an industrial engineering service which is supplied by the Irish Productivity Centre in the whole area of industrial relations? Industrial engineering and the whole area of work study, work measurement and work systems is very close to industrial relations and I would like to hear the Minister's view on that.</P>
    <P>There is considerable concern with the proposals to alter the position of the Labour Court under section 26.  Both the Institute of Personnel Management and the Federation of Irish Employers have been very forthright in expressing their concern on this issue.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, while publicly supporting the Labour Relations Commission and the changed role of the Labour Court, have also expressed reservations, and I quote briefly from the Institute of Personnel Management:</P>
    <P>In regard to structure the institute welcomes the intention to unite all services in the area under one body, the Labour Relations Commission, but sincerely believe that the structure proposed will not be effective unless the Labour Court itself is at the core of the Labour Relations Commission and is the directing force.  It is critical that the court and the conciliation service retain that link which has been the bedrock of their mutual success in the past.  The institute believes that a breaking of that link will operate to the detriment of the overall intention of the Minister's proposals which must be the improvement of the industrial relations/dispute avoidance dispute resolution machinery.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court should retain its exclusive power to investigate a dispute where the parties request a court investigation and where a conciliation conference has been held at which the parties made a genuine effort and a genuine attempt to resolve the issue in dispute.</P>
    <P>There is concern that separation of the <Col N="48" /> conciliation service from the Labour Court and coming now under the Labour Relations Commission will cause friction between the two bodies.  The conciliation and Labour Court service has been complementary and operated effectively to date.  Care must be taken that such good working arrangements are not interfered with or put at risk.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion in section 11.5 which gives official recognition to the non-paid facilitators of the industrial relations process, the shop steward.  The popular opinion of the role of the shop steward is that of a trouble maker who thwarts management's work at every stage.  That concept could not be further from the truth.  In fact, the shop steward in 90 per cent of the occasions in my experience, is the lubricant that ensures good industrial relations on the factory floor.</P>
    <P>The future of good industrial relations in a more complex organisational environment will depend on the level of trust developed between the parties.  The Labour Relations Commission must be given adequate resources to carry out its work and must not be hindered in its development by lack of resources.  The Minister has a duty to ensure this.  The commission must assist industry, commerce and the public service to identify the support and contribution that a strong personnel management function can give to an organisation, irrespective of size. Concepts which as have been lying on the shelf since the economic recession must be resurrected &mdash; like job enrichment and worker participation, on which we had a debate on 14 June, to which I contributed but I will not refer to it now because of the time factor.  The subject of communications, which was high on the agenda, is also on the shelf and should be brought down and dusted off by the Labour Relations Commission.  There are many other areas of industrial employment which should be considered in the changed economic situation.</P>
    <P>I would like again to welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on introducing it.  While it is the role of Opposition to highlight differences, I do not want to <Col N="49" /> take from the positive aspects of the Bill. I thank the Minister for his time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that we must agree with the main thrust of the Bill, particularly when we read that the purpose of the Bill is to bring about a number of important changes in trade dispute law, to establish the new Labour Relations Commission, to make changes in the procedures for reference of disputes to the Labour Court and, of course, in the procedures and constitution of the joint labour committees.  All those things are very encouraging and constitute the main thrust of the Bill.  Therefore, the Bill has to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>We must also pay tribute to the fact that changes are also proposed in the method of enforcing employment regulation orders in relation to the terms of registered agreements.  That too is something we must welcome.  The proposed changes in the conditions for the granting of negotiating licences, the grants towards expansion, transfer of engagements, merging of unions, etc., are all very welcome.  As I have said, the main thrust of the Bill must be welcomed but the real arguments will arise on amendments and will deal with detail and emphasis.</P>
      <P>We consider that section 11, which deals with the provisions for picketing should be amended because we consider it to be unduly restrictive.  I will not go into detail because we intend to table amendments to this section.  That is where the main thrust of the argument will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The range of activity covered by the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; in section 8 needs clarification.  We will deal with this in detail on Committee Stage.  Section 8 provides protection for workers in disputes who are seeking employment with a new employer, particularly where the ownership of a business is being transferred. This is another matter that we would be concerned about.  What is meant by mandatory procedures?  I would like that clarified.  Section 19, prescribing the length of notice to be given to a trade union of an application for an injunction, <Col N="50" /> is another area about which we would have some reservations.  The provisions in the Bill for balloting are extremely broad and would affect all-out picketing, and possibly make it impossible.  There is need for clarification here.  The terms &ldquo;organise, participate in sanction or support&rdquo; are somewhat vague and too broad. Like a good negotiator, it is using the safety of generalities.  We are worried about that.  The power conferred on the Registrar of Friendly Societies to investigate the requirement to hold pre-strike ballots on the part of the trade union needs further consideration.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure about the power of the Minister to revoke an negotiating licence. However we might need to take another look at that.  On Committee Stage we will get into that kind of detail.  As to the functions of the commission as set out in section 25, it is encouraging in the circumstances that we will have a commission which will assist in the provision of conciliation services, industrial relations advisory services, the nomination of rights commissioners and the appointment of equality officers.  In order to deal with the circumstances in which we find ourselves, the establishment of the commission should be given a broad welcome but not necessarily accepted in total as the Bill is drafted.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question whether this legislation would be necessary if we had done our work properly during the years.  The germ of discontent is like any other germ: it grows, reproduces, multiplies. The most virulent germ develops when somebody feels a wrong has not been addressed, irrespective of whether the wrong is real or imaginary.  This can be the commencement of many disputes, particularly where there is indifference or neglect.  That provokes irritation and like any long, continuing oppression, it aggravates discontent and causes people to bide their time until they can get revenge.  That is what has been happening during the years.</P>
    <P>If a worker indicated discontent with conditions that could be the cause of discontent and if the matter was not investigated that sense of discontent became <Col N="51" /> aggravated.  That is why we now need more structures to deal with the effects of bad industrial relations.  That is what we are dealing with; we are not dealing with causes.  Causes are something else. Had there been encouragement by respective Governments or parties in industry during the years to deal with minor matters there would not be the necessity now to have a major settlement on a multitude of complaints that have accumulated.  Therein lies the problem. If complaints are allowed to accumulate over a number of years, when there is a question of trying to improve industrial relations, new structures have to be provided. We should have had a better attitude to industrial relations down through the years and injustices should have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to introduce legislation to lay down rules and regulations. There is a reluctance on the part of the private sector to deal with problems in industry.  For years we have been trying to develop an industrial society.  The private sector should seriously consider the matter of dealing with problems as they arise instead of allowing them to develop to the point where new structures are required in order to settle disputes.</P>
    <P>On legislation like this there is an underlying assumption that there will always be two parties lined up against each other, that there is will always be conflict of interest.  As a young trade union official I had one fixed principle &mdash; to protect the wages and conditions of the people for whom I worked.  My attitude was to let the manager manage and the union would consider and would deal with it in whatever way they saw fit.  My other attitude was to take the gains and fight the losses.  I am not pointing the finger at management.  I am simply trying to pinpoint some of the causes of problems. We had a fixed principle, that we were there to fight for the wages and conditions of the workers.  The employers at the time, who had a lot more expertise, made no effort to involve their employees in the operation of the industry.</P>
    <P>One cannot tell people that they have <Col N="52" /> certain rights and democracy if that democracy does not extend into industry. We should look in a much more concentrated way at the reasons for the structures proposed in the Bill.  The community is excluded from industrial management despite the money they put into industry by way of grants.  By excluding representation of community interests we deny people who have gained knowledge on the shop floor, the right to work their way up.  The employers fail to recognise the important investment of skill and labour made by the workers. There is an equal investment and therefore, an equal right.  We talk about social partners but as long as we have to bring in legislation in order to appease people who feel they will always be in trouble, not much will happen.  The initiative has to come from the employers.  They must realise that times have changed, that they need to involve workers in education, in the science of management, in policy, in export trade, etc.  If this were done workers generally could play a much more effective role in the operation of the company.  This would eliminate to a great extent the need for much of the machinery which is there only because we have not been doing these things.</P>
    <P>Management and capital investors receive representation on the basis of a right to a share in corporate control and workers should be included in this.  They will not run away with the plant or machinery.  They will not be able to maintain a company if it is decided to close it down, but they can make a greater contribution to production and productivity levels.  They can understand the difficulties the company faces and accept that it is not always necessary to have a row in order to get things sorted out.  I must congratulate the Minister on his initiative in resolving disputes but we must work towards eliminating the causes of disputes.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House because Senator O'Toole covered the subject extensively.  It would be wrong to suggest that he did not mention the teachers once, but I was not present when <Col N="53" /> he did.  Senator Neville covered a substantial part of the ground and of course, my colleague, Senator Costello, dealt last night with a considerable number of items that I would like to talk about but it would be superfluous if I were to burden the Seanad with them now.</P>
    <P>As I said, we have reservations about this Bill but I will wait until Committee Stage to speak on them.  Then the Minister can decide whether there are grounds for extension, alteration or amendment of the legislation.  However, I hope we will have an opportunity to table amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider today a very significant day in industrial relations negotiations, welcoming the successful outcome of the Waterford Glass dispute and the phased return to work of 2,300 workers.  It is fitting when debating the Second Stage of the Industrial Relation Bill to look towards the proposed Labour Relations Commission as being the forum for discussing disputes, making recommendations, developing work practices etc. which will be needed in order to prevent disputes arising.  It is a good cross-section of trade unions, management and independent representation and will be in a position to investigate and, hopefully, resolve thorny disputes in the future.  I welcome this Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a landmark Bill since it is the most important and significant piece of industrial relations legislation since 1906.  It comes at a time of extraordinary industrial peace when one could say that most of the adversarial attitudes of past decades have gone, where the right to join trade unions is no longer disputed and where there is the constitutional right to associate, which also carries the converse, to dissociate if one wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are areas that I would like addressed.  We will go back to the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; in the Bill, which is, &ldquo;a person for whom one or more workers work or have worked or normally work or seek to work having previously worked for that person&rdquo;.  On Committee Stage we will be seeking to have that amended to provide that a person who acquires an <Col N="54" /> undertaking which had been an employer will be deemed to be an employer for the purposes of the legislation.  Many Senators have referred to the situation where the owners of a pub in dispute with the union actually suited themselves by forming a new company for the purpose of defeating a strike.  That is a loophole which the Minister might close.</P>
    <P>Another concern relates to the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister put a lot of thought into that definition but it is very wide.  Section 14 provides that any form of industrial action must be proceeded by secret ballot.  The definition provides in effect that any action which effects or is likely to effect in any way any form of contract, not just contracts of employment taken for the purpose of putting pressure on employers is to be regarded as industrial action.  It has been cited already that various areas &mdash; the work to rule, the overtime ban, refusal to undertake certain duties &mdash; would all come under that definition.  As an ASTI member and one who undertook voluntary duties within her school, if I were told to desist from such voluntary duties I wonder would it merit a secret ballot.  I could assure the Minister that the whole of the voluntary secondary schools in the country would close down if we decided we were having a secret ballot on all the voluntary work we do, that sometimes does not get sufficient recognition from religious orders who can take us for granted, or from members of the public who are not job friendly towards teachers, who believe we have too long holidays and are permanently in dispute.  At times they forget the huge amount of voluntary work that is done.  Other teachers in the House would agree with me on that.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where it might be necessary to have a secret ballot which I would not agree should come under that definition: a refusal to handle blacked goods or to undertake work which would lessen the effect of a strike in which other workers are engaged.  Because they would come under that definition I am worried about this but on Committee Stage I shall be pressing again for the <Col N="55" /> deletion of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; and the substitution of &ldquo;major industrial action which would have the effect of significantly disrupting the business&rdquo;.  That is the essence of the amendment.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the concession in the case of primary picketing where the Minister is moving away from the present definition which permits picketing at or near a house or place where a person resides or works or carries out business or happens to be, where he has given the concession to &ldquo;at or, where this is not practical, at the approach to a place where their employer carries on a business&rdquo;. The intention there is to ensure that in future picketing will be at the employer's place of business.  The Minister cites the case of multi-employer locations.  I presume he intends including ports and airports as well as shopping centres and industrial complexes and that it should be possible to secure agreement that the picket be placed at the individual employer's business rather than at the entry to the complex.  I am glad the Minister has included this as it was stressed very strongly in the other House in Deputy Mitchell's amendment.</P>
    <P>Who is entitled to vote in any ballot? I am not clear whether it is just one union in a multi-union employment or whether it is the union that it is in dispute, although all trade unions could be affected by the pickets.  I would like clarification of that.</P>
    <P>As regards inter-union disputes, again there are problems which are difficult to surmount in the workplace where unions are not Congress unions.  The Constitution allows this and I can see why the Minister would be blocked in this area. Perhaps there is some way of addressing this, because these are the thorny disputes where unions who have been part of Congress have moved out &mdash; and in many cases have moved back in again &mdash; or perhaps are more militant.  They generally end up as being the thorny disputes. I had hoped the Minister could <Col N="56" /> have done something about this.  I understand the difficulties as regards constitutionality, but it is an area he might look at again.</P>
    <P>I come now to the area of employers and management and education training. Because of cutbacks and recession, which hopefully we are getting out of, personnel departments are a rarity.  Because of the current industrial peace, I would hope that the emphasis that should be there would be restored through requiring employers to have a well trained personnel function.  Bad management is still cited as being a cause of strikes.  Industries and businesses employ high-flying, highly qualified graduates who are young and untrained in work practices.  Except for the University of Limerick where they have a co-op, in many cases the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; universities may not have the resources to provide the experience the University of Limerick can offer to the young graduates.  I would hope that when they take up their top level job in many cases they would have an opportunity for a short period of time to work through the different sections and departments of the business or industry to ensure that they are <i>au fait</i> with the structures, the relationships, the needs etc.  If they get that opportunity they can assist in creating better relations between employer and employees and eliminate poor relations that often emerge when the high-flying young person does not have the opportunity, like many people who work their way to the top have, of familiarising themselves with the business or industry they are entering.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred to education and training.  The advisory committee on worker participation in their report state &mdash; and it is very close to the point I have been making &mdash; that third level institutions might be encouraged to develop short course modules in relevant disciplines. I suppose it is all right in theory, but I would hope that, having done that, the students would have an opportunity when they become employees, and in many cases employers straight away, to marry the theoretical with the practical.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> In second level there are modules which have been funded from Europe through the project dealing with the transition from school to adult working life. Unfortunately, those modules &mdash; I suppose I should not say &ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo;&mdash; have been implemented in programmes for the less academic student and the reality is that the less academic student is today more likely to be unemployed. Hopefully, that will change; but I hope that those modules would be directed at the academic student as well.  There is such a race for points that sometimes it is forgotten that practical modules as regards the rights and responsibilities of workers, proper relationships between employer and employees and an emphasis on the work ethic are modules to which all students would have access.</P>
    <P>Speaking of education and the role of women in the workplace, it is very important to place on record my plea to the Minister that the Industrial Relations Bill be given adequate resources through the Labour Relations Commission to set up structures to retrain women for entry into the workplace, whether it is full-time, part-time or whether they are involved in job sharing.  It is 15 years since the introduction of equality legislation and we are all familiar with the fact that women still earn only 68 per cent of the average yearly earnings of men.  Much needs to be done in that area.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the efforts he has made in the area of equal opportunities, in the involvement of women in FAS training courses and also in trying to promote child care facilities, the lack of which is one of the greatest drawbacks to women entering the workforce. It is interesting that women are being looked on to enter the workforce only when demographic trends dictate; it is not through love of equality, I can assure you.  Businesses are never into making charitable gestures towards the female gender.</P>
    <P>Seeing that the demographic trends throughout Europe have created opportunities for women to enter, and in many cases to re-enter the workforce, it is important that management notes, that <Col N="58" /> the Minister notes &mdash; and I am sure he has noted &mdash; the positive contribution women have made when they have been given the opportunity to train.  They actually go up the ladder of promotion.  Many of them are involved in trade unions and with more involvement in trade unions I believe they would be less entrenched in traditional attitudes and would be far more positive towards technological change.  They would not be into the old shop steward attitude of job retention and job security at all costs.  They would look to the future and realise that technological advancement would be such that they would move forward even faster than men, because they are not curtailed by entrenched attitudes developed over centuries &mdash; you could say since the Industrial Revolution.  They would tend to be less adversarial and less inclined to retain the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>I would welcome the participation of women on the new Labour Relations Commission.  We know the breakdown of that.  There are six ordinary members to be appointed by the Minister, the line up being two worker members from trade unions, two employer members and two other members appointed directly by the Minister.  I appeal to the Minister today that it is in his hands to give representation to women in his own personal capacity, or else he would emphasise to the other nominating bodies that they include women.  I am not just looking for the token woman; I am looking for equal participation at a time when women are quite a sizeable percentage of the workforce in this country, but unfortunately in the part-time category.</P>
    <P>Rationalisation has been referred to. Being a member of the ASTI I welcome the flag flying of SIPTU &mdash; the ITGWU and the Federated Workers Union of Ireland.  They are now well established as a single union.  They are stable at this stage and other unions will follow suit. As I said the ASTI, the INTO and the TUI have now agreed they will work towards a council of teacher unions.  That is to be welcomed at a time when teachers have always been shown in the more negative aspect of trade unionism.  I do <Col N="59" /> not accept that view at all.  I think when they are called upon they will fly the flag of rationalisation as good as any other sector.  The Minister referred in his introduction to the fact that there is still great need to rationalise trade unions.  We are familiar with the figures: 20 unions represent a small number of workers, less than 500.  We have a small number of unions representing approximately 85 per cent. and the remainder represent the other 15 per cent.  It is a slow process but it is one I am sure the Minister will try to speed up.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill for its thoroughness. It has been long overdue and is long awaited.  I hope the Minister will take the recommendations and the comments into account to make it more effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an excellent Bill and I am very pleased to welcome it. I welcome it, of course, as a Senator nominated by the Confederation of Irish Industry.  The reality today is that we are all in this together.  Whether one is management, so-called, or employee, so-called, or shareholders or whatever one's role in a company or industry, we are in it together; the old-fashioned lines of separation between management and employees are rapidly blurring, and quite rightly so.  Also, the lines of demarcation between shareholders and employees are rapidly blurring.  More and more it is becoming a question of people having a share in a company and also working in it. With present-day standards of education there is a far greater interface, far greater intercommunication, between everyone working in industry or in a company.  If a company is to be successful, if an industry is to be successful, if indeed this country is to be successful in a highly competitive world, with the present-day speed of communications, it is essential that we work together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those companies in which management and those involved in the workforce work together at all levels, or those countries, such as Japan and until recently West Germany, where you have had an effective working relationship <Col N="60" /> between everyone involved, are the companies and the countries which are successful. If there are a series of industrial disputes and so on, in my view that reflects just as much, if not more, on management than on those people who are involved directly in the industrial action.  I would have great sympathy with the philosophy expressed by Senator Harte in this matter, because basically what he is saying is: we are all one integral part.  If we are to succeed we will succeed together; if we are to fail we will certainly fail together.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Jackman said about the role of women in modernday industry and in the business world but I disagree with her where she suggests that it should be a question of having equal numbers.  I agree with her in being against the idea of the token woman. That is an insult to women &mdash; that a token women should be put on this or that board.  Equally, people should be judged on their merits.  If there is a good woman she should get promotion on that basis; if there is a good man he should get promotion on that basis.  There are plenty of good women.  Indeed, in my own company one of the senior executive directors is a woman and on the technical side the senior geologist is a woman.  They both earned it on merit.  If a man happened to be better he would get that place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill from an employer's point of view and again suggest that we should be passing beyond the stage of thinking of ourselves either solely as employers or solely as employees.  We are in this together; we will sink ar swim together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senators who have contributed to this Second Stage debate.  I am pleased that the remarks have been constructive and that the questions raised were fair.  The Bill itself has been through a long debate in the other House.  I thank Senators for coming directly to the point and picking up the major issues of the Bill.  We had for one reason or another a very long Second Stage debate and a three times longer Committee Stage <Col N="61" /> debate in the other House.  The Senators have been following the arguments very well because between yesterday evening, last night and this morning they have come to the core points for or against.</P>
      <P>In thanking Senators for their constructive and broadly supportive comments, I think we can all agree that what we want to see is a better industrial relations climate with the minimum of industrial disputes.  The Bill before the House is designed to put in place a legislative framework which will contribute to the achievement of this aim.  Deputy Harte this morning, in a practical presentation of his life experiences in this area, said it is a pity we have to talk about a continuation of disputes and of disruption.  One of the central parts of this whole Bill is the Labour Relations Commission, which, as a number of Senators has said during the course of this debate goes, really to the heart of the matter, because it gives us the opportunity to do something we have not addressed since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>It is a fact, as many Senators have said, that this Bill is the first real change in industrial relations since the foundation of the State.  The 1969 Act sought to have a more preventative role played by the conciliation service, that they should try to prevent disputes and to follow on where disputes arose.  However, that has not happened.  That is why the whole new structure as envisaged in the Labour Relations Commission is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to reiterate what I said in my opening remarks because it is a very important point.  Legislation is brought forward to the Houses of the Oireachtas by Government Ministers, having been discussed within their Departments with senior officials, with the State Solicitor in some cases, and always with the Parliamentary Draftsman.  This legislation, however, is unique and I will explain why.  Since 1965-66 Governments of all persuasions have had on the agenda industrial relations reform, and all of them were consistent in that they all failed.  Since I was taking up the challenge of bringing forward legislation in this <Col N="62" /> area, I carefully read what all Ministers, starting with our President, who was Minister Hillery in the first Department of Labour, set about in undertaking the task.  After some time the Bill was withdrawn from the Order Paper and every subsequent Minister did the same thing. I think it was Senator O'Toole &mdash; if I am wrong I apologise to the Senator &mdash; who commented that perhaps we should not say that it was in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that this started. While there was work done in the period from 1965 until the 1987 Government, the fact was that when I came into office there has been no meetings for over a year and there had been no agreement on anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation at this stage would not have been possible, and I want to give the credit to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, not to myself, because the difference between this and all the other Bills was that this was the collective view of both employers and trade unions.  I do not think they put this on the record of the other House, but it is important for historians, who will no doubt be following this record.  Being a historian of industrial relations debates in the Oireachtas is a fairly hard job, because you have to go back to 1906 in another administration and then to 1946, 1969, 1982 and now 1990.  The debates in 1969 and 1982 are fairly short.  Senator O'Toole, like myself, has read the 1946 debate.  There are probably not many people in either House who have read it; but it was fairly acrimonious in a number of respects, for a number of reasons, not just the one referred to by Senator O'Toole.  The point I wanted to make was that it was the very last point in the negotiations for the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> That was written in by joint agreement between the trade union movement, led by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and by the Federation of Irish Employers, that these discussions should take place.  That will be important <Col N="63" /> for people in future who have been studying industrial relations since the foundation of the State in 1922.</P>
      <P>The next important thing is this.  I then got permission under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, because of the strength of that programme and the commitments to it, that we would not have to take this legislation in the normal format, that I would be free to discuss the contents paragraph by paragraph with the social partners.  That, as Senators will appreciate, is unique.  If it has a parallel anywhere, I am not aware of it but I am sure it has somewhere along the way because I was not confined to the normal secrecy.  We had perhaps the secrecy of the legal format of wording, but not the secrecy of the contents of the bilateral and trilateral discussions that took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another key point is this.  This legislation is not ideal from any one point of view.  It is not legislation that has an employer stand or a trade union stand. As a result of experiences and the record of failures, the fact that the social partners committed themselves to go through the legislation in this way resulted in compromise on the Labour Relations Commission.  The House will be aware that employers started this debate saying they did not think this advisory service was necessary, but they ended the debate supporting it.  The employers started the debate saying that secondary picketing had to be banned and that they could not see any compromise in that position but they also changed substantially from that. The employers also made the point I made last night to Senator Costello: they saw the position arising that if unions were not following the rules in the legislation all and sundry would have the legal right to go about taking action against them.  That did not happen in the legislation. It is only a trade union member directly involved who has a right to challenge what is in the Act.  That is a very important distinction.  It removes again a large amount of the need for legal recourse.  I agree with all the Senators who made the point, particularly Senator O'Toole, that wherever we can we should <Col N="64" /> remove the legal profession from industrial relations.  It is not that I have anything against the legal profession &mdash; it would be for another day if I was to give all my comments on the legal profession &mdash; but particularly in industrial relations it is a dangerous matter.</P>
    <P>Again, a question was asked today about unfair dismissals and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It is my intention to bring in amending legislation.  We are at an advanced stage in amending that legislation also.  We have had experiences of a simple case of an individual who is being fairly or unfairly dismissed and you require large numbers of the legal profession to come and argue it out in legal format.  That creates great difficulty, not least for the individual.  If a person feels they were doing their best in their day's work, but a supervisor unduly harasses them and, following the argy-bargy, they are dismissed, when they bring a case to try to prove that they were unfairly dismissed they are met by barristers and solicitors, who have voluminous bibles in front of them, arguing case law from 1850 to 1990.  Whatever chance they have of remembering why they were fired or not, by the end of the case they certainly feel that they may be better off to get out of the place.  I am sure every Senator has experience of talking to people who go through this experience.  It is also an unnecessary cost for employers when the employer might actually be right.  I do not think it is a practice employers should get themselves into.  There was always a code and an understanding in industrial relations of how things should be dealt with.  One of the issues that often worries me is this.  If we were to lose those who have been regarded as industrial relations negotiators, the people who, from gut reactions, know how to negotiate industrial relations, and leave it all to experts and professionals, it would be a sad day for this country.  I certainly hope that will not happen.</P>
    <P>The Labour Relations Commission and all we are doing in the Labour Court and in the conciliation service will not in any way add to bureaucracy but will make it a more civilised way of carrying out <Col N="65" /> business.  We should not lose sight of the fact that the great majority of industrial relations issues are settled at work place level &mdash; and I would like to put that on record &mdash; without recourse to the law. This is the way it should be.  When we are talking on a Bill like this we can think there is nothing that can be solved without legislation, but most cases are solved and hopefully will always be solved at the work place.</P>
    <P>The institutional framework provided in the Bill, and practicularly the range of services to be provided by the Labour Relations Commission of the Labour Court, will ensure that every assistance is available to the parties when this is required.  While industrial relations is primarily a matter for the parties involved, the law does have a role to play in providing a framework within which collective bargaining can operate.  I am satisfied that the changes in trade dispute law are long overdue and that they represent a balanced range of measures which take account of the rights and obligations of all sides.</P>
    <P>A wide range of issues was raised by Senators and I will try to deal with some of those questions.  Some of the points are of a more detailed nature and I will have a chance on Committee Stage to explain them in more detail.  Two central features of the trade dispute measures are the provisions in relation to secret ballots and those in relation to picketing. Senator O'Toole questioned the definition of industrial action.  This is important in the context of secret ballots, because to confine the secret ballot requirements to strike action would be much too narrow as other forms of industrial action can be equally if not more disruptive. The Senator, in fairness to him, made the point himself when he said he thought perhaps industrial action in the old traditional way is not as commonly used.  To give an example I used some months ago, because it was a dispute I was involved in at that stage, somebody would say that not to answer the telephone in industrial action is a minor issue and that we should <Col N="66" /> not have to have a ballot because somebody is not going to answer the telephone.</P>
    <P>These are the kind of things that happen.  Some of the things which perhaps were said in debate are unreal.  I do not see us having to have ballots for what people do in their time off.  The strong teachers' lobby in the Upper House need not worry about what they do in their time off, and I do acknowledge that the teaching profession do a lot of work in their time off.  What they do for our national games and in cultural events is probably a major part of the education profession.  However, I do not think we will be having any votes on whether teachers should run the college leagues or the local art exhibitions or anything like that.  We can be fairly sure about that.  Perhaps in time to come there might be ballots about whether teachers' holidays should come more in line with what they are in Europe than what they are in this country, but I certainly will not lead that debate.  I will continue to protect what I think is the due holidays of my teaching colleagues, since we are hoping to start into an equally long holiday, which will not be really a holiday either. I understand that the teachers are not having holidays.  That is an argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Non-answering of telephones and non-opening of letters are major issues.  A whole organisation can come to a standstill if people decide not to photocopy letters, not to use fax machines and not to answer telephones. I only use that example to say that it is not a simple issue to define &ldquo;minor&rdquo; and &ldquo;major&rdquo;.  I suppose this is a good time to outline it.  We had this debate in the other House.  I think Senators would know from reading those debates and from the discussions we have had with the Federation of Irish Employers, the Congress of Trade Unions, legal advisers who were working with the Department on this Bill, the State Solicitor's Office and the Parliamentary Draftsman, that at the end of the day it was not possible to find a definition and it is not possible.  Everything was tried and I appreciate the efforts made by so many people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole knows the efforts of his colleagues in the Congress of Trade Unions, whom I thank for their efforts, because they did try extremely hard to find a definition, but it was not possible.</P>
      <P>The basic principle is that workers have an entitlement to a democratic say in any decision as to whether they should become involved in a strike or other form of industrial action.  I want to emphasise that this is where I came from in this issue.  I have been involved in industrial disputes in one form or another as long as anyone else &mdash; back to the late sixties &mdash; and have been a follower of industrial action and disputes.  I have had an open mind and open views on a lot of disputes, but there is one thing I am very concerned about and convinced of &mdash; and I was throughout all these discussions &mdash; and that is that if a person is going to take industrial action he is entitled under all the laws of natural justice and democracy to have a say in that and he is entitled to use his franchise in that say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of industrial action in the Bill is board, but it does cover the <Col N="68" /> forms of action such as working to rule and that principle.  The definition does not refer to breaches of contract but rather to any action which affects or is likely to affect the terms and conditions, whether expressed or implied, of a contract. It is broadly framed and is not confined to contracts of employment. The usual intention in taking industrial action, whether such action is described as working to rule or go-slow or some other form is to disrupt an employer's operations in such a way as to bring pressure to bear on him.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to the changes in relation to picketing, and in particular to secondary picketing.  Picketing is one of the most controversial issues of trade dispute law with widely different views on the part of trade unions and employers as to what should be permissible. This is particlarly so in relation to the secondary picketing.  As I have said, the employers argue for total outlawing while the unions maintain that in certain circumstances secondary picketing may be necessary to prevent the effects of legitimate industrial action being circumvented.</P>
    <P>I have tried to reach a reasonable balance in relation to secondary picketing. To outlaw completely would, in my mind, tilt the balance in favour of employers. My proposal is to confine protection for picketing at the premises of a second employer to the situation where that employer has directly assisted the employer who is part of the strike for the purpose of frustrating the strike.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator O'Toole who asked what does a second person have to do.  There are two issues in this on which we had a long debate but we got an agreed understanding on the issue.  First, a person must have a belief that the second employer is involved in some way in frustrating the furtherance of the industrial action.  That cannot just be a belief based on nothing.  There must be some reason to believe that employer Y is frustrating the furtherance of industrial action.  It cannot be notional and it cannot be imaginary.  Neither can it be so tight that the worker cannot prove it.  The words in <Col N="69" /> the end were &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; and the reasonable belief based on law is what the common man in the street would understand as being reasonable belief.  It does not have to be some high falutin' legal point.  For example, if, before the strike, there were two lorries a day coming to an industrial plant, the second employer's premises and when the strike begins there are 20 lorries coming in, that would be a reasonable belief.  The workers would be able to say that this second employer is frustrating the strike because it is quite clear that they are involved in doing the order or delivering the goods or in some way by-passing the service.</P>
    <P>The wording used is flexible enough to make sure that a person cannot come in saying: &ldquo;It is my belief that there is a second strike but I have no evidence.  I feel it in my bones because I dreamt it last night&rdquo;.  You cannot get away with that but if he comes in and provides reasonable evidence then that suffices. The employers had some difficulty with that but we have resolved that point. My proposal is to confine protection for picketing at the premises of a second employer to a situation where that employer has directly assisted an employer as part of a strike for the purpose of frustrating the strike.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello also raised the question of moving from an immunities based approach to a positive right to strike.  We had a discussion on that last night.  The Senator asked me to put it on the record of the House to clarify it.  This was proposed by my predecessor but was opposed strongly by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is fair to say that Congress preferred to remain with the present system which, despite its shortcomings, has operated reasonably well since 1906 and because of the various rights and interests affected a positive right to strike would have to balance with a range of duties and obligations if it was to be sure of meeting the test of constitutionality.  Congress wanted to stay on what was a well tested balance rather than move to what could be into a very challengeable area in law.  It was <Col N="70" /> based on that thinking.  In preparing my proposals I took account of the various views which had been expressed by them and opted to remain with the immunity system based on Congress's view on this.</P>
    <P>It would be fair to say, and I think a number of Members in the House would have known, that there were many legal people lining up to try to run juggernauts through the 1906 Acts in various respects. That would have helped Congress in its view.  The legal world again thought that if they were to get a change in these principles, it would be easier for them to change the Act.  The fact that it has not been overturned gives this legislation a lot of power and it would be unlikely to be challenged in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the problems which can arise which constitutional rights come into conflict with each other and questioned why this issue was not addressed in the Bill.  What is provided for is a range of immunities against actions arising from civil torts committed in contemplation or furtherance of trade disputes.  The whole area of constitutional rights is an entirely different field and the balancing of such rights is a matter for the courts at the end of the day.  Senator Kennedy mentioned that while inducement to breach a contract of employment is covered, actual breach of contract is not.  This is because we are talking about two different areas of law &mdash; one is the law of tort and the other the law of contract.  What is provided in the Bill is immunity in the case of a range of torts.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to section 9 (2) which deals with disputes involving individual workers.  What is involved here is removal of immunities where procedures have not been followed.  There is no question of interfering with anyone's right of access to the courts.  I want to thank Senator O'Toole and others who have acknowledged that we did follow the long debate in the other House, made a number of amendments and particularly to this section which I think did improve and has improved the Bill overall.</P>
    <P>On trade union law, a number of <Col N="71" /> Senators raised questions about amalgamation or transfer of engagement and Senator O'Toole declared his vested interest.  I do not know if any other Senator had a vested interest.  To clarify the position, an amalgamation is where two or more unions come together to form a new unions and the amalgamation ceases to exist.  A transfer of engagements is where one union transfers into another union with the receiving union maintaining its identity and the transfer of union ceases to exist.  For the TUI, ASTI and INTO members in the House, that is the position.  In the case of transfers or engagements on amalgamation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>And a few others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of transfer or engagements on amalgamations which succeed &mdash; and this is the important point &mdash; grants are paid after the amalgamation or transfer takes place so it does not really matter.  What we are extending in the legislation, and this could be the crucial point and it certainly is a crucial point for a number of unions, is the fact that no money is paid in advance and there is no time limit involved.  That is the position. The provision we are talking about is to enable grants to be paid here, for whatever reason, the attempt to merge is unsuccessful.  It is necessary to have a time limit in such cases and I feel that a period of two years prior to the breakdown of the merger attempt is reasonable. There is not a time limit in the other case if it is successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 and the amendments of trade union rule books was also raised and the provision of section 15 (1) is intended to facilitate a trade union making it as easy as possible to carry through the necessary amendments to its rules.  It is envisaged that trade unions will generally carry out the necessary amendments in conformity with the rules and in consultation with their members. This section is intended to meet the situation where problems might arise, such as rule book provisions, which may contain <Col N="72" /> new revision arrangements which make it difficult to comply with the two year implementation period.  I think the Senator will be familiar with what I mean.</P>
    <P>We have looked into this but we do not see why it should pose any problems for the Registrar of Friendly Societies and I would like to think that during my period as Minister for Labour we have overcome a lot of the difficulties in that particular area.  I know there are difficulties in the past, but in fairness to that office when in 1989 we dealt with the biggest transfer of engagements and amalgamations since the foundation of the State, the office were extremely efficient.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Costello referred to section 23 which defines the term &ldquo;worker&rdquo; for the purpose of Part III of the Bill and industrial relations generally.  The definition determines those categories of workers who have access to the Labour Court, the Rights Commissioner and to the new Labour Relations Commission.  The section makes no change to the present definition which is spread over a number of pieces of legislation.  We are simply taking the opportunity in the Bill to bring together the various provisions covering the definition of worker and consolidating them for ease of reference.  That is all that is happening.</P>
    <P>There was considerable pressure on Committee Stage in the Dáil to amend the definition in order to allow access to the Labour Court and the Rights Commissioner for those covered by the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  As I explained then, any movement in this area is a matter for agreement between the parties to the various schemes and the section contains provision enabling the Government to amend the definition by order should agreement be so reached. That is a positive step that will help in making progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Another question raised was access to third party machinery for non-arbitral issues which is often the difficulty.  Since we started on the First and Second Stages of this Bill, considerable movement has been undertaken in the negotiations between the Department of Finance and <Col N="73" /> the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration schemes in this particular area.  The official side put proposals to the staff side and the Department understand that progress can be made in this area.  The matter can be dealt with by changes within the conciliation and arbitration schemes and would not require any amendment to the legislation.  In the other House last week on the completion of the Report Stage I outlined the progress that had been made.  It was welcomed in the other House and I know Senators would welcome it, but I think that in recent months we have made a lot of strides in what were long and protracted negotiations on conciliation and arbitration schemes and the proposals put forward by the official side are a long way from what was the position.</P>
    <P>I have acknowledged that the work of the Congress of Trade Unions in raising this matter and the debate we had in the House was a good day's work and helped in moving this particular issue forward.  In particular I would like to acknowledge the efforts of Phil Flynn from the Local Government Public Services Union who, with his union and his executive fronted this over a number of years at their annual conference.  There are benefits to all conciliations and arbitration schemes and generally to the non-arbitral items which at the moment cannot go to a Rights Commissioner but will now be looked at within the context of their own conciliation and arbitration schemes.  They will have, as Senator O'Toole was arguing last night, a place to go with their issues.  Turning to the broader industrial&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What has been decided with the agreement of the unions is that the official side proposals will be further discussed directly by ICTU hoping to come to a compromise.  This covers this <Col N="74" /> whole area of dual access, who goes to court, who goes to conciliation and arbitration and what happens to people who have no recourse under conciliation and arbitration.  I can say this and hopefully it will be agreed &mdash; I think a lot of movement has been made &mdash; an attempt has been made that items that would be non-arbitral under the conciliation and arbitration scheme, which is really where small issues can become major issues, would be some recourse to Rights Commissioner Service within the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Otherwise, as Senator O'Toole would appreciate, it could get into very stormy water because if you had, as was requested in some of the amendments in the other House, a non-arbitral item under the conciliation and arbitration schemes and it was allowed to go to a Right Commissioner, since the Rights Commissioners' decisions can be appealed to the Labour Court, you try to get third party intervention through the Rights Commission, and you could end up having that appealed and you are back in the Labour Court.  That is not the way to resolve it.  What seems to be the way &mdash; and I think they are moving that way in that direction &mdash; is that non-arbitral items would have recourse to a third party within the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for letting me explain that because it is an important fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, it is my intention that the commission will be established and in operation before the end of the year. Deputy Cosgrave asked about those points.  I agree that it is important that the commission, while it is a small body, should have adequate resources and that part of its staffing should be drawn from the existing conciliation service of the Labour Court.  There are provisions in the Bill to enable recruitment or appointment of additional posts which would probably be necessary.  I would emphasise that the commission is not intended to be a layer of bureaucracy but rather a proactive body which will enable the primary responsibility for dispute resolution to be shifted back to where it belongs &mdash; the parties themselves.  That <Col N="75" /> is why it is necessary to have a small Labour Relations Commission and a small group, and not a large committee. I agree with Senator Cosgrave on that.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna referred to the important role the commission will have in dispute prevention as distinct from dispute settlement, which is a very important point.  I see it performing this role through the advisory service and through the development of a code of good industrial relations practice.  A number of Senators raised the point about the codes of practice.  An important aspect of this preventive role is that it can be performed in a relatively calm atmosphere away from the immediate heat and conflict of industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman raised a point &mdash; it is a point I made here this morning and I agree with her.  I have been in the office of Minister for Labour for practically three and a half years but I have been involved between being spokesman and executive of the unions for 21 years, and almost without exception unfortunately, it is the same files and the same issues that are always raised.  The disputes come and go, and it is always fire brigade action.  The Labour Court is called, the Minister is called, the conciliation service is called and everyone gets involved.  There are motions and adjournments in both Houses and there are Congress meetings. Then the strike is over and everyone goes away but the same time next year &mdash; the holiday weekend when the weather is fine, or Christmas week, or depending on the dispute &mdash; it will come up again, and fire brigade action will start all over again. Again we have this merry-go-round, and the only thing that changes is that when the country is in deep recession the employer takes the hard line and when the country is in relative prosperity the union takes the hard line.</P>
    <P>The hope of the Congress of Trade Unions, the Federation of Irish Employers and all the related organisations from employer and union sides is that the Labour Relations Commission will be a different kind of organisation. A number of Senators have asked me <Col N="76" /> what type of commission it will be.  The members of this commission will sit down and look at what has happened in a particular dispute.  They will do all they can to resolve this company's part in the merry-go-round and perhaps will suggest better procedures, better management, or, as Senator Jackman said better personnel procedures.  It is a fact of life that there are mad shop stewards and there are difficult trade union leaders but it is equally true that bad management, or the lack of management or the lack of management training causes industrial disputes.  If one has to be involved it is preferable to deal with a tough union official who is well versed, who knows his business and a tough management who know where they stand but if you have a trade union official who is &ldquo;off the wall&rdquo; and a manager who does not know what he is at, it is unresolvable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of consultation which was raised by Senator Cosgrave, the Bill provides for consultation with the social partners in appointing a chairman, two members of the commission will be trade union nominees, two will be nominated by the employers and two will be nominated by the Minister.  These consultations and nomination arrangements are provided for in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.  I agree with the point made by Senator Jackman and it is always my practice to try to ask the nominating bodies to make sure that both sexes are represented.  It is important that there should be joint representation.  It is a hard battle sometimes and there are no <Col N="77" /> worse offenders than the trade union movement.  I will have to check the record of the teaching unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is difficult but I will not go into it.  John Carroll gave an example which other trade unions should follow when he recently had to pull out of the panel of the Employment Appeal Tribunal on leaving SIPTU on his retirement. He is fulfilling other important functions.  He made it mandatory on the trade union movement to appoint an able, capable women to the post.  I had had previous rows with them because they would not do it and this is something with which we have to continue to battle. It is proper to highlight this matter and I will continue to do what I can.  I know Senator O'Toole will also do what he can.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked how the assistance of the commission can be sought in particular circumstances.  The Bill makes it clear that either of the parties can seek the involvement of the commission and the commission is also empowered to offer assistance on its own initiative.  I mentioned in my speech last night a list of the areas that may be covered by codes of practice.  This list is by no means exhaustive and the Labour Relations Commission, when established, can consult with various interests to select other areas.  I wish to make it clear that I am not setting down what the codes of practice should be; that is a job for the commission. They have the freedom in the legislation to go into different areas.  I just gave as an example some of the issues I thought might be useful, but certainly that is not the agenda.</P>
      <P>It is the intention that the codes of practice will be drawn up in consultation with the social partners who will ensure the code has broad acceptability.  That is important from the employers' point of view.  There is no good having codes of practice if they do not stand up and it is particularly important that they have status in law.  Even though they are codes of practice, they can be used in evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have attempted to cover the wide <Col N="78" /> range of issues referred to by Senators but perhaps there are a few points I missed.  I hope I dealt with the commission at length.  Senator Neville mentioned the 1,000 membership provision which relates to the establishment of new unions.  That does not affect the existing unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Staff associations would have exempted body status, which is the title they have.  Most are negotiating bodies.  They have in law exempted body status and they will continue to have their position.</P>
      <P>I have argued strongly to get money for amalgamations.  I accept that small trade unions have excellent people at the helm; I know all the general secretaries and I know their commitment.  However, they have to recognise the sophisticated challenges they all face in the future.  It is not just a case of fighting employers but keeping up-to-date with their own trade union structures, with what is going on in ETCU, with providing the kind of services that people want.  Senators who have been involved with trade unions know it is no longer about pay and conditions; a union leader now must look at insurance, they must look at extended services for their members and it is impossible for a person to do that for a few hundred members.  Rationalisation and amalgamation will have to be the order of the day.  That is the road we have to travel.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of psychiatric nurses was a major issue.  In the early fifties both groups of nurses were given the option; general nurses opted for the conciliation and arbitration system and psychiatric nurses opted for the other system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I covered the question of picketing at multi-employer locations in my opening address.  A number of Senators mentioned this aspect.  The wording of the Bill is designed to ensure that the picket is at the place of business of the individual employer rather than at the entrance to the complex.  A saver is provided to cover <Col N="79" /> cases where the owner of a complex is not prepared to allow pickets to enter the complex.  This is necessary in the case of private property rights and in order to avoid action being taken.  I am trying to reach the point where a picket will be placed at a person's place of work, not their home and not at a second employer's place who has no involvement. If you have an industrial estate and the owner of the estate for one reason or another refuses to allow a picket, if I did not put in the saver I would be saying that a picket could not be placed.  I was not prepared to do that.  There was a lot of pressure put on me by organisations to keep it tight.  I am not opening up a loophole.  All I am saying is that where somebody, for property rights or some other bogus reason, says you cannot picket at the individual place, then in that case the union is allowed to picket at the entrance to the premises.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Senators would wish me to go into more detail on the Labour Relations Commission.  I know many of the amendments have been discussed, not only at length in the other House but also discussed in a unique way between the social partners.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record my appreciation of the Seanad.  I wish particularly to acknowledge the time and effort put in by the Federation of Irish Employers, the employer organisations and the people who sent in submissions and who worked hard on this Bill.  I am aware that a number of organisations have followed the progress of the Bill; I know that people in the Gallery followed this Bill closely during the debate.  I am aware that non-Congress unions, particularly the IBOA and people from the professional services unions, followed the progress of this Bill.  I wish to put on record that I have taken their views and their submissions into account.  They would know and respect the positions that we have on this issue.  The ICTU represent the vast majority of workers in the State, they hold that prime position. It is perhaps not appropriate, but it is a view I hold that all these bodies will one <Col N="80" /> day be in ICTU and then you will have a united front.  However, that is a matter for another place.  Their views have not been forgotten.</P>
    <P>I want to acknowledge that they have followed the Bill closely and have sat for hours listening to the Dáil and Seanad debates on it.  It must be acknowledged that they have done that.  I want to commend the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers who from the autumn of 1987 right up to when this Bill was published in the first few days of December, gave an inordinate amount of time and discussion on the various sections.  Using their legal advice and the State's legal advice, I think we have come to a very good compromise.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Seanad for allowing me the time for what has been a fairly long Second Stage debate.  Because of the difficulty of the time lapse on amendments, I went into it in more detail than I normally would.  I do appreciate the kind remarks and the probing questions that were asked and I hope I have answered as fully as possible and given due respect to the Seanad.  I always do when I am here.  I like to do what Senators ask, to stay here and to listen carefully and to take on board the views expressed. I always find the debates in this House very useful and very helpful for myself as well as for industrial relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;but does not include a member of the Defence Forces or of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The intent of this amendment is to include the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána in the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo;.  I feel it is inappropriate to have those sectors of the Defence Forces excluded from legislation which gives trade union rights.  I have always considered that there were three central sectors of the security force &mdash; the Garda, the Army and the prison officers &mdash; involved in the overall security of the country and of the institutions of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this legislation we have tightened up very considerably the procedures for industrial action, not just strike action but all types of industrial action.  Indeed, one of the bones of contention has been that the interpretation and the extensiveness of the terms of industrial action are virtually all encompassing in relation to any trade dispute.  Developments have taken place in other European countries, most notably the Scandinavian countries, where virtually all rights that are granted to normal trade union workers are extended to the security forces as well. The Army have rights in relation to industrial action.  Indeed, the prison officers in <Col N="82" /> our own country have full rights in the context of industrial action.  As I said in the context of tightening up procedures in relation to when, how and where industrial action can take place, and in the context of the new Industrial Relations Commission where a new procedure in terms of review and monitoring is being introduced, and in terms of prevention of industrial action, a new code of practice is to be introduced.  There are very tight procedures now to be followed.  At this time we should look again at these workers and they are workers in the normal dictionary term of the word but not for the purposes of this legislation dealing with trade union law and trade disputes.  I would ask the Minister to consider accepting this amendment and to extend the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; to the Garda Síochána and to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On this issue which strikes very close to the heart of organised labour, there has been a view since the foundation of the State that the Garda or the members of the Defence Forces were in some sense different from other workers.  Of course, they are in as much as they are dealing with the security and defence of the State &mdash; that makes a lot of sense &mdash; but time has moved on.  We are part of Europe.  In my experience in many countries of Europe, the Defence Forces are entitled to be members and affiliated and associated with the trade union centre in their country.</P>
      <P>Recently, I attended a seminar on drug abuse in Strasbourg where there were representatives from different trade union movements.  Two representatives from the German area were policemen. I do not see any reason for excluding the Defence Forces and the Garda from the functions of this particular Bill, although I know there was a need for it at some stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have in this section in the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; which is a reflection of another time and another age.  It is no longer appropriate.  It is no longer relevant.  Of course, I believe that the Garda and the Defence Forces would <Col N="83" /> never have quite the same levels of freedom, because of the sensitive nature of their work, as other workers and they would agree with that view.</P>
    <P>I have a special interest in the Garda Representative Association.  My father was a founder member and still works with the GRA.  For that reason, I see them go through precisely the same type of development, face the same problems, address the same issues and represent their workers and members in precisely the same way as I would do for teachers, or other trade unionists might do for other groups.  This exclusive definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; is no longer appropriate in the last decade of the century.  I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition that is used in this Act is that effected by the passage of the Trade Dispute (Amendment) Act, 1982.  It covers all persons employed with the exception of the Garda Síochána and members of the Defence Forces.  It is a factor of industrial relations in this country.  There are two issues involved; there is the issue of representation and how they are represented in so far as they are covered on issues of pay and conditions and other matters.  They have that freedom.  They are covered for that, but the definition in the section we are talking about here is the definition used in relation to industrial action &mdash; which would entitle people to take industrial action.  Neither the Army nor the Garda are arguing to be excluded from that. They do not see it as part of their remit. If they see it in those terms they have not done so in the time this Bill was around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer now to the European scene. The provisions of the Council of Europe &mdash; the European Social Charter, which is a major charter for all workers in the European context and is a modern charter &mdash; specifically excludes the Garda and the Army.  I assure Senator O'Toole that we are in no way behind the European regulations.  We are right up to date.  For that reason, I would not include the Garda or the Army in this definition.  I <Col N="84" /> would not like it to be thought that this amendment, which did not arise in the other House but, more importantly, in the debate, is not an issue.  The Garda and the Army are anxious to have their representative bodies.  The Garda have had a representative body for many years.  As Senator O'Toole, said his father was involved in that.  They have a very successful organisation and the Army now have just formed a representative body.  What is being sought here is something that was not envisaged and I have to reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister address the question of why the prison officers have been granted the status of workers?  Certainly, they are not specifically excluded, as are the other two sectors. How does the Minister differentiate between that section and the Defence Forces and the Garda?  While it may be true that they have not specifically sought these rights in relation to the industrial action, the Minister has not expressed an opinion as the desirability of such a course.  Should we, at this point, consider the developments that have taken place here or elsewhere?  While the Council of Europe may not specifically include any reference, or may exclude such reference in relation to member states, there are other states in Europe which have given these rights to their Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly perturbed when we were discussing the new defence legislation in relation to the setting up of a representative body that there was a specific reference that we should not countenance members of the Defence Forces to get together in a collective group in the context of trade union action.  If I remember correctly, the word &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo; was used in that Bill if someone was responsible for persuading another person to become part of a trade union.  I am not happy with our position. On the one side we have legislation which has recently been enacted which was antitrade union.  I would like to see the Minister for Labour explaining the position of the Department and giving any good reasons &mdash; other than it has been the <Col N="85" /> practice that they have not been included &mdash; why we should not change the situation at this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to make it clear, there is a distinction that I have not made. The Garda and the Army are seen as of particular status in the security of the State.  They are involved in all the day-to-day external and internal dealings with subversives on a nationwide basis.  Prison officers are in our prisons, which is important. There has been a distinction there for a long time.  The Senator would know that I am as supportive as possible and was involved at certain levels in the discussions with the Army in getting the recent structures.  I have always been supportive of the structures which the Garda have, but to countenance strikes by the key elements of our security forces would be unthinkable.</P>
      <P>Because of their constitutional position, in my personal view, in the view of my Department and in the Government view, Army personnel could not be included in the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in the context of industrial action.  It would be very bad legislation.  They have a special and important position as regards the security of the State and it is a very respected position.  I could quote the Constitution on that point.  In my view, even if it was not a matter of custom and practice also, it would be inappropriate to include them in the context of strike action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 12 to 18 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;industrial action' means any action taken by any number or body of workers, acting in combination or under a common understanding, which involves a partial refusal to work or a refusal to carry out work or provide services normally carried out, or provided, within the terms of their contract of employment, but does not include a refusal to carry out work or provide services which, if carried out or provided, would frustrate a strike or industrial action engaged in by others;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The whole area of industrial action and what exactly is meant by industrial action is central to this legislation.  The purpose of this amendment is to try to tease out more clearly what we are concerned with in the context of industrial action &mdash; what is meant, what is covered by it and what is not covered by it.  That is the purpose of the previous section.  It does not include a refusal to carry out work or provide services which, if carried out or provided, would frustrate a strike or industrial action engaged in by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be a major issue in the trade union movement and legally as to how to define industrial action &mdash; what precisely is covered by it, what is the extent of the parameters etc.  It is important that in the legislation we define it as clearly as possible.  The Minister went into it in some degree today and in the other House as well.  I am not sure that the terminology used is sufficient to describe <Col N="87" /> it.  This might be a better way of describing it and would be a more comprehensive description of industrial action.</P>
    <P>The other amendment, which is also on industrial action, relates to the secret ballot in section 14 &mdash; that we would delete the clause &ldquo;or other industrial action&rdquo;, so the unions shall not organise, participate in, sanction or support a strike without secret ballot.  Of course, that is the other central issue.  Having defined what industrial action is, we should try to determine what shall be the extent of the operation of the secret ballot, whether it will be for a petty matter, a trivial matter, a major matter, a local issue or a national issue.  We have already gone over in very considerable detail the dangers of this section and noted that what it will do, as at present worded, is impose a very considerable onus on a trade union in relation to all its industrial actions.  None of us has any objection to the principle of the secret ballot, but we do have problems about the operation of a secret ballot on as broad a base as is suggested here.</P>
    <P>The Commission of Inquiry was set up in 1978 and reported in 1981.  I have traced a number of their recommendations in this legislation, but they did not recommend the extensive powers in the context of the secret ballot.  In fact, they did not envisage the secret ballot being used where there was a small number of workers involved in the context of the trade union generally.  They envisaged that local actions or token actions or initial stages of industrial action could be undertaken without having to go through the quite enormous process that a secret ballot entails.  The timescale is considerable when all the procedures are entered into between organising the meetings, the branch meetings, printing the ballots, the postal ballot, the return of the ballots, the counting, the collection of the ballot, the material then to be sent out to the members to be informed of it, the employer to go to the courts.  We are talking about a very considerable time-scale. I estimate that it would take in the <Col N="88" /> region of four weeks; so we are talking about a small matter that is being turned into an enormous procedure.  That is the biggest problem I have with this section. The section is good in theory and principle but it imposes an unacceptable level of responsibility on a trade union in relation to any form of industrial action. Of all of the amendments I have down to this Bill, this amendment, if it was accepted, would improve the legislataion to the greatest extent.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the Minister is not prepared to make a distinction between something as ultimate as strike action &mdash; which is the last resort process &mdash; and other forms of industrial action.  If he does not differentiate between the two, as he is not doing in the Bill at present, I can easily prophesy that we are going to have an enormous number of wild cat strikes and activities where members are simply frustrated by these procedures which constrain them and put them into a straitjacket.  I urge the Minister to take on board this amendment particularly and also to look again at the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 12 to 18 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;major industrial action' means any action which affects, or is likely to affect, the terms or conditions, whether express or implied, of a contract and which is taken by any number or body of workers acting in combination or under a common understanding as a means of compelling their employer or to aid other workers in compelling their employer to accept or not to accept terms or conditions of or affecting employment and which has the effect of significantly disrupting the business;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with quite an amount of what Senator Costello said.  There is a danger in the definition because it is obviously difficult, in six lines, to say exactly what we are hoping to see in operation.  There is no doubt definitions <Col N="89" /> are difficult.  Perhaps we could strengthen the legislation by having the procedures take effect only where there is obviously a major industrial action, as we have in our amendment.  This morning the Minister referred to a danger in relation ot trivial matters, but I do not think he envisages it as being part of the whole system of putting section 14 into effect. If there are codes of practice drawn up by the commission, perhaps some of these things can be avoided.</P>
    <P>The definition in section 8 gives rise to a danger that one could find oneself in difficulties, particularly in relation to trivial matters, but which could still come within the scope of that section.  The Minister might expand on the difficulties as he sees them.  How can he ensure that trivial matters will not be included?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting Senator Cosgrave, it is important to qualify industrial action as stated in section 8.  If we do not do so, we will leave the interpretation, or maybe the lack of interpretation of this section open to people on the shop floor and to people charged with industrial relations responsibilities. The outcome may very well be a proliferation of unofficial disputes as union officials endeavour to do what they see as their duty to comply with the terms of this Bill, and insisting on doing so even though matters are seen to be trivial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what the Minister said on Second Stage.  It is difficult to quantify or to detail what a major or a minor industrial action is.  In industrial action, one area might be major and another area might not.  In fact, if one is talking about one of the companies involved in the mail order business, the opening of an envelope or the failure to open an envelope might be major industrial action, but in a small company with little correspondence or in another type of business, it would be of no significance. We must leave it to the people directly involved with each dispute to decide the issue.  By amending this Bill to refer to major industrial action, we will be allowing the people directly involved to interpret the situation on the ground as they <Col N="90" /> see it and allowing the new Labour Relations Commission, if there is a dispute, to interpret it as well.  Within the codes of practice that have been suggested, hopefully for different types of employment, they may be able to have different interpretations and definitions of what is &ldquo;major&rdquo; and what is &ldquo;not major&rdquo; industrial action.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands ties the situation down to industrial action.  I feel that the industrial relations area is always fluid, always involved with negotiations, discussions and eventually agreements.  We must allow industrial relations to find its own level.  I believe that by accepting our amendment the door will be opened to allow the people directly involved in the area &mdash; the unions, their members and the management &mdash; to come to terms with what is accepted as major action in their circumstances.  I ask the House to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question is how do you determine what is major and what is minor.  You cannot be definitive in terms of this.  If you start including certain areas and excluding others, you will have extreme difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Minister this morning, when replying to the Second Stage debate, mentioned telephones specifically and said in certain organisations if the union decided not to answer telephones, not to open post and that sort of thing, it would have major consequences in some sectors.  It may not be all that important in other areas but certain organisations are totally dependent on those areas.  Therefore, how do you determine what is major and what is minor?  In actual fact, it will be up to the unions to determine exactly how they will operate it in the first place. If you want to set down a definitive yardstick and criteria by which they are run, you are really affecting the unions and you are limiting them to organise for their own situation.  The reply given was a very good argument why the amendment should not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The interpretation of industrial action, because it is now <Col N="91" /> enshrined in the legislation, will be done by the courts eventually.  It will be challenged at some stage when a dispute arises in some area and the courts will then determine what is industrial action. They will not be liberal in their determination. Anything that will not comply with what management want on the floor, regardless of its merits, is likely to be interpreted as industrial action.  That is fraught with great dangers for the whole industrial area.  It is fraught with dangers for management as much as for unions. It will tie the union officials' hands and will create the situation where people will lose confidence in the union and will engage in unofficial disputes because their union cannot back them without a ballot.  It will allow for a very bad situation in the industrial relations area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I made some comments about this earlier.  It is an important issue. Taking the last points first, it is our job in the legislation to determine what is industrial action.  That is precisely why were do not include &ldquo;minor&rdquo; and &ldquo;major&rdquo;.  What could happen then is that someone would have to go to the courts to define &ldquo;minor&rdquo; and &ldquo;major&rdquo;.  We have had much of argument about this.  If you put in &ldquo;major&rdquo; and &ldquo;minor&rdquo;, nobody could decide what it was.  It would have to be sent to the courts, the Senator's very point in reverse.  You would have to accept it and you would then have to find out what does the Industrial Relations Act, 1989 mean, what is &ldquo;major&rdquo; and what is &ldquo;minor&rdquo;?  Senators would know from the record of the other House that the most eminent people in industrial relations law were involved on one side or another on this amendment.  The definition worked out following those discussions was broad, because you cannot narrow it.  If you try to narrow it, you are into all the vague areas.  That is one important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second important point that has to be made is why is industrial action and why is the definition there in the first place.  It is a protection for workers.  I stressed this three or four times already <Col N="92" /> in the House but I notice that each time Members are replying they either missed the point or do not understand the point. This is protection for workers and the only people who can challenge the trade union movement are the individual workers.  The employer cannot come in. This is a protection mechanism.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to Senator Costello's point.  Let us take the example of a row over whether the cups in the canteen are blue or white.  Many hypothetical cases have been put on the record of the Houses but I will play the game and give another hypothetical case.  I do not think we will get any worker in the Irish workforce who will go off to the High Court and take an action because the cups were blue or white.  I really do not think that will happen, say 20 weeks later, because these procedures were not completed, half the workforce were made redundant where would be their rights, what protection would exist for the workers?  What we are proposing is for the protection of workers and has to be understood, in that regard.  If this definition was narrow it would be directly against the interests of the trade union movement and they have accepted that.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the definition proposed by Senator Costello for a number of reasons.  The amendment is imprecise and confusing.  Secondly, it contains a number of internal contradictions and inconsistencies; for example, what is a partial refusal to work and what are services &ldquo;normally provided&rdquo;?  The definition is also very restrictive and excludes many forms of primary action as well as secondary and tertiary action.  I doubt if Senators would really advocate such a broad range of exclusions which would embrace many forms of serious and disruptive action from the scope of the balloting provisions.  I will repeat it for Senator Cosgrave.  If the Senator followed his own argument, we would open up the whole area of secondary picketing while, in the other House, his party argued strongly that I should close off other loopholes.</P>
    <P>A definition such as proposed by the Seanad might not be in the best interests <Col N="93" /> of the trade union movement for the reasons I have outlined.  The provision in the Bill in relation to injunctions applies only in the case of strikes and industrial action as defined.  This would not apply to any form of industrial action falling outside these definitions.  It is important to bear in mind the principle which underlines the secret balloting provisions of the Bill because they are linked, as Senator Costello said &mdash; he is correct in that &mdash; namely, that workers have an entitlement to a democratic say in any decision as to whether they should become involved in a strike or other forms of industrial action.  It is their protection and that is why the definition is there.  That is why they are allowed to take action.  That is why employers are not allowed to take action.  That is why I excluded them and that is why the FIE probably fought so hard for it.  They do not have that right, they cannot force a case in this.  It is only an individual worker.  I do not think that anyone would disagree with the principle of secret ballots or that anyone could seriously argue that the secret ballot should be confined to strikes.  Other forms of industrial action are equally serious and disruptive.  That has been proved time and time again.</P>
    <P>Having established the importance of the basic principle of democracy through secret ballots, we enter into very dangerous territory if we start to qualify the principle by saying that the secret ballot should be required for some forms of industrial action but not for others. Senator Cosgrave asked me what my thinking on this was.  It is precisely that, I feel that problems could result from accepting the second definition of industrial action proposed.  It is not always clear beforehand what effect any form of industrial action will have, whether it be major or otherwise.</P>
    <P>During negotiations on this I have had the benefit of people who have been involved in industrial relations for 30 years and varous court cases on issues like this but there has not been, since the foundation of the State, a definition of &ldquo;major&rdquo; and &ldquo;minor&rdquo; because what is <Col N="94" /> minor at the start can be major after a while.</P>
    <P>Many disputes have started on the most minor of issues but they arouse bitterness, other issues are drawn into it and then you end up with a major dispute. You cannot write into the definition what is minor and major on week one of the strike, what is minor and major on week two of the strike, what is minor and major on the final ballot of the strike and what is minor and major at the end of the strike.  There is never a situation where a strike starts and keeps on the same even keel and finishes at the same even keel. It never happens that way.  You can go up to the Labour Court, spend a few hours there, hear conciliation cases and read the orders.  They develop from minor to major, to a more serious state and then perhaps to closures.  I ask the Senators to accept that point.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;major industrial action&rdquo; is entirely subjective and could give rise to great problems of interpretation. Would it cover work to rule, would it cover a ban on overtime, would it cover a go slow?  I am putting this question to the Senators who are putting the amendment forward.  What does &ldquo;significantly disrupting the business&rdquo; mean?  The reality is that almost all forms of industrial action disrupt business to a considerable extent and that is why &ldquo;significantly disrupt business&rdquo; is of little use.  For these reasons I feel we should stick to the definition set down in the Bill as drafted.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 9 it is my intention that the provisions in relation to secret ballots will apply to other forms of industrial action as well as to strikes. Action short of full strike action can often be as damaging as the disruption caused by strikes.  It can be more difficult to resolve and we have had experiences of that recently.  It is, therefore, essential that this type of action should be subject to the secret ballot provisions.  It is my understanding that it is already normal practice for unions to ballot their members on proposals for many forms of industrial action short of strike action.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have gone on for some <Col N="95" /> length.  I am conscious that some of the Senators have missed some of the points I have made at the start but for their benefit I will reiterate that it is the protection for the workers, and it is the worker, not the employer, who will be taking the action under the &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; definition.  Senator O'Toole raised some points on it last night.  If it is a minor argument it does not matter.  It is not the employer who is trying to enforce that there should be a ballot because it is the worker who has the protection.  It is only if the worker feels aggrieved about it that the action is taken.</P>
    <P>I will answer another point Senator Costello raised last night in the case; namely, would he have to have a full meeting of all the members of ASTI?  If there were to be a ballot it would only be those directly affected.  Those are the words that are used throughout the Act so it would be the people in one school. If you had a 10 or 20 teacher school, they would be the people directly affected.  If it was a branch of one of the banks it would be the people involved in that branch.  It is only if it is a national strike that it would be the whole group.  It is the workers directly affected.  That is the reason this definition, following long discussion and legal consideration by all sides involved in this, was regarded as the most appropriate definition to have in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to labour the point still further.  No matter what we say, at the end of the day it is six of one and half a dozen of another.  In either case people will have to resort to the courts at the end of the day.  The Minister today spoke about the voluntary activities of teachers.  We do not know what pressure would be put on by an employer in such a situation, where we might have a secret ballot in that situation.  It is one that the Minister felt would not happen but he just does not know.  Would the Minister not think that the last line there &ldquo;which has the effect of significantly disrupting the business&rdquo; is fairly specific?  I listened carefully to the Minister and he <Col N="96" /> said three or four times &ldquo;which has the effect of disrupting the business&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;significantly&rdquo; is important.  Perhaps the Minister feels that would be open to legal interpretation but his arguments are logical.  He spoke about disputes ranging from minor to major disputes.  May I raise a hypothetical question? Would it have been possible for the Minister to have specified the range of activities included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for not putting this precisely is that you could not list them.  It is the impossibility of trying to list what is minor to major and how you would shift from minor to major. The employer would not be trying to do that.  It would only be one of the teachers' union members.  It is a protection for the worker so the employer would not be there trying to say &ldquo;you did not apply the procedures&rdquo;.  The employer has no say in the matter.  If someone in the school disagreed with the procedure that person would have to say, &ldquo;I do not believe the procedures were followed and this section says that we really should have had a definition&rdquo;.  If a member of the ASTI went against his or her union because they did not agree with industrial action over what they considered to be a trivial matter and went to court because the procedure for allowing for a secret ballot had not been followed, having listened to all the legal arguments on this for a long time and the legal advice from various quarters, I do not think that person would not get anywhere in court, I am quite satisfied on that.</P>
      <P>May I make two other important points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite happy that this will not lead to a spate of unofficial strikes but there are two things that could happen.  There will be a practice developed and an understanding particularly in the Congress of Trade Unions of how this is interpreted. That is what will happen in many areas and there will be an interpretation which will be the norm.  That does not mean that there will not always be someone who will try and beat that norm.  That is a possibility with all our laws every day <Col N="97" /> of the week.  That practice will develop that will be a logical one that will have a certain code to it, I do not worry about it, because this section has been debated outside of the Houses of the Oireachtas probably more than anything else in this Bill.  Everyone now knows that they have to come to an understanding otherwise there could be some difficulty.</P>
    <P>The other point is also important.  Say a group of workers, for whatever reason, do not follow the procedure and do not have the secret ballot &mdash; Senator O'Toole will be interested in this one in particular &mdash; and they go out effectively on what is official action, they will not lose the immunities.  They will still have their immunities.  Even if all was to go wrong they would still have their protection. That is a very important point and that is the reason I amended that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect the Minister's intentions in this matter that we would have procedures which are as democratic and comprehensive as possible.  The intention of having the secret ballot is to protect the union and the members in the sense that the correct procedures are followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just ask the Senators if they would look at subsection (3), on page 9, of the Bill.  It states:</P>
      <P>The rights conferred by a provision referred to in subsection (2) are conferred on the members of the trade union concerned and on no other person.</P>
      <P>It answers Senator Jackman's point.  It is only the member who can take action on any of these points, not anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the context of the individual citizen's rights, whether he is a member of a trade union or otherwise. That is beside the point for the moment.  Let us accept everything the Minister has said, that the intention of the legislation is to protect the union, to protect the worker who is a member of the union, so that a worker cannot have redress against the union if they go <Col N="98" /> through the procedures and there is a ballot.  That is a fair point.</P>
      <P>Let us accept that the Minister does not want to distinguish between &ldquo;minor&rdquo; and &ldquo;major&rdquo;, because it is very difficult to do that.  However, we still come back to a situation that I am not satisfied has been answered adequately by the Minister, that is, that strike action is a major form of industrial action.  All other forms of action are minor, relatively speaking. Strike action is the ultimate weapon in the trade union movement.  Other forms of industrial action are steps along the course.  That, effectively, is the situation in trade union terms.</P>
      <P>In relation to a strike action, which is such a major event, it is quite proper to have secret ballots, but in the context of other industrial action a secret ballot will cause all sorts of problems because of the procedures that are laid down for the secret ballot.  They are time-consuming, they involve all sorts of mechanisms affecting members, the union, the employer, in the context of information that has to be given, in communications and so on.  This will be a cause of frustration. While the Minister's point is excellent in theory, namely, that we operate in a democracy and the best form of democracy obviously is the secret ballot, nevertheless, the practice leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
      <P>The experience of trade unions is that there is a grey area between industrial action and the ultimate strike weapon. I am not quite satisfied with what the Minister has said in relation to this.  In our union, the ASTI, we have had industrial action this year and we embarked on one form of industrial action, a withdrawal of service and a work-to-rule.  It certainly was not strike action as such but another form of voluntary withdrawal of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that his interpretation of subsection (2) (a) is that it leaves it open for local action to be taken, that the secret ballot will only be taken when it directly affects a school in our case, or presumably a factory in another case, not a wider area, a branch area, a regional area or a national area.  I cannot <Col N="99" /> see how that conforms with the actual wording of the section, because it states:</P>
    <P>The entitlement to vote, which shall be equally accorded to all members whom it is reasonable at the time of the ballot for the union concerned to believe will be called upon to engage in the strike or other industrial action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It will happen in the future, I can assure the Minister.  If they are &ldquo;to be called upon to engage in&rdquo; it leaves it open to interpretation that it is not the immediate people concerned but the members of the union who may be affected.  It is the procedure in my union where, first of all, we invoke local action in a school and we may go from there to a branch action, a regional action and maybe then to a national action.  What exactly is the interpretation of this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation of that is that it leaves it wide open to say that you will have to ballot the people whom it is reasonable at the time to believe would be called upon to engage in industrial action in relation to a matter, whether in this phase of the industrial action or another phase.  The Minister is saying then he is talking about an initial phase, which might be the local phase, where the secret ballot will take place, then there might be an escalation and then there would be a second industrial action.</P>

If you reasonably believe that it is a local phase of the first stage, you have a local vote.  If you then believe it will be a regional stage, it is another phase.  If it happens to drift and you did not reasonably think it would, then you are in trouble.</P>

      <P>We can see the problems in relation to logistics in all of that where in each of the phases you go through a process that will take place in the region taking a month to deal with, and then you go to another month.

      <P>The biggest strike we have had in the past few years in the country was organised and started within 24 hours.  I spent 14 weeks slogging at it. I do not know what way the Senator runs his ballots but I am telling him what happens in the real world.  Between 1,000 and 3,000 people had a ballot and they were out in 24 hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with those sentiments and the necessity to ensure that there is democracy.  The Minister also referred to what will be the outcome of this and we will end up in the context of industrial action where a particular practice will probably develop. A particular practice has developed in my union and in the other teacher unions and it is not wildcat action.  It is graduated action whereby you embark on a token form of industrial action, by and large, you let people know it is a serious matter and there is cooling down period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to agree with the Minister.  There is a distinction between strike and other industrial action.  I presume the Minister has <Col N="101" /> decided that he will leave that section in and that he will not take out &ldquo;or other industrial action&rdquo; without a secret ballot and that the Minister is satisfied, too, that at every stage along the line a secret ballot must take place.  That is the interpretation I take from it.</P>
      <P>I am simply saying to the Minister that I agree with the theory, I agree with the principle, it is democratic, it is proper, but I am telling him that it will cause major problems in both areas, the industrial action being the mandatory subject of a ballot and, secondly, who will be called upon to engage in the industrial action?  For logistic and time-scale reasons these will cause major problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I know something about it.  I have dealt with the precise situation as it is in that legislation for some period of time now.  I have faced with the questions which Senator Costello has raised. They become real questions when one is faced with a rule book or, in this case, the law.  It raises the question he has posed.  In my own union, we have had to interpret our rulebook in this way, that a new phase is a new action.  There is no such thing as an extended action.  Senator Costello is right; it can slow down the process.</P>
      <P>What I like to do in those situations, and I have proposed that it be done three times in the last decade, is to ballot every single member everywhere.  This raises an immediate difficulty.  As the organiser of the industrial action, I can decide any way I wish, by any combination of membership, where I have a majority.  I might have a majority in Antrim and Kerry and in that case I would just pull out those two counties; I mitht have a majority in Athenry and Athlone and pull out those two towns; I might have only one school in Kildare and pull out that school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is that there are as many ways through this legislation via industrial action as there are days in the year.  What is local and what is national and what is neighbourhood is wide open to interpretation. There can be flexibility within it.  There is not necessarily a difference <Col N="102" /> of opinion between the point that Senator Costello raised and the answer the Minister gave but I know from experience that the points Senator Costello raised are real questions.  They only become real questions for a trade union official when he is faced with the decision; am I within my rights in declaring industrial action in that area and how would a court look upon it?</P>
    <P>I am happy with this section.  It now gives the force of law to a practice which I have been happily involved in for quite some time, and that is to take a national ballot, look at the results and then decide where it would be appropriate to take industrial action.  I do not think the Minister intended to do that but it gives that level of flexibility.  Given the right set of circumstances, I could take out the whole country.  That would certainly be part of any process for any period of time.  There will be difficulties but there will also be ways around that part of it.</P>
    <P>The more I listened to the debate on what is industrial action, the more I was convinced of what I said this morning, that this is a lawyer's bonanza.  When is an action industrial and when is it not? If, for instance, an employer by edict says to a group of workers that he is directing them to work an extra hour a week from now on and the employees say they will not do it, and the unions say not to worsen their conditions of service and not to do it, that is an industrial action.  I do not believe it requires a ballot because the common law would be that an employer would not be entitled to worsen conditions of service or contract of a member.  In such a situation, if the work-force decided not to take action where would they stand <i>vis-a-vis</i> this legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Senators raised valid points.  In relation to Senator O'Toole's point I do not mind if the ballot is a national one but what I am concerned about is that there is a ballot.  In many cases trade unions will not have a ballot because it is not the employer who will be taken the action under section 14.  If people look under section 14 (3) they will see that all the rights are conferred on <Col N="103" /> the individual worker.  When Senator O'Toole is at his desk in INTO headquarters asking if he is right or wrong in taking this action, he must ask if he is right or wrong in taking the action in the eyes of his members because nobody else can take him to court.  When the Senator says it will become a legal nightmare, he is saying he will make decisions which will necessitate his own membership taking him to court.  That will not happen. Under section 14 (3) the powers are conferred only on the members.  Once the members are not displeased with the action they will not bring the person to court.  The people who would bring him to court would have to be his own members because under this section nobody else can do it.</P>
      <P>I will make one very important point to Senator Costello.  I take on board many of his views and concerns.  What are the benefits for a union which complies with the regulations properly?  If you have a ballot of the members involved then you are protected.  The employer cannot run out and get a midnight court injunction, or an <i>ex parte</i> injunction.  If you state your fair case neither can he get an interlocutory injunction, so there are considerable benefits.</P>
      <P>Let us look at what happens in industry all the time.  In a dispute, in a battle between employers and workers, not in a battle between unions and their members &mdash; that does happen but not very often although I know there have been some horrific examples of it &mdash; the protection is that a union official directs his local committee to have a ballot.  Unless it has a very big membership they can have a ballot that night if it is urgent.  They give seven days notice and then the employer cannot go out and get an <i>ex parte</i> injunction trying to wrongfoot them or use delaying tactics.  Neither can the employer, if the members state a fair case, get an interlocutory injunction. That is something they did not have before now in law.  It is a considerable benefit and it is seen and appreciated as such by the trade union movement.</P>

      <P>It is not true to say that only the members of the union can take an action.  I was going to develop this point last night but I cannot think of the legal phrases at the moment.  The courts have become far more liberal &mdash; we had an example of it a short time ago &mdash; about who has an interest in a case.  Courts have declared regularly that people might have an interest in a case or in an action which they would not have said ten years ago. Let us take the example of a union wishing to take industrial action in an area. They identify a workplace A in county B where they feel they would have effective industrial action.  Workplace A is the real objective but because of the legislation I am now looking at county B.  The reality is I know I can get a majority of the members of my union in county B to take industrial action on the issue and I put it to a ballot of the members.  All the members of the union are tied in to obeying the directions of the union following the course of events.  The ballot takes place and every single worker in workplace A votes against industrial action. The industrial action I want to take, however, is in county B which includes workplace A.  Now I have complied with the regulations.  I have got a 90 per cent vote in favour of industrial action in the county and I take out that county for industrial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers in the factory are tied in to the rules of the union and will obey them but the owner of the factory might say this is not acceptable because in his workplace the workers voted against industrial action.  He will not know how his workers voted because in the section it says &ldquo;as soon as practicable... the number of ballot papers issued and the number of votes cast...&rdquo;  There is no requirement on me to break down the figures workplace by workplace.  I have looked very carefully at this.  I am acting completely within the law.  I am completely within my rights.  I am getting the effective action I am talking about but there is a very disgruntled employer who says he will get this guy for being a bit too smart with the rules and he takes it <Col N="105" /> to the courts.  He will be able to test it in the courts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 11, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;11. &mdash;Any person shall have the right to peacefully picket any place where an employer works or carries on <Col N="106" /> business or happens to be (other than a home).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals entirely with primary and secondary picketing and is the same as that in the 1906 Act.  Really what the Minister is doing, by and large, is taking on board in section 11 (1) and (2) what was in that Act, with some amendments.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned about is the constitutional provision which entitles every citizen to picket peacefully.  The section states that it shall be lawful only in the context of the trade union movement which, of course, is desirable but it infringes on a constitutional provision which it is not entitled to do.  It is not necessary to delete the other parts of section 11.  While the law can regulate matters in the context of the Constitution, it cannot take them away and it cannot cut off a constitutional right from a citizen as it seems to state here.  I suggest that we add a section on here that would enshrine that constitutional right in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Senator thought this through?  The amendment states: &ldquo;Any person shall have the right to peacefully picket any place where an employer works or carries on business or happens to be (other than a home)&rdquo;.  Clearly at some stage in composing this amendment, it was decided to exclude picketing someone's home.  We would agree that is a form of intimidation.  The amendment seems to go far beyond what any reasonable person would suggest.  The employer might happen to be at a football match, at a social occasion or something like that.  This is an extraordinary amendment and I find difficulty in believing it is meant seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of this amendment would delete section 11 of the Bill which is a very important section. It is one that we amended very substantially in the other House.  I will not <Col N="107" /> go through it line by line.  The section outlines where immunities will apply in relation to both primary and secondary picketing.  Essentially, immunity is confined to picketing at a place of business of a worker's own employer which I believe is reasonable.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Senator Costello is extremely wide because it would allow widespread picketing.  The whole purpose of the section is to define and limit picketing.  I would not accept deletion of the section which would have the effect of widening the whole area beyond what is allowed at present.  The House knows what we are endeavouring to do.  One of the functions of the legislation is to control picketing and define it more tightly.  That would all go in one swoop if we were to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  The Constitution gives the right of peaceful assembly which can be controlled in the public interest.  The courts have limited the right to picket.  Many court cases dealing with industrial relations have been centred on picketing policy.  This defines and controls it and at last trade union leaders, general secretaries, executives and others know where they stand.  Previously there was ambiguity in this area but section 11 makes it clear.  I am concerned about accepting any amendments, never mind one that would abolish the entire section.  I reject the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the amendment is to draw attention to the constitutinal provision which has been interpreted by constitutional lawyers in the context of the right to assembly as giving the right to picket to every citizen. I agree with some of the provisions in section 11 but the constitutional provision is much broader.  I am not sure if it is proper for legislation to restrict it.  You cannot restrict in this fashion what seems to be a constitutional right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the apparent conflict between the Constitution and the restriction that is embodied in this legislation.  I do not see <Col N="108" /> the amendment in terms of having to delete section 11.  I am not opposing section 11, far from it.  The Minister suggests that would be the intention.  My intention is to expand the parameters, to include this extra element which would appear to fulfil that section of the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The right of peaceful assembly can be controlled in the public interest.  Since 1941 picketing has been confined to members of trade unions who hold negotiating licences.  The 1941 Act is important in relation to the constitutional issue.  Up until now there have been arguments about where one can picket.  This section states you can picket at your place of employment and you can picket at a second place if there is direct evidence that a person is frustrating the strike. You have to prove that is the case.  The Senator in his amendment excluded homes and we have also done so.  If the Senator were to follow his line of argument it would mean that if there were a dispute in Senator Conroy's business his employees could be outside the Dáil picketing. I am totally in favour of allowing a legitimate picket to follow an employer who is trying to work with another employer to break a strike but to allow it on a wide scale would cause havoc.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister. if we were to accept that amendment it would effectively delete section 11 of the Bill.  All sides were in agreement on Second Stage in relation to picketing and the difficulties involved in shopping centres, etc.  If you were to define a shopping centre as a place of work because a person was working there and you placed a picket on the entrance to the shopping centre, that would cause difficulty.  If we were to accept that amendment we would be doing away with what is extremely important and progressive legislation.</P>

      <P>There is the constitutional guarantee that citizens have the right to peacefully assemble.  The interpretation that has been put on that by some writers on legal matters is that it covers the area of picketing and, therefore, once it is in the context of communicating a particular matter that covers the area of dispute with an employer, that in a sense the right of the citizen to peacefully picket an employer in the context of the trade union movement is enshrined in a broader sense in our Constitution and rather than allowing that to lapse totally in this context it should be established in the legislation.  I did not intend for the amendment to delete section 11.  I have been told that would be the effect of it is but that is not my intention.  My intention is to expand it to ensure that element of the constitutional right is allowed to remain and to ensure that it is not simply restricted to the particular legal interpretation here.</P>
      <P>While I agree with this legal formulation and have no intention of trying to delete any part of section 11, either on primary or secondary picketing, I am saying there is a broader constitutional principle involved than is stated here.  It is not incorporated in the terms of this provision.</P>

      <P>Yes, and particularly the way it has been interpreted.  What we <Col N="110" /> are talking about here is picketing for the purpose of furthering a trade dispute. These are the rules that apply in those circumstances.  I accept that Senator Costello is not trying to delete section 11 but if I added in his amendment everything else would fall.  However, I accept his arguments.</P>
      <P>What the Senator is attempting to do is to get picketing accepted as something that is connected with the right of association. You could argue about that.  If the constitutional aspect is right, assembly will also give you the right to picket. However, you have then to go back to the 1941 Act which said the right to picket was the right of a trade union member and of a person with a negotiating licence. I do not think we can accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) for the purposes of this section &lsquo;to attend at a place&rsquo; shall include the following:</P>
      <P>(i)  directly outside the actual entrance or entrances to the place of employment, where that entrance or entrances open on to a public place,</P>
      <P>(ii)  directly outside the actual entrance or entrances to a place of employment, where that entrance or entrances open on to a place which is a place normally open to the public but which is private property including ports, airports, shopping centres, industrial estates and other multi-employment locations unless the owner of that private property indicates in writing to the workers concerned that he objects to such attendance on his property,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> (iii)  the nearest approach or approaches to the actual place of employment where either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  an owner of private property indicates in writing his objection as provided for in subparagraph (ii) to an attendance at the actual place of employment, or</P>
    <P>(II)  it is not practicable or possible to attend at a point closer to the entrance or entrances to the actual place of employment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this in his Second Stage speech and I would welcome his further comments.  He talks about protection of the right to property. I want to put a situation to him where a dispute takes place in a small enterprise in a shopping centre.  Under our proposal the union can place a picket unless the owner specifically states in writing that it is not acceptable.  Under the present Act, as I see it, the converse is the situation, the union cannot place a picket in the centre unless they have obtained permission from the owner of the small enterprise to do so.  What employer who sees a union putting a picket on a small enterprise will want to contain it within that when he knows that if the picket is placed on the larger centre there would be more pressure on the union to come to some settlement?  I would welcome the Minister's view on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any great disagreement on this; it is just a question of where we are trying to get to.  I understand Senator Neville and Senator Cosgrave's concern is in moving these amendments.  I know Senator Neville is worried about the question of picketing at multi-employment complexes such as ports, airports, industrial estates and shopping centres as he has outlined in the scenario which he has put before us.  I share his concern in this area and I would like to emphasise that the wording in the Bill was devised with these type of situations in mind, as I referred to earlier.  The present wording will achieve <Col N="112" /> the same end but in a much less complicated way than the arrangement proposed by the Senator.</P>
      <P>The fear has been expressed that the use of the words &ldquo;at approaches to&rdquo; will lead to picketing at the entrances to and approaches to multi-employment complexes but that ignores the words which come immediately before those words, namely, at or &ldquo;where that is not practicable&rdquo;. The test to be applied is whether it is practical in all the circumstances to picket at the individual employer's place of business inside the complex.  Normally it should be possible to arrange that the picket be placed directly at the premises of the employer involved in the dispute. It would only be where the owner of the complex objected to the picketing taking place inside the complex that the saver would then come into effect, that the picket could be placed outside.</P>
      <P>The situation where an employer could choose to exercise his rights to prevent trespass onto his property is clearly recognised in the Senators' amendment and I acknowledge that.  I said already, the Senator and I are in agreement on what we are seeking to do but I am satisfied, following the legal advice of the parliamentary draftsman, that the wording of the Bill will achieve this end in a less complicated way.  For this reason, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment because we have achieved what both of us wish to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a further question.  If the small employer within the centre objected to the picket on the basis that it was on private property, even though he did not own that property, even though it was the property of the owner of the complex rather than the individual employer, would he not have a right under the Constitution to do so and if he took it to court would it not be found to be within his rights as a small employer to object to picketing in private property even though he did not own that property but had an interest in it by way of lease or whatever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, even <Col N="113" /> in that instance the owner would also have to agree because the property rights really only come into play if you are dealing with the owner.  In those circumstances the small employer would not have that right.  However, if he got the agreement of the property owner, then we could not overrule the property owner's rights.  He would have to get the agreement of the property owner. Subject to checking, I do not think that would hold because that is not related to the constitutional position.  It is the property rights that are related to that.  If he got the agreement of the owner &mdash; presumably he is leasing it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, if he gets the agreement of the owner, for example, most of the leases are for 20 or 25 years.  Surely the owner of a lease of 20 years acquires property rights in those circumstances?  Could he not hold he has a right to object to picketing in those circumstances on the basis that it is private property and that he has ownership, even though it is of a lease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure as the Senator says, particularly in a long-term lease, he could establish a property right.  I was thinking more of shops with 12 month contracts, 24 month leases.  I do not think they could establish that.  On a long lease he could establish a property right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>My main concern here is the area of a port.  I am directly involved with Foynes Harbour and we have something like 300 people employed in the port itself.  All of the leases are for not less than 15 or 20 years.  I suggest my amendment will cover that situation and places the onus on the owner, rather than on the employee, to obtain permission as is the case in the Bill.  The Minister is shifting the onus to the employer rather than placing the onus on the employee. In most instances, if an employee in a dispute goes to an owner and asks for permission to do anything, he will be refused.  In particular the owner will refuse permission to picket right outside his door because, quite understandably <Col N="114" /> an employer will try to put as much pressure as possible on a union to compromise or negotiate.  In the case of a port where there are 300 or 400 people employed and there is a small employer employing three, four or five, there is a lot more pressure on a union to settle if they are representing 300 or 400 people than in the case of three or four employees, where they could have a protracted strike.  It would be good tactics from the employer's point of view in a dispute to handle it in that fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Both in an industrial estate and in a port area the other employers would want the owner to allow them to put the picket at the employment of the individual rather than at the entrance of the complex.  That is why &ldquo;at or near&rdquo; is a far better definition.  If they can confine the picket to the premises in dispute, it does not cause overall disruption. That is one point.</P>
      <P>On the other point about property rights, they would have to get the agreement of the owner.  There is considerable case law in property rights.  They would have to establish a property right and it would be questionable whether a lease or rent or agreement would suffice.  I do not think it would.  A property right is ownership.</P>

      <P>The shopping centre is a relatively new concept.  Would the same criteria be used within all those multipurpose, multi-industrial, multi-unit and multi-shop areas?  It might be necessary to tease out the differences as regards leasing and industrial concerns within them.  I am worried about the lack of legislation in certain areas of new shopping centres.  There is considerable worry for owners and management as to who owns what.  In the Limerick area this is a concern at the moment.  Does the Minister think there is sufficient legislation in relation to the new shopping centres? In the case of ports the case is fairly straightforward; in Dublin Port and Docks a situation arose in regard to a protracted industrial dispute.  Shopping centres may need more careful analysis <Col N="115" /> as regards ownership or leasing or whatever, there is the question of the local authority's involvement, whether it is owned by a management, whether it is owned by some mega-developer who lives in another part of the country.  It is rather more complex because it is a new concept.  Perhaps the Minister might give a little more thought to the implications for the shopping centre complex.</P>

      <P>I agree that the point made by the Senator is important.  That is why we have changed the position from what it was, where you could place a picket anywhere at the approaches.  The first objective test in this is: it shall be lawful for one or more persons acting on their own behalf and on behalf of a trade union in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at... &mdash; that is the first part &mdash; or where that is not practicable, at the approaches to, a place where an employer who is party to a trade dispute works or carries on business.  It will be the same now &mdash; just to confirm what the Senator asked &mdash; in any of these multi-disputes the interpretation of this Bill can only be that the picket must be &ldquo;at&rdquo; the place of business.  It is only then, if they have the reason as stated in the rest of section 11 (2) that they go anywhere else.  That will be the rule that will be applied.  That will also be linked into the situation relating to injunctions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (3), line 25, after &ldquo;life-preserving services&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any necessary action by an employer in other essential services covered by regulations made by the Minister after consultations with bodies representative of employers and trade unions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> There are other essential services other than health services.  There could be a situation where the fire brigade or even the members of a local authority could be regarded a very essential service.  Take a case much as we had earlier this year of severe storms where extensive damage was caused.  The Minister is aware of the moneys voted by Government to various local authorities to repair the damage. The local authority in such circumstances could become a very essential service in removing trees, dealing with floods or other difficulties that arise during severe storms.  The Bill should cover such circumstances. The amendment uses the words &ldquo;after consultations with bodies representative of employers and trade unions&rdquo;.  The Minister, after consultation with bodies representative of employers and trade unions should identify these people in such circumstances as being essential services.  Many Senators who are members of local councils will appreciate what I am saying.  Similarly, in circumstances where there is a series of forest fires and in danger of getting totally out of control and there is a strike in the services concerned it should be regarded as an essential service.  We are saying that it should not be confined to the health service, which of course is the most essential service, but should be broader to include life-preserving services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) is included to make it clear that any action taken by the health services to maintain life-preserving services would not be regarded as action taken to frustrate a strike.  It is most unlikely that any court would hold that such action was taken for the purpose of frustrating a strike rather then for the purpose of preserving life. The subsection is designed to put the matter beyond doubt.  I am sure Senators will agree that the health services are a special case and any doubts about this should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment proposed by the Senator, the question of disputes in essential services in general is a much broader issue and one which I do <Col N="117" /> not feel is amenable to regulation in the way proposed by Senator Neville.  To attempt to arrive at any agreed definition of what constitutes an essential service would in itself be a daunting task.  It is not just one or two services, you get into a huge area.  I have constantly taken the view that the best way to cater for the wide range of issues which arise in the context of disputes in esential services is by means of codes of practice.  I referred to that last night on Second Stage and again today.  The drawing up of codes of practice to cover all aspects of such disputes, including the critical issue of adequate levels of emergency cover, is something which I intend to ask the proposed Labour Relations Commission to give priority attention to when drawing up codes of practice for essential services.</P>
    <P>The change proposed would be strongly opposed by the trade union movement and would be counter-productive. I accept the need for what Senator Neville is saying.  I can give the assurance that it is one of the first areas where we intend to get a code of practice. However, to write in essential services generally would prohibit industrial action to a great many workers and that is something that would not be acceptable to the trade union movement.</P>

The health services and life-saving services are very specific but if we were to detail and list a whole range of essential services where would it stop?  That is the difficulty.  You could get into a quagmire because with such a long list inevitably some services that people regard as essential would be left out.  The provision would have to be specific and, if extended, it would include a range of <Col N="118" /> services that some people might consider essential and others might not.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 49 and 50 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iii) the overall result of the ballot.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a matter of some concern to me in the context of what we have already discussed in regard to secret ballot which was dealt with to some degree last night on Second Stage.  The question at issue here is that the democratic process is adhered to in the context of the secret ballot and then as soon as practical after the conduct of that secret ballot the results shall be forwarded to the members in question and that the trade union shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that that is done.  There is a list of the requirements on the trade union, in regard to the number of ballot papers issued, the number of votes cast and then in regard to the two controversial issues as far as I am concerned, the number of votes in favour of the proposal and the number of votes against the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for my reservations about this is that immediately that is done every single member of the union will be aware of precisely what the voting was, whether or not there was a large percentage in favour of the particular form of industrial action, whether or not it was 50.01 per cent, whether it was a very small majority or a massive majority.  That means the <Col N="120" /> trade union leadership then is automatically at a disadvantage because in terms of any large trade union if every single member is informed it is only a matter of time until management or the employers are aware of the position. Therefore, the trade union leadership is at a disadvantage in dealing with the employer because their hand is known immediately and the strength of the membership support for the particular form of action can be assessed immediately. It means, effectively, that the trade union is negotiating with one hand tied behind its back.</P>
    <P>I accept wholeheartedly the Minister's genuine attempt to be as democratic as possible about it and that is the provision the Bill is for the benefit of members and that the members are the people who can take action against the union if democtatic procedures are not followed. However, may I say to the Minister it is sufficient for the overall result of the ballot to be indicated to members.  Do not forget that the wording in sub-paragraph (f) is, as soon as practicable after the conduct of a secret ballot, so it must take place after the ballot has been conducted and, the implication is prior to the negotiations.  The trade union is in that limbo when it is negotiating and it needs all the strength it can get but the employers are not similarly penalised. We do not know, for example, in regard to the employer whether the board of directors had stood firm or otherwise on a proposed course of action.  That information is secret and is not transmitted to the other side.  The effect of this move to democratise is to penalise the trade union and to strengthen the hand of the employer.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to take the amendment on board.  It certainly would be very beneficial in ensuring that the playing field remained level during the course of the negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to disagree with the Senator there.  He mentioned the union would immediately be at a disadvantage in relation to the negotiations <Col N="121" /> with the employer but as I read the section it gives flexibility to the trade union involved in a sense because it states &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; and also that the trade union shall take reasonable steps. That does not suggest that the result should be made known immediately.  In fact, it states specifically &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;. As a member of a trade union I would wish to know the outcome of a vote in terms of who voted for and who voted against and the result.  That does not mean that I will want to know the result the minute a vote is taken.  The Bill gives flexibility to a trade union.  I wonder how all of us in this House would feel if when elections have been held, it was just the overall percentage result that was given.  I do not think any of us would be prepared to accept that.  I emphasise again that the section gives flexibility to the trade union in relation to this aspect. I disagree with the Senator's proposition that it puts the union at a disadvantage. It does not.</P>

      <P>During the miners' strike in England, when McGregor was on the employers side, there was a major row about a secret ballot.  Scargill was looking for the suport of his members and was running the whole show through the media and he was being urged every day of the week by McGregor to put it to a secret ballot of the members.  It was the weakening point in terms of the public perception of how Scargill operated that campaign.  Some years later when McGregor got round to writing his memoirs it transpired he had been using a technique which some of us in Ireland have been using for a number of years, that is, he was doing a survey of the members of the opposition.  In other words, he was surveying the miners by means of one of the survey companies, and assessing the views of the members of the NUM during the course of the dispute.  During the time he was publicly challenging Scargill to commit this vote to a secret ballot, he knew that Scargill had a 70 per cent vote from his own members.  Scargill did not know that and he was not prepared to risk a ballot on <Col N="122" /> it.  As it now transpires, had he done so he would have won and would probably have won the dispute.</P>
      <P>That shows the other side of the argument, because I support totally what Senator Costello said.  I mentioned this on Second Stage last night.  The reality is that the majority of workers find the idea of the withdrawal of labour abhorrent, as any of us would.  It is a very serious step for people to take.  We are talking about a secret ballot here and I support Senator Costello's point on it.  It is like a game of poker where one fool has his cards on the table and others are holding their cards close to their chests. In other words, we are saying that when a ballot is held the results should be made available to the opposition.</P>
      <P>I listened closely to what Senator Costello said and his view was not to keep secret, forever, the results of the ballot. His view was that what is proposed would weaken the union during the course of a dispute.  For instance, in my view &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo; in these situations will mean in the following annual report of the union; in other words, the results are kept within the union and published with other results of the union at the AGM.  They should not be published during the course of a dispute.  That is the important point.  If the information is required to be published during the dispute, that is not on.  I will push the section to a vote if that is the position, because I do not believe any trade union should be asked to give part of their bargaining power to the opposition during the course of a dispute.  If the Minister were to say that it would never be practicable to demand this during the course of a dispute but to demand it as soon as would be convenient, thereafter then I would have no difficulty with this.  I am not interested in keeping secrets, I am all for <i>glasnost.</i>  It is the timing that is important.  What are the Minister's views on this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If people feel that their members might run off and tell management, that is a problem for union leadership and their members.  Second, members are entitled to be informed of the detailed results and I see no reason why they should not receive detailed information.  The whole question of secret ballots is based on the principle of giving members a say and, in keeping with this, they should be fully informed of the outcome of the action.  Thirdly, the rights conferred on members of a trade union in section 14 (4) should be conferred on the members concerned and on no other person.  When and how the result is given should be a matter for trade union membership, so if they were going to take action, it would be against the membership.</P>
      <P>I understand what Senators O'Toole, Costello and McKenna are saying here. In my view, &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; would take account of how a leadership of a union would have to act in such crucial times.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;As soon as practicable&rdquo; is a term that is commonly used in legislation.  It has a flexible interpretation. If the Senator reads the second part with the first part he will see it would be the person objecting to what was proposed or who had a legal right to do that would be a member of the union.  If union leadership interpreted &ldquo;as is practicable&rdquo; as I outlined, I do not think the union membership in this case would object; it would be a tactical negotiation as outlined by Senator O'Toole.</P>

      <P>I am taking the wording that is there.  First, the wording says &ldquo;after the conduct of a secret ballot&rdquo; and follows with &ldquo;members entitled to vote in the ballot&rdquo;, which specifically excludes as an entitlement those other members who are not entitled to vote.  Is it, as the Minister says, that in a local action there is a ballot just of those members in the school or factory, and for any other phase of the action there is a further ballot? Therefore, the result of that particular ballot should only be promulgated as far as those members involved are concerned as they are the ones who got the express entitlement.  Does that mean that the members who are not be involved in this phase but who may be involved in a later <Col N="125" /> one do not have automatic entitlement under this legislation?  Is it discretionary?</P>

      <P>I asked a specific question on this and the Minister responded to it in his winding up speech on section 2.  I mentioned last night the difficulty in dealing with the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  To put it at its most basic level, the Registrar has to comply with the law of the last century, which requires the registration of trade unions with the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I take it the Registrar is also required to comply with the laws and regulations of this Bill. It is necessary to amend some of the legislation under which the Registrar operates at the moment?  Are we in the process of doing that?  At the moment the Registrar insists that unions comply with an acceptable strategy in order to change rules.  Any registrar would absolutely refuse to accept a change of rule from the administration of the union, in other words, from the executive of the union.  What are we doing to enable the Registrar to accept this kind of rule?</P>
      <P>Many union rule books would have written into them that the AGM or the annual conference is the supreme ruling body of the union.  That is a normal provision. However, any time this has been tested in a court, the court has taken the view that even the supreme ruling body of the union is subject to the rules of the union.  Therefore, putting both of these together, the rules governing the Registrar and the experience in the courts, what are we doing to prevent a successful legal challenge on section 15?  Are we required to amend the legislation?  Are we, in fact, amending it?  Where are we giving the enabling powers to the Registrar to accept changes of rule under this system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This deals with unions not complying with the procedure for a secret ballot.  I asked this question last night on Second Stage and I will ask it again.  In the event of a trade union official being found to have interfered with a secret ballot, what is the position? Is there a case against such a person? After this legislation is enacted, it becomes the law of the land for trade unions and, therefore, officers of the trade unions are required to comply with the law.  If an officer of a trade union or a branch of a trade union seeks to pervert the procedure of a secret ballot, will any action be taken against him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify two points.  Section 16 ensures that the union has the issue in its rule book and complies with it.  The answer to Senator O'Toole's other question is yes.  If a member feels that an official has in some way interfered with his right under section 14 (3), that member can take an action against the union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a civil action because members would be able to make a case that they, had a contract through the rule book with their union and if that is breached they could take a civil action against it.  This applies under any provision in section 14 (2).  I understand the concern about this but I cannot see it happening.  It is unlikely that there will be many cases under section 14 (2).  The Senator will accept that is why the rights and protections on the other side are necessary in this Bill.  I cannot claim it as my own idea; it comes from a number of <Col N="128" /> people who have argued for these protections on the other side.  The provisions will prove themselves and will pass the test of time.</P>

      <P>In page 12, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where non-licenced associations of workers operating as a negotiating body with an employer or employers exist prior to the introduction of the Act, and satisfy the Minister on this, and subsequent to the introduction of the Act, apply for a negotiating licence, it may be granted at the Minister's discretion.&rdquo;  I move this amendment on the basis that there are in existence many staff associations who are not licensed trade unions and who are not covered by this Bill.  They have a negotiating arrangement with their employer and, in these circumstances, there is a very good relationship between the employer and such associations.  What is the position when the relationship deteriorates, as often happens because of change of management or changes within the organisations, and the association wishes to obtain a licence but does not wish to join any particular union?  I know of one group who did not wish to join any association on religious grounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Their position has not changed.  The amendment appears to be seeking to give them a negotiating licence.  That could not be done because unions have to go through very stringent procedures and conditions to get a negotiating licence.  If they have exempted body status, which effectively means they cannot strike but they can negotiate, or if they have recognition by employers that they are a local negotiation committee like in-house committees, there is no change.  The amendment is different. It seeks to give these bodies a privileged position in a short-cut way, that a trade union cannot do.  If the Senator is asking that they stay as they are, there is no difficulty.  If he is asking to give them a short path through to a negotiating licence, I would have to say no.  There is a different procedure for that and they must follow the trade union rules.</P>

If these bodies have fewer than 1,000 members, the Minister should be in a position to grant them a negotiating licence because they have been in existence prior to the Act.</P>

      <P>Basically, I could summarise it by saying they should join a union.  I am flabbergast to hear that somebody could have a religious viewpoint which would create a difficulty for them joining a trade union.  A trade union is the <Col N="130" /> most Christian form of activity a worker could engage in because all it does is look after the interests of the employees.  This would go against the whole spirit of the legislation.  The small groups there at the moment would not lose out; they would be protected.  You would create a mushrooming of other small groups going into the system when there is a consensus on all sides that it is time to move towards amalgamation and to form larger units.  I would have great difficulty with it.</P>

      <P>I assure Senator Neville that he is not upsetting me or causing me any problems.  It is seldom Senator O'Toole and I agree but in this instance I think we are 100 per cent in agreement.  Regarding the sentiments he expressed in relation to the mushrooming of many small unions, why should a group of individuals wish to become members of a trade union?  Why would a small group of people wish to go off on their own and get a negotiating licence for themselves?  It is against the whole spirit of the thrust of this Bill.  The emphasis in relation to affording expenses for amalgamation and so on would be against the spirit of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the points the Senator is making.  If they are just a negotiating body and do not wish to join a trade union for whatever reason, then they are not affected.  If they have exempted body status they can again negotiate but they do not have a full negotiating licence.  Under the 1971 Act there is provision in certain circumstances for an organisation to go to the High Court and prove they are a body that should have a full negotiating licence even though they do not comply with what was then the figure of 500.  That will not change.  That provision is still in the 1971 Act.  I am not sure what organisation the Senator is talking about but there are three assurances; first, if it is a local negotiating body, they are not affected by this legislation; secondly, if they have accepted body status, like many medical organisations, they can do everything but they cannot strike; and thirdly, if they <Col N="131" /> are some kind of homogenous group they can apply under the 1971 Act.  If the Senator is referring to a particular body we could check with the Department. Either way, the Senator can advise them that they are protected.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17<i>a:</i></P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (2), line 12, to delete &ldquo;, within the period of two years immediately..</P>
      <P>I should explain that amalgamation of unions cost money because there is an immediate duplicity of resources in one area and a shortage in another.  That happens by virtue of the fact that there would be two people to do certain jobs and nobody to do the extra work in other areas.  A fair amount of reorganisation has to take place and invariably there are costs in terms of assuring the livelihood of people who may become redundant or whatever.  There are all sorts of other costs as well, like building costs, which have to be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister very wisely in section 22(2) outlined that he may provide a grant of such amount as he thinks fit towards such expenses as he is satisfied were incurred, within the two years immediately prior to an attempt to amalgamate unions.  I think this would be in a situation where the attempt to amalgamate has failed.  Two years, in some instances, is perhaps too short a period <Col N="132" /> and it might well be an unnecessary constraint. People could operate over a period of years and try to achieve some form of a developed co-operative support towards a transfer of engagements.  All I am asking is that the Minister delete the reference to the two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very reasonable amendment because the Minister is establishing in section 22(1) the positive approach of a grant towards expenses for amalgamations and then being prepared to carry the can, so to speak, where there have been unsuccessful attempts.  This amendment is to ensure that the successful and the unsuccessful attempts are covered.  As Senator O'Toole has pointed out, there may very well be a long gestation period in relation to the amalgamation of two and more unions. Certainly in the present circumstances where teacher unions have started, hopefully, along that course, it is quite possible that the period envisaged would be in excess of two years.  In a normal situation it would be in excess of that and there is no guarantee that it would be successful.</P>
      <P>I remember in the seventies when the teacher unions attempted to go down this road it was unsuccessful.  The Minister has given it his blessing and imprimatur and is very strongly urging rationalisation. It is part of his policy &mdash; and that of his Department &mdash; to delete this two year limit in regard to expenses incurred by the unions in amalgamation. It would be welcomed by the trade union movement who are in the process of &mdash; or contemplating &mdash; amalgamations or mergers.</P>

I think we are clear, and I hope it is understood, that in the case of a successful transfer or amalgamation there is no difficulty, there is no time limit, and the affairs are cleared up.  The limit started off as being a six month limit but I made the point that the biggest amalgamation ever since the foundation of the State, the case of <Col N="133" /> SIPTU, took 12 months with the tens of thousands of workers they have and I thought that by getting it to two&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a full secret ballot of membership.  I have to pay the stamps, so I know.  It cost me a lot of money &mdash; and twice, because under the Registrar of Titles you have to have two ballots. On a serious note, the costs arise really close to the amalgamation.  The costs arise on the ballots, on the printing of the new rule book, on the halls for the meetings.  I have seen a number of amalgamations. Not alone are there in the period of two years but the really heavy costs come in the last three or four months.  That is a fair point.</P>
      <P>Having had to negotiate the principle of this with the Department of Finance, we hope to go back again because of what we are doing here.  I thank Senator Costello and Senator O'Toole for acknowledging that I am committed to these amalgamations.  This should cover the bulk of the costs.  There is no doubt but that there are heavy costs.  It is not really the legal costs; it is the cost of postage, of halls, of rule books, of negotiations with the registrar and tying up the deals.</P>

Of course, you have to produce evidence and so on; but in the case of the small unions it is not a substantial amount of money.  But, having had the experience and having had to drift through the accounts of a number of amalgamations, I would warn that in the case of the Senators, whose members are spread throughout the land, it is very costly and very exhausting.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17b:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 35, to delete paragraph (c).</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 17b and 17c are the most critical, because it goes against everything in this legislation so far that there are groups of workers who are denied access to the process of conciliation and settlement.  It is unjustifiable and untenable.  I listened to the Minister's response this morning and the response does not meet my particular need.  That is why I tabled these amendments and they are crucial.  I have had to live with this and teachers have had to live with it. It just is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last night on Second Stage, when the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, was being introduced by the Dáil by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Seán Lemass, it was in the middle of an industrial dispute.  The INTO had 5,000 members on the streets of Dublin during that week.  All the debate that took place &mdash; and I took the trouble to read over it &mdash; made constant references to the fact of the teachers being involved <Col N="135" /> in the dispute.  I have no doubt that this was a major motivating force in excluding teachers at that stage from the Labour Court.  That is only a matter of history.  I am not interested in what happened before I was born, although barely before I was born.  That is not the issue.  The issue for me is a very simple one: If I take the group I know best, national teachers, national teachers do not have a conditions of service system of conciliation and arbitration.  I want to put that on the record.  There is no conciliation and arbitration system in the Department of Education for national teachers.  Neither is there access to the Labour Court for national teachers, because this section, which is a direct lift from the 1946 Act, excludes them very definitely from it.</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury, the new Labour Relations Commission &mdash; though I am not clear what it does &mdash; apparently are further excluded from the process of, to quote the Bill, &ldquo;settlement and prevention of disputes&rdquo;.  It does not make any sense at all.  In his reply this morning the Minister indicated that those unions in the public service who already have conciliation and arbitration procedure are negotiating and there there will be some development to allow them access to what is in this Bill.  Unfortunately, the reality is that the members I am talking about do not have a conciliations and arbitration system for conditions of service. I cannot allow pass me here today something which denies my members access to the process of negotiation, to the process of negotiated settlement through negotiation of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I have looked at paragraphs (a) to (f) in section 23(1) many times and wondered why it was there.  I have looked at some of the labour legislation in the seventies. I am quoting from memory, but it was probably the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1974.  In that Act there is a list of people who are also excluded, and it is clearly lifted also from the 1946 Act but in that case they took the national teachers out of the exclusions &mdash; in other words, they allowed them access at that time.  I do not know why.  I want to hear the Minister <Col N="136" /> justify why the national teachers of Ireland do not have access to a conditions of service conciliation and arbitration and to the Labour Court.  What is the problem? They are employed by boards of management right through the country.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Costello, has also put his name to the amendment and I presume he will make a similar, not quite identical, point in regard to secondary teachers.  Something similar but also different could be said about the teachers in the vocational system.  Both of my colleagues in those two unions have got some form of negotiating structure. There is none for my members.  It just is not good enough.  We have been attempting for many years to get agreement on it.  I do not believe the Minister will be able to justify the position.</P>
    <P>I will give the House a graphic example of a situation last year where we had a group of almost 2,000 substitute teachers in primary schools who were being paid pin money &mdash; well qualified excellent teachers who could not live on the amount of money they were being paid for substitute teaching and could not depend on the process of payment.  We could not negotiate for them because they did not have access to a C and A scheme.  They were excluded from it. We could not have access to the Labour Court because they were excluded from it by this legislation.  We eventually had to go through an incredibly circuitous route to get agreement from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance, the Department of Labour and the Department of Education and approval by Cabinet for the setting up of <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration in order to deal with the case.  That is ridiculous in this day and age.  There is no case to be made for it.  I ask the Minister to take that section out of it now and let industrial relations progress for my members also.  I cannot accept the position and I will not withdraw my amendment.</P>
    <P>I am making the same argument for both cases, with one minor difference: that amendment No. 17<i>c</i> which asks that:</P>
    <P>(2) Workers, as defined in section 8 <Col N="137" /> who do not have access to the Labour Court and who do not have access to a Conditions of Service Conciliation and Arbitration scheme, shall have access to the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not know any other group of workers in the country in that system and I see no reason why the Minister could not accept that amendment.  It does not create a problem with the 1946 legislation, nor does it create a problem with section 23.  I have put it there just as a fallback position.  I am not that happy with it; but I would prefer to fall back on the second amendment, though really the first amendment is the one that is crucial. I want to know why national teachers continued to be excluded.  I want to hear the arguments that went on in the Department of Labour before this section was framed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to echo the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole.  It is difficult to see why there should be specific exclusions of people in the Civil Service, the public service and teachers identified and excluded specifically from it.  The limited access we have to conciliation and arbitration and the fact that so many of our attempts in relation to claims are stymied when we go down along that road are one of the stumbling blocks that we are coming across all the time.  I am sure the Minister will have something to say about why there are certain rules and regulations in relation to the Industrial Relations Act for certain sectors of workers and other sectors are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be looking in terms of the same access for everybody if we are talking about full democratisation, which this legislation is about.  It is a comprehensive piece of legislation.  It is updating the 1906 Act as well as a number of other Acts.  Therefore, this is the type of matter the Minister should be addressing, one that is causing all sorts of hiccups and obstacles for the trade union movement in the public sector and in the area where my union is involved.  I wonder can the Minister give us justification for that; and, if he is not prepared to provide it <Col N="138" /> strictly within those terms, is he prepared to give a particular access in the context of the new Labour Relations Commission? Is he going to provide a specific route of access in industrial relations terms to the members of my union?</P>
    <P>I support the amendment wholeheartedly. It extends to secondary teachers, national teachers and, indeed, to all teachers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for making their points.  First, can I explain the first aspect of this, the definition of worker contained in the section, because it determines those categories of workers who have access to the services of the Labour Court, the Rights Commissioners and the Labour Relations Commission. It makes no changes to the existing definition but brings together a definition which is at present spread over a number of pieces of legislation.  The categories of workers excluded from access to the Labour Court and the Rights Commissioners are covered instead by conciliation and arbitration schemes and the question of providing access to the Labour Court and other services for such categories is one for discussion and agreement between the parties to the various conciliation schemes, and that has always been the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A provision is contained in subsection <Col N="139" /> (5) of this section to allow the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; to be amended by order should there be agreement to do this and, in the absence of such an agreement, I am not in a position to make any amendments to the definition.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Toole, Costello and Jackman made points about the teachers' scheme.  This was debated in the Dáil, as I mentioned this morning, not from the point of view of the teachers' scheme but in regard to the Local Government Public Services Union and their C and A scheme.  They have a position where there is a certain arbitrable licence and they wanted a debate to try to get extension of what is arbitrable and what is not.  That is the first aspect they wanted changed.  I think the same applies to other C and A schemes as well.  It was not put forward in the early part of this debate or in the discussions.</P>
    <P>The second part is where there are issues that perhaps are not arbitrable, not in the list of arbitrable items or for the extension of arbitrable items where you could get access to the Labour Court, items of discipline or other more minor items.  As I mentioned earlier on today, there is the difficulty that, if you go outside of the C and A scheme and go direct to the Rights Commissioner service with some of these issues, people can appeal a Rights Commissioner's decision and then they can go back to the Labour Court. You will then have a position where you will have people having issues in the C and A scheme, issues in the Rights Commissioner service and issues on appeal from the Rights Commissioner service to the Labour Court.  It was felt, certainly in relation to the Local Government Public Services C and A scheme &mdash; and I think it would be equally so in regard to the teachers' C and A scheme, where Senator O'Toole was outlining the difficulties &mdash; that they go one road or the other.  I do not think it does much for the industrial relations service, but even less for the group affected, regardless of what group is affected.</P>
    <P>If there are some issues in the C and A scheme being negotiated between the <Col N="140" /> parties involved, which in the case the Senator is talking about would be the teachers, the Department of Education and the official side represented by the Department of Finance, they could have items in either the Labour Relations Commission, which we referred to or, in the Rights Commissioner service and perhaps have some of them on appeal to the Labour Court.  That would definitely be spreading the resources of the industrial relations service all over the place and would not be advisable.  From inquiries I have made I understand that the question of third party proceedings, which is essentially what is being sought by the Senators, for access to these services is being discussed under the consiliation and arbitration schemes for local authority and health service workers and the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>On the question of bringing the teachers' C and A scheme into that, that is a matter to raise with the official side.  I believe that such issues are best handled within the established negotiating machinery.  Given the variety and special employment status of the many groups of public servants covered by C and A schemes, it would be particularly important that structures appropriate to their culture and operating environment be worked out, not using the arm of the industrial relations machinery that is not appropriate for these areas, regardless of whether it is Health, Environment or Education.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is by no means clear that, given the C and A tradition, all public service groups in the C and A schemes would wish to bring their problems to a Rights Commissioner with the prospect of a right of appeal to the Labour Court or to any other body.  I am familiar with differences of opinion in the health service, but I am not familiar with what is in the education service.  Ongoing discussions between the parties, the various C and A schemes, including the local authority and health services schemes, are taking place with a view to working out solutions tailored to the precise needs of their own services.  I would not wish to put myself in the position of pre-empting <Col N="141" /> the outcome of these discussions.  The parties raised this issue with me many months ago in the early part of these discussions and asked me, through the Department of Finance and through the local authority services, through Phil Flynn, Local Government and Public Services Union, to get discussions going. I know also, although I was not directly involved, that the same applies to the health C and A scheme.</P>
    <P>That is all I can say that is of use and value in trying to assist the Senators.  I cannot amend it because it is outside my ambit.  However, if it is helpful to the Senators, I will raise in the discussions which I have assisted to get going in the other areas that the issue of the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme should equally be taken on board.  That is as far as I can go.  It is not within my ambit to change this Bill.  As I said, I do have powers if there is agreement afterwards to amend by order but, if it is done the way it has been envisaged in the other areas, it seems to me that uniformity of the schemes would be sensible. There is no point in having the local authority conciliation and arbitration scheme and the health conciliation and arbitration scheme one way and having the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme the other way.  The review of them all, including the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme, and the official side response should also be discussed with the teachers.  However, I have not the power to do that and it would not have to be done by legislation if raised through the conciliation and arbitration schemes.  I will just give a commitment to the House that I will raise these issues which have been brought up today by a number of Senators, the amendments, and the arguments put forward, bring that back to the official side and ask for it to be reviewed.  That is as far as I can go.</P>

      <P>Most of the points I raised have not been addressed by the Minister.  I want to be quite specific about it.  I want to deal with the issues the Minister has raised.  I asked him to justify <Col N="142" /> why teachers are excluded from the scheme.  The answer he gave was that he had not changed the 1964 Act.  That is no answer.  We have been changing the 1964 Act since last night at 8 o'clock, line by line and section by section.  I want to know why.  I am going to ask the question twice, why, why?  Who in the Department of Labour said that they were going to exclude national teachers, secondary teachers and vocational teachers?  I want to hear the reason.  I do not need to be told that it has not been changed.  I said it is a direct lift from the 1964 Act.  I can see that.  I want to know why?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point, as I have said already, that there is no conciliation and arbitration scheme.  We have raised it with previous Ministers for Education.  I will list them to you &mdash; back from Martin O'Donoghue every single one of them up along.  Governments or somebody has refused to negotiate with us on it.  That is the reality.  I am not playing games here.  What is being discussed at the moment with the other people in the public service are people who already have a conditions of service conciliation and arbitration scheme.  That is the reality.  I am not making this up as we go along.</P>
      <P>The other point &mdash; and I want to stress this very firmly &mdash; is the idea of the double chance, of taking one thing to conciliation and arbitration and then going on from there.  I agree completely with the Minister on this.  I always exclude from agreements the opportunity for people to go one road or the other.  For instance, from grievance procedures I would not allow people to take up equality cases.  There is a road to be followed for unfair dismissals. There is the 1977 legislation to be followed for equality cases &mdash; incidentally, teachers can get in through the back door to the Labour Court through the 1977 equality legislation.  It is the only place that they have access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is reality.  It is not a question of moving outside the conciliation and <Col N="144" /> arbitration scheme.  It is not a question of asking the Minister to do away with the conciliation and arbitration schemes. There is just no scheme at the moment for teachers because it has not been acceptable for anyone to negotiate with us.  We have raised it with Minister after Minister and it has been refused.  We now find ourselves in the astonishing situation where, when there is a problem to be resolved, there an <i>ad hoc</i> mechanism has to be set up.</P>
    <P>All I want the Minister to say is, first, that this legislation might be changed; and, second, that it is an untenable situation. More than anything else, I want to hear the justification why we were excluded.  There is no justification coming forward.  I think the Minister will understand my frustration on the issue for that particular reason.  There are no ongoing discussions of this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just add to that, Minister, before you reply.  The existing conciliation and arbitration scheme is a very limited scheme referring to salary matters with the very minimum conditions. We are always coming up with problems in relation to conciliation and arbitration, finding that so many matters we want to deal with are simply not arbitrable and we are stopped; we are stopped in the middle of industrial negotiations.  There is very little we can do because of the type of scheme we have.  I would be interested to know whether the Minister will address this. The Minister may or may not be able to give a reason other than stating that it is in the 1946 Act.  Of course, that is not good enough as a reason.  It is a simple statement that the legislation is here.  It is like when we were changing the 1964 Criminal Justice Act last week.  Why were certain provisions in the 1990 Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill?  The reason was that they were in the 1964 Act.  That was a piece of bad updating of legislation on a matter that should have been looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will say that it would mean a large degree of work in relation to the whole conciliation and arbitration <Col N="145" /> matter.  Would the Minister make a commitment that he would be prepared to enter into negotiations with the teacher bodies with a view to bringing the teacher unions and the other public service unions, the local authorities and so on, within the provisions of this legislation, as stated under Part III?  He certainly did not specify any principled objection to doing so.  Would he say whether his Department and the Minister himself would now feel that there is an anomaly here and that the best approach would be to enter into negotiations to eliminate it as quickly as possible and then to introduce amending provisions to incorporate it into the present legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the frustration expressed by Senators O'Toole, Costello and Jackman and by my own good colleague, Senator Mullooly, who has been responsible for these affairs for many years from the teachers' union point of view.  I am aware of the previous discussions with Senator O'Toole regarding the issue, but I could never be accused of being responsible for changing the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers. That would be far outside my remit. My agitation was caused by the suggestion that I would dare cross into the voids of the teachers unions.  They hardly allow the Minister for Education to do that, never mind the Minister for Labour. However, I will take up this issue and respond.  The negotiations are a matter primarily for the official side represented by the Departments of Finance and Education.</P>
      <P>I am not putting up any defence for it. I have not changed the definition.  I have not changed any of the procedures that were there since 1946.  The only correction I would make on all that is that I think Senator O'Toole was wrong in the figures that were outside the gate in 1946. I think it was 6,000 and not 5,000.  I am not disputing any of the other details.</P>

I cannot change arbitrarily what is in the teachers conciliation and arbitration scheme or any other conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It is not within the powers of this legislation or of the Minister for Labour.  There seems to be a difficulty in regard to the conditions of employment for teachers.  I discussed this with Senator O'Toole and some of his teachers' leaders some years ago.  I clearly recall that.  I am not sure what the difficulties are or why this is not being moved on.  However, I will undertake to raise the matter with the official side and the Department of Education to see if some progress is being made in this regard.  I would be glad to try to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this is a responsibility that should be dealt with through the Minister for Education as opposed to the Minister for Labour.  I would be the first to say that.  However, we are not discussing legislation from the Department of Education.  Legislation from the Department of Education is a rare thing indeed.  This is the only legislation I have in front of me.  This is the only place I can vent my frustration with the system that is there.  I accept the good faith of the Minister on the matter.  I would like to ask three questions.</P>
      <P>First, I heard him say at an earlier stage that there was some question of changing the definition of a worker under a section of one of the Acts.  I would just like to know if that is the case.  I just want to know what the options are.  Second, I have not quite understood why, even if the 1946 Act did not allow access to the Labour Court &mdash; and I can see reasons for doing that where those unions have a conciliation scheme already &mdash; we cannot have access to the Labour Relations Commission.  I do not agree either that there should be conciliation and then go to Labour Court.  That defeats the whole purpose of the scheme.  That is not the issue for me.  What I do not understand is why we cannot have access to the Labour Relations Commission.  There are ongoing disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I left the House here 40 minutes ago <Col N="147" /> to deal with a dispute in the west of Ireland, which is fairly well known and which cannot be dealt with.  In the last year my union spent approximately £60,000 employing, at its own expense, rights commissioners to do the job that everyone else gets done under the system, in order to try to get fair play or to resolve or solve problems.  There is a very fair case in those situations.  Why could we not have access to that part of it?  There does not seem to be a section in the legislation in front of me which says that worker as defined under section 23 will exclude certain people when dealing with the prevention and solving of problems under the Labour Relations Commission.  I feel that that at least would be half-way down the road.  Third, I want from the Minister a commitment that he would be prepared to set up the negotiations under the terms of his Department, and that within the ambit of his Department he would respond to the teacher unions either as a group or to each one.  They are in different employments, so it would be unclear if there was one system for all three.  I would like to hear the Minister respond favourably to a request from the unions to discuss that type of thing.  So there are three issues there, Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The first issue relates to the question of the order, and being able to change the definition in section 23 (5) where the Government may by order amend the definition of worker in subsection (1) and may by order revoke or amend any such order.  That is in a case where there is agreement between any of the conciliation and arbitration schemes and the official side in the appropriate Department.  Then, by order under this legislation that can be enacted.  That, I think, is the appropriate way to do it. When it is properly negotiated, we will then enact it.  The second point is the question of £60,000.  Some of the exemptions that are there as to what is arbitable and not arbitable create these difficulties under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  That is equally so in some of the <Col N="148" /> other conciliation and arbitration schemes.  I accept this.  I have said it in the other House; I said it before at Question Time in the other House; I have said it publicly and at some of the conferences. The arbitable items are, in some cases, from another period and they are too narrow.  There is, clearly, a need to review the arbitable areas.  That is one issue.  The second issue is where you have what are termed normally in industrial relations terms in conciliation and abitration schemes small issues that should not cause any difficulty, but since there is nowhere to go with them so, they create major difficulties.  A kind of Rights Commissioner Service would be valuable to them.  That is there for some of the other schemes as well.  They have this limited position.  That is an area that can be looked at.  The definition of &ldquo;workers&rdquo; would rule teachers out.  I do not want to go into that debate again, but the expression &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; means that there are definitions under the 1946 Act which exclude teachers.  I am not trying to answer by saying that can never change, which is what the Senators are saying. If teacher groups were unfairly left out under that Act and their conciliation and arbitration scheme is limited, then they should try to make progress on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think &mdash; I have said this years ago to Senator O'Toole &mdash; we have not had the chance of debating this in the House, but if I can help by raising this issue &mdash; and Senator Mullooly has made this point to me before too &mdash; I and my Department will try to start the discussions.  We have done it in the terms of conciliation and arbitration schemes, not so much in the Department of Health, but I was directly involved in the one for local authority/health workers &mdash; I was involved with the local authority workers. I will raise it in the same way for the teachers and see if we can make some progress.  I accept there is a point.  I am not here to say what is in or what is not in.  That is not my job.  It is a matter for consideration by the official side in Departments of Finance and Education. I have been requested by all sides of the <Col N="149" /> House to raise this, and I will undertake to do that.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a brief comment on the sincerity with which the Minister will address this issue.  I would implore that it would be done fairly soon for the simple reason that the Minister will pre-empt quite a lot of pressure, because one of the days the teacher unions will have amalagamated under the Council of Teachers.  Obviously, they will be in a far stronger negotiating position then.  All the anomalies and uniformities that will emerge as a result indicate that this item should be addressed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I think they arise now. There are great anomolies in nominating the system at present.  In the hospitals system &mdash; and it arises through all the conciliation and arbitration schemes &mdash; health boards will go to conciliation and arbitration schemes and voluntary hospitals will go to the Labour Court.  When they work side by side you have some going one way, and when you have a joint case, they want to go both ways.  It is not just a case of tidying this up for any group of workers.  From the State point of view, you have people coming at you from all sides.  The trade union movement over the years have worked out where it is to their advantage and what case goes to the Labour Court and what case goes to the conciliation and arbitration scheme. They have been trying to get somebody to create an anomaly and then say there are analogous grades.  I think everyone is familiar with that.  I played that from the other side of the fence in years past. The argument I have made is that these schemes have to be looked at, but I do not think people can go two ways at the same time.  That is where we have to start the debate.  I have given an undertaking to raise this issue in the Dáil.  I certainly will communicate with the Senators who are interested.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister, through you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. As I understand him, following <Col N="150" /> negotiations and due agreement, he would be prepared to recommend to the Government an order to amend the definition of worker, if that was the most appropriate course of action.  There is an &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; situation here and I just want to be in one or the other.  We have never had the luxury of the either/or situation unfortunately.  We have had Hobson's choice.  I am not trying to set up an either/or situation because at the end of the day that is in nobody's interest.  I just want a way of resolving problems.  The other thing I understand the Minister to have said is that he would be prepared to facilitate, following a request from the teacher unions the negotiations that would be required through the public service for a conciliation and arbitration scheme for that group.  On that basis, I would like to thank the Minister for a very full and spirited response to my proposal. I will withdraw the amendment on that basis.</P>

It would seem that the appropriate way would be to introduce an amendment under subsection (5) of this section in relation to the definition of a worker.  What is required then are the procedures.  There are many bodies involved such as the Public Service and, of course, teachers who come under a variety of categories, or none.  Can we take it now that our unions can write to the Minister, or do we wait for contact <Col N="151" /> from the Minister on this matter?  Is it a matter we can deal with without going to the Department of Education? Obviously, the Department of Education would have some say in this matter as well.  It is a matter we have discussed for so long now and we are agreed on this side that it is unsatisfactory.  The Minister agrees that it is unsatisfactory, as well.

      <P>It was.  I wish to say to Senator Jackman &mdash; and Senator Honan would agree &mdash; that we should try to get <Col N="152" /> as much female representation as possible. The sad thing about being Minister for Labour is that you do not have the luxury other Ministers have where they can appoint all their boards, because there was a practice set up by Sean Lemass 45 years ago where the social partners would have nominating rights. What normally happens on a board of six is that the employers and the trade union movement will pick four and the Minister is left to pick two.  The Minister has to cover certain interests that have not been covered by the other two bodies.  They have to cover a broad representation.  It applies to all the boards.  If they do not go along with female representation, it makes it very difficult for the Minister. The upsetting thing is that when I have a particular quota people read in the newspaper the number of females the Minister has appointed.  I do not have authority over the whole lot.</P>
      <P>I agree totally with what Senator Jackman has said and I will see if we can convince them to give equal representation. It is a difficult task but we will strive to achieve this.  From previous experience, it will be extremely difficult. When appointing the appeals tribunal last year, I wrote to all of the nominating bodies involved, both employers and trade unions, and pointed out to them that there were a number of females in the country and that perhaps they would take due recognition of that fact.  I think I got one or two nominations from the employers.  Though the unions had far more I only got one or two from them also.  I will continue the task and will use the record of this debate to try to influence them to do a little better than they have done previously.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4) Notwithstanding subsections (1) (a) and (3) the Court may investigate a dispute if the parties to the dispute request a court investigation and where a conciliation conference has been held at which the parties made a genuine attempt to resolve the issues in dispute.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section concerns itself with matters and situations where investigations of a dispute are undertaken by the Labour Court.  It is in line with the thinking of the Minister that the Labour Court is the last resort, and how the matter comes from the Labour Relations Commission. What I am introducing here is another scenario where the party involved has access to the Labour Court.  The difference here is that what is being stated is that the court may investigate a dispute if the parties to a dispute request a court investigation, and where a conciliation conference has been held at which the parties made a genuine attempt to resolve the issues in dispute.  It is a new combination here, giving the priority to the parties themselves where they make the request.  There are various options there already.  I am introducing a further option &mdash; that this would be an appropriate one for referring the matter to the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>At present the Labour Court, under the 1969 Act, may investigate a dispute when conciliation has been held and the parties request it to investigate.  One of the main reasons for the establishment of the commission is to ensure that as many issues as possible are settled without recourse to the Labour Court.  This has to be reflected in the legislation.  The wording in the amendment proposed by the Senator would create the same difficulties of interpretation which arises with an earlier wording in my proposals which require the parties to make a bona fide attempt at settlement.  The words made a &ldquo;genuine attempt&rdquo; could also give rise to disagreements as to whether an attempt at settlement has been made.  The wording in the Bill requiring the commission to be satisfied that no further efforts on its part will advance the resolution of the dispute gets over the difficulty of interpretation. If operated flexibly and in a commonsense way, as is the intention, the provision should not give rise to problems, while at the same time making it clear that as many disputes as possible should be settled at conciliation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) Reference of issues which are not covered by arbitration procedures for public service employees can be made to a rights commissioner, provided relevant conciliation procedures for such employees have been observed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is somewhat on the lines <Col N="156" /> of an amendment which we were discussing previously in the context of section 23.  I note the response the Minister has given us in the context of section 23. However, there are problems that will exist in the interim.  One of the major problems we have as teacher organisations is in the whole question of conciliation and arbitration and the limitations on that.  While we can get to conciliation with the parties we are negotiating with, we find ourselves against a stumbling block in relation to arbitration on very many matters.  One of the matters we have been endeavouring to get over in recent years has been the question of pensions and reduction in the age limit for the retirement of teachers.  We have problems with special claims, as well.</P>
    <P>There is a major stumbling block in the context of arbitration for us particularly in the public sector.  We need some outlet.  There has to be some way of getting over this block.  In the meantime, before we get equal rights under the legislation, as I hope we will be able to negotiate in the not-too-distant future, I suggest to the Minister that it would be appropriate that he would provide an avenue where matters of arbitration that we do not have access to or that we cannot deal with at the present time can be dealt with.  This would be one of the ways we could do it.  A pertinent way would be by giving us access to a Rights Commissioner, provided all the other relevant conciliation procedures had been followed.</P>

It has remained, not in an emergency fashion, but operating in the normal course of events.

I would like at this stage, along with thanking both Houses of the Oireachtas, to also thank the various groups that were involved in making presentations and their cases, particularly the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers who, with their membership and experts and advisers, both legal and industrial relations advisers, put in a truly enormous amount of time.</P>
      <P>I would also like to thank the officials of my Department, who have been dealing with this Bill since 1965 and who have seen a number of Ministers in successive Governments come and go.  As I said earlier, it is the fact that progress under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> allowed this Bill to come forward.  I am grateful for that and acknowledge the commitment to the programme otherwise another Minister would be in a position to bring forward this legislation. It was the patience and the endurance of officials, some of them literally dealt with this Bill during the 25 years' gestation, others who have dealt with it for a lengthy period, who have stuck with it and continued to negotiate.  It is a major achievement for them.  I want to acknowledge their outstanding commitment and the commitment of people in the House who have helped greatly.  The debate and the issues that arose helped.  Since it is 84 years since the last substantial Bill &mdash; it was before the foundation of the State &mdash; I hope this Bill will be a long time on the Statute Book.

It is the first major updating of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.  That in itself is a daunting task for any Department and for any Minister to take on and bring to fruition.  I thank the Minister for his courtesy and his clarity in explaining the matters raised.</P>

      <P>I would like to join in expressing appreciation to the Minister for his epic achievement.  It is the first substantive legislation in almost a century, legislation which will provide the basis for industrial relations for many years to come.  Members on all sides agree that this in necessary and beneficial legislation and they appreciate the tremendous work of the officials of the Department, of the trade unions and of <Col N="162" /> the many people in the trade unions who were involved.  I would like to thank also the people on the employers side.  A great deal of work was done there.  There was much hard arguing but at the end of the day there was a recognition that all our interests are basically similar.  We in this House and our colleagues in the other House have also contributed to what were extremely well informed, very positive contributions, very well argued, which we would all agree have greatly improved the Bill.  Again, I want to pay a tribute to the Minister.  It is part of his character that he has been willing to take on board recent amendments which will clearly improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the Minister for the work he has done, bearing in mind that it is almost 24 hours since he entered the Chamber and he has been with us for most of our sitting since that time.  It is very commendable of the Minister and I thank him.  I would like to join with the others in thanking those who worked on the Bill with the Minister over the past few years and with previous Ministers, the trade union representatives, the Federation of Irish Employers and others.  It is, as Senator Honan said, a very historic situation.</P>
      <P>As somebody who waded through various measures of legislation since studying industrial relations some 20 years ago, I understand the significance of it.  In future those studying and operating within the industrial relations sphere will refer to this legislation almost on a daily basis.  I am happy to be here on this historic occasion as somebody involved in industrial relations.  I compliment the Minister on the way he dealt with the amendments.  While we did not accept everything he said we did not feel strongly enough to call a vote on any of the amendments because of his clarity in answering our questions.</P>

      <P>As Leader of the House, having listened all of the evening to this debate and in my office I would like to say how impressed I was with the standard of <Col N="163" /> debate.  It is right that we should pay tribute to the officials of the Department of Labour, the trade unions, the employers, all the people who helped to make this Bill possible.  Of course, we should congratulate warmly the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern.  He excelled this evening in this House.  The fact that we had no vote indicates his comprehensive knowledge of this Bill and his unassuming persuasive powers in the nicest way possible led to the situation that we had no votes, no sharp exchanges or anything like that.  His explanations at all times were perfect and we should thank him warmly for that.</P>
      <P>It is right and fitting also that we should thank and congratulate the Senators on all sides of the House who contributed in such an excellent may to this debate. As has been said, it is very important legislation and I am happy the Seanad has played its role in making it a very worthwhile debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) recognise the serious income crisis affecting thousands of Irish farmers,</P>
      <P>(2) implement measures to alleviate the present income crisis in the areas of beef, store cattle, sheep, milk and cereals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> This is a motion which those of us associated with the agriculture industry are reluctant to see on the Order Paper. Nevertheless, the serious situation that has arisen in agriculture demands that this motion be on the agenda before the House today.</P>
    <P>The social and economic importance of agriculture and farming is of vital importance to the economic future of this country.  Very plainly, their importance is such as to be almost incapable of being exaggerated.  What do we see happening all round us?  A price collapse in practically all types of farming.  The price collapse in beef and sheep is such that right now the prices being paid to farmers barely covers the cost of production.  Beef bullocks, heifers and store cattle are down approximately £100 per head. Dairy farmers are taking almost £300 per cow reduction in their income.  What is being done to ease the blow?  Very little, I am afraid.  When one considers the disastrous situation of our cereal growers, one wonders if there is a concentrated effort to move people off the land and denude rural Ireland of its population.</P>
    <P>I know of no other period during the past 20 years when there has been such a sudden and sharp deterioration in the fortunes of Irish farmers and all independent observers agree that the future is far from bright.  In fact farm incomes, according to the best independent advisers, will drop from 20 per cent to 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I regret that the Minister is not here but nevertheless the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, is very welcome. This is an unparalleled and unprecedented drop in income from one year to another.  I wonder why the report of the farm management survey has not been issued?  Is it being deliberately delayed because of the frightening figures projected for farm income for 1990?  Is it being delayed until the Dáil has gone into recess?</P>
    <P>Prior to joining the Common Market agriculture was a severely underdeveloped sector which concentrated on supplying a small domestic market and <Col N="165" /> satisfying the needs of the United Kingdom demand for a limited range of bulk commodities.  To date, the Government would lead us to believe that agriculture spearheads the national drive towards employment creation and economic survival. Need I mention the publicity attached to the launching of the Goodman deal, when we were all convinced that down the road we were going to have everything pre-packed and landed on the shelves of Europe?  We were going to create 2,000 new jobs.  What has happened to this project that was launched with such fanfare and now seems to be left on the shelves to gather dust?</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons given is that membership of the European Community has given us access to wider markets and the availability of institutionalised price support.  These wider markets should have enabled us to boost production and expand processing capacity in areas as dairying, beef and sheep where we enjoy a natural advantage. I point out the advantage that could be gained from the processing of hide, skins and wool.  Unfortunately the Government have failed miserably to do anything about these downstream industries. I cannot understand why the Government, in conjunction with the IDA and the National Development Corporation, have not pursued the possibility of creating jobs in the hide, skin and wool industries.  I regret very much that the Government have ignored developments in these areas.  These three commodities are at present priced at a very low level, and substantially less than they were last year.</P>
    <P>I question strongly whether we have taken advantage of the huge market. What marketing strategy have we got? Have CBF and Bord Bainne been given the kind of support they require to market our produce?  Have we moved away from bulk commodities towards added value manufacturing?  This is something we heard a lot about but I believe, unfortunately, very little has been done about it.  What effect has the huge cut in the CBF budget had on the marketing of our Irish produce?  Have we <Col N="166" /> taken advantage of the added stimulus from the change made over recent years in the Common Agricultural Policy price support system?  I believe we have not and CBF have not been given support by the Government to sell Irish products, have them properly branded and launched in the same way as Dairygold or whatever.  We have failed to do that with beef and lamb and we are paying the supreme price for it at present.</P>
    <P>A fundamental requirement for the continued development of the agriculture sector is confidence in the industry, in order to continue to supply the raw material but right now this confidence is being shattered.  Something needs to be done right away.  Producers require confidence and guarantees.  They want to know where they are going.  I never saw so much uncertainty when one considers the impact the GATT negotiations could have on prices and the prices we are receiving today.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of months, we have seen changes in those support arrangements.  For example, arriving at the 1990 ewe premium the stabiliser, the method used to take into account increases in ewe numbers in calculating the ewe premium, has been increased to 7.25 per cent compared to 5 per cent in 1989 and the carcase co-efficiency has been reduced to 17 kilos compared to 17.5 kilos in 1989.  These combined measures led to a reduction in the ewe premium of £2.  That is tinkering with the mechanism by which Irish farmers gain subsidies under the ewe premium scheme from Brussels and because of changing the goalpost and the ground rules, we now end up with £2 less than we would be getting if the 1989 guidelines were adhered to in 1990.</P>
    <P>Farmers are very concerned about the current nogotiations on the GATT round.  Will prices be halved as is being suggested?  Farmers want to know precisely what is happening so that they can plan for the future and invest accordingly. In the case of beef producers, specific decisions as to the extent of future intervention support for the beef sector is now needed.  Our milk producers clearly need <Col N="167" /> to know whether quotas will continue after 1992 and if so under what conditions. Farmers want to know if the existing link between quotas and land will be broken, and if so, whether after 1992 quotas will be transported across member state frontiers.  This is a very important issue and one I hope the Minister will address when he replies.  It is a matter of grave concern to farmers.</P>
    <P>Huge questions must be raised about the marketing of sheep meat, when we find that New Zealand frozen lamb is being sold in our supermarkets.  Why is this acceptable from a non-EC country when we have such a supply of lamb? Together with our own supply, we are now 105 per cent self-sufficient.  Without them, the EC would be in a deficiency situation.  Need I point out to anybody here the huge difference that this would make to the sheep farmers of Ireland.  I believe it is an absolute scandal that this sheepmeat can come in at substantially reduced prices, be dumped onto the EC market, and as a result depress the price of Irish lamb.</P>
    <P>Last week in reply to the debate on bovine TB levies, the Minister referred to a statement which I made regarding farmers' incomes.  The Minister stated things were not quite as bad as Senator Naughten said.  I want to point out that I did not exaggerate and I want to further point out that I am rather amazed at his statement.  It quite clearly indicates that he is unaware of the extreme difficulties many Irish farmers are in as a result of a drop in prices in every agricultural commodity. If the Minister is not aware of the situation one must seriously question, if he is capable of representing Irish farmers at the Cabinet table or in Europe.</P>
    <P>Let me point out to the Minister that lamb prices have reduced by 25p per lb between 1 July 1989 to 1 July 1990. Taking the average lamb at 43 lb carcase weight, that means a farmer is getting £36.12 in 1990 when he was getting £46.44 in 1989, a difference of £10.32.  For a farmer with 100 ewes and a lambing average of 1.3, this means a loss of £1,342 on <Col N="168" /> lamb prices alone.  Taken in conjunction with the drop in wool prices from 72p per pound to 30p per pound, it means the income of a farmer with 100 ewes is down by a total of £1,600.  This is exacerbated still further if one considers a farm with a lambing rate of 1.6; the losses then become £1,965.  These are facts that cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the Minister that lamb prices in the first week of July 1989 were £1.10 per lb and on the first week in July 1990 they were 84p per lb.  Let me further point out that on 1 July 1989 cattle prices, steer prices, were £1.13 per lb.  In the first week of July 1990 they were £1.06.  Heifer prices in the first week of July 1989 were £1.10 per lb.  In the first week of July 1990 they were 95p per lb.  A farmer selling 20 heifers, killing at 540 pounds carcase weight will take a loss of £81 per head or £1,620 on his 20 heifers.  A similar situation exists for the man feeding 20 steers.  If one takes the average 50 to 80 acre farmer he can lose anything from £3,500 to £4,000.  I ask the Minister if there is any other section of the population that would tolerate that.  We heard of Black Monday on the Stock Exchange but if there were the same ratio drops on the Stock Exchange there would be a riot.</P>
    <P>At present one of the greatest difficulties facing the farming community is the glut of lambs on the market.  Let me point out to the Minister that on the advice of the Department of Agriculture and Food sheep farmers increased sheep production on the clear understanding that we were only 80 per cent self-sufficient. I ask the Minister, without any further delay, to introduce a scheme along the lines of aids for private storage that would take the immediate glut of lamb off the market for July and August, because if that is not done, the 84p per lb will become 75p per lb in two weeks' time.  I appeal to the Minister to convey to the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, the vital importance of getting the glut of lamb off the market.</P>
    <P>Mutton is being sold at 17p per lb. I cannot understand what CBF or the Department of Agriculture and Food <Col N="169" /> have been doing to allow mutton prices to drop to this level.  I appeal to the Minister to take up this matter with CBF and see what can be done to get a market for mutton.</P>
    <P>In the dairy industry, 65 per cent of all farmers have 20,000 gallon quotas or less. Those farmers have no capacity to borrow and are taking an income drop of £3,000 to £4,000.  They are small dairy farmers who cannot afford to lose this money.  I recognise that many of the larger farmers, the 35 per cent with a huge gallonage, have done reasonably well over the years out of milk and can, for the time being tolerate a drop of income but the smaller producer cannot. Many of those people have borrowed to develop their farms and build up their herds.  They borrowed on the advice of the Department of the Environment to comply with pollution regulations and so on and now they are not able to meet their loan repayments.  There is another group of farmers who are about to develop or to comply with the pollution regulations but cannot get the money to do so because farmers no longer have any borrowing power with the banks.  No banker wants to see a farmer borrowing for stock.  He will give him money to buy a tractor if he deals in tractor hire or for a lorry if he is in the haulage business but not for farming.</P>
    <P>Let me point out to the Minister the necessity to know with reasonable certainty how future community support arrangements will operate so that farmers can plan for the future.  My concern is to maintain family based farming in the Ireland of the future and to ensure the viability of the rural lifestyle for our children. As a representative of a rural constituency and a farmer, I am sure the Minister shares my concern.  I will continue to champion the cause of family farming and the preservation of rural society.  It frightens me to hear that a 100 acre farmer today is not in a position to meet any commitments beyond family living expenses.  This will have a devastating effect on farmers who have borrowed to stock their lands, to carry out farmyard improvements or to meet the <Col N="170" /> new requirements under the water pollution legislation.  Farmers who have borrowed for those purposes will be unable to meet their repayments.</P>
    <P>What plans has the Minister to alleviate the major hardship on those farmers? It is in all our interests to plan with a degree of certainty and in a stable environment. Our dependence on agriculture is not fully realised.  Proportionately, Ireland is one of the Community's largest exporters of food and drink which account for 25 per cent of the value of our total exports.  Are the producers of the raw materials, the farmers, getting the kind of support they deserve?  Commissioner MacSharry has promised a comprehensive range of rural development measures but we need more than promises now: we need action and we need those developments immediately.</P>
    <P>The decision to get intervention beef paid for at 45 days instead of 120 days is something I have been calling for for a considerable length of time.  It was one of the weaknesses I noted in the intervention system as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I welcome that.  We were told at the time that this would mean an automatic increase of 3p per lb in factories.  Not alone did producers not get the price increase of 3p per lb but the price of cattle was reduced by approximately 8p per lb.  Some weeks ago Ireland looked for intervention facilities of 8,000 tonnes of beef and my understanding is that we got intervention of 2,000 to 2,500 tonnes, one quarter of what we looked for.  I believe that the factories are working in co-operation with each other and if one checks the quotas of factories it is remarkable how close they are to one another.</P>
    <P>Recently the EC Council of Ministers agreed to the importation of 200,000 young cattle and about 50,000 tonnes of processing beef at a time when we cannot sell what we have.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food failed in his duty to farmers by not preventing those imports at a time when cow beef is being sold at 70p per pound.  One cannot be blamed <Col N="171" /> for believing that the Minister for Agriculture and the Agricultural Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, have reneged on the Irish farmers and failed to represent their interests at the negotiations in Brussels.</P>
    <P>It is frightening to realise that for the first time in Irish agriculture the farming community have no creditworthiness with the banking institutions.  Farmers, by and large, are unable to repay loans which they received from the banks and others who need money for investment in livestock or for farm buildings or pollution protection cannot get loans.  This is a clear indication by the banks of lack of confidence in the policies pursued by the Government.  Most of the repayments will not be due until October or November and this will cause a crisis for many farmers at that time.  Lending rates are in the region of 17 per cent and farmers just cannot afford to borrow money because of the amount of the repayments.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points the Minister should immediately implement which would help to alleviate the disastrous situation which exists at present. Farmers should be guaranteed a minimum price level below which cattle will not fall in the spring.  This is of vital importance to the beef farmer but it is also of major importance to the store cattle producer in the west of Ireland.  If there is not a market for beef in the spring it will have an adverse effect on the store trade in the autumn.  It is of vital importance that we have a guaranteed price for spring beef so as to guarantee the future for store cattle producers.</P>
    <P>It is also of vital importance that the Government make low interest loans available to farmers.  As a result of the high capital costs involved, interest rates have become a huge cost on Irish agriculture. It is vital, therefore, for the Minister without any further delay to seek loans in Deutschemarks and they could be made available at 9 per cent when normal bank handling charges are taken into consideration.  I believe that shortterm loans could be made available to <Col N="172" /> farmers at approximately 11 per cent or 6 per cent less than they are at present. The Government would have to underwrite the exchange risks.  However, because of the short duration of the loans, this would prove a very small cost factor to the Exchequer.  Current interest rates are crippling Irish agriculture.  Those loans would help farmers to restructure their present loans and would help them to retain livestock over the winter.  If the present trends continue stock prices in the autumn will be even worse than they are at present.</P>
    <P>The Government should make loans available to farmers to purchase nitrogen for the purpose of a later cut of silage. This was done some years ago and was very effective.  It created a substantial additional amount of winter feed.  It is of vital importance that we face this winter with an adequate quantity of feed so as to prevent farmers from dumping stock on the market later.</P>
    <P>With regard to EC headage schemes the Government have failed drastically over the past three years.  Senator Hussey is well aware of what I am talking about here.  Why the Government have not pursued the question of reclassification of all the disadvantaged areas to severely handicapped so as to ensure that headage payments could be paid to farmers in all of the disadvantaged areas I cannot understand.  It clearly indicates the lack of commitment not alone on the part of the Minister but also on the part of the Government who have failed to make the additional funds available.  This is one way that direct assistance could be given to farmers.  We have not availed of that mechanism.  It is subsidised to the tune of 65 per cent.  It is one way that money could be channelled immediately to farmers but we have not availed of it.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to increase headage payments to the maximum.  At present farmers only receive 50 per cent of what they could get under the headage mechanism.  At this point of crisis in the agriculture industry, the Minister should double the amount of grants available under the headage system and ensure <Col N="173" /> that all grants are paid without any further delay.  With regard to the system of application for those grants and the herd readings, I cannot understand why the applications have only gone out in the last couple of weeks and why the readings for headings payments will not start until August.  What does the Minister propose to do with regard to the vast numbers of farmers who have applied for those schemes but who will not, because of the delay in readings, be able to dispose of their cattle until readings take place?  This inevitably will cause a glut of cattle later in the year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the headage scheme I ask the Minister to announce, without any further delay, that he will accept mart dockets and factory dockets for cattle that have been disposed of and so avoid a glut at the end of the year.  If cattle are held until the headage readings take place, there will inevitably be a major glut of cattle in November and December. I cannot for the life of me understand why it is beyond the powers of the Department of Agriculture not to get those forms out in April rather than in July and have the readings started in May instead of in August.</P>
    <P>I deplore the delay in the payment of the 1989 part of the ewe premium.  I cannot understand why those payments have not been issued since readings for this scheme started last March.  Is it that the Department have not got the finance to meet the payments or that they are understaffed?  I call on the Minister to immediately pay the first part of the 1990 ewe premium together with the 1989 premium. What plans has he to set up a land authority?  This was promised some years ago but unfortunately we have not got it. How long will we have to wait for a land authority?</P>
    <P>With regard to the headage schemes and the ewe premiums, it is of vital importance that the farming community get their hands on this money.  It is no use to them if they have to wait 12 months and pay 17 per cent bank interest in the meantime.  I cannot understand this delay in headage payments.  Part of last year's headage payments have not been paid <Col N="174" /> yet.  Every Senator from a rural community has had to make representations to the Department of Agriculture and Food to try to get those payments cleared. I am sure I am no different to any other Member of this House in that respect.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's policy with regard to agriculture?  What is the future policy with regard to production, what lines of farming would the Minister advise farmers to go into?  For example, milk is tied up with the quota system and unless you have a quota you cannot produce milk.  With regard to beef, you can no longer produce it economically.  It is a recognised fact that you would want to have 500 acres to have have a beef system that would give a family a livelihood. As regards sheep, there is a glut on the market and production costs are not being met.  The Minister has a duty to outline to this House what exactly the future is for agriculture.  Unfortunately I do not see any future in it.</P>
    <P>There are problems in the dairy, beef and sheep industries.  I believe the Department did not plan properly.  As I stated earlier, farmers were told to get into sheep production.  They did so and now they cannot sell their sheep.  They were told that we were 80 per cent self-sufficient in sheepmeat and that there was a market there of 20 per cent but within 12 months we found that market was no longer there.  The market for beef has slumped.  There is absolutely no future there.  Whatever future there may be for steers in so far as that you have an intervention system, limited though it may be, there is absolutely no future for heifer beef.  Where does the Minister see the future for a young farmer taking over a 100 acre farm from his father or uncle? Where can he get money to stock it and what line of production can he go into?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion.  In doing so, I would remind the House of Brendan Behan's words of some years ago, because they become more prophetic, or the wheel has turned the full circle.  In the fifties Brendan Behan said about farming; &ldquo;in Holland it <Col N="175" /> was a science; in England a hobby and in Ireland a bloody misfortune.&rdquo;  If the man was with us today he would have something to say in this debate.  Indeed, he would have uttered many a word by now on the way the fortunes of farming have been declining in recent times.</P>
      <P>There is a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to be a farmer with all the risks involved.  We have this false urban versus rural situation, a false tension and a misunderstanding that one sector can live without dependence on the other sector.  I refer to all the risks involved in farming.  Some are natural, others are produced by external forces such as market conditions and the like.  There is a misunderstanding of what it means to be caught between the world of business, which most farmers have to be today, and the forces of nature; what it means to be up milking at 7 a.m. and negotiating with the bank manager at 10.30 a.m. for loans or further overdraft facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion, before us in a few simple, sharp words, expresses the crisis in farm incomes today.  I ask the Government side of the House to reconsider their amendment, particlarly as they are deleting all the words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo;. They are deleting the reference to calling on the Government to recognise the serious income crisis affecting thousands of Irish farmers.  I think Government Senators realise there is a serious income crisis affecting thousands of Irish farmers.  They should not delete paragraph (1) or (2) but specifically they should not delete paragraph (1) because their own amendment goes on to say that they are recognising the major improvement in farm incomes &mdash; which I will have a word about &mdash; and commend the Government for measures which have been taken during 1990 to maintain farm incomes in the face of the more unfavourable market conditions.  Thus, they are admitting there is a problem, they are admitting there is a crisis, but they are deleting our reference to the serious income crisis that affects thousands of <Col N="176" /> Irish farmers.  They are being inconsistent and their amendment to the motion means absolutely nothing.  They are contradicting themselves if they delete in particular, paragraph (1) of the motion. For the sake of consistency and because I feel they must recognise the crisis facing farmers, I ask them to accept our motion and leave it unamended, because I do not think we are as far apart on this as those Members of this House who would like to play politics with the issue think we are.</P>
    <P>In moving the motion an excellent case has been made by Senator Naughten.  All the primary sectors are facing and have faced appalling times in recent months. Indeed, farm incomes look like being down 20 per cent this year.  No matter what we say about farm incomes in 1989, there was no real increase when inflation is taken into account.  When the stock changes in the national herd are taken into account there was no increase.  There was a nominal increase of 4.5 per cent from the CSO but the CSO does not allow for stock changes and the changes in stock numbers which are included in income.  Therefore, it is not a real increase in the farmer's pocket; there is no increase in farmer's disposable income after inflation.  In 1988 there appeared when one averaged the income increases to be an increase in farm incomes but what we forget about is that there was a huge increase in 1988 for those with viable milk quotas and virtually all the other enterprises were below the line with decreases if not in a standstill position.</P>
    <P>The figures quoted by the CSO are average figures across the board and they hide the fact that there was huge divergence in a two-stream farm income system in the country.  There were the dairy farmers with good quotas and there were the have-nots in virtually every other enterprise.  So let us not dwell too long on the increase in 1989 because the figure hides the tragic crisis of the haves and have-nots in Irish farming today.  Statistics are statistics but they do not tell the truth and they do not give the whole picture.  We have to read behind the lines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> Let us not pretend, and let the Government Senators not pretend, that the vast majority of farmers had not major income problems in 1989 as well.</P>
    <P>We could discuss figures and statistics and the different enterprises but I suppose because of the evening that is in it we must give time to the news about to the GATT negotiations that has broken this evening.  I said last week, when we debated the implications of the GATT, on CAP and on Irish farmers generally, and I have said consistently, that I am extremely worried about the outcome of the GATT in terms of the future for Irish farmers, and the basic family farm, because if we do not accept that as the basic unit of the future of farming in Europe we are at nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>You excluded that in your amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Our motion was accepted last week.  We supported your motion and indeed our amendment included it. If the Senator had listened to us last week he would have no need to be mischievious in the House tonight.  This is far too serious a matter for petty political bickering in this House.  If Senators can tell me that there is not a crisis in farm incomes today I will sit and hear what they have to say, because they must be living in a different country, let alone a different continent, from the rest of us. If we do not protect the basic unit of the Irish family farm in terms of the Common Agricultural Policy we are at nothing, our farm Minister is at nothing, the Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry is at nothing. I would ask him quickly to explain his response to the outcome of the GATT talks that has broken in the news this evening.  Apparently, it means that the ZEEUW paper which was the one on the negotiating table for the last nine or ten days has been accepted.  That means the virtual elimination of export subsidies and substantial and progressive reduction in all farm supports over the next ten years.  It appears that is what we will get as part of Europe now and that appears to be the future for agriculture in this <Col N="178" /> country.  I await with interest the Minister's response.  Hopefully, we will get a detailed response from him on the implications for Irish agriculture.  The Dutch and the Danes will be affected, but the Irish will be affected more than any other country in Europe if this is the agreement we are now facing.</P>
      <P>Agriculture represents 10.5 per cent of their GNP but when you take the Community as a whole it represents only 3.5 per cent of their GNP.  We have far more to lose than virtually any other country in Europe if the US and the CAIRNS group in the GATT talks get their way in terms in liberalisation of agricultural trade in Europe at an unacceptably fast rate.  It is totally unacceptable over ten years because we have yet to hear what the progressive transition period would bring us, how we will wean the agricultural supports from our present system, how we will compensate our farmers in the interim, how we will ensure there is not a total flight from the land within the collapse of farm gate prices if the subsidies are removed too quickly.  We need the answers and we need them fairly quickly in this whole area.</P>
      <P>I said last week &mdash; and I repeat it because it is a very important area &mdash; that I find it very hard to know in the longterm on which side of this argument Ireland's interests lie.  Some 25 years down the road, if we take the right transition steps and if we put in place the proper help to Irish farmers, it is possible that a far more liberal agricultural situation would be to our benefit or would be of benefit to whatever farmers would survive in the interim given that we are a net exporting country and we can claim natural advantage, particularly for grass-based production.  However, I do not know how we are to get from our present position to the ultimate position.  It has never been spelled out.  The Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, has never indicated what are his views.  Commissioner MacSharry has never indicated how Ireland will be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do not forget that the bigger nations in Europe are in a position from their <Col N="179" /> national exchequers to give greater income aid and supports nationally to their farmers than ever we could as a small nation.  If the CAP supports are progressively removed from us, we will not be able to compete and look after our farmers in the same say as the Germans and French, if the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy to meet the requirements of the GATT talks means that Europe no longer supports our primary production and our farmers as it has heretofore.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to suggest that European farmers have been subsidised to a greater rate than those in the US and the Cairns group generally.  An OECD report has highlighted it &mdash; I do not have time to go through this country by country &mdash; but the Japanese farmers, apparently, are the most subsidised, rapidly followed by the situation in the Cairns group and particularly in America.  The US Farm Bill, which was published a few months ago, is riddled with supports and protection mechanisms of all kinds at the very time the US were preaching to Europe about their support for agricultural trade.  We had President Bush in the past day or two lecturing Europe on what is best for European farmers.  He has only to look at the system that operates in his own country; two million US farmers get the equivalent in support as the ten million European farmers.  That does not add up. Yet, we have to be lectured by the US and the Carins group as to what to do with our own farmers.</P>
    <P>We should reform the Common Agricultural Policy only through internal pressures in Europe.  We should reform it along the lines that suits Europe and European farmers.  We should not be forced by external pressure from the US or the Cairns group or any other group. We should not have the gun held to our head.  We should be able to look at other world agricultures.  Let us look to the EFTA countries and how they operate their agricultural system.  We perhaps have a lot to learn from them: low intensity model family farms which answer most of the Common Agricultural <Col N="180" /> Policy's new requirements regarding extensification and, indeed, answer virtually all the environmental requirements on sustainable agriculture and farming sensitively generally.  That is what we have got to look to but the pressure must come internally from Europe so that we can reform our agricultural policy to suit Europe and European farmers and, as far as I am concerned tonight, to suit Ireland and Irish farmers rather than be forced through GATT talks and external pressure to do what we are told by nations that subsidise heavily their own farmers.</P>
    <P>The motion specifically asks that the Government implement measures to alleviate the present income crisis in the areas of beef, store cattle, sheep, milk and cereals.  Most Members would not be here tonight if they were not interested and concerned about the future of Irish farming and Irish farmers generally. Most know the difficulties in all these areas of prime production.  In terms of beef, all grades are back on average £100 per head on this time last year.  My colleague, Senator Naughten, went through the different weights and I will not repeat what he said.  Store cattle is the same. The price of calves has collapsed with over £100 per head off their price.  I admit it might have been a false price for a year or two but the sudden collapse, the expectations having been raised in the previous years, is what is causing the problem.  The high purchase price of stores contributed to the cyclicals in beef production.  The winter fattener got scourged this winter for the third year in succession and bank managers are not looking favourably on forwarding money for winter fattening in the future.  There are increased cycles in beef production, augmented and exacerbated by the APS system.  We need APS but we must ensure that it does not increase the cycles over the 12 months of the year.  Now that the use of hormones is abolished it takes longer and a greater amount of input in terms of feed costs to get cattle to the same weight and then they may not grade to get the higher value.  Altogether, there is a large cycle of problems there which <Col N="181" /> are contributing to the problems in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>Where is the ewe subsidy?  The Minister could have paid the ewe subsidy since April.  The French and the Northern Irish have been paid.  What are we waiting for with lambs half the price of last year, back to £25 a head?  Could it be plainer? What is the Minister playing at?  Why does he not pay our sheep farmers?  Why delay any longer?</P>
    <P>In milk production what is the future for those under 30,000 gallons?  Have they any future in the Europe post-1992? What alleviation will the Minister bring the small dairy farmer at the moment? He should be honest with them.  Is there a future in Europe for the dairy farmer who does not have a viable quota?</P>
    <P>Most of our cereal farmers are facing virtual bankruptcy.  If they have not 500 acres and no bank overdraft they are going nowhere.  They must have storage and drying facilities or they cannot cope with the present co-responsibility levy and the rules they are now governed by in Europe.  Yet, there are, without virtually any penalties at all, corn gluten imports from outside Europe, taking the place of native corn and European corn.  It is plain to see there is an income crisis right across the area.</P>
    <P>Pig prices have taken a down turn. Poultry prices are decreasing and have had difficult times.  There was the BSE scare which had a knock-on effect.  What is the Minister's answer?  What is this Government's answer to the present income crisis?  Why do we have to drag everything from Minister O'Kennedy to help the Irish farmer?  Why cannot he have a policy on the table and be pro-active rather than reactive to the problems of Irish farmers?  Now the GATT talks have let us down again but where is our Minister tonight?  How is he going to stand by as GATT virtually eliminates a future for thousands of Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>I await the Minister's response with interest.  We joined the EC in 1973 because of the benefit to Irish agriculture. We pursued the single market with enthusiasm also but if this Government lets the Irish farmer down we will have <Col N="182" /> no future in Europe and we will be dictated to by external forces, as is happening at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;recognises the major improvement in farm incomes since 1986 and commends the Government for the measures which have been taken during 1990 to maintain farm incomes in the face of the more unfavourable market conditions which prevail at present.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving the amendment, of course, I accept there are serious problems in farming but I do not accept that the Government are unaware of this or that they have not introduced measures to alleviate the income crisis for Irish farmers.  That is the reason I am moving this amendment to the motion today.</P>
      <P>I would find common ground with Senator Doyle in her comments on the GATT negotiations at the present time. Probably the discussions that are taking place in Uruguay are far more serious and have far more serious consequences for the Irish farmer than anything that is happening here at home.  I was very pleased to see that the statement made by President Bush was rejected by our Minister for Agriculture and Food, and indeed by the farming leaders here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must accept that the situation in Europe and in America are quite different. There are ten million people employed in agriculture in Europe at present and the average size of the farms is nine hectares.  Whereas in the United States there are two million farmers and the average size of the farms is 184 hectares. There is quite a different situation and there is no point in President Bush or any of the American negotiators telling us that they are not subsidising their <Col N="183" /> own farmers, because they are subsidising them but perhaps in a more discreet manner than we in Europe are doing it.</P>
    <P>Community agriculture cannot be left entirely to market forces.  It will continue to require support and protection measures for the foreseeable future and that is why it is important that the CAP be maintained for farmers because our farmers could not survive at the present time without subsidies.  We are committed to developing the value of our agricultural production and ensuring that farm incomes are kept at a reasonable level.  For that reason, we can support fully the Community's policies in relation to agriculture in the GATT negotiations. I am not aware of what has emerged this evening from the discussions but I am sure that is not the end of the road.  Those discussions have to go on for some time yet and I still believe the proposals put forward by the European Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry will bear fruit at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>During the past three years farmers have benefited from strong and steady income increases bringing total farm income in real terms to the high point of the decade in 1989.  In the farm price negotiations the Minister for Agriculture and Food succeeded in getting a number of concessions in the intervention system. This is particularly important as far as beef is concerned because this is the biggest problem at present.  The overall limit for intervention was increased to 220,000 tonnes compared to 200,000 tonnes originally proposed by the Commission.  A safety net clause was introduced to provide for unlimited intervention if prices fell below certain levels.  The Council too gave special recognition to the special position of the beef industry to the Irish economy, and that again is very important for us.</P>
    <P>The special recognition of the relative importance of our beef industry has been of particular benefit to us in our dealings with the EC Commission since the adoption of the revised beef régime.  In March 1989 the Minister got special intervention <Col N="184" /> measures adopted to deal with problems that arose at that time.  In the autumn of 1989 he got agreement to aids for private storage scheme which was of crucial importance to the industry during the peak production period.</P>
    <P>Under the new regime of intervention on the basis of tenders, the Minister has vigorously pursued the case of Irish producers, and it is significant to note that during the first years of the tendering system, intervention in Ireland accounts for 47 per cent of the Community total compared to an average of 20 per cent in earlier years.  Even allowing for the fall in prices in recent times, 1990 prices are with the exception of the very high prices in 1988 and spring of 1989, higher than any year since 1984.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the changes made in the intervention system and the acceptance by the Commission of the importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy, which our Minister negotiated in January 1989, allowed us to place significant quantities into intervention during the last 12 months at prices which enabled us to support the market both during the critical autumn months of 1989 and indeed in the early months of 1990.</P>
    <P>Another important suggestion made by our Minister at a more recent meeting, and adopted indeed by the Commission, was that the delay in payment for beef taken into intervention should be reduced from 120 days to 45 days.  This again should help our producers and is a very practical step, taken at the instigation of the Irish negotiators, which will have a positive impact for our producers.</P>
    <P>Another welcome extension was the suckler cow scheme which was extended to include small dairy producers.  I realise, of course, that the beef industry was doing better in 1988 than it is at present but that was a year when some third country markets were buoyant and our industry was able to exploit those markets and reap the benefits.  Some of those markets have now experienced their own difficulties, which means that our exporters have not been able to gain the same access or have had to accept lower prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> I am glad to note that the Council of Ministers have agreed to explore further markets in the Far East and I am sure, if a concentrated effort is made that we will succeed in getting some of our surplus beef into those countries.</P>
    <P>Seasonality of production is something that should be tackled here also.  Most of our cattle are being marketed from September to December while for the rest of the year we see factories working two or three days per week because they cannot get cattle in.  I hope that the group set up by the Minister to examine this and other problems in the industry will come up with a solution acceptable to all.</P>
    <P>I would be very hopeful for our beef industry because we have established on the world market a reputation for top quality beef.  We can exploit still further the favourable conditions prevailing here for the production of top quality beef and we should make every effort to rid our national herd of TB and brucellosis because time is running out and we are fast approaching 1993 when it will be far more difficult to market our cattle and beef unless the incidence of TB is drastically reduced.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say last week in the Seanad that he had provided extra funds for the eradication of TB in the current year.  We know that there are problems in that area at the present time and we know that ERAD, which was set up by the Minister to tackle this problem vigorously, have run into financial troubles and there is a shortfall of £12 million there but, the Minister has provided that money from Exchequer funds. This is an earnest of his commitment and the Government's commitment to get rid of this disease and to tackle it vigorously once and for all and to make sure that our national herd is clear of TB by 1993. We know that the higher number of TB reactors removed in 1989 and again in 1990 are adding to the Exchequer bill. Nevertheless it is better to do that and to tackle it now than to leave the problem for somebody else.</P>
    <P>The Government have recommended that the pre-movement test be reduced from 120 days to 45 days.  That, again, is <Col N="186" /> very good and shows that they have the interest of the industry at heart, and that that will help in no uncertain way to minimise the problems for the farmer and to tackle this problem head on.  The Government are providing this year £48 million for the eradication of bovine TB and, as I said, that is an earnest of their commitment to the eradication of the disease.  I hope we will see the end of the disease before too long.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk in recent times about the sheep flock and the problems in relation to sheep production.  We all know there is a problem because farmers are expecting a drop in price of some £20 to £25 on their lambs.  The provision of subsidies will not solve the problem.  I have said, and I repeat, that part of the problem is created by the large subsidies that were paid to sheep farmers over the last few years because they encouraged everybody to get into sheep production.  We see all over the country people who never owned a sheep in their life now have flocks of sheep because they benefited under the grant scheme. They got into sheep and they have created a problem.  There is a lot that could be done to market lamb, even on the home market, that is not being done. Somebody should have a look at the profit margin available at present for butchers. There must be a huge profit margin there because the price of lamb in the shops and supermarkets has not dropped back in relation to the drop in the price of lamb at the market or factory.  Something should be done about that, somebody is benefiting from this rip off and it is certainly not the farmer.</P>
    <P>The sheep flock is 4.5 million head, an increase of 500,000 on last year's figure. It shows the problem that has been created by the huge grants that are being paid to farmers because people have got into sheep who had never been involved in sheep farming before.</P>
    <P>As was mentioned by Senator Naughten, the Government have reviewed the disadvantaged areas scheme.  That review resulted in a decision to lodge a detailed <Col N="187" /> application with the European Commission seeking agreement for an extension of about two million acres of the present disadvantaged areas by adding new areas to the list of less severely handicapped areas and by designating certain coastal areas as areas suffering from specific handicaps.  They have reclassified as less severely handicapped those areas now designated as mountain sheep grazing areas, again 255,000 acres; they have reclassified as more severely handicapped certain areas &mdash; 1.3 million acres &mdash; now designated as less severely handicapped; and they have restructured the scheme to provide for an increase in headage rates and for greater modulation of payments reflecting different degrees of handicap. That has gone to the Commission in Brussels and we are hopeful that there will be a favourable result and that the increase in headage grants and in other grants that were asked for by Senator Naughten will be made available perhaps in 1991.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the new proposals, together with the existing expenditure under the disadvantaged area scheme, will attract 65 per cent Community recoupment.  When fully implemented the new proposals, together with the abolition this year of the off-farm income restriction, will increase headage payments from £60 million to £100 million a year.  In addition, the newly designated areas will benefit from increased investment aids, exemption from the milk co-responsibility levy and the special supplement to the ewe premium.</P>
    <P>Let nobody tell us that the Government are not concerned about the income of farmers, both big and small, and that they are not able to do something about it.  I wish I had a full hour to highlight what the Government are doing for Irish agriculture at present.  I have only had a short time to go through some of them but I hope I have proved to this House that the Minister and the Government have been active in this area and that they have provided benefits to carry the Irish farmers over this so-called crisis.  It is not a serious crisis.  It is not nearly as serious as what we experienced in 1973 <Col N="188" /> and 1974.  Many Members of this House will remember when such calves were brought from the mart for £1 each.  Thank God we have not reached that situation yet and I hope we do not.  I ask the House to unanimously support this amendment and to show confidence in the Government and in what they are doing for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Hussey's amendment with pleasure.  I also welcome the Minister here tonight.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to this amendment put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party because it is a very important one.  I would like to refer to the drop in milk prices which are caused by world trends.  Milk has come back somewhere between 12p and 15p per gallon on the 1989 prices, but nevertheless this drop in price does not bring us below the 1988 milk price.  Farmers in general never expected the milk price to go so high in 1989 and for this reason I would not be particularly worried about the present fall in the milk price provided it has bottomed out and that milk prices will not drop any further.  At present we have approximately 90p per gallon for 3.55 per cent butter fat and 3.30 per cent protein which is a fair and reasonable price for milk considering the world market trends at present.</P>
      <P>Calf prices certainly have come back to £70 to £90 per head, but calves also were much too dear in 1989 and neither the store cattle farmer nor the beef farmer could make money from them. Store cattle are also a bad trade at the moment because beef is in very poor demand and there is a very depressed market for beef heifers at present.</P>
      <P>With reference to the sheep market, the weakness of sterling has affected the prices.  Moreover, the increase of sheep numbers over the past two years caused a glut on the market and has thereby effectively brought the price down. Nevertheless, there is a good subsidy on ewes and this offsets the loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cereal prices are not wonderful, but this is due to world market trends.  We have so much corn gluten coming into <Col N="189" /> the country from America at a subsidised price that it is depressing our own home market.</P>
    <P>Even though I feel that there is a slight fall in farm incomes since 1989, we must recognise that major improvements have been achieved since 1986.  I commend the Government for the measures which have been taken during this year to maintain farm incomes in the unfavourable market conditions which prevail at present.  The Minister and Minister of State Kirk are doing everything in their power to protect farm incomes in Ireland and I congratulate the Government and the Ministers on doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is indeed a most important motion.  It appears that for almost nine months now our Government were preoccupied with European affairs to the detriment of home matters.  While it is reasonable to compliment the Government on their performance during their six months Presidency, that achievement has caused the administration at home to suffer greatly.  A happier balance must be found in future years to protect against that.</P>
      <P>Beef farmers in particular have been badly hit this year.  The only response I have seen to that was the new TB testing regulations.  I would like to ask the Minister: do the Department for Agriculture and Food or the Minister not monitor the weekly prices, or are our civil servants unable to keep track of the fall in prices from one week to another, from one month to another, from one year to another?  Listening to my colleagues, the proposer the seconder of the amendment, certainly they have not been reading the weekly bulletins from the semi-State organisation with responsibility for our beef sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who says that farmers are having a good year this year are completely out of touch with the situation, because even the weather has been most unseasonal.  I certainly do not blame the Government for that, but the Government must recognise the implications of that and the way that it adds to the difficulties and the fall in prices.  For smaller <Col N="190" /> farmers, who always get the rough end of the stick, the less mechanised farmers who use hay as a high proportion of their winter feed, they are facing considerable losses and have some difficulties to contend with.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask my colleagues on the other side: what contribution do they think the new TB testing regulations will make to our already depressed cattle price situation?  It is horrendous, as a farmer, to contemplate the way one will have to comply with these regulations in a buyers' market.  It certainly does not inspire confidence.  All we on this side of the House sought to do in tabling this motion was to draw the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to those difficulties so that something can be done to give hope, to alleviate the situation, to try to rescue many farm families who will be yet again suffering a fall in income.</P>
    <P>At least 70,000 farm families continue to derive less than £7,500 a year in farm incomes and any suggestion that these farm families are in some way better off than urban families is clearly a misconception. The most significant statistic I read in the <i>1987 Household Budget Survey</i>, published by the CSO, was that the average income earned by farm families was around £119 per week and this compared with an average industrial wage of £189 per week in that year, 1987; and they are the latest statistics in that survey.  For many farm households, because of the low level of farm incomes either the farmer himself or some one or more members of the family has to supplement the farm income by off-farm employment.  That brings the average direct income of farm families up to £200 per week, which is still less than the direct income of the urban households, which it was stated is at £222.</P>
    <P>The survey also shows that the typical farm household is 30 per cent larger than the typical urban household, which means that direct income <i>per capita</i> is as much as 25 per cent higher in urban households.  Another big difference between farm households and urban <Col N="191" /> households is that farm households contain twice as many people aged over 66 or of pensionable age.  That means that farm households obviously benefit from old age pensions, which bolster the farm income figures to some extent.</P>
    <P>The industry has been crying out for a long-term agricultural policy, which we have not got even from the EC for many years.  The last effort the Community made in this was to announce a set-aside policy, which, I doubt was implemented to any great degree in this country.  I think that is very much a negative attitude. What the farming industry requires are new outlets, new markets for farm produce and not payments for leaving the land idle to grow nettles, docks or buachalláns or whatever.</P>
    <P>It is not untimely to introduce a new and dynamic concept of non-food crops. There is, of course, a regime for rape seed oil in the European Community.  We have in this country State ownership of almost one quarter of a million acres of cut-over bogs, which the Government have decided will go to the State forestry organisation, Coillte Teoranta.  Everybody except the Government must surely be aware that the residual depth of peat left in those cut-over bogs is insufficient to carry grown and mature trees.  When you consider the fact that the vast majority of this acreage was compulsorily acquired for as little as half a crown an acre from the farm families who owned it, is it not time to look perhaps for a more economic usage for these acres? Now that there is clearly in Europe a new technology to utilise rape seed oil as a non-food crop, to utilise it as an energy crop &mdash; and that is clearly demonstrated with the introduction of the Elsbett environmental engine &mdash; I would hope there would be a rethink on the part of the Government in regard to the usage of the cut-over bogs.  This affect the Midlands, where we have lost over 2,000 industrial skilled jobs in the past three or four years.  That is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey, in proposing his amendment, spoke of the ten million farmers in the European Community <Col N="192" /> with an average of nine hectares each compared with the two million US farmers with 184 hectares each.  He admitted that our farmers cannot survive without subsidies.  This, of course, is where the crunch comes with the new agreements we will be reading about in more detail over the next few days.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey told us of the prices that were achieved in the past, of the increases over the past year, but what is important to the farmers of today are the farm incomes for 1990 and that is what we must be preoccupied with in this debate.  It is what this debate intends to do &mdash; to bring the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to the difficulties facing very many families.</P>
    <P>As has already been said, cattle prices are down over the past number of weeks at least £100 per head right across the board in all categories.  The price of sheep has been aggravated by the fact that the ewe subsidies have not been brought forward or paid, which means that they are adding to the difficulties.  This is something which could be organised by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>In regard to milk, where we have clearly a drop of 15p or 16p per gallon compared with last year, the entire industry would appear to be on the decline.  It is literally a closed shop for thousands of young farmers, even farmers who have sat and won their green certificates and are otherwise highly qualified.</P>
    <P>The shocking drop in sheep prices, the lower cattle prices, the 16p reduction in the price of the gallon of milk means that farm incomes will be down at least 10 per cent this year.  Unless urgent steps are taken, this will mean a return to a period of uncertainty, where farmers will not be able to meet their obligations to their banks and to other lending agencies, whether they be co-ops or merchants. That will put us back into a difficult situation again.  It is unfortunate that that should be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>I would not like the suggestion to go from here that the reason this motion was put down was to embarrass the Government. The fact that the Government are taking no steps to change or improve the <Col N="193" /> situation over the past number of weeks is a cause for considerable concern.  We feel there must be some recognition of the difficulties being experienced not just in relation to store cattle, sheep, milk and cereals, but there has to be a policy to bring hope &mdash; a policy that will keep the younger farmers on the land.  They are perhaps better educated than any previous generation, because it is not possible to take on farm ownership or to have a farm transferred to a son or a successor now without their having a certificate of competency or a green certificate. This was a very positive and proper step.  The young farmer now who would accept the gift of 100 acres of land, or certainly less than 100 acres of land, would need to think very seriously, because if he was not able to sell it he would be signing himself into hardship for life.  That is a problem.  This Government, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his two Ministers of State have a heavy responsibility to ensure that there must be a future in farm incomes.</P>
    <P>I support the motion so very ably proposed by Senator Naughten and seconded by Senator Doyle and I would ask the House to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that my party, the Progressive Democrats, fully realise the seriousness of the income problem within Irish agriculture.  In that sense I support the first part of the motion as proposed by Senator Naughten.  I do not think many people would need convincing as to the depth of the problem which confronts people living in rural areas, and particularly on smaller family farms.  In that connection, if I am not out of order, I would like to welcome representatives of the United Farmers Association to the Visitors Gallery here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully agree that there is an income crisis.  I also accept that incomes did increase during the latter half of the decade, but they increased very modestly and only were of an acceptable level because of the fact that inflation finally came under control.  We all know what happened in the early part of the decade <Col N="194" /> when we had inflation totally out of control and we had price levels being increased by very modest amounts from Brussels and related to European levels of inflation, which were very much less than ours, and that lead to the squeeze on farm incomes.  That was a fundamental problem.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much point in me giving a catalogue of what sheep prices, beef prices, calf prices and milk prices.  Every farmer knows the price of what he is selling; they have been catalogued already here this evening.  Suffice to say that in virtually every commodity the price the farmer is receiving today is less than it was six months ago; it is certainly less than it was last autumn.  As a tillage farmer myself, I know what the stabiliser mechanism is doing to us in terms of an automatic 3 per cent reduction in prices every year.  Only today I learned that there is a prospect of a reasonably good harvest, and thank God for that.  I hope that we do have a good harvest and that it is safely collected, but once again, the consequences of a good harvest will be another automatic cut in prices, more co-responsbility levy and to say to a farmer that he must have so many pounds deducted from his income when it is a very modest income &mdash; it is only a plus income on the large acreages &mdash; is a matter of extreme concern.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that there are people leaving the land daily.  There are people leaving the land of Ireland daily. There are people who are forced to take the emigrant ship or to take the plane to make a living somewhere else.  I do not if that is the Governments' responsibility, Brussels' responsibility, or somebody else's responsibility, but it is a fact that the people are leaving.  The year for which we have the most figures indicates that something like ten or 11 people a day were leaving the land and going abroad or going onto the labour market which is already over-supplied.  How can they be accommodated there?</P>
    <P>I am pessimistic about the future of the industry, and I share the sentiments which were expressed earlier about the <Col N="195" /> division between town and country.  It is something that we have already referred to here in the last couple of weeks when we discussed GATT.  Agriculture is central to the welfare of our economy and to the welfare of our people, just as industry is central to their welfare.  There seems to be a presumption abroad that it is almost not in the national interest for farmers to do well &mdash; and, of course, it is very much the reverse.  If there is money in farming, there is money in the rural towns and there is a greater air of optimism abroad.  It is in all our interests, because of the importance of agriculture within our economy, that agriculture does well.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of GATT.  We debated GATT here over the past two weeks.  The motion which the Progressive Democrats put down was out of concern for what was happening in the GATT Round of talks and to bring the attention of the people in Brussels to the opinion of this Parliament, and the opinion of this Government and to the opinion of this country, and there was no apology for that.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest what Senator Doyle had to say about defending the family farm.  I fully subscribe to that.  That is central to the whole philosophy of my party and I know it is central to the agreed Programme for Government.  I did find it somewhat curious for Senator Doyle to say that she was supporting the family farm when the amendment Fine Gael put down last week to the GATT proposal excluded the family farm.  It said: &ldquo;in the interests of producers and consumers&rdquo;. The family farm is central to what we are as a nation.  The family farm must be defended without fear or favour.  The people in Brussels must know about the central importance of the family farm to this country.  The people in GATT must know of the central importance of the family farm and that we are not prepared to compromise.</P>
    <P>The Community is not prepared to sell itself down the river in the face of American bullying.  The doctrine which America is putting forward in the GATT <Col N="196" /> Round is a very attractive doctrine &mdash; the doctrine of market liberalisation, the doctrine of a free for all, but it is a doctrine based on self-interest.  America knows that its farms are very much larger than ours.  America knows that it can compete on the world market very much more successfully than the smaller European farmer.  It is totally out of self-interest that America is pushing their line in the talks.  It is a line which must be resisted, and I am glad that the Minister this afternoon and the farming organisations have responded to what came out of the G7 talks.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, it should be remarked that there are only seven countries involved.  There are 98 countries in GATT.  I am sure the 91 other countries have something to say about the matter. I look forward to the Commission defending the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy and defending the family farm.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the growth in sheep numbers and that people were advised to go into sheep &mdash; I submit that it was very correct that they were advised to go into sheep.  Certainly, many farming incomes improved over recent years because of taking that advice.  That is not to say there are not serious marketing problems at the moment.  Of course, there are; and of course it is difficult for people to see a very big drop in the price of sheep meat.  I would say that the advice was correct at the time and that it has brought national benefit.</P>
    <P>The problems that are there now must be addressed and must be overcome.  The point that needs to be made is that we have a perception of ourselves as a clean, environment-friendly country.  We do produce extremely good agricultural products.  We have some of the best food in the world.  If we have some of the best food in the world, the question arises: why do we not go out and market it?  I said before in this House that if we were to capture even an additional 1 per cent. of the European market it would have enormous national beneficial consequences. Any multinational company launching a product and going on to the <Col N="197" /> market would expect to capture at least 1 per cent of the market.  Why can we not have a national marketing drive for our agricultural products?  The price is the problem; Let us see what we can do about it.</P>

    <Title>Shannon Navigation Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The propose of this Bill is to update the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the Shannon Navigation and to provide the necessary powers for the restoration and taking into care of the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell navigation.</P>
      <P>The river Shannon is one of the greatest natural assets which this country possesses, particularly at the present time when the need for leisure and recreational facilities is widely appreciated.  It is possible now for boats to navigate from the estuary at Limerick to Acres Lake near Drumshanbo in County Leitrim and by way of the Boyle water into Lough Key, near Boyle in County Roscommon, but this was not always the case.  Prior to the middle of the 18th Century only intermittent stretches of the river were navigable.</P>
      <P>The establishment of Commissioners of Inland Navigation in 1751 marked the beginning of a serious effort to establish a through navigation.  By 1787, when those commissioners were dissolved, navigation was possible between Killaloe and Carrick-on-Shannon.  Control later passed to the Directors General of Inland Navigation and, following the construction of 11 locks and significant stretches of canal to by-pass serious obstacles in the river, the entire navigation from the estuary to Lough Allen was opened up by 1814.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Completion of the Grand and Royal Canals in the early 1800s provided links with Dublin and regular cargo and passenger services operated between there <Col N="198" /> and Limerick.  Many defects, however, manifested themselves in the Shannon navigation and, after an examination of the position by a commission of inquiry, Shannon Commissioners were appointed in 1835 to prepare detailed plans for its improvement.  The 1839 Act for the Improvement of the Navigaton of the River Shannon, which the Bill before the House is intended to extend, provided for major improvement of the navigation and vested the care and conservancy of it in the Shannon Commissioners.  That Act also provided the framework for regulations and by-laws and defined the limits of jurisdiction of the Commissioners. An extensive scheme of works, carried out between 1839 and 1846 and involving deepening of significant stretches, construction of huge weirs and locks and rebuilding of many bridges, transformed the waterway.</P>
    <P>In 1846, the powers and duties of the Shannon Commissioners were transferred by statute to the Commissioners of Public Works, with whom they have since remained.</P>
    <P>Despite the creation of a high quality navigable route and despite the link to Dublin and the east of the country, the volume of traffic was disappointing.  The relatively sparse population distribution, lack of industrial activity and absence of bulky materials such as ore, which were the mainstay of waterways in other countries all contributed to low traffic levels.  The coming of the railways from the mid-19th Century and further depopulation of the western part of the country led to a serious decline in both goods and passenger traffic.  Surprisingly, despite the ominous trends, a successful summertime passenger steamer service operated between Killaloe and Carrick-on-Shannon for several years at the turn of this century.</P>
    <P>The decline in traffic continued and the condition of the navigation began to deteriorate.  However, CIE operated summer passenger cruises from the mid-1950s and although the navigation was originally intended for commercial traffic, slowly with the improving economic climate pleasure boat traffic began <Col N="199" /> to emerge and by the early 1960s boats were available for hire.  The Office of Public Works restored the operating condition of the waterway and traffic grew steadily.</P>
    <P>Over the last 25 years there has been a major transformation of the river.  The Office of Public Works has expended very significant sums of money on the provision of quays and harbours at many locations and several others are planned for the next few years.  Among the centres where major new facilities have been provided are Lough Key, Drumsna, Dromod, Lecarrow, Hodson's Bay, Clonmacnoise, Portumna and Dromineer, while further works are in progress or planned for Roosky, Portrunny and along the river Suck.  It is intended to open the Suck navigational link with Ballinasloe.  The budget for 1990 for the Shannon is almost £1 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision of these berthing facilities there is, of course, an ongoing programme of maintenance of the waterway.  These works, which include dredging, hydrographic surveying, the provision of water and other services and the marking of hazards and navigation routes, are vital to preserve the navigation in a safe and pleasant condition.</P>
    <P>The powers of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to Shannon Navigation, which derived initiallty from the 1839 and 1846 Acts have been obscured by various enactments since that time.  In effect, the only statutory power which the Commissioners of Public Works now clearly hold is that related to the maintenance of the navigation and to raise very minimal tolls and charges.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of section 39 of the 1839 Act the boundaries of the Shannon Navigation were defined.  Additional property has, in the interim, been acquired as worthwhile additions to the navigation facilities but these fall to be administered as State property under the State Property Act of 1954.  It is highly desirable that these properties, together with any subsequent acquisitions and any <Col N="200" /> extensions to the navigable waterway, should be within the ambit of the Shannon Navigation legislation.  The only satisfactory method of resolving the matter is by the introduction of new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal is the name given to the junction navigation that once linked the Shannon and Erne navigations.  It was 39 miles long and it consisted of a still-water canal from the River Shannon near Leitrim village to Lough Scur, a distance of 5.3 miles, and the canalised Woodford River from Lough Scur to Upper Lough Erne at a point about 4.5 miles north of Belturbet in County Cavan, a distance of 33.6 miles.  The canal rose about 80 feet through eight locks from the Shannon to Lough Scur.  From Lough Scur it fell about 70 feet, also through eight locks, and passed through the towns of Ballinamore in County Leitrim and Ballyconnell in County Cavan on its way to the Erne.</P>
    <P>The proposal to link the Erne and Shannon systems was first mooted some two centuries ago but, while some work was done at that time including partial construction of a lock at Corraquill, or Caroul, between Lough Erne and Ballyconnell, it came to a halt in 1792 and was not resumed for over half a century.</P>
    <P>Two events in 1842 gave an impetus to a resumption of the project.  The first was the completion of the Ulster Canal which linked the Erne with the other navigations in eastern Ulster and the desire at the time to extend the connection westward to the Shannon.  The second was the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act of that year which made provision for the carrying out of river works &ldquo;to promote the drainage of lands and improvement of navigation and water power in connection with such drainage&rdquo;.  There was confidence at that time that a link between the two major navigation systems would generate through traffic between them and that industry and agriculture in the area would generate local traffic and would derive benefit from the facility.</P>
    <P>A combined drainage and navigation scheme was drawn up by the Commissioners of Public Works and drainage <Col N="201" /> works were commenced in mid-1846. Work on the navigation started 18 months later.  The navigation design called for a depth of six feet of water over lock cills and in channels and for locks 82 feet long by 16 feet 6 inches wide. However, as an economy measure during construction, depths were reduced to 4 feet 6 inches over considerable stretches of channel and in some places they were subsequently found not to exceed 3 feet 6 inches.</P>
    <P>Under a further Act of 1856 the operation and maintenance of the completed drainage and navigation works were handed over to separate boards of trustees.  In the case of the navigation this took effect on July 1860.</P>
    <P>In October 1860 an engineer, appointed by the navigation trustees to direct and supervise the maintenance work, carried out a survey of the works as completed and listed many faults.  These included inadequate depth over considerable lengths, rock and silt in lakes, bank slips and badly constructed locks and fittings.  He reported that effectively only small steamers could use the navigation.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to say if these criticisms at the time were valid or exaggerated. However, neither through nor local traffic materialised.  Lack of traffic meant lack of revenue which in turn led to poor maintenance.  Conditions got worse and passage through the canal got more difficult.  A report in 1875 indicated that the navigation was even at that time sinking into a derelict state.</P>
    <P>The navigation trustees, however, continued in existence with two interruptions until 1948 but, although they have not met since then, and no elections have been held, there has been no formal move to wind them up or to transfer their duties and responsibilies to any other body.</P>
    <P>The navigation has been unusable as such for well over 100 years.  During the most of that period it has been permitted to decay with only piecemeal attempts at maintenance.  However, apart from unauthorised interference with a number of the weirs there has been very little deliberate demolition and substantial <Col N="202" /> parts of the works have survived remarkably well.  The visible evidence of these works, notably some of the locks on the western leg that appear to be in very good condition, has continued to fuel a desire to see the navigation restored.  The revival in recent decades of the Shannon and Erne navigation systems for pleasure cruising and other recreational uses has given impetus to the project.</P>
    <P>The area served by the canal has relatively little manufacturing industry and comparatively poor agricultural land and, in the circumstances, tourism represents the major element in any future plans for the development of the area.  The restoration of the navigation is a significant move in this direction.  Much has already been said about both the history and current status of the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell canal.  I refer in particular to the lengthy debate on the Second Stage in the Dáil on 8 May 1990 and during the Committee Stage on 5 July 1990.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the statutory powers necessary for the restoration of the link between the Shannon and Erne navigations should be incorporated in the Shannon Navigation Bill.  The Bill provides that the restoration may be undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works or by such other person or persons to whom those powers may be delegated by order by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also allow the commissioners to maintain and operate navigation facilities on the River Erne in the State, including Lough Oughter, which is connected to the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell navigation and for which there is no navigation authority at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also have the effect of applying the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell drainage district as is the case with all other drainage districts within the State.  Hitherto, statutory responsibility for maintenance of these drainage works has been vested in Drainage Trustees, the cost being borne ultimately by the local authorities.  Henceforth, responsibility for maintenance of these works will lie directly with the local authorities.  This <Col N="203" /> particular aspect of the Bill was the subject as well of a lengthy debate during the Committee Stage in the Dáil, but I am satisfied that the course which has been followed in this Bill is the proper one.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a comprehensive one which overcomes the deficiencies of the old enactments and will enable the commissioners to properly undertake the care, management, control, improvement and development of the Shannon navigation, including the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell navigation and the section of the River Erne Navigation within the State.  As I have stated during previous debates, potential for joint ventures with public and private interests will be fully explored and the whole development programme offers excellent opportunities for further development along the whole system.</P>
    <P>It will empower the commissioners to make charges for the use of the navigation facilities provided by them, to make by-laws for the control of the users of those facilities, to acquire and dispose of property, to enter on adjoining lands for the purpose of inspecting, surveying and carrying out works to the navigation and to extend the limits of the navigation. The Bill, of course, also contains adequate safeguards for the rights of existing landowners.</P>
    <P>The Bill empowers the commissioners to control pollution from boats using the navigation.  However, the general question of pollution of rivers is the responsibility of local authorities under the Water Pollution Act.  It would not be appropriate for the commissioners to duplicate the efforts of the local authorities in this regard.</P>
    <P>In this time of greatly increased interest in our waterways systems by both home and international users I am confident that this House will agree that the Commissioners of Public Works should be given the necessary statutory powers for the control and management of the Shannon Navigation as a single entity to assure its vital role as the major asset that it is.  I am similarly convinced that the <Col N="204" /> management and development of the navigation should be directed towards maximising its contribution to tourism revenues and charges fixed accordingly.</P>
    <P>The tourist potential of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell link is uppermost in my mind.  The significance of this North-South link in bringing tourists from the South into the Northern waterways and those from Northern Ireland into our own waterways will have many benefits.  The advantages to the small towns and villages along the route of the canal with tourism revenues from North and South is an important feature of the project.  The authorities in Northern Ireland are fully supportive of the venture and I see it as an important initiative adding to our North-South links.</P>
    <P>In the development of our waterways currently under the direction of the Commissioners of Public Works and its further extension proposed in this Bill the extensive waterways will match those available in any other countries, such as the United Kingdom and France.  These waterways are increasingly seen as essential ingredients in the tourism attractions available to visitors.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Navigations Bill provides the necessary means whereby the future of these waterways will be assured.  I had the opportunity recently in a helicopter to view and examine the whole area with the aid of my professional and technical advisers.  It will be possible in a few years to take a boat from the new marina which is at present under construction in Kilrush in the Lower Shannon, move through the navigation in Limerick into Lough Derg and into the Shannon catchment, and right up through the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  In the near future it will be possible to link Limerick with Derry.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I want to welcome this Bill.  Might I say at the outset that I do not have the responsibility of being spokesman for the Office of Public Works, so if my views are a bit disjointed I hope the Minister will pardon me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a tremendous Bill.  I wish to <Col N="205" /> compliment the Minister on the background he has provided for the House this evening which leaves nobody in any doubt not only about the origins of waterways in this country but about their evolvement and the coming together of the various private companies which have endowed this country with a wonderful network of waterways.  The only one the Minister omitted to mention was the canal through the Barrow Navigation. While many of the locks are narrow it flows in south Carlow and Kilkenny through most magnificent valleys.  It is the only stretch of the canal that goes through Laois.  In the Offaly portion of the constituency we are very proud of the canals and we are very happy they have been retained.</P>
    <P>The first time I can remember coming into contact with the canals was when I was at a dance in the old St. Mary's Hall in Tullamore many years ago.  I met a very nice girl who told me that her father was the harbourmaster.  I said: Where in Tullamore?  I thought that, perhaps, I had too much to drink.  Each of the canals had harbours and harbourmasters.  That was back in the forties and fifties.  Twenty years ago, I am glad to say, I played a role in ensuring that the canals were not filled in.  It was a very determined effort by many people, who were looked upon as cranks by the powers-that-be, who saved that tremendous inheritance for the people and country.</P>
    <P>I want to wish the Minister every possible success.  I was glad when a couple of years ago, the Office of Public Works acquired the canals from CIE.  When CIE took them over originally there was considerable traffic with beet and turf.  After the demise of that trade the canals were looked upon by the transport company as a millstone around their necks.  I am glad that the Office of Public Works are taking this very seriously.  They inherited a workforce from CIE that upheld a noble tradition which has served the country well, and have worked extremely hard maintaining the services right down the years.  Might I compliment the Office of Public Works on restoring the portion of the canal outside Edenderry which burst <Col N="206" /> with such catastrophic effect some two years ago?  In my 30 years as a Member of the House, this was the first time a Minister had an official function in the constituency to which I did not get an official invitation.  It is no harm to remind people that one is still around.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank my colleague, Senator O'Toole.  I want to compliment the Minister and the Office of Public Works.  I would like to be very serious.  We are in an era where there is tremendous interest in the waterways as a leisure activity.  We have an extremely valuable asset which, coupled with our relatively clean and wholesome environment, must surely be a tremendous attraction from the marketing point of view for people who wish to engage in boating holidays.  The water ways in the UK are overcrowded compared with our canals or the Shannon and there is considerable pollution there.  The great waterways of Europe, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark have very heavy traffic.  From the point of view of the people navigating those waterways this kind of travel is not restful. It is not possible to relax because there is so much traffic and activity.  It is a very serious business if one is navigating the canals or the rivers there.  The unfortunate and outrageous pollution is also evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his excellent introduction &mdash; his Second Reading speech &mdash; that the Bill empowers the commissioners to control pollution from boats using the navigation.  He still points out that the local authorities would still retain responsibility for them under the Water Pollution Act.  If the Minister plans, with the Minister for Tourism and <Col N="207" /> Transport that the waterways should be a very important basis for significant development and improvement in our tourist trade and in the infrastructure of our tourist industry, then he must introduce the most stringent regulations.  That is important.  If we are going to sell ourselves as a place in which to relax and to bring one's boat or cruiser onto Irish waterways and if we sell them as uncrowded waterways with a clean environment, they should be maintained to whatever standard we set.  I would hope that there would be close co-operation, not only with the Minister for Tourism and Transport and the Minister for Local Government but with the local authorities to ensure that sewage disposal effluent will not pollute the tourist navigation stretches of waterways.</P>
    <P>We should be able to police those tourist areas from the point of view of either industrial or agricultural pollution. Indeed, with regard to pollution on the waterway itself, I would like to see regulations brought in to ensure that all combustion engines on our waterways used environmentally friendly fuel and that they could be confined to engines run on vegetable oils only, which are non-pollutant and would also serve to fatten the fish.  That is a possibility.  Since we are starting from a fairly low base from the point of view of numbers of boats per mile of waterway, it is something that could be implemented.  It is something that the Minister should consider seriously.  If the Minister would not be offended, I will submit to his office details of such new technology for his perusal.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, in presenting this Bill, commenced a completely new phase for the preservation and development of the canals and navigable rivers.  The fact that cross-Border waterways are being re-opened, perhaps for the first time, is most important.  We should recognise and welcome the generosity and interest of the Irish American fund which has made a contribution towards this.  While I have the greatest respect for the work and the craftsmanship of the Office of Public Works and for the care they take of our <Col N="208" /> national monuments, I would be happier if the Minister set up a waterways authority that would have a responsibility not just the Shannon but every other waterway in the country.  Perhaps this authority could report directly to the Minister.  I would like to see a waterways authority with the power to lay down fairly stringent rules and regulations.  This is important.</P>
    <P>Even though the Minister told us that these canals have been there since 1751 and the earlier part of the 18th century I still think we are turning over a completely new leaf.  I compliment the Minister on that.  I would like to see a 1990 administrative facility being set up.  I would like to see all the waterways being brought very closely under one umbrella. We should have rules and regulations that would be acceptable right across every mile of waterway.  Such an authority should have powers to regulate the type of boats and everything that one would want in order to develop this very important national asset, not just for the people of Ireland, but to attract the clientele who can afford to engage in water sports of this type.  They are expensive leisure activities.</P>
    <P>I would like to again compliment the Minister and to wish this Bill a speedy passage through the House.  It is important that it be enacted as early as possible so that the regulations can be put in place that will ensure lasting benefit to the areas in question.  My colleague, the Leader of the House, Senator Fallon, who lives beside the Shannon in Athlone, I am sure will agree that it is always very pleasant to see the activity on the Shannon.  I do not think we realise the full potential of that magnificent river to our tourism-earning capacity.</P>
    <P>I hope, through this Bill, we shall be able to have the infrastructure facilities boosted to such an extent we will reclaim our position as the best location for water leisure sports in the European Community. I wish the Bill every success.  I compliment the Minister on his work to date on this.  There are one or two amendments I understand my party would like <Col N="209" /> to table.  I hope we will have an opportunity of discussing them in full on the next Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to update the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the Shannon navigation and to transfer to the commissioners the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell navigation with powers for its restoration by them or by other persons to whom those powers may be delegated by order of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I believe that any legislation dealing with the Shannon should be dealt with very carefully and closely examined because for many people the river Shannon represents almost a complete way of life whether it be swimming, fishing, boating, sailing or any other water activity.  The river Shannon is a hive of activity and it is obviously something that we must guard and protect.</P>
      <P>I do not have to refer to the tourism potential of the river Shannon and its lakes, which continues to grow all the time.  Of course, the other side of the coin is the havoc the river Shannon flooding cause to many people, the hardship and inconvenience that can be caused to them.  Last winter, I suppose, was the worst in this regard for the past 50 years or so.</P>
      <P>The transfer of the navigation powers of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal to the commissioners is very welcome.  As we know, there is no navigation authority there at present.  I understand the waterway has been unusable for almost 100 years so, obviously, much work has to be done.  Clearly, this is an area which can be of great benefit from a tourism point of view.  I believe it is a very wise move to proceed with the development of the navigation in this area; the reopening of the canal can benefit the general area in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great strides have been made on the Shannon over the past 25 to 30 years. Before that I remember the famous Guinness barges.  In the fifties or thereabouts I remember CIE operated summer passenger cruises.  Cruisers were <Col N="210" /> very much a feature of the Shannon at that time and my recollections of those boats are very happy ones indeed.  They were moored at Portumna and certainly at the docks at Athlone they were known as the <i>St. Ciaran</i> and the <i>St. Brendan.</i>  I had many trips on them to Lough Ree an downstream to places like Clonmacnoise and further on.  In many ways those CIE pleasure boats could be described as the forerunner to the cabin cruisers we now have on the Shannon and other rivers and other craft that are now for hire.</P>
    <P>I believe a waterway like the Shannon, to reach its full potential, must have proper berthage and the Office of Public Works have recognised this over the years.  In my own area close to Athlone these new developments have taken place upsteam at Lecarrow, the Hodson Bay and downstream to Clonmacnoise. Only this morning I received from the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Brennan, a notice announcing EC aid for tourism projects.  He said that just £2 million had been approved for a number of waterway facilities including a major new waterworld at Bundoran, County Donegal.  He spoke about other places, in particular, he referred to cruising developments at Banagher, Carrick-on-Shannon and Athlone, all areas on the Shannon.  It is something I welcome very much.  Other developments that are so necessary to such a large waterway, such as the marking of hazards and the navigation routes have been provided over the years.  All of this work has been done generally to improve and make navigation safe.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is perhaps the section which might cause worry to some boat owners. In general, it can be said that boat owners accept and appreciate that the commissioners have the right to control navigation but many of them see the principle of legislation as something new.  It is understandable that an element of caution exists on the part of many boat owners in this regard but, in general, they recognise the need to behave responsibly, to berth properly, to keep harbours clear and generally they act responsibly on the rivers.  The worry some boat owners have <Col N="211" /> in this regard is that the majority might be penalised for the deeds of the few.</P>
    <P>Boat owners using the river Shannon accept the great strides that have been made that have greatly improved the waterway network.  I do not believe that a few pounds registration fee will keep boat owners off the river, particularly in view of the great progress that has been made to date and the future plans for the river.  Indeed, the Minister indicated that the budget for 1990 for the Shannon is in the region of £1 million and that is to be welcomed.  I urge the Minister strongly, when the time comes to prepare the by-laws, that full discussions be entered into with the various boat owners associations, in particular the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland.  The Minister might confirm the registration will apply to cabin cruisers only as distinct from ordinary rowboats, lake boats, sailing boats and dinghies.</P>
    <P>On section 3 (1) (m) of the Bill there are different views on the period of the licence, whether it be for one year or some other specified period.  These are points on which boat owners would like to have discussions.  I ask the Minister to enter into discussion with them at by-law preparation stage.  I also ask him to confirm that berthage charges are for winter moorings only on public quays and public jetties.  My plea &mdash; I know the Minister will respond positively &mdash; comes back to urging him to enter into discussions with organisations such as the Inland Waterways Association and other boat owners so that they may make an input into the by-law.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a very important matter.  It is well known and accepted that the pollution of rivers is the responsibility of the local authorities.  The Minister has indicated that the Bill empowers the commissioners to control pollution from boats using the navigation.  This should be highlighted.  It is very important to know this.  Sadly, from time to time, we have spills of oil and petrol into the rivers.  This is all too common unfortunately.  It should be highlighted <Col N="212" /> that this Bill empowers the commissioners to control pollution from boats using the navigation.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the passage of this important Bill.  The development of our inland waterways has never been as promising as now.  This is a further development which, hopefully, will guarantee the future of the waterways that are referred to in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I welcome the Bill and the possibility in the not too distant future of the Ballinamore Ballyconnell Canal being open again with all the potential it has to offer.  I became aware of the extraordinary attraction and the amenity of our inland waterways some ten or 12 years ago when I took a trip on the Barrow navigation going in at Leighlinbridge going down a far as St. Mullins.  We could not afford one of the larger more luxurious Shannon type boats but four of us and a dog rented a mere dinghy.  It was a somewhat hazardous outing but one which we all greatly enjoyed and it really brought home to us the extraordinary amenities that are on offer.</P>
      <P>The first of many protests I was involved in was to save the Grand Canal. It is worth reflecting, when so much of our heritage and so many possible amenities are under threat, and reminding ourselves of the very active proposal being pursued by Dublin Corporation to lay a sewer on the bed of the Grand Canal, then to cover in the canal and to put in a six lane highway thereby effectively obliterating that entire section of the Grand Canal which we know to be such an important linear park within the city.</P>
      <P>I would like to give special mention here to the excellent work that has been done and I encourage anybody here, who has not seen it, to look at the recent work which has been carried out by the Commissioners for Public Works and other bodies on the stretch of the canal between Leeson Street and Baggot Street Bridge.  It is commendable and a most outstanding amenity for the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context it would be no harm to mention the sad condition of sections of <Col N="213" /> the Royal Canal especially those near the city, which need attention desperately and some areas are a total disgrace.  I hope that Dublin Corporation will not seek to obliterate, as the last proposal did, any section of the canal because it is very important.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Inland Waterways Assocation on the amazing work they have done in a very quiet but very efficient way down through the years. They are an outstanding body.  They first mooted the whole idea of developing the Grand Canal basin which has now been taken up and which I hope will come to fruition in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The wonderful thing about the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal is that it is going through areas which can only be described as the most disadvantaged and underdeveloped in Ireland &mdash; Cavan and Leitrim.  It might be salutory to note the decimation of the population in those counties.  In the County Leitirm area the population dropped by 50 per cent in the 50 years between 1926 and 1986.  In the Cavan area &mdash; parts of County Cavan are more prosperous &mdash; overall 35 per cent of the population have left.  The tourist revenue accruing to those counties is minimal, negligible, virtually non-existent.  Only one per cent of tourist revenue accrues in the County Leitrim area and two per cent in the County Cavan area.</P>
    <P>Last week I visited County Cavan.  I was in Stradone, Bailieborough, Virginia and Lough Gowna and I was amazed and delighted by the enthusiasm of the people there to develop whatever amenities they have because tourism will provide a boost for the local economy.  I was in a small village in Loughglynn the day before yesterday and on the main street there was no fewer than 12 derelict houses, which is very undermining for the people in the locality.</P>
    <P>I would like also to mention that in the Cathaoirleach's County of Roscommon. The county manager there has a most enligtened approach to the development of tourism in that locality.  He is undertaking with Structural Funds and with <Col N="214" /> other assistance, a number of interesting projects.  I refer particulary to the King House in Boyle which I visited, a magnificant early 18th century house and its potential for tourism is being recognised. There are many other amenities in the area.  That sort of attitude is growing, and the opening of this section of the navigation will do an enormous amount to bring prosperity to that very disadvantaged region.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte told me recently &mdash; other Senators may know this &mdash; that the trends in tourism are changing quite dramatically and that there is quite a perceptible swing from the more organised type of holiday, to caravan parks and to marinas.  People coming to Ireland wish to get away from the hassle, the noise, the activity, the highways and the byways.  In that connection, boating on our lakes, canals and on the Shannon is a tremendous attraction.</P>
    <P>Tourists are starting to move out of what we identify as tourist areas, like West Cork and County Kerry, which are <i>par excellence,</i> but where are the tourists going?  They are starting to move up country and, hopefully, they will start to visit the Leitrim, Cavan and Roscommon areas which are very beautiful, but which are undersold.  They have enormous potential for people coming from Europe who live in large cities and want to get away from the hussle and bustle, and the stressful life.  There are fishing, wildlife and many water sports which can be very easily developed in those areas.  The approach on the part of Bord Fáilte is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>When this section of the waterway is opened, as other speakers have said, we will have a navigation system second to none.  Many of the waterways in Europe are very polluted, and carry heavy volumes of traffic; for instance, the Canal du Midi one of the best in Europe has very heavy traffic.  Here, again, we will win out in this regard.  I hope in the locality the potential will be seen and that the agri-tourism will develop in a very positive way, that bed and breakfast accommodation, farmhouses, hotels and all those things will be brought up to a <Col N="215" /> high standard so that tourists coming to the area will find attractive amenities.</P>
    <P>I would like to encourage something in which I have a great interest, the Tidy Towns Competition, which I have done a great deal to promote over the past few years.  We have a special waterways award which is sponsored by the Emerald Star Line.  In response to that, a great number of the villages on the waterways, places like Portumna, Carrick-on-Shannon, Dromod, have looked to see how they can improve their own locality and how they can clean up litter.  That is something that must be emphasised.  The promotion of the area will obviously be undertaken by Bord Fáilte but it is important that each village looks to see what it can do for itself and how it can promote its best interests.</P>
    <P>It is opportune that the Water Pollution Bill, which we discussed here this morning, should come up at this time because as I have said, in Europe many of the waterways are unattractive because of the heavy pollution.  I hope that is an aspect which will be taken care of and that we will not find in a short time that these developments bring pollution from the boats.  I hope there will be co-operation between the various interests in the areas so that they do not, in a very short time, spoil those areas with bad, insensitive and tasteless development, as we have seen, sadly, in some parts of Ireland.  We have seen cases where there has been a rush to maximise, perhaps in an insensitive way, the tourist potential and in doing so they have killed the goose that lays the golden egg.</P>
    <P>I hope Bord Fáilte, through persuasion as much as through legislation will endeavour to prevent that.  I hope also there will be a general co-operative effort between the landowners, farmers and all the other interests so that the benefits will accrue to those countries which I said already have seen such poverty and misery and which are heavily disadvantaged areas in Ireland.  I greatly welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for State for bringing forward the Shannon Navigation Bill, 1990.  My interest in this Bill concerns the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal and the Erne and Lough Oughter navigation.  I understand the statutory powers necessary to carry out the work in connection with the restoration of the canal is incorporated in this Bill.  I am delighted the Commissioner of Public Works or their agents will be able to carry out the necessary improvements and development work and the subsequent management of the waterways.</P>
      <P>The restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal will provide a major significant improvement to the tourist infrastructure of the Fermanagh-Cavan-Leitrim area.  I believe this will be the most significant development in the area that will occur in our lifetime.  Over many years I have heard people talk about the many advantages that would arise from the restoration of this canal, but I believe most of these people thought such work would never be carried out.  It is particularly heartening to note that in a time when Government have many stringent controls on public finances a major system like this is to be undertaken.</P>
      <P>Coming from a Border constituency, I am more than aware of the need for cross-Border projects, I believe this is one great step forward in this vital direction.  The people of both sides of the Border wholeheartedly welcome this initiative and they believe the investment concerned will be very worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Ireland's share of boating and cruising holidays is very small.  The improvement and proper management of the canal is bound to dramatically increase the market share. Nowadays, all of us are more aware of great inland waterways in this country.  It is to the credit of the Office of Public Works that they have undertaken, positively and in an enlightened manner work <Col N="217" /> on the canal system throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal will provide access to a system of waterways which I believe will be unique and will be the envy of other countries in Europe.  The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal links the two great waterways systems of this country, the Erne and the Shannon.  I recall reading in one of the local newspapers in Cavan about Councillor Seán Smith, now chairman of Cavan County Council, proposing a motion at a Cavan County Council meeting that the restoration of the canal should be adopted as a key tourism policy in view of the Government's decision in 1977 to target tourism as a priority development area. Obviously, his thinking was very much in tune with the Government's objective.</P>
    <P>Coming from the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan I wish to commend the Minister for the Marine, who, as Minister for Tourism and Transport, was very much to the forefront in proposing this canal scheme.  I have heard him speak at length in the constituency on the great potential that exists for this development in the area.  I know he was vigorous in pushing at all levels for sanction to proceed with the restoration work.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials in the Office of Public Works for their work in bringing forward the Bill.  While I may have been parochial in my contribution, referring mainly to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, which is only a section of the Bill, I trust the Minister and the House appreciate my great interest in the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no doubt that as we enter 1992 and an integrated Europe we should view tourism as an area with tremendous growth potential and of tremendous significance in the development of our economy.  I am convinced that even though we have made considerable strides in tourism over the years we have not realised our full potential. We have a number of distinct advantages as a tourist country.  We have the <Col N="218" /> advantage of having very beautiful scenery and natural amenities.  Coupled with that beauty, we have a very rich, complete and interesting cultural heritage. We have a great artistic tradition as well. Were we to focus on our natural beauty and those attributes to a sufficient degree, we could develop a very vibrant tourist industry.</P>
      <P>In many respects we will come to be viewed as the holiday resort of Europe over the coming years.  We must gear ourselves for that.  From that point of view I am delighted with the opening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  As somebody from that constituency, like the previous speaker, it is obviously of immediate interest to me and to the people I represent.  That aspect of it is important.  I see it as offering tremendous tourist potential for the area and improving the industry there.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Bill essentially gives the kind of statutory controls necessary to go ahead with opening the canal.  That whole area has been devastated by the cross-Border trade over recent years. There is no doubt that the tourist potential of that area has been stunted completely by the fact that the Northern troubles made it a less attractive tourist location.  That Border area needs positive discrimination.  On the northern side of the Border in the Enniskillen area and in that general hinterland, the Northern tourist authorities do a superb marketing job.  They do a superb job on highlighting its potential for tourists and it is incumbent on us in the Republic to do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the local authority I have consistently voiced the view that the canal should be opened and have joined with others in raising the matter at meetings of the local authority.  I see another important dimension to it and that is the cross-Border dimension in that it will be a tourist amenity for Northern tourists. It should attract quite a number of Northern together with people from the Republic and that can only be desirable.  There can be no question about it but that the proper approach to deal with the crisis in the North is to break down the barriers at educational, social and economic levels. <Col N="219" /> That is the only way we can achieve what we want to achieve in Northern Ireland. Without labouring the point, I see the cross-Border dimension as an important facet of that development.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that drainage works would be the prerogative of the local authority which is appropriate because I believe, as a member of a local authority and as somebody committed to the concept of local government reform in the sense of restoring as much power as possible to local authorities, that important functions like this should be the responsibility of local authorities unless we are paying just lip-service to the concept of local government reform.  I want a specific assurance from the Minister in his reply to Second Stage that the necessary funding will be given.  We all know the present method of funding of local authorities is to hand out moneys from central Government and use them at local government level.  Whatever the future may hold in that area is for a different debate.  I want an assurance that the money will be there to ensure that arterial drainage work is carried out satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I would also be interested in more specific projections from the Minister on what he sees as the tourist potential for that area and what other types of infrastructure might go along with the development of the canal in that area. One of the things that is of great difficulty for people in that hinterland as they try to maximise tourist earnings in the area is the fact that that grants are no longer given out for new accommodation for tourists to guesthouse owners.  It is considered that <i>per capita</i> we have sufficient accommodation for the projected numbers of tourists.  This was at a time when there was no activity in the area because of the Northern troubles and because the canal was not open.  Now, however, as a result of this development there would be need for grants to help towards developing guest house accommodation, extra beds and extra accommodation units in the specific areas around the Ballinamore canal.  We have one heartening <Col N="220" /> development in the area in that a major attractive, ultra-modern hotel, the Slieve Russell Hotel, is being built there.  That is an appropriate local development to match the opening of the canal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opening of the canal and see no difficulty with granting the statutory regulations to achieve that aim. I welcome it as something that can only enhance our tourist industry and also from a cross-Border point of view.  It is the first lift an area devastated by cross-Border trade has got in a while.  I cannot emphasise sufficiently to the House the devastation in Border towns as a result of cross-Border trade.  Shopping complexes have mushroomed on the far side of the Border.  The most telling way of describing it to the Members of the House would be to draw attention to the fact that in the town of Clones, which is like Ballyconnell and so many other Border towns, the only regular customers at the local petrol station for a long period of time were the local gardaí because they obviously could not use the petrol stations on the far side of the Border.  That is the tragic reality. For that reason it is incumbent on all of us to provide the necessary infrastructure in the area which help to improve the lives of the people there.  If we do not achieve social and economic cohesion in the Border areas any talk of unity or of a solution to the Northern problem is pure mythology.</P>
    <P>My concern is to have assurance from the Minister that the necessary financial back up for arterial drainage will be given to the local authority.  That is a very important.  It is not the intention of my party to obstruct this legislation which will allow for the opening of the canal at a critical juncture in the development of the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation especially as it is my own Minister, Brendan Daly, and his Department who are bringing it through the Oireachtas.  I compliment him on a job well done in his short time in the Department.  After this legislation goes through, there will be a need to develop Lough Derg, Killaloe, Mountshannon and Whitegate &mdash; areas <Col N="221" /> which the Minister will frequent again in a few years time.  It is marvellous countryside which will benefit directly from this legislation.  It is vital and of crucial improtance that we should bring in legislation to develop tourism any time we can.  It is the one area where this or any other Government could create jobs.</P>
      <P>We have in place, again thanks to Minister Daly, a new marina in Kilrush which will link the lower and the upper Shannon and of tremendous importance to Clare and the west coast.  I remember being on the Shannon as a little girl with my late father &mdash; we had a boat when very few people had a boat.</P>
      <P>I heard the former Cathaoirleach and the former Leas-Chathaoirleach talking about romance.  He was in a boat going to a dance or something.  I was not quite sure whether he was in the boat going to the dance or where he was.</P>

      <P>This is excellent legislation.  I am glad the Minister has decided to recognise the importance of local government.  If you say it long enough and often enough to Ministers that county councils are important they will be convinced.  If you keep belting it home they will get the message. The Minister is giving back responsibility to the local authority and I hope he will also give them proper funding.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the general question of the pollution of rivers being the responsibility of local authorities under the Water Pollution Act.  That is quite fresh in our minds because we only cleared that Bill here this afternoon. After being amended in the Dáil it came back here so every Senator who spent time in this House today is quite familiar with that legislation.  The Water Pollution Act also gives responsibility to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made it public once again that he is a firm believer in private and public interests being fully explored.  If I understand him correctly &mdash; and I think I know him well enough to understand <Col N="222" /> him &mdash; he believes as I do that public and private interests work well together.  We have seen it happen in our constituency. We have also seen it happen in the area of health where voluntary and statutory bodies work together.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain section 7 a little further because in that section the Minister may, by regulation, do anything which appears to him to be necessary.  I worry a little bit about legislation which includes a section stating that the Minister &ldquo;may, by regulation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  It will do a lot of good for that part of our island.  If we get our act together, we can create more jobs in this area and make this country look the way we all want it to look.  I do not know how long this Bill was sitting on a shelf waiting for some other Minister to deal with it, but I compliment the Minister, Deputy Daly, on bringing it into the House and making it possible for it to become law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Senator was the last speaker but her colleague who complimented the Government for making money available for this project at this time.  I will give credit where it is due.  On two occasions when we discussed tourism over the past three years.  I indicated this was one area that badly needed development. The Shannon covers approximately 161 miles from where it is navigable down to the tidal area in Limerick. We have now added to that the Ballyconnell canal.  I must compliment the Minister for battling against his partitionist training in the Fianna Fáil Party to cross the Border in this case.  It has been extraodinarily successful in that sense.  It means, and I stand to be corrected, that this is now the longest navigable canalway in Europe.  I am not just talking about from Foynes to Ballyshannon. I would like the Minister to confirm that it is now navigable down through both lakes, Lough Erne, Lough Uachtar agus Iochtar and down to the power station.  I would like to know the precise details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier Senator McDonald referred to the fact that there is far more to it than that.  In terms of canal navigation somebody can go from Mullen in Waterford right up through the Barrow to the Grand Canal and down to where it joins the Shannon at Shannonbridge or wherever and then decide to go upstream or downstream, to Ballyshannon or down to the Shannon Estuary.  That is an extraordinary achievement and all concerned deserve to be complimented.  We are very <Col N="224" /> close to creating something which may not be in the interest of some of the Senators who have spoken already.  In recent weeks the section of the Royal Canal between Mullingar and Blanchardstown has been opened and renovated as a result of voluntary and public effort.  That is a tremendous achievement. Senator Hederman raised the difficulty in the North Dublin area from the Tolka right out to Blanchardstown.  I understand it is the objective to open that in the next number of years.</P>
    <P>It was extraordinary and I think the Minister will thank me for raising this point that on the day he announced the opening of that section of the canal from Blanchardstown to Mullingar, which to me is a landmark, it was only covered by RTE and one of the national newspapers. I wonder what is news anymore?  I thought it was an extraordinary achievement. Work has taken place from Mullingar to the Shannon, I would estimate a distance of approximately 30 miles, and when this work is carried out there we will have a circuit of canals.</P>
    <P>The possibility of hiring boats at one point and leaving them at another point is very attractive to the tourist.  That is an industry that needs investment.  We now have the basics in terms of excellent waterways and we must look at the cost of investment in boats.  I investigated this recently and I looked at a number of BES schemes &mdash; one such scheme was set up quite recently in the Robertstown area &mdash; but I am not sure if the capital investment will be returned.  There is a need to have a serious look at a once-off injection of capital into this industry.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the industry that bothers me.  Anybody driving through Portumna, Jamestown or Carrick-on-Shannon at any given time up to a month ago would have seen hundreds of boats tied up there lying idle.  My experience of hiring a boat on the Shannon and on the canal has always been in the off-season period.  I have always seen it as an attractive activity in the spring or autumn.  It really has major attractions and ties in completely with fishing.  That is an area which needs to be developed <Col N="225" /> and it need some input of capital.  I come back to my old complaint of Bord Fáilte trying to sell this country as a sundrenched island.  Let us forget about the sun and sell what we have &mdash; clean, natural amenities that are attractive to those people who have the sun on their doorstep all the time.  They do not come here for the sun, they come here for other things.  We must develop the water activities industry so that it is not just simply a two or two and a half month season.</P>
    <P>There is something special about going through the canals and waterways of Ireland and mooring at villages.  Senator McDonald spoke earlier about the harbourmaster's daughter in Tullamore. There is something magical about travelling through our waterways and being able to moor the boat in the middle of a town or in the middle of the main street as happens in Edenderry and Tullamore. It is an aspect of our tourism industry which is not sufficiently emphasised. Whether it be in the local pub or on local entertainment or whatever, people will come and spend money in these towns.  I see this as an investment and as a triumph for the public service and I think they should take a bow for their work.</P>
    <P>We are now at a stage where the industry needs to be developed.  One of the reasons we do not have enough Irish people involved in this activity is because it is expensive.  Lough Derg on the Shannon at this time of the year is full of continental people.  Unfortunately, Irish people cannot afford that sort of holiday anymore and that is tragic.  There is a sense of loss on all sides because it is an attractive holiday for people who stay at home.  As far as I know, the extent of navigable waterways in Ireland is greater than in the UK and I also think that we now have a greater mileage of navigable waterways for canals and boats than is the case in France.  That is extraordinary and some people are unaware of it.  The idea that while on holiday one can cross the country now by boat is certainly very attractive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> For the purposes of the Bill I understand that the Shannon navigation includes the Ballyconnel Canal and also that portion of the Erne which is in the State &mdash; I would prefer if the Minister spoke about the country but I know what he means.  If that is the case, are the canals run by CIE?</P>
    <P>Recently I had a look at part of the upper part of the Barrow navigation and it is full of weeds.  Many of the canals are like that.  They need clearing now.  I saw men pulling weeds out of the propellors of their boats.  That means that these people will not come back there again. The waterways must be kept well.  We will have problems when we set up the basic structure if we do not look after them.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the archaeologically-based holiday and the specialised holiday.  Another example is the school tour.  My colleagues in primary schools are always very interested in bringing pupils to experience the wonders of this country.  I noticed recently, on either Lough Conn or Lough Corrib, that there were tours of the lake by boat organised for school tours.  This is something that might well be developed in the Shannon area on the canals.  It would be very attractive.  There is no better way to get to know the land.  The opportunity is there to do it.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on the specialised holiday.</P>
    <P>I find section 7 of the Bill extraordinary. I agree 100 per cent with Senator Honan on that.  I read it three times.  I could not believe what I was reading.  I am going to read it into the record as well, because it is the only way to get it in there.</P>
    <P>If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into operation the Minister may, by regulation, do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of removing that difficulty.</P>
    <P>It sounds like something the Mafia would say &mdash;&ldquo;remove the difficulty&rdquo;.  That is extraordinary legislation.  In the three <Col N="227" /> years I have been here I have not read such a wide clause.  I have difficulty with it.  It is bad legislation.  There is an element of laziness on the part of the draftperson involved.  If there are problems which might arise, we should identify them now and give the Minister authority to cope with them.</P>
    <P>Whatever my difficulties with that section, they are compounded by the next section, section 8 &mdash; the power of making regulation and the laying of regulation before the House.  It is a negative process that is in operation here.  I will read it:</P>
    <P>Regulations made by the Minister shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and ... if a resolution annulling the order ... is passed by either House within 21 days when it shall be annulled.</P>
    <P>Twenty one days is a long time, and in non-sitting time, it is even longer.  I am utterly opposed to this new direction. There has not been one Bill brought before this House in the last three years that contained the affirmative process, as far as I can recall.  Regulations with such broad powers as the ones envisaged by section 7 should be brought and proposed to the House and accepted by the House.</P>
    <P>I keep saying to people that if they want to know about these regulations to turn to the back of our Order Paper every day.  Let us look at today's Order Paper. There are eight Papers laid before the House today.  I will read a few of them: The Control of Bulls for Breeding (Permits) Regulations, 1990 &mdash; I guarantee that nobody in either House would have the slighest idea what that is.  I raise that point because in some months' time we will come in here and on the Order Paper there will be &ldquo;Regulations under section 7 of the Shannon Navigation &mdash; at that stage &mdash; Act, 1990&rdquo;.  We will all wonder what it is all about: it will be the Minister removing the difficulty but none of us will know anything about it.  I use that as an example.  That is bad legislation. Accountability to the Oireachtas requires <Col N="228" /> that a section which gives such wide ranging powers should require that the regulation bringing it into effect should be proposed and laid before the House through the affirmative process rather than through the negative process.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, the Bill is a celebration of the Office of Public Works. They have dealt again with the whole area of navigation successfully.  It can only bring good.  I would disagree with a previous speaker about increasing the market share.  I do not think it will increase the market share; it will increase the market.  I would commend the Minister for bringing it before us.  I wish the Bill success.  I will certainly be supporting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be as brief as possible in the circumstances.  I have been following the debate on the monitor and, indeed, followed the progress of this Bill through the other House.  With my colleagues on all sides of both Houses, I would like to welcome this legislation.  It is particularly significant to my own part of the country.  Coming as I do from the North Shannon area, the impact of this legislation on that area, if properly implemented, should mean that, in the words of one of my parliamentary colleagues, it would be as good an industry as any providing 300 or 400 jobs.</P>
      <P>Several speakers &mdash; and the Minister himself &mdash; have dealt with the historical accident that brought about the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal, an accident in the sense that it became one of the most expensive white elephants of the 19th century.  However, that white elephant, hopefully, is going to be turned into a much more acceptable colour as a result of this legislation and the handing back of the authority for the maintenacne and development of the Shannon Navigation and, more importantly, the development of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal to the commissioners and to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Shannon Navigation itself dates back to 1814.  Up to that time there had been stretches of the Shannon which one could have intermittently navigated.  The <Col N="229" /> authorities at the time in their foresight decided that the Shannon as the premier waterway of this country should be developed further, not only in its own right or on its own merits but in order to link up with the Northern waterways, the Ulster Canal and the Erne Canal.  Of particular interest to me is that the Shannon Navigation was extended into Lough Allen.  Passenger services operated from Killaloe, in the Minister's own constitutency, as far as Carrick-on-Shannon right up to the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in the early part of this century &mdash; and it is part of local folklore in Drumshanbo &mdash; the company of C.S. Laird Limited, who would be well know to Members of the House as manufacturers of jams and marmalades &mdash; were also in the early part of this century flour millers and wholesalers of grocery products, especially Limerick bacon. Until very late in the twenties and thirties, they used the Shannon Navigation waterway as a means of transportation for their produce form Limerick to Drumshanbo.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some regret that following the legislation enacted in the mid thirties the canal was closed to passenger and commercial traffic.  Subsequently, Lough Allen has been used as a reservoir for the electricity supply at Ardnacrusha.  This stretch of canal, which moved off at Leitrim town, or Battlebridge to be more accurate, and brought access to the Shannon Navigation into Acres Lake and subsequently to Lough Allen, has been a <i>cause celebre</i> in the locality, literally, since it closed and more recently since tourism was recognised as being something with great potential for the area.</P>
    <P>My late father lobbied successive Governments in order to have the canal reopened.  It was rather unique that, when the ESB were given the statutory powers to close the canal, they did not fill it in; they just dammed it at a bridge leading to Lough Allen, which meant that the engineering necessary to reopen the canal was minimal.  However, then as now, money was a primary reason for reluctance on the part of successive <Col N="230" /> Governments in the fifties and sixties to embark on a programme of reopening the canal.  However, persistence paid off. I know it was one of the highlights of my late father's political career when one portion of the canal was eventually reopened to passenger traffic in 1987.</P>
    <P>The economic impact of the reopening of the largest stretch of the canal &mdash; two-thirds of it in fact &mdash; on the immediate Drumshanbo area has been quite significant. With the increase in cruiser traffic over the past number of years and with the Government's own priorities in that area to encourage investment and Bord Fáilte's marketing and promotional campaigns, it is quite obvious to all who wish to see that the development of cruiser traffic along the Shannon Navigation is going to be one of the primary sources of tourist income, not only for my part of the country but for all those areas that touch the Shannon from where it rises in the Cuilcagh Mountains down as far as Limerick and into the Shannon estuary.</P>
    <P>It would be churlish of me not to pay tribute to the late Henry Kenny who was the Minister's predecessor in the Office of Public Works and who gave the green light to the project.  I suppose the fact that he was the first west of Ireland Minister in that Department had some bearing on the fact that he looked sympathetically at the development of the canal and the reopening of the Lough Allen canal. Moving on some 20 odd years, I wish to pay the highest possible tribute to the present incumbent, to my friend and colleague, Deputy Brendan Daly, who has shown not only a great understanding of the wishes and aspirations of the people of my area in relation to the opening of that portion of the canal but who has physically seen for himself the potential there is at Acres Lake and at Lough Allen.</P>
    <P>During a recent visit the Minister took time out of a very busy schedule, when he was opening Parkes Castle in Dromahair to come up Drumshanbo and have a look at it for himself.  I know that in political life Ministers do not wish to be put in a spot.  Whenever they are out in the field they wish to take note and <Col N="231" /> reflect on what they have seen and subsequently make decisions.  However, I think I would not be pushing the Minister too far if I were to inform the House that his interest went beyond the bounds of duty in this area, and that he is taking an active interest, mainly through the provision of money from his Department, for a hydrographic survey of Lough Allen and on the basis of that a study of the cost and viability of opening the canal.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt on this aspect of the legislation because as far as my own town of Drumshanbo is concerned and also the whole north Roscommon mid-Leitrim area, the reopening of the canal and the development of the Shannon waterways, in general, are really going to be an economic lifeline for that area.  As time is pressing, I do not intend to elaborate too much on all aspects of the Bill, but to select just one or two areas that I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister. With regard to the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal which is central to this legislation &mdash; and, indeed, I would say was the catalyst for bringing this legislation to the House &mdash; I was pleasantly surprised to learn that of its 37 miles two-thirds of it is actually in County Leitrim, the remainder being in West Cavan and County Fermanagh.  It is quite a long waterway.  It will be a feat of major engineering brilliance to reopen this canal and to make it ready for the many hundreds of cruise it ready for the many hundreds of cruisers that I hope will be plying their way up and down it in the years to come. I can assure the Minister that the small towns and hamlets along the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal are feverishly awaiting the input of the £20 million that has been promised for this project.  It is one of the largest amounts to be spent in the State, and certainly the largest in my part of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe the commitment of the Government from the Taoiseach down, in the early Eighties to the present is an indication of the understanding they have of the serious economic plight in which the people of Leitrim and west Cavan have found themselves in as a result of <Col N="232" /> the neglect of successive Administrations since the foundation of the State, coupled with the disadvantage of two counties being caught under Partition, where their hinterland was cut off and where economic activity was severely stunted and also where there was a traditional pattern of emigration.</P>
    <P>I hope that the effect of the legislation going through this House will be to give the people in my part of the country some hope for the future, that not only will it give them hope but that they can translate that hope and optimism into action.  The Minister has been pleading that investment is the key word and that local communities coupled with private investment, have the answer to solving the many problems in the tourist area, especially the Shannon area.  This area has been severely under-capitalised down through the years.  It is important we should realise that the development that will flow from this legislation should bring economic prosperity to the region.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister the impact on local authorities due to the transfer of statutory obligations from the board of trustees in the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore area to the relevant local authorities, especially as it relates to drainage.  The Minister has made the point elsewhere that the end result of the legislation is not going to mean any change and that there will be no extra financial charge on the local authorities concerned.  I would like the Minister to reassure the House in his reply that that will be the case.  It has been indicated to me, especially by Leitrim County Council, the the result of the transfer of this statutory obligation from the board of trustees to the local authority will, in effect, make the local authority responsible for the maintenance and drainage in the area.  This could have a severe economic and financial impact.  I am drawing the Minister's attention to this point and perhaps he might make a comment on it.  Will there be extra financial hardship on local authorities as a result of the change as proposed in the legislation?  I would hope there would not be. <Col N="233" /> The Minister has made the point about parts of the Shannon not being navigable. Parts of the Shannon are already not navigable, for example, areas which I showed the Minister myself during his brief visit to the country.  I am wondering whether the new legislation will have an impact on those areas.  I am thinking particularly of damage that might be caused to wildlife along the Shannon area and to the possibility of pollution as a result of forestry development too close to the Shannon waterway.  As the House is aware, there are no planning laws which restrict forestry development in this country.  To put it in simple terms, if you wish to build a house you have to apply for planning permission; if you wish to plant a tree, you do not.  There is some cause for concern that, perhaps, because of the flexibility or this concession planting which is going on apace within my county generally, and more specifially along the Shannon waterway, might result in the needles from coniferous trees coming into the Shannon waterway and creating pollution resulting in the death of fish life and wildlife along the Shannon.  I am anxious that the Minister would address himself to those two areas in his reply on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>My third area of interest would be whether the Minister, under the Vote from his Department, would be in a position to provide much-needed onshore facilities for the cruiser traffic we are going to have on the Shannon as a result of the ongoing development and, of course, of the local and national marketing of the Shannon as an area for cruiser traffic.  I am talking specifically about the provision of telephones at key areas in small towns such as Rooskey, Cootehall, Cashcarrigan and Leitrim. Will the Minister make it incumbent on Telecom Éireann to provide telephones as a facility rather than the existing situation where, as my colleagues not doubt will be aware, whenever they have applied on behalf of their constituents for the provision of telephone kiosks in their areas the usual letter that comes back indicates that unless it is viable Telecom Éireann will not provide a telephone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> We are talking here about the tourism industry.  I am anxious that the Minister should address himself to the provision of facilities such as telephones and toilets, which are extremely important for our tourist population.  Representations have been made to me on a continual basis for the provision of toilets at mooring areas and for the provision of more mooring facilities at key areas along the Shannon, such as at the small towns and villages, particularly where the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal is being developed.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his patience.  I am sorry for having held up the House at this late hour.  Like many of my colleagues who have already made a contribution, I feel that this is one of the most significant pieces of legislation in the area of tourism and the economic development of a region that encompasses many counties.  When one talks about the Shannon one talks about the premier waterway of this country and one of the finest waterways in Europe.  In that context, the impact of the legislation can only bring prosperity to our nation as a whole.  I support the thrust of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on this Bill.  Being probably the only land owner adjacent to the Shannon in this House I could not let the opportunity go without saying a few words on it.  I welcome the Bill.  The development of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal is very welcome.  I compliment the Minister for bringing this legislation before the House.  I endorse the sentiments expressed by Senator Mooney.  I have absolutely no doubt that it will be a major development in that part of the country and will play a major part in boosting tourism from Limerick to Lough Erne. That is very important and something that cannot be emphasised enough.  We are extremely lucky that we have such clean waterways.  It is up to us to provide the facility, first, and secondly, to market it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The River Shannon is a great commodity to sell.  I have witnessed many small towns and villages on the edge of <Col N="235" /> the Shannon, from Shannonbridge to Cootehall, which have developed their own industry as a result of tourist traffic on the Shannon in summer time.  The cruiser traffic definitely is a great money spinner and is something that should be encouraged.  The sooner this work can get under way the better.  It is very desirable. I look forward to this development.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out already, the Shannon rises in the Cuilcach Mountains and flows on to Limerick.  While it is a major tourist asset there is no doubt that it has caused many problems in my part of the country.  While the Shannon is beautiful in the summer it can be another story &mdash; as Senator Fallon well knows &mdash; in the middle of winter where, very often, people suffer great hardship because of the bursting of the banks.</P>
    <P>I note that £1 million is being spent on development along the Shannon.  That is to be welcomed.  I am not asking the Minister to drain the Shannon.  That day is gone.  Nobody would believe me any more because there has been so much talk about drainage of the Shannon in the past.  I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of having the channel cleaned. There is no question but that there is a major silting in the main channel of the Shannon, as Senator Fallon may also be aware.  People in Athlone who have boats on the Shannon have stated that on occasion, boats have got stuck in mud-banks on the Shannon where peat has been washed into the river.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the possibility of having those peat banks removed, particularly in areas adjacent to Meelick and Meelick weir.  They obstruct the flow of water and the result is that the water backs up.  I am not blaming that altogether for the flooding, but the silt banks cause that flooding to rise much faster.  It is very important to remove those silt banks.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator Mooney's contribution about his late father's commitment to the Shannon.  I have no doubt about that.  I know the late Councillor Mooney was committed to the Shannon; <Col N="236" /> he was committed to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  He was committed to tourism in that part of the country.  All of us who live adjacent to the Shannon must recognise the major tourist assets we have and it should be developed and marketed at every opportunity.  I agree also, for example, that facilities such as pay phones should be provided.  That is a live issue for tourists who are on boats on the Shannon and who are trying to communicate with Germany or Holland. They find it very difficult to get public pay phones in villages such as Shannonbridge, Athlone, Lanesboro&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Two years ago the usual letter came back saying that a telephone kiosk could not be provided because it was non-viable.  Now, if we look around many of our towns, not alone do we see one telephone kiosk but we see them going up back to back &mdash; two are being erected instead of one.  It is of vital importance that they are placed in all the villages along the Shannon.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister in his role as Minister of State at the Department of Finance to examine the possibility of setting up a Shannon valley authority, an authority which would have responsibility for all developments on the Shannon, be they boating, fishing or managing the weirs and the different sluices along the Shannon.  At present we have many bodies, such as the ESB, the Inland Fisheries and the Office of Public Works each of which have control over different gates and over different stretches of the Shannon. I appeal for an authority which would have representatives from all of those bodies together with the farming community, who, God knows, have suffered enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> Like many other people on the Shannon, I recognise that it is not possible to drain it.  Farmers are now getting a subsidy to get out of production.  There is no question of the EC coming up with funds to bring land into production.  What should be done is that that area of land which is subject to continual flooding should be declared an environmentally sensitive area.  I know that does not come within the Minister's ambit, but there should be better management of the Shannon and better management of the gates by keeping them open and keeping the water moving earlier in the year.  It is something that we, in the midlands, are very sore about.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to developments that have taken place such as the new facilities which have been provided at Lough Key.  A major development has taken place there and at Drumsna, Dromod and Lecarrow.  One of the major difficulties with the Lecarrow Canal is that there is a weed growing in the canal which is sucked into the air system of the boats.  At certain times of the year the boat owners have to tell people renting the boats not to go on the canal because this weed is growing.  I ask the Minister to see what can be done to have it removed.  I know the Office of Public Works do a certain amount of work each year but it could be done more often.</P>
    <P>The developments at Hodson Bay are to be welcomed.  I sincerely hope that the further development which is being discussed between the Roscommon Country Council and the Office of Public Works will take place as soon as possible in Clonmacnoise, Portumna and other areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister referred to Ballinasloe, even though it was not in his prepared speech.  I appeal to him to examine the possibility of having navigation provided to the town of Ballinasloe. This is a very vital stretch of river from the Shannon to Ballinasloe along the Suck.  There are two or three rock beds in that stretch of the river.  I appeal to the Minister to see what can be done to have those rock beds removed so that we can have navigation from the <Col N="238" /> River Shannon to the town of Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my weight as former Chairman of Westmeath County Council.  I am very well aware of the massive problems we had when the waters along the Shannon were very high. I am also very much aware of the Shannon as a tourist attraction for the country and for the counties along it.  This is tremendous news.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that whole area around Leitrim will be opened up.  It is long overdue. It is one of the bright lights to come before us in the Seanad over the last number of years.  It will open up this beautiful part &mdash; as the song says &mdash; of lovely Leitrim and, indeed it is just that.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister who is doing a fantastic job in his portfolio.  We are all delighted with him and we are proud of the Office of Public Works for the tremendous job they are doing.  The chairman of the Office of Public Works and I had the pleasant duty on Whit weekend of attending the Royal Canal opening; we went by boat as far as Mullinger. It was a joyous occasion and over 3,000 people turned up to witness the extension of the canal to the town of Mullinger.  I look forward to the day when the Dublin Bridge will be organised in such a way that it will be possible to travel by the Royal Canal right down to Clondra, County Longford &mdash; about 40 miles of waterway west of Mullingar.</P>
      <P>As was said, this is one of the longest stretches of inland waterway in Europe and speaks well for the area.  The midlands area of Longford, Leitrim and Roscommon is not getting its fair share of tourists or tour promotion.  The coastline of Ireland gets tremendous promotion, but the £20 million investment is to be welcomed.  We welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank the Senators who contributed to this debate.  It has been a debate which encourages me to press ahead with the <Col N="239" /> important work that everybody here recognises and appreciates.</P>
      <P>I will endeavour to cover the main points referred to by various speakers. Many Senators repeated the same sentiments in relation to the development of potential and the need to develop facilities alongside the Bord Fáilte development programme.  It is more important to put a legislative framework in place that will enable us to develop the policies which, in turn, will transform what has been a relatively dormant, stagnant national resource into a vibrant engine of economic development right through the whole network.  The Canals Act deals with specific areas not covered in this Bill.  This Bill deals with the Shannon navigation.  The Barrow navigation and the Royal and the Grand Canals are covered by the Canals Acts.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald, in his very constructive contribution, highlighted a cause of concern to many people, the ongoing problem of pollution, whether in the inland waterways or pollution generally. Apparently the campaign to eliminate pollution will be ongoing.  There is need for legislation in this area and very strict enforcement of the regulation but, above all, a creation of awareness throughout the community of the damage that can be done through carelessness and neglect.</P>
      <P>The problem of pollution is evident, especially in our inland waterways.  I had an opportunity this afternoon, when the Dáil was adjourned, to visit parts of the Royal Canal adacent to Dublin city.  The necessity to continue the work on the restoration of the Royal Canal was referred to by Senator Hederman.  I recently opened the section from Blanchardstown to Mullingar and, the first boats went through there a few weeks ago and were welcomed by Senator Cassidy on behalf of the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section of the Royal Canal which flows towards the city, it is probably one of the city's unique attractions &mdash; is being used as a dump.  It is unbelievable what is dumped there, and would be too revolting to describe here.  It adds to a scandal <Col N="240" /> of unmitigated proportions to see what could be the focal point of upmarket development and opportunity for leisure, recreation, immediate development and economic prosperity in the inner Dublin city in a state of total collapse, dereliction and neglect.  That brings home to all the necessity to be vigilant in relation to pollution matters, but above all, the urgency of no allowing natural resources which have tremendous potential and enormous amenity and recreational value to become derelict eyesores and refuse dumps.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald mentioned the necessity of putting pollution controls in place.  The Bill empowers the commissioners to control pollution from boats using the navigation.  The by-laws which will be laid down under that legislation will prohibit pollution from boats. At present, plans are being prepared by county councils for pump house facilities at various locations along the waterway and we are working with the Department of the Environment on this.  When these regulations are in place, boats will be required to have holding tanks for sewage disposal.  That should eliminate the anxiety people have that when the canal system begins to operate on a profitable commercial basis &mdash; you do not throw out the child with the bath water &mdash; the inevitable pollution from that type of intensive development will be kept under control and will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Senator that we will be working with local authorities in that regard.  In fact, at present EC Structural Funding is available to enable local authorities to put these facilities in place. I would encourage Members who are associated with local authorities to use their good offices to bring to the attention of the administration personnel in their local authority that EC Structural Funding is available, under the new structural arrangements, for the provision of these facilities and, as far as possible, they should be put in place.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan mentioned the potential of areas like Mountshannon.  She will be glad to know that the new sewerage system being installed there includes <Col N="241" /> pump storage facilities at Lough Derg and cruisers and boats using the facilities on Lough Derg can avail of the Mount-shannon sewerage system for the disposal of their sewage and refuse.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon spoke at length and with sound practical knowledge of the potential of the canals.  He mentioned the necessity for consultation in the preparation of by-laws relative to registration. I want to assure him that registration will not apply to row boats or sailing boats and mooring charges will be imposed at public harbours only during the winter months.  I want to acknowledge the valuable guidance and support from the members of the Inland Waterways Association and from many other voluntary organisations and enthusiasts in this area.  As I said, we have already had advice from the Inland Waterways Association.  When this legislation was being debated in the Dáil and in the Seanad, members of that association have been present.  This indicates clearly their interest in this legislation and their willingness to co-operate with us in an overall drive to enhance and develop the Irish canal system which will play a magnificent role in the overall development of the economies of the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred to the necessity to look at the Barrow navigation. As I said, the Barrow navigation is covered under the Canals Act.  Senator O'Toole asked who had the authority for the Barrow navigation now.  The authority now rests with the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Commissioners of Public Works took over responsibility for the canals from CIE when the new canals legislation was enacted.  They now cover many of the areas mentioned here.  They also sought the advice of professional consultants as to how the resource should be developed and the Brady, Shipman and Martin report indicated precisely how that should be done.</P>
    <P>Because of the interest of Deputies and Senators in the development of this resource we recently commissioned further studies to enable us to measure the potential of other inland waterways <Col N="242" /> which are not at present covered by legislation and to add to the Brady, Shipman and Martin report.  This enabled us to get an overall view of the potential and to keep in mind that the development, whether it be by way of restoration, renovation, reconstruction, redevelopment, or in some cases total renewal, as in parts of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, costs money.  In any endeavour to do an overall long-term programme, the necessary resources must be provided.  If there is a willingness on the part of local authorities and voluntary groups and bodies, through joint co-operation and consultation and the active involvement of the business community in the private investment area, we can transform our inland waterways.</P>
    <P>I was glad, with Senator Mooney, to have the opportunity to look at the potential of Lough Allen and the canal system in that vicinity.  On 8 June, when I had an opportunity to look at the canal system from the Shannon right up to the Border, Senator Mooney and I met with community leaders in Drumshanbo.  They are conscious of the value and importance of the amenity.  They are also worried that when the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal reopens traffic and, therefore, business will by-pass the Lough Allen area.  We are conscious of the necessity to ensure that that will not happen.  It is more likely that it will be the other way round.  We will certainly work towards ensuring that this development enhances the prospects for development of Lough Allen.</P>
    <P>From hydrographic studies carried out, we already have an indication of the potential of the area and we will continue work with the local community, the ESB and the local authorities there.  If it is financially feasible to undertake development there, we will not lose any time or waste any effort in doing that.  However, we must keep in mind the cost of many of these developments.  What appears at times to be a relatively simple operation, taking into account engineering works and so on often turns out to be very expensive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> There is an awareness of the importance of the canal system and the contribution it can make to overall tourism development.  Senator Hederman mentioned the navigation on the Boyle River and I had occasion to discuss this with the Cathaoirleach.  Some time ago the Cathaoirleach drew my attention to the necessity to undertake restoration work to enable development in that area to link up with the Boyle River.  We have had preliminary engineering works carried out there and I am satisfied that work can be undertaken.  This would be desirable and be worth while.  We have asked for further studies to be carried out to determine precisely what engineering works are necessary, the cost of such undertaking and how soon it can be carried out.</P>
    <P>There would be little credibility in me saying that the extension to Ballinasloe, the further improvements on the Barrow navigation or the reopening of the old system around Limerick City which has run into dereliction will be achieved in a short time.  Certainly all this is achievable but the fact is &mdash; and I would like to assure Senator O'Toole about this &mdash; with the completion of the network we can have the best inland waterways system in the world, but it will cost some money. The question often arises as to whether people are prepared to put their money where their mouths are.  The Government have demonstrated clearly by their commitment to the reopening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, their financial commitment in this year's Estimates and the support of the European Community who have also carried out technical studies, that they are prepared to provide money to undertake this vital work.</P>
    <P>Extension and development works to a large extent depend on the availability of resources.  We will work with community groups, chambers of commerce and with other bodies and organisations to find a formula to get over the financial problems and many of the obstacles to development which have hindered the prospect of opening up the canals system <Col N="244" /> over the past ten or 20 years.  Many of the Senators know as well as I that there is quite an amount of money in the country for projects of this nature.  With the prospect of this new development, a new £1.5 million project linked to the maritime faclities in Killaloe has recently been put in place.  This is the first major investment in holiday and leisure recreational facilities connected with the lake there that has taken place in the past few years.  This clearly indicates that if people see the prospect of a good return from this kind of investment, they will certainly go for it.  A sum of £10 million has been committed to the Kilrush marina from private investment to match the overall plans which are in place for Community and State funding.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien also dealt with the potential in this area and I am sure that will be acknowledged by everybody. These developments are slow and tedious and take some time but we are taking the first major step here this evening in providing the legislative framework that can be put in place to enable us undertake the work.  Senator O'Brien quite rightly mentioned the work of the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson.  He has been to the forefront in the campaign to reopen the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  He recognises the potential there, as does the Minister for Tourism and Transport. He initiated some studies a few years ago to get this project under way.  Not only that, but the Taoiseach has taken a personal interest in seeing this project through.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald, Senator O'Reilly and others raised the question as to whether it would be possible to get this work done speedily and how it was proposed to undertake it.  A steering committee will oversee the project which will consist of representatives of the Departments of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Tourism and Transport, and Electricity Supply Board and the Office of Public Works.  In addition, a joint steering committee has been established with the Northern Ireland authorities to effectively oversee the cross-Border dimension of the project.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> The Government are also giving the opening of the Ballianmore-Ballyconnell Canal high priority as one of the flagship projects for EC Structural Funds.  As I said earlier, the Commission obtained an independent assessment of its viability and have expressed satisfaction and expect it to go ahead quickly.  Senator O'Reilly asked whether action had been taken to determine whether there was potential in doing this and if we were not just doing it for the sake of reopening the canal.  A study was commissioned and carried out which indicates clearly that a fairly substantial benefit will accrue to the region by this development.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Royal Canal and the derelection and neglect I spoke of earlier, we have opened the Royal Canal from Blanchardstown to Mullingar and are working towards the city with lock gates being prepared for that stretch.  Reconstruction work is presently taking place moving towards the city from the Blanchardstown area and we expect to have that completed by the end of next year. The lock gates are almost ready for installation. When they are installed the cleaning up of the area, and the dredging that will be necessary, can be carried out.  A section of the canal running by Croke Park has recently been cleaned.  This was carried out under the initiation of the Office of Public Works with the help of local voluntary community groups.  Thousands of tonnes of litter, plastic bags and every type of deleterious material was removed from that area.  I want to compliment the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, who initiated that work and who organised, with the help of our Department and some technical advice, local community organisations to do a massive clean up there.  People on their way to the football finals in Croke Park this year will not be horrified as they were with sights they saw there last year.</P>
    <P>The question of maintenance of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal was raised by Senator Mooney.  The question he wants answered is whether the maintenance which will be necessary as a result of the works which we are about to undertake there, will create a burden <Col N="246" /> for the local authorities.  We do not anticipate that.  We have made changes which we feel are necessary to bring the overall administration into line and to abolish the trustees and the complicated mechanism that was in place, and which was totally out of date after the removal of rates.  It is no longer feasible because rates have been done away with.  While that system was in operation the rates were levied, collected and spent.  We had all this duplication and overlapping and as a result the job was never done.  I am sure the organisation of local authorities is occupying the minds of Senators, and central to that will be questions of how best these matters can be dealt with.  When this legislation is enacted we do not envisage any further burden on local authorities. In fact, in the restoration work on the Ballinamore-Ballyconell Canal should help the drainage system and alleviate some of the problems there.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the income from tourism will be of the order of £50 million over 25 years.  Many Senators highlighted the decline in population and economic prosperity in that area.  Anyone who flies over that region, as I did on 8 June, will see the number of vacant, derelict and run-down farms and houses and realise how necessary it is that we undertake this work, which, hopefully, will make a meaningful contribution to the economic prosperity of the people in the region. One can get an overall view of this when travelling from one part of the region to the other.  However, one of the attractions of that area is its remoteness, its isolation and the quiet to which Senator Hederman referred.  When promoting this region we should turn what are perceived by some people to be handicaps and disadvantages into advantages.  We should highlight this area as a place of peace and tranquility, unspoilt by developments that have taken place in other areas and throughout the European Community at large.  Those disadvantages which led to the decline and breakdown of the economies of some of those areas can in future be turned into positive advantages which will encourage people from the continent to come here <Col N="247" /> and spend their money in those areas. This will lead to greater prosperity for the regions.  The disadvantages and handicaps of those regions should be used as positive promotional attractions to revitalise the area.  Hopefully, this will encourage people in the towns and villages to enhance their properties, provide more accommodation and, therefore, get a slice of the ever-increasing tourism market.  That would transform the economy and get rid of derelict sites.  It would encourage reconstruction and development which would lead to more employment and more economic benefits for the people in the region.  Hopefully then, people would set up businesses and enterprises in these areas.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Toole and Cassidy mentioned the potential of these areas, not only from the point of view of the enhancement of tourism but for fishing. Members will be aware that in the recent Government environmental action programme we were allocated £500,000 to enhance fisheries and the canals system and we can consult with the fishing authorities in that regard.  The fishing potential has a twofold benefit.  First, it enhances the prospect of developing the resources from the point of view of promoting it as a tourist attraction and, second, it provides local recreational facilities for our own people.  It is significant that when I visited the Royal Canal today, four or five young people were fishing there, although I could not see the bottom because of the plastic bags, refuse cans, Omo cartons, and pieces of prams and bicycles which were dumped there.  The fact that there were three teenagers fishing in the canal indicates that in the city of Dublin, in the centre of what would be regarded as an underdeveloped area, we have the potential to provide leisure and recreational facilities for the young boys and girls who live adjacent to the canal.  There is a message here for the Members from the Dublin area.  They do not have to go beyond the boundaries of their own city to look for opportunities to develop the potential of this area.  The canal system <Col N="248" /> in this city not only provides a unique opportunity to develop sporting facilities, such as fishing, but it can provide leisure facilities such as walking and cycling on paths along the canals.  As part of the overall development, we are working with other State agencies to develop tourist trails.</P>
    <P>I was in Limerick recently looking at the old canal system which was never completed after Ardnacrusha was built. The walk along the old canal banks from Limerick city to Plassey and Ardnacrusha, one of the most beautiful scenic parts of Limerick city, is in a state of total dereliction.  There is a message there for public representatives from those cities to do as we did in a derelict area in Kilrush in west Clare.  The new maritime development will enhance the prospects of economic development and job creation.  People who seek foreign enterprise and foreign companies to establish here need look no further than their own back doors to see the prospects for job creation.  Places which are derelict today could provide employment opportunities tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten highlighted the importance of developing the potential of the area.  I am sure he knows that for all those living along the canal system there will now be the prospect of developing worth-while enterprises.  That will make a fairly significant contribution to the overall development of the area which he wishes to see take place.</P>
    <P>With regard to running engines on vegetable oil, I would welcome Senator McDonald's data on that but the indications are that it would not be commercially available at present here.  I do not know whether it would be commercially viable but if the Senator has documentation on that we would examine it and see whether it would be possible to draw it to the attention of the people who are involved in the business.</P>
    <P>In relation to by-laws, we have already published a very informative booklet on them and it is our intention, after consultations have taken place with representatives of the Inland Waterways Association and other interested bodies, <Col N="249" /> to prepare a similar set of easily readable by-laws and guidelines.  Recently we had the honour of having the Taoiseach launch a new guide to our heritage which will be available shortly.  It is available at present in the shops.  It is a very prestigious document and it sets out the various heritage attractions region by region. It deals with issues like national parks, historical monuments, the provision of nature reserves and the development of areas of scientific interest.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan was very worried about section 7.  It relates to making of regulations, if it is necessary, mainly in order to remove technical difficulties which might arise when bringing the legislation into operation.  This is similar to what was in the Canals Act, 1986, and it was never put into operation.  It would be detrimental if after the Bill has passed, some minor technicality was discovered which we had not foreseen at the time as this could cause a complete shut down of some of the work.  It is desirable to have that section in place.</P>
    <P>We are very keen to go ahead with the extension to Mullingar.  As Senator Cassidy pointed out, it is desirable that we undertake this work.  With this new legislation and with the professional advice available to us, I see a situation over the next few years when we can have an inter-linked network of national inland waterways which will be unique and will be a motivating force to undertake a whole range of economic developments in all the small towns and villages from the Barrow navigation in the southeast right up to the Shannon navigation. We have power under this Bill to include the small areas that were not covered before and to complete the section to Ballinasloe.  Work is going ahead on the Suck navigation to Ballinasloe and will be completed very soon.  It gives us power to deal with areas where there was a conflict of views as to whether we had jurisdiction such as in Limerick city.  I spoke about the improvement of the canal system, in Mount Plassey and Ardnacrusha.</P>
    <P>This is very worth-while legislation.  I <Col N="250" /> very much appreciate the valuable contributions and support of Members here this evening.</P>

      <P>On section 2 (f), the Minister will have power to acquire by compulsory order.  It is important that the Minister's policy should progress as fast as possible.  Acquiring land by compulsory order can take a couple of years. I ask that it would be the policy of the Office of Public Works to pay a percentage over and above the normal value of the land, particularly if it is agricultural land, as an incentive to the landowner.</P>

This has been the policy of the commissioners in the past and they will continue to try to acquire land through voluntary arrangements.  A compulsory purchase order will only be used in cases where it would be impossible to proceed and work was held up.  The method by which this will be done is covered in the legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 28, after &ldquo;safety&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and anti-pollution measures&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Conservation is something to which, in the main, people pay plenty of lip service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> There are no votes involved in it.  It is extremely expensive.  The last Seanad suffered for almost two years because it was necessary to restore this Chamber and thanks to the Office of Public Works, we now have the honour of working in the most environmentally pleasing atmosphere in the whole country.  They carried out a remarkable job of conservation and restoration.  In any sphere, when it comes to conservation, there is a price to be paid.  I find that at council level but one thing that creates hassle is when it is proposed to locate a dump in an area or when one is trying to protect the environment or trying to implement anti-pollution measures.  The public have a very definite dual standard.</P>
    <P>We have just come to the end of the Green Presidency.  The Government had a remarkable and laudable policy of projecting this country as one with a healthy environment.  When the Minister makes the regulations I hope he will include anti-pollution measures to protect and conserve the waterways.  An environmentally friendly engine has been developed.  As far as new and replacement engines are concerned the Minister should take power to direct that those new engines be environmentally friendly and run on vegetable oil which would be produced a home &mdash; it could be used both as a fuel and a lubricant.  Any spillage of oil would not kill and pollute fish but would fatten them.  Let us demonstrate in a practical way that we believe that we say.  Let us present to Europe and the rest of the world environmentally friendly waterways where, if people fall off boats into rivers or lakes, they will not be poisoned by pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to introduce by-laws to cover the pollution aspect the Senator mentioned.  In that regard it would not be necessary to mention anti-pollution measures specifically. The regulations on the condition of boats used on the waterways are provided for under section 3 (1) (a) and the by-law to be made under section 3 (1) (k) includes a prohibition on anything which could <Col N="252" /> become a danger to health, fish stocks and so on.  We have provided the necessary power to enable us to make the by-laws which the Senator feels are necessary. It is not necessary to mention anti-pollution measures specifically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that we are coming to the end of the era where we could take a boat and row across the waterways free of charge?  Have we reached the end of inexpensive or free recreational activities on our waterways? Does the Minister propose to licence boats and have owners pay some kind of registration tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention to have a registration system.  This would not apply to small rowing boats.  They would be able to row and said freely.  It would apply to the bigger cabin cruiser.  That would be desirable especially in view of some of the points made by Senators here this evening.  If this development escalates over the next few years, we will need to have a measure of control over what takes place and avoid the pitfalls Senator Hederman mentioned.  She highlighted very important canals where they have these problems mainly because there is no registration arrangement in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (7), the Minister is taking the unusual precaution of giving his Department 12 months in which to prosecute; normally it is six months.  Why do we need to have a 12-month facility under this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that this activity will be widespread in the sense that boats from the Ulster navigation can come through the Erne-Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal into the Shannon and down to the Estuary, and maybe further. I know that Senator Mooney would like to see yachts from the Cayman Islands in Lough Allen, that is feasible, but the fact <Col N="253" /> is that we need some additional time to enable inquiries to be made.  That is the reason for this provision.</P>

      <P>In what circumstances does the Minister see the implementation of the powers that will now be granted to the commissioners to carry out works in relation to Shannon navigation and to enter land?  Would it be in cases where development has been inhibited by reluctance on the part of landowners to release their land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 4(1)(a)(ii) the Minister is taking power to enter any land.  In his reply on Second Stage there was a point made about pollution in the Shannon valley from the activities of Bord na Móna.  In the flooding season, from October to May, a lot of land is badly polluted.  Some 20 years ago, one landowner, Eddie Kearns from Offaly, took a very expensive law case against the board and he was successful. Since, in this Bill, the Minister is taking powers to enter any land, will he also have responsibility to compensate people whose lands or crops are damaged in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the legislation provision is made for the payment of compensation and there are procedures set as to how that can be arrived at.  The normal <Col N="254" /> arbitration arrangement for such settlements is in place already and can be utilised. The answer to the question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Mooney's point, questions will arise as to whether we can or cannot enter the lands and we will have to be clear that we have the authority to do what we want to do.  Occasions arise from time to time when it is not possible to undertake survey work which would be essential in the design of a scheme, and we need this authority to enable us to undertake that kind of work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be vesting delays of up to five or six years in the transfer of land.  What will the situation be if the Office of Public Works want to acquire a piece of property?  Do I take it from section 4 (1) that the landowner will not be paid until after the vesting?  It would be unfair if people were left for four or five years without payment.  That is how long it takes now for a father to transfer land to his son.  I do not want to make a big issue out of it but should we not have an ordinary deal where they would buy it and let the vesting take its own time, then it would not matter very much to either party if the deal is finished and put through.</P>
      <P>Why is the Minister bothering to hand over the payments to the Irish Land Commission. Nearly all of those annuities have run their 100 years course.  Why should the Office of Public Works have to pay the Land Commission which is now extinct?  The staff have disbanded and the commissioners are gone so why does he start talking about the Irish Land Commission five years after its demise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation to wind up the Land Commission is before the other House on Second Stage.  It has not gone <Col N="255" /> through yet and until such time as that legislation goes through the Land Commission is still in place.  It is likely that, in the winding up of the Land Commission provision will be made to continue through the Department of Agriculture and Food certain activities which are carried out at present by the Land Commission. The Seanad will have an opportunity to discuss that Bill but, for the present, the law is as it stands and even though the Land Commission is being wound up certain of its responsibilities and functions will continue to be carried out perhaps not by the commission in its present form but under another framework.  This legislation will apply to that new arrangement and that will be provided for in the legislation which will come before the House.</P>
      <P>It is not necessarily the case that people will be held up for three or four years awaiting vesting.  My advice is that the normal transaction can take place, that people can be paid and that vesting can be completed without necessarily holding up the payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point worth making is on the Land Commission annuities.  Even on 100 acres of land in the more expensive parts of the country you are only talking about an annuity of £7, £8 or £11.  It will not pay the Office of Public Works to chase those annuities which, in the main have only three or four years to run.  It is an uneconomic activity and the Minister should drop it from the Schedule altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be advisable to drop it because we might be left in a situation where we would not be able to complete titles and ownerships satisfactorily.  It is important to have this provision here.  In view of the fact that the legislation which the Senator spoke about has not yet gone through the Oireachtas and may be changed dramatically, it would be unwise to do something which would be detrimental to the people from whom we would acquire property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am sorry for the late hour but I am sure of his goodwill and interesting comments as always.  The motion refers to a resolution of the European Parliament. This is the most appropriate context into which I can put it.  The motion was notified to the European Parliament on 10 May 1990 in the names of Mr. Tindermans, Mr. Habsburg, Mr. Robles Piquer, Mrs. Lenz, Mrs. Oomen, Mr. Chanterie and Mr. Klepsch.  The motion read:</P>
      <P>The European Parliament:</P>
      <P>A. having regard to:</P>
      <P>(a)  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,</P>
      <P>(b)  the European Declaration of Human Rights,</P>
      <P>the Heklsinki Final Act,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> (d)  the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</P>
    <P>B. having regard to:</P>
    <P>(a)  the extraordinary humanitarian actions of Mr. Raoul Wallenberg which saved some hundred thousand Hungarian Jews during the Nazi final solution,</P>
    <P>(b)  his arbitrary arrest in January 1945 by Soviet troops after the liberation of Hungary,</P>
    <P>(c)  his indefensible detention in numerous Soviet prisons,</P>
    <P>(d)  the number of witnesses who have testified to seeing Mr. Wallenberg alive subsequent to July 1947, when according to the Soviet authorities of the time, he is supposed to have died,</P>
    <P>(e)  the anomalies found in his death certificate, such as the absence of Christian name and date of birth,</P>
    <P>(f)  the lack of irrefutable evidence that Mr. Wallenberg died in 1947,</P>
    <P>(g)  the attitude of openness and understanding recently displayed by the Soviet authorities in connection with the case, as evinced by the Kremlin's official invitation to the Wallenberg family to visit Moscow,</P>
    <P>Calls on the Soviet authorities:</P>
    <P>1.  To reopen the case of Mr. Raoul Wellenberg and his driver, Mr. Vilmos Langfelder;</P>
    <P>2.  To allow an international commission of historians and experts to examine all the archive material;</P>
    <P>3.  To use the press, radio and television and all other legal avenues to launch a search throughout the territory of the Soviet Union</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister was aware that this was passed unanimously on 17 May by the European Parliament.  When I say unanimously I mean unanimously, <Col N="259" /> including the fact that no one abstained. It is a most important resolution.  The Minister, who is used to interpreting this kind of documentation, will note a very considerable shift because the prsumption behind the motion is that Wallenberg is still alive.  This is the belief of the European Assembly so it is important that we take it in this context.</P>
    <P>I spoke this afternoon to Mme.  Simone Lucki who is the distinguished advocate in Brussels who framed this motion on behalf of Mr. Tindemans who is a distinguished former foreign Minister of Belgium.  She explained the background to me and also the fact that it was passed in this manner as a matter of urgency because it was wished to have this as an instrument before the recent meeting of CSCE in Copenhagen where it was raised with some of the Russian delegates.  I will return to that and place some further information on the record.</P>
    <P>The matter of Raoul Wallenberg had been raised by a senior diplomat with Mr. Shevardnadze in Brussels in December 1989.  Mme. Lucki, the advocate to whom I have already referred, who is the president of the Belgian Raoul Wallenberg Society met with Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary General of the United Nations in the presence of Foreign Minister Eychens in Brussels within the last six weeks. He has promised to raise it directly with Mr. Gorbachev.</P>
    <P>Returning to the question of the CSCE meeting in June it is important to recognise that major advances have been at that time, which is the very recent past indeed, in direct discussions between senior Swedish diplomats and Russian personnel.  The Russians have now agreed to the establishment of the group within the Soviet Union to examine the Wallenberg case in detail.  At a meeting on 15 June in Copenhagen the phrase was used by a senior Russian diplomat: <i>les imprausions sur les circonstances de déces de Wallenburg,</i> the uncertainty surrounding the death of Raoul Wallenberg. It is a very interesting point that the Russians themselves have now accepted even from their own perspective that there is a degree of uncertainly about Wallenberg.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> This is important because it is essential to understand that Wallenberg is still alive.  I spoke also to Sonja Sonnefeld, who is the secretary of the international Wallenberg committee, and she supplied me this afternoon with further information which I place on the record of the House.  In speaking to me on the telephone, she said that she was particularly pleased because I stated at the beginning that I believed Wallenberg to be alive.  This is, in fact, the case.  I would make the point to the Minister in the criminal law one presumes an accused to be innocent until proved guilty.  In the case of Wallenberg there is an absolute moral obligation on us to assume that Wallenberg has survived.  It is frequently asked: How can anybody survive a labour camp?  Wallenberg is not in a labour camp.  He is 77 years old.  He is in a very special kind of camp, the existence of which is not widely known, camps known as schneigelagern, and that is the German translation which means camps of silence, into which outside the Gulag Archipelago persons who have been for political reasons declared to be dead are kept in such absolute secrecy that not even members of the top echelon of the Russian political regime may be aware of the fact that they continue to exist.  It was interesting that at the meeting between members of the Wallenberg family and the Swedish Wallenberg society last October, the KGB, having handed over some documents, said not that he was dead but that he could not survive the camps, they presumably meant at any of the camps, but particularly the labour camps.  He is not in a labour camp.</P>
    <P>I have a number of examples of people who have survived.  I would like to place on the record the detailed story which I have here of a woman called Oxana Bandera who was arrested in 1941 and sentenced to a labour camp incarceration. She was released inexplicably in 1989.  She is a perfectly healthy woman. She has been in the camp four years longer than Wallenberg and she has managed to survive.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to another document and I will have to treat this very <Col N="261" /> much more briefly than I would if I had more time, but perhaps that is a useful discipline.  It was faxed to me from Stockholm today.  It is a series of interviews with Per Angor who was Second Secretary of the Swedish legation in Budapest during the period that Wallenberg was saving the Jews.  The question is asked: how come you believe Wallenberg is still alive?  This is the answer:</P>
    <P>Prisoners of various internationalities were released, went back to their countries and witnessed to have seen Raoul in prison or to have been in &ldquo;knocking contact&rdquo; with him.  Since there is evidence that Raoul has survived the Stalin era and it is known that after Stalin prisoners have to serve their sentence, no matter how many years, our belief is justified.  There are other strong indications that Raoul lives in a place together with other prisoners of different nationalities who are all declard dead.  That is the Schweigelagern.  It is said that Raoul was given another identity, but this information could not be checked. Soviet declarations that Raoul should have died in a Soviet prison in 1947 have always been rejected, both by Raoul's family and the Swedish Government.</P>
    <P>This is a man who was a professional diplomat, a realist, somebody who had direct personal experience of this world and of Wallenberg himself.  It seems to me that it is very strong evidence indeed.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention also the fact that until his recent and tragic death this was the opinion of Academician Andre Sakharov who was no fool.  He was a scientist who was used to the evaluation of precise scientific material.  Not only that, but in an interview Sakharov makes the point also that not only does he believe that Wallenberg is alive, but that he considers it quite extraordinary and incredible that the Russian Government are unable to produce documentation about Wallenberg and his fate because, as he points out, everybody knows that for a person of Wallenberg's significance and diplomatic status it would be <Col N="262" /> unthinkable that NKVD and subsequently KGB files about a man of this standing would be allowed to disappear or could disappear.</P>
    <P>I would further make the point to the Minister that it is certainly incomprehensible to me that if Wallenberg were dead, nothing, except for the forged documents produced in handwritten form to suggest that Wallenberg had died in prison in 1947, has been found or produced by the Soviet authorities.  I would remind the Minister that in the case, for example of Martin Boorman who was killed in a bombing raid while he was trying to escape along the underground railway line in Berlin and whose bones were discovered a couple of years ago, the very same Russians who came across his corpse by accident were able to tell who it was and identify him positively by means of his dental records.  They have not produced any comparable physical evidence that Wallenberg is dead, despite the fact that they actually had Wallenberg in their custody.  This is a very remarkable, indeed an extraordinary situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to point also to the fact that the Russians in 1947 said in a communication under the signature of Mr. Vyshinsky, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR:</P>
    <P>As a result of careful verification, it has been established that Wallenberg is not in the Soviet Union and we do not know anything about him.</P>
    <P>That was accepted in 1957, ten years later, by Mr. Gromyko as a complete downright and utter lie, but this statement, as the Minister knows and as the Swedish Government have continued to insist, was also untrue and this, I would remind the Minister, remains the consistent position of the Swedish Government.</P>
    <P>Who are we going to listen to in the matter?  Are we going to listen to the Russians who have lied once so categorically that they had no record of Wal lenberg in 1947?  Then in 1957, Mr. Gromyko suddenly discovers that it was all a lie and that they did have him in the Russian prison system but mysteriously <Col N="263" /> he died, and even more mysteriously all the people who were involved in his medical treatment, in the autopsy and so on have also disappeared, the principal one, Abakumov having been executed for treason so there is not very much reason to place any credibility on his testimony. It is quite unusual to say the least and to put it at a very mild level that the Russians would trot out the word of a traitor to support their contention that Wallenberg, about whom they had already lied, and admitted they had lied, was dead.</P>
    <P>I take the view &mdash; I believe it is a view that is increasingly held and supported by a growing number of international statesmen &mdash; that Wallenberg is alive.  I would like to say a few words about what is so very special about Wallenberg.  I need not repeat the entire story of Wallenberg but in the closing years of war Wallenberg went voluntarily to Budapest. He was a son of a very distinguished family who had an enormous interest in industry and commerce throughout the Scandinavian countries and, indeed, throughout the world.  He went with the mission of saving the Hungarian Jews.  It was an act of extraordinary Christianity on Wallenberg's part during a period when the Christian world did not behave always in accord with those values.  He went unarmed into the railway trains that were taking the unfortunate Jewish people to extinction at the camp at Auschwitz.  Armed only with his own extraordinary integrity, he was able to defy the armed might of the Gestapo and rescue 100,000 of these wretched people by giving them the protection of his own charisma and extending to them diplomatic passports which he was manufacturing in the Swedish legation in Budapest.  That is what makes him a most important figure.  We are continually talking about peace and the question is asked in this country, how can peaceful means operate against an armed aggressor?  Wallenberg demonstrated how moral authority could win out in the end.</P>
    <P>In 1945 when the Russians were closing in on the city, Wallenberg crossed into <Col N="264" /> the Russian zone in order to negotiate for food for the people he was protecting. He was taken into protective custody by the Russians and when they interrogated him and asked him what he was doing, he said that he was trying to save the Jews.  In 1945 that was absolutely laughable. You may remember that the Allies would not divert even one aeroplane to bomb the railway siding into Auschwitz and save people whom they knew they would save by this very economical measure.  Wallenberg also had a plan for the reconstruction of Hungary after the War using Jewish intelligence, financial expertise and American money.  Putting all these factors together, the Russian read into the situation, American spy.  By the time they got him into their clutches the bureaucratic system had closed around him and it was virtually impossible to get him out again.</P>
    <P>I would like to place on the record the kind of thing that used to happen because I think in a vignette it tells the quality of Wallenberg.  In a book called <i>Righteous Gentile</i> by John Bierman, a man called Tommy Lapid who subsequently became head of the Israeli television network, tells a story of how in 1944 he was waiting in hiding with his mother and grandmother when suddenly the door burst open and they were taken away.  His mother and grandmother disappeared. He was nine years old and he sat on the floor crying.  He knew they were going for ever to extinction.  However, an hour or an hour and a half later the door opened and the two women came in and they only said one word: Wallenberg. That was enough for the child to know precisely what had happened.  As he said in the book, there was only on man who cared for the Jews and it was that extraordinary angel, Wallenberg.</P>
    <P>That is why it is important that we take this motion seriously and that we believe, as we are morally impelled to do, not only by every decent civilised principle but also by virtue of the enormous evidence that is available, that Wallenberg is still alive.  We must believe that he is still alive and we must move to persuade the Russians that it is now time and in <Col N="265" /> their interests, as I believe it is, that Wallenberg should be released.</P>
    <P>The time is critical because in September 1991 there will be a very large international human rights conference in Moscow and if in the 15 months before that confreence Wallenberg is not released it will be immensely more difficult for the Russian regime to be able to release him.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to discuss with the Government the possibility of something which is the subject of a motion I have on the Order Paper and which I believe would be supported throughout all sections of this House &mdash; and also I believe in the Dáil and that is that the Government should set in motion, as a matter of urgency, the legal machinery required to confer upon Wallenberg the status of honorary citizen of Ireland.  This has already been done by the United States, Canada and Israel.  I mentioned this to my contacts in Stockholm and also in Brussels today and they both said that is fantastic.  That is what Ireland could do.  It would be remarkable.</P>
    <P>Most of us were in the Dáil when that great statesman and great human being, Nelson Mandela, addressed the Dáil, because this country had such a feeling for human rights that Dublin, this great capital city in which we are standing tonight, made him a freeman of this city. Can you imagine what the feeling throughout the world would be if Raoul Wallenberg, on his release, came also and addressed a meeting of both Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
    <P>What more appropriate day could there be to discuss this than the day in which we seem to have moved very close indeed to the release of another hostage, Brian Keenan, who has been incarcerated for four years?  Wallenberg has been inside and continues to live in a camp of silence, and this is his 44th year. He is 77 years old.  We owe it to him to break the silence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for putting forward this <Col N="266" /> motion and also for his remarkably well researched contribution to the debate.</P>
      <P>The case of Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who, as Senator Norris said, saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of Jews in Budapest during the Second World War; is of tremendous interest to all of us.  It is a very special story.  It is a story of courage and selflessness and shows what a person can do in the right place at the right time to help his fellowmen in the desperate circumstances that exist.</P>
      <P>The tragedy of the Raoul Wallenberg story is that, having survived the Nazi occupation and having heroically struggled to frustrate the criminal racist policies of the Nazi regime, he came into the hands of the advancing Soviet army and disappeared thereafter.  In the confused circumstances surrounding the liberation of Budapest, Mr. Wallenberg was taken into custody by Soviet officers.  There have since been a number of reports of his having been seen in the Soviet prison system by other inmates of the Gulag Archipelago.  In the nature of things, these reports were impossible to corroborate or deny.</P>
      <P>Successive Irish Governments have taken an active interest in the case.  The Soviet Embassy has been made aware of this interest.  Many Irish people, moved by the possibility that this man could still be imprisoned in the Soviet Union, have themselves written to the Soviet Embassy in the hope of gaining new information on the case.  Unfortunately, until recently, the only Soviet official information on Mr. Wallenberg's situation, was that forwarded by the then Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrei Gromyko in 1957 &mdash; that is something Senator Norris referred to &mdash; this was according to a document found in the archives of the Lubyanka Prison in Moscow, Mr. Wallenberg died in that prison in 1947. The Gromyko memorandum, as it was called, quoted the discovered document as stating that Mr. Wallenberg died suddenly &ldquo;probably as a result of a heart attack&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the account reiterated for many years by the Soviets when they <Col N="267" /> were questioned about the fate of Mr. Wallenberg.  However, in August of last year the Soviet Ambassador to Sweden reported in an article in <i>Moscow News</i> that Mr. Wallenberg had been murdered by Russian agents.  The ambassador, Mr. Boris Pankin, expressed Soviet guilt and regret for the crime and I quote:</P>
    <P>The dead cannot be brought back to life.  The only thing you can do is again praise his accompishments and express feelings of compassion and guilt to his people and those closest to him.</P>
    <P>The ambassador's article has taken the Soviet official account of the fate of Mr. Wallenberg a stage further.  Nevertheless, his relatives and those who are active on his behalf, as detailed to us by Senator Norris, and indeed all of us who are anxious for clarification of his case, are still hopeful that the Soviet authorities will release the documentation necessary to establish why Mr. Wallenberg was incarcerated and, if he was murdered, judicially or otherwise, why this occurred and in what circumstances it occurred.  The Soviet authorities argue that there is no further documentation on Raoul Wallenberg which would establish the exact circumstances in which he disappeared.</P>
    <P>At the CSCE conference on the human dimension in Paris in June 1989 the chief Soviet delegate, Mr. Yuri Kashlev said that the Soviets had no information beyond the fact that Mr. Wallenberg was imprisoned and died in the Soviet Union. He used at that stage a phrase somewhat similar to what Senator Norris described another person as using, and that is: &ldquo;his fate, like that of thousands of others, is unknown, as are the circumstances surrounding it.  If we knew any more we would let the world know.  We have thousands like him, people who have passed into oblivion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kashlev claimed that the people who destroyed Mr. Wallenberg destroyed the papers concerning him and were then eventually destroyed themselves. He assured the conference that if any new information emerges they would inform the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> There can be no reasonable doubt that Mr. Kashlev's comments on the general situation regarding those involved in the Soviet system at the time were true.  It was partly the tragedy of the Soviet Union at the time that millions were killed and that these included in their turn those who were responsible for the murder of others and that many of the records of this period were destroyed or disappeared.</P>
    <P>However, I have noted what Senator Norris has described as the presumption behind the resolution which was before the European Parliament and I have noted the persistent reports that Wallenberg was seen in the Gulag after the period referred to by Mr. Kashlev.  These reports are troubling.  These reports were also cited by Senator Norris in his contribution to the Seanad this evening.  I will certainly discuss with the Minister for Foreign Affairs the details which have been mentioned and which have been laid before the House by Senator Norris.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kashlev has assured the CSCE participating states that if any new information emerges on Mr. Wallenberg the Soviet authorities will inform the world of it.  The Government will urge that a very special effort be made to clarify the case further.  I can assure the House and Senator Norris that the Minister for Foreign Affiars will continue to take an active interest in Mr. Wallenberg's fate to try to ascertain once and for all conclusive evidence of the factual situation surrounding Mr. Wallenberg's case.  Hopefully he is alive and well.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his courteous reply.  I take great heart from the fact that he will study the evidence I have placed before the House which, as he noted himself, is even more recent than his own excellently researched documents and casts a particular gloss on the explanation of the Russian Government.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 12.35 a.m. on Thursday, 12 July 1990 until 10.30 a.m.</P>
