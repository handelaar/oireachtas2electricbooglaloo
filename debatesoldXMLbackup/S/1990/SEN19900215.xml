      <P>I have notice from Senator Liam Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House to-day, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The delay in publishing the report on pay and conditions in the Defence Forces with the continuing hardship for members and their dependants.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The critical problems caused to all sectors, rural and urban, by recent storms on our coastline and inland, the lack of Government response and the totally inadequate emergency moneys offered by Brussels.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to explain any arrangement he has reached with a Member of Dáil Éireann concerning the funding of hospital services in Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cosgrave, Doyle and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matter raised by Senator <Col N="2002" /> Cosgrave and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Doyle and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Horse Breeding Bill is a Bill to repeal the Horse Breeding Act, which deals with the licensing of stallions.  I would like to ask the Leader to reconsider the ordering of this Bill today as the Equestrian Federation of Ireland have a motion before the next meeting of the Horse Advisory Committee, which is in March, to continue the licensing of all stallions.  So what we are doing here today is the opposite of what the Equestrian Federation of Ireland, the parent body, will be moving at the very next meeting of the Horse Advisory Committee.  I am not saying we will never do it or should never do it.  I just think our timing is an insult to the very committee that the Minister appointed before Christmas.  I urge that we leave this Bill until the Horse Advisory Committee have had time to study it. It has not been brought before them and I think this is a conscious decision not to let them see it.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise very briefly on the Order of Business a matter which has been giving some concern to Independent Senators for some time.  I do not think it is relevant to the An Bord Glas Bill which is coming before the House now but it is relevant to a lot of Bills and perhaps to other Bills which will be before the House this week and next week.  It is this.  We frequently do not get the relevant Minister; we get a Minister taking through a Bill on which he is not properly briefed and which he is not qualified to take through the House.  I do <Col N="2003" /> not think this is a new problem for this House.  It is something which we should have raised &mdash; it is our own fault &mdash; many years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to appear to be the least bit repetitious.  I want to say simply that I agree fully with Senator Ross that ordering business means ordering business in a way which means that this House can discuss the legislation in a proper fashion and that means both that the Members are facilitated and also that the Minister who is competent and responsible or an appropriate competent responsible deputy is here.  It is no service to this House or to the legislative process to have Ministers here who, through no fault of their own, are not well informed on the contents of a Bill.</P>
      <P>May I say, as Béarla, how much I agree with Senator Ó Foighil.  It is particularly scandalous and shameful that an issue that is raised by deliberate choice by a Member of this House in what is theoretically the first language cannot be given a response in that language.  It is not a reflection on the particular Minister who is here.  There are more than enough Ministers and junior Ministers in the present Government, or indeed in any alternative Government, with competence in the Irish language to be able to do that.  What it effectively says is that there are two languages to be used in this House, one of which is important and the other of which is marginal, and that is a total and utterly abject display of hypocrisy.</P>

      <P>Two questions were asked which are relevant to the Order of Business.  One was Senator Doyle's question in connection with the Horse Breeding Bill.  What happens outside the Houses of the Oireachtas is of concern, of course, when Bills are coming forward. This Bill is being introduced here and, once the Bill has been introduced and the Minister makes his speech, people from outside the House will then have plenty of time to address themselves to what is in the Bill.  I would suggest that the people concerned will have been reasonably well briefed already on what is in the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Bord Glas Bill, 1989: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that he will be flexible. The Minister's approach is right and proper because this Bill will have far-reaching effects on the agricultural industry and, for that reason, flexibility is very important.  I realise a review of agriculture and of the farm income area is a difficult subject on which to have perfect legislation and I am sure we will have to continue to update legislation in the light of the changing situation in Europe.  I want to congratulate and compliment Deputy Kirk for his consistent interest. Even before he was Minister, when he was a TD, he wrote papers and showed a very serious interest in the development of horticulture and tillage.  Unfortunately for far too long we lacked people with ground experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Minister, Deputy Kirk is sitting here.  I remember very clearly going to his house during my Seanad election campaign and I met him out in a field on a tractor.  It is great to have someone who has &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; experience steering this Bill through the Seanad today.  I appreciate very much the Ministers down-to-earth attitude and I am sure we will have an even better knowledge and a better grasp of the subject when this Bill goes through the Seanad.  I appreciate the many difficulties and all the different areas that have to be <Col N="2008" /> covered.  It is a difficult task.  The setting up of the interim board in 1987 was a proper decision because it has given the Minister time to examine in a serious way any difficulties that might arise.  I think that procedure was proper.</P>
    <P>Potatoes, glasshouses, mushrooms and vegetables are all growth areas with potential for jobs.  They need support and recognition and the fact that we are now competing with every country in Europe means we must give the maximum support to those involved in the horticulture scene.  It has got to be fully developed; expertise, advice and financial aid must be updated and I think we have the right Minister here to do that.</P>
    <P>First, I will deal with a subject which is fairly near to my heart, the potato industry which certainly has had a long history of difficulties.  I sympathise with the Minister because he has had to take over and help out an industry that has been run down for years through bad management.  For the past 20 years the potato industry has been largely managed from Merrion Square by a Civil Service structure that was far removed from the difficulties experienced on a farm.  I believe the Potato Marketing Board and the Potato Marketing Company are largely responsible for having allowed the potato industry to fail.  They administered the potato business from Merrion Square and they were out of touch completely with the world scene and developments in marketing.  While their intentions were good and they were hoping to achieve reconition, unfortunately they presided over the total failure of this country to participate in any serious way in the marketing of potatoes.</P>
    <P>The present Minister, Deputy Kirk, cannot be blamed for the failures in the past in the potato industry because the structures were very complicated.  The Department of Agriculture were involved in the setting up of the Potato Marketing Board.  That was a clumsy vehicle that never worked.  After the setting up of the board which evolved into the Potato Marketing Company, that company set about trying to develop <Col N="2009" /> export markets.  I claim it never did this successfully.</P>
    <P>It is tragic for those of us who are interested in the potato business to look at the world scene where the Irish potato producers have declined while, at the same time, the world market has increased.  In the past 15 years the market in Europe was able to expand from 857,000 tonnes of seed potatoes in 1970 to 1,082,000 tonnes in 1985.  That expansion of the industry has taken place mainly in Holland, France and Scotland. The Dutch, in the years from 1970 to 1985, doubled the tonnage of seed potatoes they exported.  In that very same period the production of seed potatoes in Ireland declined to the point when it was hardly worthwhile providing the structures of support, including the potato inspectors whose salary was paid by the Department of Agriculture.  The tonnage declined to the point where one small boat would take all the potatoes the country produced. I speak with some knowledge and experience because that production was in my home county of Donegal.</P>
    <P>That is the situation the Minister in charge of horticulture has taken over.  It can only improve and it behoves all of us to give the maximum support to him in the hope that he will turn around an industry that was very valuable to this country.  Many farm families were sustained and maintained from the production of seed and ware potatoes and when the seed industry declined, automatically the ware industry declined also because they were related and dependent on each other.</P>
    <P>Many housewives will say they are buying imported potatoes because Irish potatoes are not graded properly.  This is a cry from people who do not know the history on the ground and how difficult it has been.  The small producer on the hillside farm has not had the support he should have had.  We were supporting institutions in Merrion Square.  On the dearest patch in this country we were supporting the best office the country could provide, with a staff of about 16, with cleaners and with tea trollies coming around at 10 o'clock.  If you were to <Col N="2010" /> inspect the office at Merrion Square you would think it was in charge of a flourishing industry but if you paid a visit to a small farm anywhere in Ireland you would find that the farmer had very few facilities and no storage space at all. These are the root causes of the potato industry failing.  We have had a serious decline, to the point where the industry is nearly lost.</P>
    <P>The Minister must not make the mistake that has been made in the past of picking out a few large firms and supporting them at the expense of the producer. In Holland and in other countries where the production of potatoes is very successful farm prices are looked at very closely.  Every producer must have proper accommodation.  We must show the same care and give the same support for our producers.  We must inspect his land, farm, implements, storage and facilities on the ground.  If there is financial support it must be given to the farmer &mdash; the producer.  All the other support we give is important but it is secondary. There is no point &mdash; and we did this for years in the meat industry &mdash; in supporting the processor.  The person who needs support is the producer.  The conditions have got to be right on the ground. If there is grant support it has got to be given to those on the ground.  There is no point in allowing the industry to develop and, at the same time, not taking very good care of what is happening on the farm.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Kirk, has enough experience to know that the support must be given direct to the farmer.  I strongly urge him not to give substantial financial support to co-operatives because if he does that he will build up the co-ops and grading stations and marketing centres but they will have nothing to market and nothing to grade if the farmers are neglected.  I strongly urge the Minister that primary attention should be given to farmers.  I hope I am getting through to the Minister.  I believe that he is in a position to know best.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the special difficulties we have in the glasshouse <Col N="2011" /> industry.  Much the same story can be told about this industry because ten, 15 or 20 years ago we were developing the glasshouse industry throughout the country.  Tomatoes were grown in those glasshouses, because we recognised that the Irish tomato has a special flavour and probably is the best tomato produced anywhere in Europe.  At the time many of those glasshouses were heated by oil and the Suez crisis and the subsequent steep increase in oil prices left us with the problem that many of our producers and glasshouse owners had to go out of business. At this stage the Dutch took over because they had glasshouses heated by natural gas.  They were importing the natural gas through a pipe grid from the Soviet Union.  The steep increase in the price of oil and the fact that the Dutch had a competitive edge resulted in the collapse of our glass industry.</P>
    <P>The provision or our own natural gas from Kinsale to Dundalk gives us an opportunity for a major development of the glasshouse industry.</P>
    <P>There has been a completely turnaround and a new start is being made.  If cheap energy is not provided for glasshouses and we cannot compete, we will not be able to stay in business.  There is no point in the Department supporting the provision of glasshouses when it is evident that the industry is dependent on dear sources of energy.  The Department will have to put down clear markers in regard to how glasshouses will be heated. If because of cheap energy they can compete with other European countries those glasshouses will survive.  It would be a major mistake to support the provision of glasshouses unless it can be clearly established that cheap energy will be available to heat them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recent substantial development of the mushroom industry, I would like to compliment the Minister here, because he saw the niche in the market for the development of that industry.  An Bord Glas have supported mushroom development in a positive and serious manner.  Anything less would not <Col N="2012" /> have succeeded.  It is nice to see the clusters of mushroom houses in rural areas. These are great developments and they will help to sustain small rural farms.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to introduce tight supervision because mushrooms are prone to disease.  Any breakdown in supervision will result in collapse and economic failure.  I strongly urge the Minister to ensure he has the right personnel frequently calling for a number of years until the industry is established on a sound footing.  Every month somebody should inspect the inside of those mushroom houses to see that they are being well maintained and that there is no disease. We must ensure that the people who have committed themselves to this industry and have received support are maintaining their mushroom houses in a way that will give the industry a good name and ensure that the Irish mushroom development will be a success story.</P>
    <P>The fruit and vegetable industry is wide open for development.  One could talk about fruit or vegetable development for a long time.  We have not been successful in any major way in growing fruit.  I know that, with our climate and being disease free, we could grow substantial tonnage of fruit and we could save on import if the right approach was made.  We can grow plums, strawberries, raspberries or other fruit instead of importing thousands of tonnes every year.  We have the right climate to grow our own fruit and vegetables. All that is needed is the supervision and the support on the ground.</P>
    <P>The Department have to come to grips with this question of fruit production. They must be careful not to go into it on a big scale but to allow the industry to develop in a supervised way to the point where those involved in growing fruit recognise that there is only one way to survive financially, that is, to manage the business in a professional manner to compete with Europe, and to compete with other countries that are allowed free access to our markets.  We have the climate and we have suitable land. Whether it is a question of shelter belts or other protection the grower needs, it is essential that the Department draw up <Col N="2013" /> conditions and provide assistance to the point where there is a reasonable chance that those involved in growing fruit will survive.</P>
    <P>The same comments can be made in respect of vegetables.  There is no other place in Europe we are aware of that can produce vegetables any better than they can be produced here at home.  They might produce earlier cauliflower in Brittany and France and earlier lettuce under glass in Holland, but we here in Ireland have the perfect climate and soil for the production of vegetables.  We are only scratching at the potential for development of the horticultural industry. There are thousands of jobs available. When one matches that with the tonnage coming into this country one becomes depressed.  When will we ever come to grips with one of our greatest potential industries?  I give strong support to the Minister of State in the formation of An Bord Glas.  That puts down the framework for a new start in the whole development of vegetables, and fruit.</P>
    <P>We have to start to educate people in horticulture.  I encourage the new board to start in the schools, especially secondary schools.  Every secondary school in the country should have a plot of ground.  Whether or not they are involved in agriculture in a serious way, every secondary school and vocational school, should take an acre of land two miles down the road or have it within the confines of the school and should give an opportunity to their students to become involved in experimental work on horticulture. Every secondary school should have a glasshouse and should engage in the growing of early flowers and lettuce. The possibility of earning a good living at home should be brought home to every student.  I strongly urge the Minister to look at the possibility of encouraging schools to have their own plot of ground where young people can be afforded the opportunity to grow and test crops.  This will give them the opportunity of seeing what can be produced at home which is equal to the best we import.</P>
    <P>I accompanied the Minister last year when he visited the Department's farm <Col N="2014" /> at Topp's in Raphoe.  There is the opportunity of breeding plants there.  Care and considerations for the proper breeding of plants and disease-free plants is basic. The Minister has made an important contribution to the breeding of plants.  I encourage him to expand activities at Topp's farm in Raphoe.  This should be supported and brought into the overall development plans of An Bord Glas.  This will pay off very substantially.</P>
    <P>It is not much of a contribution to criticise everything that is done or has not been done.  It is better to make a more positive contribution.  There have not been enough opportunities on the small rural farms in Ireland in the past few years.  When the former president of the EC visited the country he indicated that his first priority was the retention and support of the small rural farm in Ireland and other countries.  That was a welcome recognition.  Unfortunately we have not had support on the ground for the small farm and we had reached the point when tillage had almost disappeared.</P>
    <P>Barley production has practically ceased because it is no longer a profitable crop.  The reason for this decline is largely because we are importing offal and animal feed from Third World countries. There is very little control over this. When one highlights the imports of Third World countries into Europe, which is making life difficult for farmers in this country, one is always told that it is a counter-balance to something else, that Europe will export its beef and so on and we have to allow certain quotas.  Farmers who are involved in growing barley in County Donegal find that they have reached the stage when it is not profitable any longer largely because the offal is coming in from the other end of the world.  Millers have to buy the cheapest imports.  Boats of offal arrive daily in Belfast and Derry.  Huge lorries of grain and offal arrive daily in County Donegal. The small farmer who has to rotate crops is no longer able to grow barely and make a profit.  He cannot break even.  This is a tragic situation.  The answer appears to be beyond An Bord Glas and the Minister of State.  This is a European problem.  There <Col N="2015" /> is no point in offering help to small farmers if, at the same time, imports are being allowed to put them out of business. The money to support them in the first instance is being wasted.</P>
    <P>We have got to recognise the advantages and educate our young people to be aware of them.  We have a clean and a green island despite the fact that there is a lot of talk about pollution and smog. Our island is cleaner and greener than any other part of Europe or the world. That is not an exaggeration.  We have the best climate, suitable and disease-free to produce all the different vegetables, the grain, and the grass, the cheapest feeding for animals.  We have the best opportunity of anybody in Europe and we can survive any competition if our people are encouraged to believe in themselves and are committed to earning a living on the farm.  Help has to be offered to stabilise development and to encourage people to believe there are many opportunities on this island.</P>
    <P>Whether you have tillage, sheep, milk or whatever, the question of land use is a big factor.  We have thousands of acres of land underdeveloped and under-used. Everywhere you go you see mass tracts of land that are not properly used.  I would like to encourage the Department and An Bord Glas in particular to examine land that is not productive.  Notice should be taken whether land is being held to accumulate value or whether it is held as an investment.  The land has to produce to the maximum for the people of this country.  If we channel our resources right we can do this.</P>
    <P>Every time I get an opportunity I say that we have got to get away from sending loads of dole money down the country whether it is to Mayo or Donegal and sending the Army down to guard that money every week.  People who are sick and in need of assistance should be helped but to continue to send money every week to good healthy young men is the wrong way to help people to believe in themselves.  I strongly urge An Bord Glas to do a survey of how well we are using our land.  It is basic and important. <Col N="2016" /> If land use is examined and we had a register showing how much land is not in production we would be surprised.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister to examine alternative crops.  Have we reached the stage where we cannot be competitive in any area in Europe.  I mention, in particular, the growing of flax of which I have some basic knowledge.  If the French can grow 66,000 acres and get nearly £9 million of EC subsidy, there is something wrong if we are not growing flax because we have a tradition of growing it.  Irish linen was famous on the world scene.  Years ago when there was little development on the land this country could have produced first-class linen grown from Irish flax.  There are 11 spinning mills in the North of Ireland today producing Irish linen, some of it from Russian flax and none of it from Irish-grown flax.  I ask the Minister to look at the possibility of providing some assistance to re-establish the flax industry on a commercial basis.  We have the tradition, the knowledge and the climate.  There are no fools in the industry in France and if they are growing 66,000 acres, it is about time we had a look at the potential for developing that industry here.  I ask the Minister to examine carefully the possibility of alternative crops and one of those alternative crops is the growing of flax.  This would help to establish a better economy on some of our farms.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, when he is involved in setting up An Bord Glas, to look for people among the 11 members plus one member who are not tied to any category. He should not try to appease the IFA or any section of the community but should look for the best people he can get to develop this most important basic industry. That is where the Minister will succeed. I have no doubt about it.  He will succeed by getting committed people, not intellectuals who are very able, not the Tony O'Reilly's of this world.  If he gets people who have a pair of wellington boots on them rather than having a degree he will have a better chance of succeeding.  I am not suggesting that the Minister does not look for practical and <Col N="2017" /> good business experience; I am suggesting that he looks for the best people he can get without saying that he has to take three from the IFA and four from somewhere else and he has to appease another section of the community.  There must be no strings attached to the people who are selected to manage our most important industry.  I urge the Minister to ensure that a percentage of the board of directors of An Bord Glas have practical experience of horticulture or agriculture. They must be committed to promote the development of land and tillage.</P>
    <P>I attended a seminar in the Spa Hotel two years ago and I took a careful note of the different interests at that conference. Of 17 speakers at the conference 14 spoke about milk and milk quotas, calves and subsidies.  The whole trend of that agricultural conference was about milk, how you measure the fats in milk, how you get prices, etc.  I thought as I came away from the conference that although it was useful and the people at it were serious there was a major gap in so far as those who had no milk quotas were not considered at all.  The formation of An Bord Glas will be a Government decision.  I appeal publicly to the Minister to make very sure that part of the board is comprised of people who have a basic sound knowledge of tillage and horticulture, who will see that the tillage side of farming in Ireland is not neglected, forgotten or written off.  If the structure of An Bord Glas membership is right, that problem will automatically solve itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an onerous task.  Very few Ministers involved in the Government have as big a task as he has.  His decisions are very important at this stage, for the future of the industry.  All I can do is to offer my total support.  There will be a helpful approach from all the people involved in agriculture throughout the country because at the present time we are at the crossroads.  The structures now being put in place are vital for the future of an important industry and I would choose no man other than the Minister and that is not an idle compliment I am paying him.  Having good knowledge of <Col N="2018" /> agriculture and coming from a good agricultural background, he is the right Minister to set up the board, to pilot the development plans An Bord Glas will have to undertake.</P>
    <P>At present, there are a number of inspectors throughout the country who are not very busy unfortunately.  I am not being critical but I am bringing to notice the fact that the Department have a number of inspectors who are under-utilised. I hope that in the restructuring of An Bord Glas all of those people will be involved.  It is discouraging for the staff themselves.  I will say no more about that.  It must be recognised that everybody involved in agriculture, from the Minister down, has to pull their weight if this very important industry is to succeed.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success.  I have great confidence in his ability to implement the new measures.  The structures will give a new approach to agriculture and horticulture. The Minister has the confidence of the people involved in the industry.  Certainly he has my confidence and good wishes with the new Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on this Bill. At the outset I would like to compliment the Minister with responsibility for horticulture, Deputy Kirk, on the progress which has been made since 1987 in the horticultural area and also on bringing forward this important Bill.  His appointment and the establishment in 1987 of Bord Glas on an interim non-statutory basis have led to a considerably increased awareness of the potential of the horticultural industry and the contribution which it can make and, indeed, which it <Col N="2019" /> is already making to job creation and import substitution.</P>
    <P>For years, there has been a growing recognition of the fact that we were importing millions of pounds worth of fruit and vegetables which should, and could be, home produced.  Were it not for the initiative that was taken by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 to deal with this situation, there is little doubt that Irish horticulture would have continued to decline and the advent of the Single Market in 1993 would unequestionably sound the death-knell for the industry.  Thankfully, the situation which obtained when the Minister was appointed has been turned around.  Much development has already taken place in the industry.  The interim Bord Glas have prepared a five year plan for the development of horticulture; a comprehensive examination of all sectors of the industry has been carried out and targets relating to increased output, recovery of domestic market share, job creation and export potential have been set down.</P>
    <P>This Bill now proposes to give effect to the Government's decision to establish An Bord Glas as an independent statutory body which will have responsibility for developing all aspects of the horticultural industry with a view to meeting the targets contained in the plan.  If I were asked to identify what has been the greatest achievement to date of the Minister and of the interim Bord Glas, I would say it is that they have given hope to the horticulture industry and the people involved in it.  This restoration of confidence is essential if Irish horticulture is to respond effectively to the changes and challenges of the 1990s.</P>
    <P>The commodity teams which were established by the interim board to examine the industry and to make recommendations to assist it in the preparation of its five year development programme did a very thorough job.  The targets are ambitious but realistic and I am satisfied that if the plan drawn up by the board is properly implemented over a five year period, it can be achieved.  The plan aims in that five year period to increase our <Col N="2020" /> producer share of the home market for horticultural products from 45 per cent to 60 per cent.  The value of this increased market share would be, we are told, in the region of £31 million.  In addition, the board envisages an increase in the annual value of horticultural exports from £27 million to £43 million.  In employment terms, the net result of these increases will be the creation of 1,800 full-time and 1,500 part-time jobs.  In arriving at these projections the board, we are told, took into account seasonal factors and also the fact that certain imported products cannot be produced in our climate.</P>
    <P>Ineffective marketing was identified as having been a major constraint in the past on the development of the industry and this situation was further compounded by the fact that each sector of the industry had its own unique problems.  Quality, grading, presentation and awareness of consumer requirements were not as good as they should have been in the case of most produce and lack of continuity of supply also created difficulties.  Some of these are areas in which much improvement has already taken place over the last few years.</P>
    <P>A major element of the policy of the Minister and the interim board has been the promotion of organised production and marketing through the development of producer groups.  An increasing number of growers at last realise that they can no longer compete effectively as individuals.  By becoming involved in producer groups and selling produce on a joint basis, individual growers are in a much stronger position to profit from selling in greater quantity and on a continuous basis to major outlets.  The fact that aid is available over a five year period towards the cost of formation and operation of producer groups should be a major incentive to the formation of such groups.</P>
    <P>It should be obvious to everyone who is involved in the industry that by coming together in producer groups owners are in a better position to meet present-day market requirements for produce in greater quantity, of better quality and on a continuous basis.  This would improve <Col N="2021" /> competitiveness against imports and give the grower a better opportunity of improving the return for his produce.  In addition, growers working together in a group can give their produce a brand name under which they can establish their own reputation for quality and reliability. Changing consumer demand and the growth and importance of the supermarket means that horticultural produce must be of the highest quality and available on an ongoing basis.  A producer group is in a much better position than an individual to ensure that quality and presentation are consistent, that supermarkets can get the quality they require and that there is continuity of supply.</P>
    <P>One of the main tasks of the new board will be to achieve a situation where all growers will be members of producer groups.  Another major advantage of belonging to a producer group is, of course, the fact that in the case of certain produce such a group can participate in market intervention arrangements on behalf of its members.  For example, I understand that apples, tomatoes and cauliflowers can be withdrawn from the market at European Community expense for the purpose of stabilising prices.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that at the moment the position is that only approximately 20 per cent of home-produced fruit and vegetables is sold through recognised producer groups when the situation in some other European countries is that almost all the fruit and vegetable production is marketed through such groups.  As long as we continue to have producers growing crops without any plan as to how and where the crop will be marketed, we will have gluts, shortages and an unstable market.  In a situation where there is now free trade in horticultural produce within the European Community and Irish consumers are becoming more aware and more quality conscious, Irish growers must pay increasing attention to quality if they are to achieve greater domestic market share.</P>
    <P>Of all sectors of the horticultural industry the greatest success story in recent years has been in the mushroom sector. The vast bulk of the output is exported. <Col N="2022" /> During the 1980s Irish mushrooms have gained an image and a reputation second to none.  Every aspect of the industry has seen a huge expansion.  In addition to the increased numbers involved at production level, many new jobs have been created in marketing, composting, transport and generally in servicing the industry. A firm foothold has been gained in the lucrative multiple markets in the UK.</P>
    <P>The most remarkable thing about the industry is that practically all the people who became involved in mushroom production during the 1980s started competely from scratch.  The undoubted skills which they now possess were acquired mainly through attendance at courses on mushroom production organised principally by Teagasc.  Many of the people who are now top-class growers did not even know what the inside of a mushroom tunnel looked like when they embarked on these courses and, as I have already mentioned, as the number of growers increased there has been a corresponding expansion of the other activities associated with the industry, namely, in the manufacture of compost, in marketing and generally servicing the industry. County Roscommon is a county which has benefited significantly from the expansion of the mushroom industry.</P>
    <P>Just 12 months ago we had the honour of having the Minister, Deputy Kirk, in Strokestown to officially open a new pack house and distribution centre for Western Mushrooms.  At that time, approximately 20 growers were supplying their produce to Western Mushrooms and the company were exporting between two and three container loads of mushrooms each week to the UK market.  The Minister will be pleased to learn that today 50 growers are supplying the produce of approximately 400 tunnels to Western Mushrooms. Another fridge has been installed and seven full container loads of top grade mushrooms are now leaving Strokestown for the UK each week.  Six full-time jobs exist in the pack house and between three and four drivers are employed on a full-time basis each week.  That is a total of nine to ten jobs, which is significant in that area.  In cash terms, the monthly <Col N="2023" /> value of the produce exported is approximately £250,000 or in excess of £3 million per year.  In job terms in the area the 50 growers represent 50 families and the number of part-time jobs involved is in the region of 350 to 400.  As I said, our county has benefited significantly from the expansion that has taken place in the mushroom industry.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister realised, however, that the mushroom industry is going through a difficult patch at the moment.  A combination of factors has contributed to this situation; the poor sterling exchange rate, falling prices and the traditional post-Christmas slump in the market have combined to put pressure on the industry.  In addition, I understand a couple of the major UK producers have pulled back their prices to the 35p to 40p per pound bracket.  While the quality of their product is not comparable to that of Irish mushrooms, such a sharp reduction in price levels to that of Irish mushrooms, such a sharp reduction in price levels is putting pressure on the market and creating problems for Irish exports.  However, because of the strength of the industry and the competitive advantages of Irish mushrooms, I am confident that these difficulties will be overcome and that the industry will continue to expand in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It is important that An Bord Glas should monitor the development of the mushroom industry carefully over the years ahead and I welcome the fact that the board will have the right of consultation in this and in other areas of the horticultural industry.  Nothing can be left to chance if the present 8 per cent market share which Irish suppliers hold at present in the UK market for mushrooms is to be increased to the 16 per cent market share which is the target set in the development plan and which is well on the way to being achieved at the moment.</P>
    <P>The point has also been made that there is considerable potential for expansion in the hardy nursery stock and amenity horticultural sector.  One of the great advantages we have in this area is the fact <Col N="2024" /> that our climate is so suitable for the growing of trees and shrubs.  Yet, I understand that huge quantities of trees and shrubs are being imported at present.  In view of the massive road building and road improvement schemes which are underway and which will be carried out over the next few years, it is vital for the board to take steps to ensure that trees and shrubs which will be planted along these roadways will be home produced.</P>
    <P>In addition to the road development programme, there is also a considerable amount of open space and park development taking place all the time and as nursery stock cannot be produced overnight the board should endeavour to obtain from local authorities estimates of their projected requirements of nursery stock over the next number of years. This is an area in which local authorities should be officially requested to provide the maximum possible co-operation to An Bord Glas.  It is also encouraging to note that the hardy nursery stock sector is making every effort to gain a foothold in the UK and other export markets where there must be tremendous scope for securing outlets for a wide variety of plants.  Last year I was requested to arrange a meeting with the Minister for certain individuals who were engaged in the production of hardy nursery stock. The Minister and his officials met the individuals concerned.  The problems which they wished to discuss were in relation to the export of plants.</P>
    <P>I must say the meeting which took place was very helpful and constructive and it certainly was very informative as far as I was concerned in that the Minister outlined the position and the developing situation in relation to plant health regulations. He also stressed the desirability of a co-ordinated export strategy which would be achieved through nurseries grouping together so that there would be co-operation in securing outlets and providing them with a full range of plants. Certainly such a strategy appears to make a lot of sense and I am pleased to note that the Minister stated that An Bord Glas, together with Córas Tráchtála and the IDA, are working with the people in <Col N="2025" /> the hardy nursery stock sector to achieve a more co-ordinated and developed approach to export marketing.  If these efforts are successful, then the target of 400 new jobs in this sector and an increase in output of £7 million over the next five years should become a reality.</P>
    <P>The Bill assigns a consultative role to the board in the area of higher education curricula for horticulture.  If the full potential of the industry for job creation is to be achieved the board should have a role in conjunction with Teagasc and also possibly FÁS in the provision of all training courses for horticulture.  There should be access for young people, and in particular young people engaged in agriculture, in the small farming areas to training courses in every sector of the horticultural industry.  As I mentioned earlier, many of our most successful mushroom growers are people who started from scratch and who knew nothing at all about mushroom growing until they attended a Teagasc training course.  I see no reason why it should not be possible to provide similar training courses for every other sector.  Such courses would have an important role to play in the promotion of producer groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt in some detail with the area of organic farming and referred to the special unit which is being set up in the Department to promote the development of organic farming.  I welcome the establishment of this unit because, as the Minister stated, there is a growing demand for horticultural produce and, indeed, for all agricultural produce which is produced without the use of chemicals, pesticides, artificial fertilisers or other synthetic agents.  Because of consumer demand, organic farming is increasing and a certain amount of organic produce is now available in most supermarkets.  Many restaurants also are specialising in organic food.  It would appear a growing number of consumers are prepared to pay substantially higher prices for organic produce.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the board, through the special unit to which the Minister referred, will give positive support <Col N="2026" /> and encouragement to the expansion of organic production.  I welcome this for a number of reasons.  First, the demand for such produce will continue to increase. Secondly, Ireland's international reputation as a producer of high quality, healthy, wholesome food will benefit and will be enhanced.  Thirdly, our tourist industry will have much to gain from the underpinning of our image as a country in which the air, water and food are clean, fresh, wholesome and pure.</P>
    <P>Another factor which should help the fruit and vegetable industry is the increasing emphasis which is being placed on healthy eating.  There are very few people today who are not convinced there is a significant link between diet an health. Every book or magazine or newspaper article which purports to recommend healthy eating habits emphasises the importance of including fresh fruit and vegetables in any diet.  The number of people who claim to be vegetarians also seems to be increasing and it is suggested there is a much lower death rate among vegetarians from cardiac-related illnesses and certain cancers.  Whether or not this is the case may be a matter of some debate, but the important fact is that many people believe it is so and more and more people are becoming more and more diet conscious.  This is an area in which the board should liaise with the Department of Health in order to promote healthier eating habits and to emphasise the vital place which fresh fruit and vegetables have in a balanced diet particularly in view of the fact that the relationship between diet and coronary heart disease is pretty well established.</P>
    <P>I have complimented the Minister and the interim board on what has been achieved to date.  Before concluding I should like to pay tribute to the chief executive of the board, Mr. O'Donnell, for his dedication and commitment and for his hard work on behalf of the board. Because of the expansion which has taken place in mushroom growing in County Roscommon, our county development team, of which I am a member, have over the past couple of years discussed on <Col N="2027" /> many occasions the potential of mushroom production and other sectors of the horticultural industry for job creation in the county.  With this in mind, we invited the chief executive of An Bord Glas to attend one of our meetings to make a presentation on the development of the horticultural industry with particular reference to the sectors which he considered might be of interest to County Roscommon.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Donnell very kindly accepted our invitation and he gave us a wide-ranging and informative briefing.  I must say the team members were most impressed with his comprehensive and indepth understanding of every aspect of horticulture and his own personal commitment to the development of a long-term commercially viable horticultural industry.  I would just like to put that on the record and to thank Mr. O'Donnell once again for having accepted our invitation and for the presentation which he gave.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I welcome the Bill.  The new board will have a major role to play in the development of Irish horticulture over the decade that lies ahead.  Much remains to be done in the areas of production, processing and marketing so that the full potential of the industry for job creation, import substitution and increased exports can be realised.  My sincere hope is that the Minister and the new board will be very successful in achieving their objectives and that they will have the full support and co-operation of everyone involved in the industry.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, for introducing this legislation and to take this opportunity of welcoming him to the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Horticulture is a vast sector that will not reach its full potential quickly despite the best efforts and best intentions of An Bord Glas.  I hope An Bord Glas, working very closely with the IDA, <Col N="2028" /> SFADCo, the Department of Agriculture and, of course, Teagasc, will go a long distance down the road, not alone in solving our problems with regard to the importation of vegetables, fruits and so on, but that they would also provide a very important vehicle for the export side of the business.</P>
    <P>I know that certain vegetables and particularly, fruits, such as citrus fruits, cannot be produced here but I estimate that at least £100 million worth of fruit and vegetables which are currently being imported could be produced here.  That is a very sizeable sum which would make a very significant impact on our entire balance of payments.  It would also help enormously the whole area of unemployment which has been talked about on a number of occasions recently in this House.</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's remarks on the introduction of the Bill that he envisages that the effort by An Bord Glas in the whole area of seed potato production would create over a four or five year period something in the order of 1,800 jobs on a full-time basis and perhaps about 1,600 jobs on a part-time basis. That would be satisfactory, but I hope that perhaps these figures could be exceeded.  Successive Governments and others involved in the whole industry have nothing to be proud of with regard to the level of imports of fruit, vegetables, potatoes and other such products. We are currently importing around 55,000 tonnes of potatoes that we could produce at home, about 57,000 tonnes of tomatoes, about 10,000 tonnes of onions and about 20,000 tonnes of carrots.  In addition, we are importing many other products which we could produce here. Of course, as I said earlier, there are some products which we cannot produce here but nevertheless the potential is enormous.  I am quite certain that there is determination on the part of the Minister and all of us concerned to make this a successful venture.</P>
    <P>We have talked about diversification in the realm of farming and frankly this is one very vital area of diversification. As was said earlier here this morning, <Col N="2029" /> perhaps a lot of emphasis in the past, in the farming context, has been put on the production of milk, beef, cereals, beet and the traditional lines.  We know, unfortunately, that problems have arisen with a lot of these traditional lines of farming and this has had a serious effect on income return to farmers.  For that reason all avenues and alternatives must be explored.  I am satisfied that An Bord Glas, while it has responsibility for only a small portion of the areas of agriculture to which I have referred, will do a great job in filling a big void in the future.</P>
    <P>We must have efficient people to manage and operate this industry.  This whole venture will depend particularly on management skills for its success and the production of results.  No stone must be left unturned in ensuring that persons of the highest degree of skills are engaged at the top level of the industry.  Very competent people should be employed in the operation of An Bord Glas and their related activities.</P>
    <P>Of course there has to be a very close link between the producer and An Bord Glas.  I totally subscribe to the idea of producer groups, co-operative societies or whatever, that it might be appropriate for group production rather than having haphazard, isolated production of commodities of whatever type.  Quality does not need to be mentioned because it is obvious that it is of paramount importance, particularly in the whole area of fruit, vegetables, potatoes and so on.  We must make certain in the future that we have quality products and also something we have lacked very much, continuity of supply.  I believe that, if we address ourselves earnestly to the question of production of top equality products and ensure that there are no gaps in our production cycle, we will reach the sort of goal that is necessary to ensure that any horticultural programme succeeds.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the past, ventures were undertaken in this country, particularly in north County Dublin, where large amounts of fruit and vegetables were produced to supply this city; but, unfortunately, for whatever reasons, after many varied attempts at processing <Col N="2030" /> and marketing that whole system has not succeeded in the way it ought to have done.  A co-operative society was formed which did good work in marketing but, in spite of the fact that this is an area where ideal conditions prevail and which is ideally located for the production of fruit and vegetables, with a market on its doorstep, things did not go as well as they ought to have done.  North County Dublin, together with all the other parts of the country, must &mdash; and I am certain they will &mdash; play their part in ensuring that An Bord Glas is a success in the future.</P>
    <P>We have an ideal climate and ideal soil for the production of many of the crops which have been referred to.  It behoves us to set about establishing the correct management.  I recognise that there are some products which we just cannot produce but I would see this venture, in the first instance, wiping out £100 million of our imports bill.  In addition, as time goes by I believe there should certainly be a very significant export dimension to An Bord Glas and their activities.  In net terms one could be talking about several hundred million pounds.  That would have a magnificent effect both on employment and the balance of payments. These areas are the barometers which measure the success or otherwise of particular projects.</P>
    <P>Going back to the question of quality, I am very strongly of the view that we must carry out correct market research and make sure that we produce precisely what the consumer wants.  As regards the home market, we must produce and present a quality product in a manner that the housewife in Dublin, Limerick, Galway, Cork or wherever, wants.  As regards exports we must do likewise.  We must establish quite clearly the requirement, taste and presentation demanded and required by the housewife in Paris, London or anywhere else.  Unfortunately and I have stated this in the House before &mdash; we have never established quite clearly not alone in the food producing area but in other areas too what exactly the consumer wants.  We have tended to produce a particular commodity or product, be it <Col N="2031" /> in the food area or the non-food area, and then with a great dynamic approach tried to sell it.  It is a compliment to the people selling their products that they have succeded so well without this kind of research into the demands or requirements of their customers.  I believe we could do much better if we addressed ourselves significantly to that area.</P>
    <P>Mushrooms have been referred to. There is no doubt that in the last 12 months, and even longer there has been a very significant advance in the mushroom industry and that is something of which those involved in the production, processing and marketing of mushrooms can be justifably proud.</P>
    <P>Indirect reference was made to the nursery area &mdash; sowing small trees, shrubs and so on.  I believe that in the context of tourism there is vast potential for producing a great number of products to meet the demand for the development of parklands and other areas that are part and parcel of developing our country. Having regard to the suitability of our climate and, our developed skills in the production of nursery stock, hopefully we will develop a significant export market in that area.</P>
    <P>We must be very conscious of the fact that we are dealing with perishable and non-perishable products.  Obviously we are dealing with products that we can produce here as well as products we have to import.  Taking all these factors into account, I am confident that we can in time &mdash; not overnight &mdash; produce something in the order of £200 million or £300 million worth of products, in net terms, by way of replacing current imports and establishing a significant export market in nursery stock and other products.</P>
    <P>I have referred to potatoes already. This is an area where there is vast potential. The whole area of seed potatoes offers tremendous potential and we have the climate, the soil and skills to produce that product.  There are many matters to which I could refer but I am aware that there are a number of other speakers anxious to contribute.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with a few remarks. <Col N="2032" /> First, I would say to the Minister of State, for the benefit of the Government, that this programme must not be underfinanced. The necessary finance must be made available.  In my view and in the view of our party, it would be a good investment in the long term to get this right in the beginning, even at a cost. Otherwise no amount of correction will rectify the matter.  Secondly, it is vital that we have the maximum degree of group activity from the growers so that products are produced on an very organised basis.  Thirdly &mdash; and this has not been referred to while I was in the House this morning &mdash; it is essential that contractual production be entered into.  It is only in this way that An Bord Glas or any similar organisation can operate to the maximum degree of efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak on this Bill for two basic reasons. The first is that the Bill is almost tailor made for a significant number of my constitutents in north County Dublin, in my view a group of horticultural experts who deserve the highest praise for their progressive outlook and attitudes as well as for their willingness at all times to meet the challenges and changes of the horticultural industry, at the equally important levels of technical skill and market response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will remember in the early eighties coming to north County Dublin with the then Leader of our own party, Deputy Haughey, now Taoiseach, and meeting the growers in Lusk and Rush who made the point at the time that one of the most important factors for the industry was the appointment, on the return of a Fianna Fáil Government, of a Minister of State with a specific role in horticulture.  At that time the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Kirk, was appointed spokesperson for the industry and produced a policy document which, in my view, on looking back on it, has stood the test of time.  Times have moved on and progress has been made and is now to be consolidated in this Bill.  This Bill represents for the horticultural industry a giant leap forward, a mechanism for <Col N="2033" /> harnessing the potential of the field and garden produce market both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Let me now advert to my second reason for my already expressed pleasure in speaking on this Bill.  I do so safe in the knowledge that I speak not alone as a Member of this House representing, as I have already said, one of Ireland's foremost horticultural regions but also as a person who has first hand knowledge of this important sector of the wider agricultural industry through my own involvement as a farmer and in the retailing of produce.</P>
    <P>I have first hand experience of trading in the Dublin market in the early hours of the morning.  I have listened first hand to the trials and difficulties and indeed sometimes hardships that is the lot of the people who keep our shops and our tables stocked with the finest produce.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in its stated purpose, is designed to give effect to the Government decision to establish an independent statutory body to develop all aspects of horticulture.  An important aim is to increase output and thus achieve twin aims of recovering domestic market share and providing increased tonnage so that the ongoing demands and, one would hope, ever increasing demand for our produce abroad would be met.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of increased production, one must pay tribute to Teagasc, Eolas and other bodies involved in research.  The excellence of our research in the horticultural domain is reflected in the wider range of glasshouse crops, in the diversity of approach in the matter of horticultural husbandry and in the increased cropping ratios and yields as well as the cost-effective techniques that have come into being as a result of dedicated and clever research.</P>
    <P>New methods and the introduction of new species require up-dated technologies for their implementation.  New technologies are only feasible and practical if they are cost effective.  A heavy cost for horticultural producers is of course the heating of large areas under glass.  Oil, with its fluctuating price and the maintenance demands that are a <Col N="2034" /> dominant feature of oil burning systems, has long been an inhibiting factor in the horticultural development.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased, therefore, to put on record here today the very wise decision of a Fianna Fáil Government to reverse an earlier decision of a previous administration in relation to the location of the national gas pipeline.  It was scheduled to take a route through Ashbourne, County Meath, until Fianna Fáil made a strategic change which rerouted it through the north County Dublin horticultural belt. It has been a long-standing Fianna Fáil policy to give the benefit of this natural resource to a wider community and especially the rural community.  More than 40 growers in the Rush area have taken to replacing oil with natural gas. This area is covered with about 90 acres of glass.  I am assured by these growers that they are well satisfied with their decision.  There are lower costs all round and increased production and cropping options as well as less emphasis on maintenance, like even for instance the constant checking to ensure full tanks and then the ordering of supplies with the worry of on-time deliveries.  It is a combination of major and minor factors which have made these growers of my personal acquaintance so well pleased with their natural gas systems.  This of course is one aspect of the horticultural business to which I would like to see An Bord Glass giving specific attention, that is, the energy question.</P>
    <P>As you may be aware, at the Kinsealy Research Centre on-going research into wind power has been in progress for several years.  I would like to see An Bord Glas expand this activity and, bearing in mind that seaboard areas are generally climatically suitable for horticulture, give some thought to experimenting with wave power.  Kinsealy Research Centre would be a good place to base such research, given its nearness to the Fingal coast and its situation in the horticultural farmlands.</P>
    <P>Again, I would use a concrete example of how good energy systems help both the industry and the economy generally. Early tomato crops mean more people at <Col N="2035" /> work and less imported produce at what used to be the low point in native produce production.  Great opportunities for increased employment exist in the horticultural industry.  With efficient heating systems and well designed glass-houses, coupled with the ever developing techniques for new crops, new croping targets, crop rotation, crop innovation and extended cropping seasons, there is great scope for increased employment. This is possible at the level of primary production and in the following stages of processing and marketing with all the skills that it entails.  It is my view that if we get our growers fully committed to adopting and pursuing the opportunities opening up daily through the research at Teagasc stations like Kinsealy etc. we can harness this great job creation potential at a relatively low cost per job created.</P>
    <P>Irish growers have to be complimented for their ever-ready response to take on the challenge of increased production when they are assured of the backing and support of specialists.  In this regard I must not neglect to point out that very important measure taken by the interim board in setting up the new grant scheme for greenhouses which came into effect from 1 August 1989.  This scheme came about as a result of a recommendation in the five year development plan published by An Bord Glas in November 1988.  The Minister with responsibility for Horticulture, Deputy Séamus Kirk, pointed out at that time that the scheme would apply to both food and non-food crop production.  The Minister was right in providing that, as part of the grant scheme, the applicants should be part and parcel of producer groups and also of the marketing strategy and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his address pointed out that the grant scheme could lead to an increase in tomato production of 6,500 tonnes.  This of course requires a great emphasis and a new positive approach to marketing.  Every grower must be trained to recognise the fact that marketing is not a desk concept; it is not an advertiser's <Col N="2036" /> speciality, nor does it start and end with clever sales techniques.  It starts when the seed is selected.  It starts with a conscious decision to match the selected variety with the current consumer demand. There is no point in having tonnes of cos or other types of lettuce if the retail sector is demanding iceberg.  Attention to detail from the tiny seed stage to the sales point is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas should and are possibly intending to look at extending market awareness among the growers.  Maybe the appointment of a marketing adviser in each region would help.  Maybe a course for growers on the techniques of winning market share and making fast responses to market change would be useful.  At any rate, An Bord Glas, with their capacity for overview, have the potential to meet all these issues and demands.  Closely allied to marketing there are other important issues.</P>
    <P>As a former proprietor of a retail business which traded exclusively in horticultural produce and to a lesser degree in dairy and meat products, I have two letters indelibly printed on my mind and they are QC &mdash; quality control.  Ask any person engaged in the marketing, wholesaling or retailing of food products what has been the most significant attitudinal change in consumer demand and I will be greatly surprised if the reply is other than an ever-increasing interest in the quality of food.  An Bord Glas, with their central role, will be in a unique, new situation, able to moderate and mediate the various services and agencies that together make for good standardised production with quality control in a pivotal place in public consciousness.</P>
    <P>The Members of this House will remember the beef hormone controversy, the ever-bubbling food additives controversy, the salmonella in eggs controvery etc.  All these issues are indicative of the growing public awareness of food quality and its impact on both individual and community health. If one looks to the horticultural sector, specific and equally important and serious public perceptions are in evidence. Because of modern marketing and <Col N="2037" /> merchandising approaches coupled with the fact that the origin of foods being from the sales point means that what is generally called shelf life had to be a major consideration.  Methods of prolonging shelf life are becoming increasingly important to producers as better yields and extended seasons coupled with longer transport times mean greater volumes of perishable produce must be kept in top condition as long as possible.</P>
    <P>Irradiation is one way of tackling this problem.  However, irradiation, despite a great deal of research into its possibly undesirable health aspects, has not been proved conclusively to be either wholly good, as some suggest, or wholly bad.  It is an important technique.  It is not an issue that we can ignore, nor is it a field of research that we should fail to explore.</P>
    <P>Then again, there is the anti-pesticide lobby.  They are having little difficulty in raising public fears on the alleged detrimental effects of some pesticides on health.  There is the green lobby that takes the view that pesticides are environmentally destructive.  Food technologists and environmental ecologists have widely varying views on these issues.  They are not matters that can be left too long at issue as inconclusive findings or variances in publicly-expressed views on the part of experts lead to heightening of public fear. It must be the avowed aim of the horticultural sector to give the consumer public a wholesome and acceptable vision of our fruits and vegetables.  We have to engage in research and we have to engage in public relations so as to keep our consumers on both the home and foreign markets happy with the cleanness and greenness of Irish produce.</P>
    <P>Again, I would refer to section 9 and say that there should be a large slice of the third level curriculum devoted to this matter.  I am well aware of the Minister's concern on these issues and I would ask him to make them a priority issue for the new Bord Glas.</P>
    <P>Turning for a moment to non-food production, I would urge An Bord Glas to take a special interest in hardy nursery stock.  This is an area with great potential. As chairperson of the Fingal Committee <Col N="2038" /> of Dublin County Council, I am aware of the excellent pioneering work of the council's parks department seeking to make themselves self-sufficient in this regard and providing their own basic tree replacement and expansion stock.</P>
    <P>It may not be generally realised the Dublin County Council parks department can source 60 per cent of trees and shrubs for their open spaces, parklands and the linear planting of motorways from Irish stock.  Bearing in mind that it stood at only 30 per cent a few years ago, one has to acknowledge this significant progress.  There is still great potential there.</P>
    <P>With regard to landscaping, particularly that being done on new motorways, it should be encouraged as it reinforces the clean green image for both natives and tourists alike.  Dublin County Council recently outlined to Irish nursery stock growers the problems they have in meeting their requirements.  If you multiply their needs by that of every other local authority and take account of planned future development it is possible to see great potential for hardy nursery stock.  I believe that Ireland with it's ideal climate and soil could become Europe's premier source of hardy nursery stock, Europe's power house of quality trees and shrubs.  From my research on this it appears that while there is plenty of manpower, there may be a lack of skills in the growing of hardy nursery stock. The Minister may consider some sort of course that would help to fill that vacuum and also encourage our present growers to take on board the market that is there and not take the soft option of importing from Holland and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>By it's very nature, An Bord Glas implies close links between the various agencies such as an Bord Glas itself, Teagasc, Córas Tráchtála and the IDA. I would ask the Minister to ensure that these links be established at the earliest moment so that co-operation of the most productive kind quickly becomes a tradition and central feature of the horticultural process.  As I am addressing the Minister I would also like to convey <Col N="2039" /> a desire expressed to me by my horticultural constituents in Dublin North that beaucratic procedures should be cut to the minimum.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill assigns a consultative role to the board in the formulation of State investment policy and higher education curricula for horticulture.  I have long held the view that at all levels of education we should afford significant interest bodies the opportunity and guaranteed right to involve themselves in formulating the curriculum content and shape of courses related to their specialism.  Education must be a leading force in developing the industry.  It must be responsive to the expressed needs of the producers and have an eye at least a decade ahead of their competitors.</P>
    <P>It has been said that academics are the best people to plan course content whatever the discipline.  It has been said that in education and training the corresponding agencies abhor co-operation. May I give the lie to that and say that at the level of the community great things can be accomplished.  May I go further and briefly outline that in our own town of Malahide we have a course which has been running for six years.  At a time when all the agencies were separated it brought together a community council, AFT as it was then, AnCO as it was, and Dublin County Council in a training course for young people in horticulture. The local community saw that within its own town there was the Kinsealy Centre and, the expertise was there and by bringing in one or two other agencies we were able to put this course together.  Many of the young students from the course now have flourishing businesses in horticulture.</P>
    <P>I would like to make another point on how schemes such as that can respond. Recently the nursery stock and garden landscapers made a comment about the lack of any garden design content in all the courses that are available at the moment.  We have responded quickly to that and have added it to the course and the young people now will have that as part of their curriculum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2040" /> There are several speakers who wish to contribute so I will just refer briefly to the mushroom sector.  It should be emphasised there can be achievements in the industry which is now foremost in the country in its expertise, marketing and job creation.  While there may be some difficulties in the industry due to outside circumstances such as sterling and other issues, it is fantastic that we have such a successful mushroom industry at the moment.</P>
    <P>This Bill shows the Government's intent to intensify and difersify horticultural production to the benefit and advantage of the horticultural growers, their employees and the rural community in general.  It is another clear signal that no stone will be left unturned to ensure that the economy continues to grow and that imports of produce continue to decline.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas is an instrument to marshall all the forces that separately provide important services to the industry but which collectively have the potential to change the face of horticulture in a beneficial way.  Advisory services, educational providers, marketing strategists, biological researchers, and all the other elements can be integrated under the aegis of the board.  Forward planning in all the important areas concerned will be the hallmark of the future.  We must be market leaders in an international framework, not net importers in a domestic squabble.  The current role of Ireland with it's term of EC Presidency is indicative of the changing face of Europe. The changes in eastern Europe may, and possibly will, have a very real impact on our role as a producer nation of highest quality foods.  We can meet the challenge if we plan, educate, research and strive or we can be overrun by others if we fail to realise the potential that is inherent in the strategy that underpins the Bill.</P>
    <P>The industry which the Minister represents has a major role to play in the future economic welfare of this country. I congratulate the Minister on bringing forth this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator <Col N="2041" /> Wright for a very comprehensive explanation of the Bill and an equally comprehensive tour of his own constituency in the process.  I am sorry I do not have either the same problems, involvement or indeed knowledge of this particular subject as have many of the other Senators.  I have no expertise in this particular area but I have an instinctive suspicion of any Bill which receives such unanimous all-party support in this House as this particular Bill has obtained. I have an instinctive suspicion also of any Bill which increases State interference in any industry in this State.</P>
      <P>Those who are in favour of the Bill have said very articulately, and in some cases very convincingly, that the reason for this Bill is that the horticultural industry needs organisation and advisers, but I suggest that behind the great approval for this Bill is the smell of money for nothing.  There is power in this Bill to vote money to give what are now euphemistically called grants-in-aid to various industries.  The Minister in his introductory speech said:</P>
      <P>The board and the Government have also recognised the special difficulties facing the glasshouse sector.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, special aid for this sector was introduced last year in the form of a new capital grant scheme of 25 per cent and an increase from 15 per cent to 35 per cent for grants under the farm improvement programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why these sort of grants should be given to the glasshouse industry or to any particular industry by the Government.  I am an unapologetic believer in private enterprise. It it inconsistent of the Government at a time when privatisation is becoming more fashionable and is being looked at with a less prejudiced eye by many Governments, including this one, to introduce a Bill of this sort which is obviously going to enable the Government to give grants at will to the horticultural industry; grants-in-aid or what they call support or capital grant schemes do not put a great deal of intense pressure on those who receive them.  They seem <Col N="2042" /> to be once-off payments which do not put pressure on those who receive them to produce dividends.  It would appear to be against the trend of present thinking, especially in terms of the thinking of Irish Life and other State industries now, to introduce a Bill which, as I understand it, gives unlimited powers to the Government to pump money into this industry willy-nilly.</P>
    <P>I am casting no aspersions on the Government, and people should not be too sensitive about this, in saying that the temptation, when these sort of powers are given to Ministers of all parties, to distribute grants of this sort to these industries in specific constituencies, is too great in certain cases to be resisted.  It is wrong in principle that powers should be given to Ministers to allow grants to industries which are politically sensitive at election time.  It would be far more sensible if the horticultural industry was left to fight its own battles, and certainly financially to fight its own battles.  I cannot understand, and I never have been able to understand, why the Government should be giving money to industries that cannot get it elsewhere, why the Government should be giving money to particular projects when the banks have refused it.  This is really the kernel of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are many good things in the Minister's speech.  There are a lot of good things in the Bill about getting producers together, about encouraging industry in certain areas.  That is absolutely fine although I cannot understand why the producers have not done it themselves if it is a good idea.  I cannot understand why the industry should get grants from the Government if the banks will not give money to them.  The reason the banks will not give it to them is quite simple; it is because the banks regard it as too risky, or the banks do not regard it as getting a proper return.  It is time the Government stopped regarding themselves as a charity for ailing industries.</P>
    <P>It is no good the Minister, or other Ministers supporting the same principle, coming before us and saying: &ldquo;This is going to create X number of jobs&rdquo; and <Col N="2043" /> giving us figures about the number of jobs which have already been produced.  The jobs in themselves are absolutely no use unless the industry in which those jobs are created is set up on a very sound footing.  Private enterprise will do that better than the Government because we have too many cases of semi-State bodies or ailing industries being supported by the Government and collapsing afterwards. We have had many embarrassing cases of that happening and the Government having to pump more and more and more money into those industries where a bad commercial decision but a good political decision has been made in the first place.</P>
    <P>That is why I am suspicious of this Bill. That is why I think this Bill has been so uncritically accepted by the Opposition because the Bill is short-term good news. It is about creating jobs and it is about giving money away and it is very difficult for any political party to oppose that or even to criticise that, especially if it means the speaker's own constituency will benefit.  It is one of the advantages of being an Independent Member of the Seanad in that if one does not have ambitions for the Dáil one does not have to suffer from these pressures and one does not have the sort of constituency pressures of other Members of this House, and I say that in the full understanding of the pressures under which other Members of this House suffer.  It might have been helpful if, when we are getting Bills of this sort which envisage giving money to industries, those particular industries, before they are given money and before the Minister votes the money, as he can do under this Bill, are forced to provide projections which are scrutinised, not by themselves but by independent auditors and by independent consultants.  In that way at least the money which is being granted will stand the scrutiny of commercial pressures and will remove the suspicion of political pressures.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister when replying to consider the possibility that when money is granted under this Bill, and he <Col N="2044" /> has unlimited powers under this Bill to grant money, that it be subject to commercial scrutiny at all times from people who are not beholden to the board or to the Government.  If that were the case, and it should apply to the borrowings of the company also, perhaps there would be a case for giving money to the company when it required it.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to the powers the Minister has in the Bill to give directions to the board.  It is a general point but it seems to me that the boards of these bodies leave a lot to be desired, not only in their appointments &mdash; which I will come to &mdash; but in their powers themselves. Section 26 of the Bill empowers the Minister to give directions to the board concerning its activities and general policies.  This may be a general provision, and I think I have seen it in several other Bills, but it gives the Minister full powers to tell the board to do exactly what he wants at any time.  What we are to have here is not a semi-State body with independent powers but a body which is completely appointed by the Minister and a body which then, having been appointed by the Minister, has to accept all possible instructions from him. What greater temptation could there be for political exploitation of a semi-State body?</P>
    <P>It would have been far more sensible and far less open to any such accusations if the board were appointed for a period of time, which it is, but a member of the board can be dismissed by the Minister at any time.  Therefore, it is at the pleasure of the Minister.  In other words, everything the board do is subject to Government approval and direction and the semblance of independence is actually a false and deceptive one.  This is a general provision which applies to nearly all semi-State bodies at the moment.  It is something which the Government should look at.  I know Ministers are loath to limit their powers in any way at any stage but if these bodies are to carry some credibility of independence it would be far better for them and for the bodies involved if they were given this independence without such restrictive checks <Col N="2045" /> because in reality they have absolutely no independence at all.  They can do what they like as long as the Minister does not stop them.  If the Minister wants to stop them, he can stop them.  If he wants them to do something else, they have to do that.</P>
    <P>Finally, I find the composition of An Bord Glas very difficult to understand and the reasons why it is appointed in this way.  Five members of the board are to be appointed on the basis of their knowledge of or expertise in horticulture.  That seems quite a reasonable criterion to use for those who are being appointed to a horticulture board.  Apparently, the other five will not be appointed on that basis and I do not understand why.  The remaining five will be appointed by the Minister following consultation with the horticultural industries he considers appropriate.  That is rather flowery verbiage to mean that the Minister can appoint whoever the hell he liked to the board in both cases.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, is undoubtedly an expert gardener.  The Minister, according to section 3 of the Bill, can consult with the Taoiseach &mdash; God forbid it &mdash; on the appointment of a board like this because the Taoiseach is a good gardener; between them they might come up with five board members because the Taoiseach is a good gardener.  That is exactly what is in the Bill.  I do not believe that the first five will necessarily be appointed on horticultural merit but the bottom five can be appointed without any horticultural merit at all.  All the Minister has to do is consult with somebody who knows something about horticulture.  I would like to inform the Minister that I am also a very good gardener.  The Minister might, when he is making these appointments, not just ask the Taoiseach, but he might come and talk to me as well.  After those consultations I am sure we will come up with five very interesting members of the board.</P>
    <P>I am making a serious point here.  It is that the appointment of members of the boards of these bodies should be taken out of the political arena.  We have seen far too many appointments of a political <Col N="2046" /> nature to semi-State bodies recently being made.  I am not going to name anybody but there has been a trend in recent times to make outrageous and nakedly political appointments to boards of this sort.  They are not made on merit; they are made for political favours which have been done at elections and that cannot possibly be justified.  Some of these appointments are disguised by the veneer of a vague knowledge of the particular subjects.  The primary loyalty of those appointed is to the Government party that is in power.  This does not apply solely to Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil are great practitioners of political patronage on semi-State bodies and recently have been showing dangerous signs of going beserk in that area.  But it applies equally to the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party Coalition when in power.</P>
    <P>For some reason the board members of these particular bodies are regarded as fair game in terms of political patronage. It is time that that stopped.  It is time the Minister gave up the powers conferred on him in nearly every Bill of this sort to appoint his cronies to boards of semi-State and State bodies and instead have them referred to an independent body which would make the appointments on a non-party basis.  I can understand the temptation to do this.  I can understand the reasons it is done.  The answer always offered is that the other side does it so why should we not do likewise.  That is simply not good enough.  I will be watching the appointments made to this particular board by the Minister, especially the bottom five.  It seems that the distinction is outrageous.  The distinction is quite simple &mdash; five have got to know something about the subject they have been appointed on and the other five do not have to know anything about it.</P>
    <P>I would like to know why the distinction is made by the Minister.  It would be better if this clause in the Bill had been left out and that it was stated quite clearly that the Minister can appoint the ten people of his choice.</P>
    <P>To put in this slight veil of respectability about the first five and to say the other five can be political hacks is giving the <Col N="2047" /> game away.  Otherwise, I believe the intention of the Bill is a very worthy one. I hope it will not become a source of Government spending for political reasons and that it will benefit the horticultural industry.</P>

      <P>As usual, Senator Ross was at his flippant best.  He likes to come in on Bills like this and make a short, snappy, punchy little contribution looking for the usual headlines, making outrageous statements and then leaving the Chamber.  Before he leaves I would like to reply very briefly to him before I get down to the few comments I have to make on the Bill itself.  Obviously, any board the Minister sets up will consist of knowledgeable people who will have the important work of the board in hand &mdash; in this case to develop all aspects of the horticultural industry &mdash; and as long as they are doing that they will have a free hand and the Minister will not in any way examine their position.  Obviously, if it is seen they are not doing that then the Minister surely has the right to intervene and bring them in for discussion.  Senator Ross suggested that the unfortunate grower in Connemara, Mayo or West-meath should not get a grant for an industry that is creating jobs, but I presume he would regard it as OK that people who are many miles from the shores of Ireland can set up industries and get grants to create jobs.  This is a fact of life.  In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the progress report by the Central Review Committee makes the following point on horticulture:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 350 full-time jobs and 300 part-time jobs are estimated to have been created in horticulture in 1988. <Col N="2048" /> The bulk of these were in the mushroom industry.  It is estimated that 400 full-time and 300 part-time jobs were created in horticulture in 1989.</P>
    <P>That is success.  It must be a source of pride to the Minister with responsibility for Horticulture, Deputy Seamus Kirk.  I would like to congratulate the Minister warmly for his great interest and work in this vital area of the overall agriculture scene and wish him well in continuance of this successful work in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>May I go now, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I am glad the Senator waited.  The aim of the Bill is to set up a new statutory board with responsibility to develop all aspects of the horticultural industry.  The horticulture industry has been like a rudderless ship. It is moving slowly onwards not knowing exactly where it is going.</P>
      <P>The industry needs revitalising and development.  The Government recognised this some years back when they appointed a Minister for Horticulture, Deputy Séamus Kirk.  His interest in his work is clearly revealed in this document I referred to earlier.  Special emphasis on this important sector in the years ahead will prove very successful and will be of huge benefit to the economy.  The revitalisation of the industry should, with proper planning and proper approach, reduce imports, increase exports and, as it is an intensive employer of labour, it should create many jobs.  The proof of that is in what I said earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite certain that the way forward is as outlined in the Bill.  The formation of the board will lead to increased profits for the people in the industry and will contribute to all aspects of improving the full potential of this industry.  We are an agricultural country.  I must confess, as an urban dweller, that I find it alarming that many farmers with farms of 100 acres or more will not till even one half acre of their land.  I am not suggesting that we have compulsory tillage but farmers <Col N="2049" /> should be encouraged to sow more vegetables and fruit if only for their own families' use.  Hopefully, this will happen as a result of the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We have the spectacle at the moment of farmers' wives trotting around the supermarkets possibly buying imported vegetables.  When you examine the problem you have to say that it is a scandal that we, an agricultural country, should import vegetables to the value of £1,000 million, most of which we ought to be able to produce at home.  Exports of horticulture amount to less than 25 per cent of the total value of imports whereas, in the overall agriculture and food sector, exports amount to more than two and a half times the value of imports.  There is a great imbalance which is doing very little for the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect of the work of the board will be liaison with the other State bodies, particularly Teagasc.  There is a specific reference to this in section 8 of the Bill.  A strong link is necessary between the board and Teagasc as well as with other areas of importance such as the IDA, An Córas Tráchtála and the Department.  In regard to the educational aspect of the industry &mdash; perhaps the Minister will make a note of it and I am sure the board will be made aware of it in time &mdash; the adult education programme of the many VECs throughout the country should be urged to take on appropriate education of people who have an interest in becoming growers. This would be of benefit to the industry in the years ahead.  This is something that might be examined.  As a member of a VEC I know that some of the adult education programmes &mdash; such as golf and badminton training &mdash; have been of very little relevance to the work of these committees, but here is a classic example where a VEC adult education programme would be very appropriate.</P>
    <P>While I have referred to Teagasc, education and the other bodies, there is another important group who should be contacted on a regular basis, that is the consumers and the consumers association. There is need to educate the consumer. If you look at the present position <Col N="2050" /> you will find that the housewife will go into her local supermarket and buy carrots at 30p per pound or £4.20 per stone and the local greengrocer or the local stall will sell the same carrots at £1 per stone. The same supermarket will buy mushrooms from the grower for 70p per pound and sell them for £1.60 per pound while the greengrocer will sell them at £1 per pound or less.</P>
    <P>The grower will wait 45 days for his money from the supermarket &mdash; I believe the supermarkets are now looking for an extension of that credit period to something like 70 days &mdash; while the greengrocer pays before he leaves the shop.  A stone of potatoes is at least twice the price in the supermarket compared to the price charged by the local traditional greengrocer.  Another ploy in the supermarkets is that for one week of the 52 they will mark up two or three vegetables which will be sold off for half price or less, but for the other 51 weeks exorbitant prices apply.  The moral of that story is that there should be education for the consumer so that they will buy their fruit and vegetables from the greengrocer and get good value.  In regard to the fruit and vegetable industry the supermarkets are ripping off the consumers.  We must all be concerned about this.</P>
    <P>The grower is also losing out.  Six years ago you paid £11.50 for a four stone bag of Scotch records while today the price is £4.75.  A stone of carrots today costs £1.25 while ten years ago it cost £2.50.  I am talking about the very best carrots. The moral of this story is that the growers seem to be working harder to sell more but get less profit.  All these areas have to be addressed, and hopefully, the board will examine them.</P>
    <P>Last July and August we travelled the length and breadth of Ireland seeking votes in the Seanad election campaign. A very notable feature of the trip for me was the number of new mushroom units all over the country&mdash; I reckon there must be 1,000 mushroom units at present.  In 1988, 350 full-time jobs and 300 part-time jobs were created in horticulture and the bulk were in the mushroom industry.  I am not surprised by this because the smallest <Col N="2051" /> unit will give employment to perhaps five or six people, and one or two of them may be permanent and the rest temporary. The mushroom growers have got their act together.  They had a good promotion during 1989 when they sent out good leaflets of menus and the uses for mushrooms.  The knowledge that 80 per cent of their produce is exported must be seen as a very successful aspect of the whole horticulture industry.  They have displaced the Dutch on quality and general presentation in Britain.</P>
    <P>While this is a success story and hopefully that will continue, there are problems. One of these problems is Sterling versus the Punt and the other is transport which is slow and expensive.  This is an area where I hope the board will help mushroom growers in the future and that it will also help them with the larger European market as it expands.  This is an important aspect of the industry.  Last year we had £100 million worth of mushrooms exported which by any standards is excellent.</P>
    <P>I remember many years ago my late father and others renting a plot of land to grow vegetables.  It still operates.  If you go down along the canal in Dublin you will see rented plots of land where people sow their vegetables.  A local authority which owned maybe two acres of land would divide it into little parcels of maybe 20 yards by 20 yards or something like that and rent them to a group of 8, 10 or 12 people who would grow lettuce, carrots and onions for their families. I would like to think that many people today would do likewise if the land were available.  There are many patches of land owned by local authorities or semi-State bodies where this could be done successfully.</P>
    <P>All dieticians strongly recommend fruit and vegetables in people's diet.  The diet and health aspects are very important selling points in the promotion or marketing of these products.  Many people for various reasons have chosen vegetarian diets, and this is a growing development in recent years.  Some teenagers will not eat meat.  The fruit and <Col N="2052" /> vegetable growers should be pleased about that.  We can be very proud of this Bill.  I again congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this legislation which will be very important for the national economy and the creation of jobs, and for the future of the horticultural industry in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House.  I think there will be general agreement that our achievements in horticulture over the years, could have been much greater.  There are, of course, exceptions.  The mushroom industry, in particular, is a resounding success.  Apart from mushrooms, there has not been much evidence of success in the horticultural industry.</P>
      <P>Efforts have been made over the years by various Ministers to try to improve the position.  In 1986, Fianna Fáil, then in Opposition, published a blueprint for the co-ordinated and effective direction of our horticulture.  That document was a most creditable endeavour to improve the industry.  It had as an essential idea, the setting up of a body, An Bord Glas, to take the development work in hand.</P>
      <P>The framework for An Bord Glas as set out in the Bill is very satisfactory.  I am glad to see that there is provision for close liaison between An Bord Glas and the various other bodies, in particular Teagasc, closely concerned with horticulture. There will indeed have to be very close co-operation between all the bodies involved, as producers are entitled to expect a full range of help from the State in regard to research, advice investment, marketing and so on.  In turn, of course, where the State makes a maximum effort to improve a sector, it is reasonable to expect the producers, as the beneficiaries, to row in with the State effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need more than anything else better co-operation between producers with regard to horticulture.  We already have it in regard to mushrooms, but the lack of producer co-operation is more evident in horticulture than in any other sector.  The potato sector is an obvious <Col N="2053" /> scene for co-operation by producers because at the moment it is a shambles. To the best of my knowledge, potato producers make little attempt to develop co-ordinated marketing of their products, except in some cases for early potatoes.</P>
    <P>This is very evident at the start of the season when we see a lot of television advertising.  It is tragic that Ireland, with its long tradition in the production of excellent potatoes should have to depend from time to time on very large imports of potatoes.  Potato producers should know very well by now that if Irish potatoes are not up to standard, there is a ready supply available from other producing countries. If An Bord Glas succeed in organising the potato industry, they will be doing very good work.</P>
    <P>There are many improvements possible in potato production, covering sowing, attention to the growing crop and harvesting.  I would like to see An Bord Glas, Teagasc, the Irish Farmers Association and other interested groups getting together to increase awareness among potato producers of what needs to be done in order to make their crop more profitable to them, and to the country.  I take the opportunity, therefore, to commend an Bord Glas for producing a first-class video on potato production.  Copies are being made available to the potato people, who now have very useful information aid at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food have not been remiss in relation to the potato sector.  Following representations they made to the EC Commission, a regulation has been enacted which enables community aid to be given to potato producer groups in Ireland. This is a very positive step towards organising the commodity.  Under the regulation, valuable financial aid is available towards the cost of setting up and running a producer group.  This regulation affords a great opportunity to address more forcibly the question of marketing, one of the great problems of the Irish potato trade.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bord Glas Bill before us today is mainly to reduce imports, increase exports and as a result, <Col N="2054" /> increase much needed jobs in horticulture. We may not all agree on the best methods for performing this task but there is agreement on the need to develop the horticultural industry.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous potential in this Bill.  We need only look at the way European consumers are moving in relation to their perception of food, especially with the pending EC Directives.  I have no doubt that An Bord Glas will be able to take full advantage of all the expertise available to assist them make horticulture more efficient.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the interim board and the Minister of State, on the document, &ldquo;A Programme for the Development of Horticulture&rdquo;.  This excellent document came about as a result of a very detailed examination of the industry by the interim board.  The main task of the new board will be to implement the many recommendations already made.  I welcome the statement of the Minister that the new board will have broadly the same responsibilities as the interim board, that is, the development of all aspects of horticulture.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State is very committed to his task, I wish him every success, I hope that when we discuss horticulture in a few years, we will see this Bill as a great success story.  The Minister and the board have a lot of work to do. I have no doubt that they are both committed and the greater the success of this board, the better for our balance of payments by the elimination of many imports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to welcome the Bill and to congratulate the Minister of State for bringing this excellent measure before us.  It will do a lot of good for the horticultural industry, an industry that was probably neglected for many years, as a number of speakers have outlined already.  Our vegetable production is a long way behind that of other developed countries that go in for extensive horticultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have as good a climate and potential to develop our horticultural industry as these other countries.  Many farmers <Col N="2055" />&mdash; Senator Fallon touched on this earlier &mdash; could be encouraged to grow more vegetables.  Our mushroom industry has taken off.  It is a typical example of the progress that can be made when there is a commitment to a certain product.</P>
    <P>Teagasc by voluntary redundancies have cut back a lot on staff.  In County Monaghan we have been very badly hit by voluntary redundancies.  We had 13 advisers four years ago, now we have four.  I ask the Minister to look favourably at that situation.</P>
    <P>In connection with the mushroom industry, there is a 25 per cent grant for the building of these houses but there is no grant for the installation of a new cooling system.  This is a very good system and it has increased production greatly over the last few years since it was introduced. It is of very great importance to the mushroom growers, especially in the summer months when houses are normally closed owing to the very hot weather.  The new cooling system has a great advantage for those growers as they can produce their product during the summer.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House because all I wanted to say has already been said by a number of speakers.  There have been some fine contributions.  Once again I would like to congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill before us. He has done a wonderful job.  I thank him very much and wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should take the opportunity of thanking Senators for the very constructive and worthwhile contributions they made during the debate on the Bill. While there has not been absolute unanimity on it, there has been a general acceptance that the Bill is very worthwhile and that it is addressing an area of underdevelopment in the sphere of agriculture that needed to be addressed for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underlying sentiments which were expressed clearly indicate that the measures which we are proposing under <Col N="2056" /> the Bill and the role which we envisage for the new board will develop the horticultural industry.  It is fair to say that what has been said coincides very closely with my views on the matter.</P>
    <P>I have a little longer than half an hour perhaps to wind up and Senators will understand that if I cannot go into any great detail on some of the points I will endeavour to touch on as many as possible of the relevant points which have been raised in the course of the debate. We will have time &mdash; hopefully, next week &mdash; when we move on to the Committee and remaining Stages, to go into more detail on them.  I am not taking them in any particular order but a number of points were raised today.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freagra a thabhairt ar an gceist a chuir an Seanadóir Mullooly orm mar gheall ar an dteideal, An Bord Glas.  He raised the question of the origin of the title of the new board.  The name Bord Glas stems from our desire that the new organisation should have an Irish name.  We decided that the name, whatever it would be, would have to meet a number of requirements, namely, that it echo the concept of vegetables as denoted by the Irish word glasraí, that it evoke the notion of green in colour, that it be brief and easily pronounced. Senators will agree that the word &ldquo;glas&rdquo; meets all these requirements pre-eminently and, if I may say so, even felicitously.</P>
    <P>It is of course important to appreciate that &ldquo;glas&rdquo; is not meant to be the dictionary word but is naturally inspired by it &mdash; in other words, it is not meant to be taken literally.  However, I am sure Senators will agree that the word now has clear connotations of the whole sphere of horticulture and is already well established in the public mind as such.</P>
    <P>Senator Shane Ross in his contribution a short time ago dealt with aspects of the Bill from perhaps a slightly different perspective from that of the other Members of the House.  His interpretation of the Bill is not right.  The Bill has no power in regard to grant giving. Section 5 clearly underlines that.</P>
    <P>Two points need to be made.  Bord <Col N="2057" /> Glas is a development board for the horticultural industry.  The development trust above all else will be about encouraging better markets.  Grants are a separate matter.  Bord Glas is not in the grant business.  Agriculture in general gets grants from the Government under the various national and EC schemes. Bord Glas is not in the business of giving money away.  Irish horticulture has up to now suffered from the lack of a well structured development programme. The development plans and projections set out in the development programme at the end of 1988 illustrate that the board will have a clearly defined role and clearly defined aims and objectives to pursue.</P>
    <P>Grants from Government have to be matched with very serious investment by private people involved.  At all times grants must be given with the normal parliamentary control of Government expenditure.  Grants must be included in the Estimates for, as in this case, the Department of Agriculture and Food and, of course, in due course, have to be approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Raftery's contribution, he poses the question: could Teagasc not do the work that is proposed for Bord Glas?  If we turn back the pages we will discover that under ACOT and AFT &mdash; ACOT, of course, in its advisory role &mdash; despite its best efforts, unfortunately the industry did not realise its full potential.  It was from that situation that the whole concept and idea for Bord Glas has its origins.  It is clear that there was and is a need for the provision of a catalyst to effect change within the industry. We certainly envisage Bord Glas being a catalyst for the horticultural industry.</P>
    <P>Senator John Dardis raised the point of the relationship between Teagasc and Bord Glas.  In section 4 of the Bill, which I am sure we will have an opportunity to debate in more detail on Committee Stage, the phraseology used is &ldquo;to develop, to promote, to facilitate, encourage, co-ordinate and assist the production and marketing and consumption of horticultural produce.&rdquo;  The <Col N="2058" /> terminology used clearly reflects the thrust of what we are about in this legislation. Section 8 confers a crucial additional function on the board.  It provides for the involvement of the board in the formulation and approval of the annual horticultural programme of activities of Teagasc.  The Government decided on this approach rather than go for the complete separation of the horticultural activities from the board of Teagasc.  We will have an annual consultative role in the programme for Teagasc. I would like to say at this stage, having had the interim board in operation since March 1987, that the working relationship which has existed between the interim Bord Glas and the board of Teagasc has been very satisfactory.  I look forward to an even closer relationship in the immediate years ahead.</P>
    <P>As I said briefly earlier, the main task of An Bord Glas will be to promote better marketing.  In all the comments that we have, inside this House and outside it, we invariably come back to the deficiency which exists in the marketing end of the industry.  There is a deficiency regarding the presentation of our produce.  We must realise that we are dealing with an ever more discerning consumer.  If the product is not presented in the right way, if the quality of the product is not right, it is so easy for them to tell the supermarket personnel or the retail outlet, &ldquo;we need the Dutch or the imported product in a particular line&rdquo;.  That has been the difficulty for us.  That is the reason we have had in many respects the level of imports. There are other considerations also.  It is over-simplification to say that the problem is in marketing, even though marketing is the primary problem.  There may be economic considerations in regard to production.</P>
    <P>The major activity for the Bord Glas staff will be the promotion of the producer group concept.  There has been the producer group concept in the fruit and vegetable sector for some years and while we would like to see a much greater percentage of producers directly involved with producer groups, nonetheless there <Col N="2059" /> is a growing awareness of their importance. I realise there are growers who have very satisfactory arrangements with wholesalers in Dublin or in other places around the country.  There are very satisfactory arrangements between wholesaler and producer as to supply of produce.  We are quite prepared to recognise the importance of that arrangement but in general terms I must say that more producers will have to involve themselves with producer groups.  Various grant schemes have been introduced and one of the conditions for payment of grant aid is that the applicants will become members of producers groups.  That is very desirable indeed.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that in recent times we have succeeded in getting the producer group regulation extended to the potato sector.  As I am sure many Members of the House will know, we have offered to the IFA to part finance the appointment of a marketing co-ordinator and recruitment of the individual for that job is at a very advanced stage.  We are looking forward to the announcement of his appointment in the not too distant future. If we can combine the appointment of the marketing co-ordinator with the availability of quite generous grant-aid under the producer group regulation for potatoes, we can begin to effect quickly the changes that are so sorely needed for the potato industry.</P>
    <P>In the day-to-day workings there will be a very close working relationship with Teagasc, for instance, in the organisation of seminars and conferences for producers. We will be doing that and have been doing it jointly with Teagasc.  We will be endeavouring to build up a more cohesive working relationship between the multiplies, the supermarket outlets and the retail outlets.  If we can succeed in eliminating the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; mentality which tends to pervade the sector in certain instances, it will be a very worthwhile job.  The supermarkets and the multiples must realise that the producers have a vital role to play and, <i>vice versa</i>, the producers must realise the importance of the multiples and the multiple outlets, <Col N="2060" /> that they are the people, as it were, at the coal face where the consumers decide whether product A or product B will be purchased on any day of the week.  As I said earlier, over the past two and a half years the working relationship with Teagasc and Bord Glas has been very satisfactory and we are looking forward to that relationship continuing.</P>
    <P>Complaints about monopolies in the fruit and vegetable sector have been mentioned and two points need to be made in this regard.  First, An Bord Glas is a development board; it is not being given functions in regard to dealing with complaints of this kind.  There is another Government body in existence, the Fair Trade Commission, and it is to that body that complaints about this problem should be directed.  That body is under the direct control of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Anybody who has any misgivings in this regard should not feel reluctant to lodge a complaint and to have it processed by the Fair Trade Commission.  It would be very unsatisfactory that an individual or organisation should feel badly done by because one or two groupings are in a dominant position in the industry.  The legislative provision is there to cater for that under the Fair Trade Commission.  I am bearing in mind that this is something that has been raised at recent meetings I have had with the IFA.  I said to them and I repeat it in the House, that provision is there to deal with complaints under the Fair Trade Commission and if there is an individual or collective problem I am saying to them to refer it directly to the Fair Trade Commission to have it considered by them.</P>
    <P>During the debate on Second Stage, and indeed on Committee Stage, in the Dáil there was some focus on the legislative provision we are making for the collection of a levy perhaps at a later date.  There is nothing new, or innovative about it.  There is a levy in place for such State boards as CBF and it has been working quite satisfactorily.  At this point we have not decided when the levy will be introduced.  It is a question that when the legislation is going through the <Col N="2061" /> Houses of the Oireachtas it is necessary and desirable that we would make provision for it.  At least one Senator, perhaps two Senators asked whether the levy would be charged on imported produce. The direct answer to that is, yes, it will be imposed on imported produce.  I simply cannot say at this stage when or what way the levy will be charged but when we have the statutory Bord Glas in place we will be listening very closely to their advice in the matter, and it is reasonable to assume we would be guided by that advice.  The levy when brought into operation should be charged on all produce marketed in the country, both home produced and imported.  Not to charge a levy in this way would be discriminatory against the home producer and it would be reasonable to anticipate that we would have considerable difficulties with it if we were to confine the levy to home produce.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the appointment of the board members, I have always felt about the appointment of persons to State boards that it is absolutely desirable that we have persons of quality on such boards.  We need persons, whether they are representing the primary production end or the retail, wholesale or multiple end, who know what they are about on a daily basis, who have a proven track record in that sphere and who can at board level articulate the needs of the sector they represent.  I am not suggesting they should see their role merely as representing that sector.  They must take a much broader view of the needs of the industry.  For far too long we have operated on the premise in this country that a person is appointed to a board simply to represent the interests of the people he is there to represent.</P>
    <P>We must face the reality in these competitive days that there must be an integrated approach to the development of any industry.  There is an interdependence within industries that unfortunately has not been fully appreciated but I think appreciation of that fact is growing.  For that reason, it is absolutely desirable to get the right people for board management, people who are successful in their spheres, who can articulate at <Col N="2062" /> board meetings the needs of the total industry, who have a genuine and deep-rooted concern for the development and progress of the sector they represent.</P>
    <P>I have had representations from various organisations.  We are quite prepared to invite and have invited some to submit names for consideration for appointment to the board.  We will be doing that.  It is not a matter of approaching it with a closed mind.  So far as the board is concerned, we want to get the chemistry right to ensure success in what is at the end of the day a difficult industry to get off the ground.  There are particular problems. We are in a very competitive situation. The Dutch can export produce to this country and make life very difficult for our primary producers.  It is important that the programme and the chemistry are right to ensure that over the period of the programme we attain the targets and the objectives which we have set outselves.</P>
    <P>When the Oireachtas sets up a body like An Bord Glas and provides that it may be funded out of public moneys, it is wrong that a Minister should have to accept names for board members put to him by organisations merely as representatives of that organisation rather than as individuals who can represent, as I said earlier, the total need of the industry. The Minister who makes the appointments naturally will be accountable and answerable for those who have been appointed to the board and who at the end of the day will be responsible for spending taxpayers' money.  If the board are being funded in part by levies collected from sections of an industry, then I can see a good argument why a proportion of board members should come from the industry.  These members should be found on the basis of an election but the people paying the levy have not the right to vote in the matter of their appointment.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan mentioned flax growing.  While it certainly does not fall within the scope of this Bill, I have taken note of what Senator McGowan has said and we will be conveying it to the relevant section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2063" /> I have referred briefly to the development of the organic unit in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  As Senators are aware, it has been decided to establish an organic unit within the ambit of the Department of Agriculture and Food to look at this sector.  There is no doubt that market demand for organically produced food is growing.  I am not suggesting to the House for one moment that we see a huge slice of the market requirement for food in this country being sourced in the organic area.  I do not think that will be the case.  It is fair to say that if the marketplace vibes show we need organically produced food in greater volume, we should endeavour to supply it.  I fully realise that without the premium which apparently it can command at the present time, the economics of this production could well be doubtful. The realities are that if people are prepared to rearrange their domestic finance, their domestic budget, in such a way as to spend more money on food because they are more satisfied about its origin, so be it, and if the market niche for it is growing we should endeavour to cater for it.  The indications are that across Europe and at an increasing rate here as well, people wish to have organically produced food.  Having said all that, I fully realise that the conventional method of production will be for a long time the principal source of our food needs.</P>
    <P>I am glad to tell the House that I have long held the view, as representing a Border constituency that, as a very small country of five million people, within the agricultural industry we should do all we can to promote better and closer working relationships North and South. On a recent visit to look at some of the research facilities which they have in the North, I had the opportunity of meeting the Parliamentary Under Secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Peter Bottomly. We had an exchange of views.  Subsequently we invited him on a visit here to discuss areas of mutual and common interest.  He gladly accepted that invitation. We had him in on Friday of last week and as a result of that meeting we <Col N="2064" /> have agreed to establish a working group comprised of members from our own Department, including the research end, and their counterparts in the North to focus on such areas as seed potatoes and perhaps mushrooms.</P>
    <P>I would see them principally considering the possibilities of closer cooperation in research, particularly in regard to seed potatoes.  We have spent a volume of resources on varietal development.  It is a very long term job. The conventional way of developing new varieties takes years.  Perhaps the biotechnological method which is to a degree in an embryonic state, would provide a shortening of the period for varietal development.  If there are possibilities for a joint venture or greater utilisation of resources on the island as a whole, we should explore them.  Our seed potato industry has declined seriously in recent years, the volume of exports has declined.  The same applies in the North. Their seed potato industry has declined quite seriously in recent years.  There is a common interest to do the things and effect the changes needed to put the seed potato industry on to a more developmental footing.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a tribute to the work which has been done by the interim Bord Glas since it was set up some two and a half years ago.  I referred earlier to the development plan for horticulture brought forward by the interim board That plan will be a very important guideline for the new Bord Glas.  Putting together that plan was a major job.  It involved not only the interim board but also seven different commodity teams, each team made up of experts in each product or a small group of products.  In all some 80 experts were involved.  As well as the very important work of producing the plan, the interim Bord Glas involved themselves in a large number of activities mainly directed at improving marketing.  The products involved included potatoes, tomatoes, onions, soft fruit and mushrooms for the domestic market.  This work will also serve as a guideline for the new board.  The interim board did not have large numbers of staff. It had to depend for the most part on staff <Col N="2065" /> made available from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  As soon as they are established, the new board will quickly begin to recruit their own staff and I would expect them to be in full operation in a fairly short time.</P>
    <P>It is not, of course, for me to tell the new board how many staff it should employ.  I would say to them, first, to make sure that the staff taken on are of sufficient experience, calibre and quality to do the by no means easy job which lies ahead.  They will also, I would expect, have due regard to cost and take as their guideline that quality rather than numbers is the important thing.</P>
    <P>To meet the situation in which Irish horticulture found itself in the years after accession to the European Community and since then, special action on the lines I am now proposing is needed.  We must put an end to the very unsatisfactory situation where we are on the one hand importing products which could well be produced at home and, on the other, not making full use of our export possibilities. The new Bord Glas have an important task before them.  They will serve as a single motivating force acting on everybody connected with the horticulture industry, not forgetting as I said before the important role of the home producer.</P>
    <P>I thank sincerely all the Members for their worthwhile and valuable contributions to the Bill.  The contributions were of a very high standard indeed, and reflect the depth of knowledge which exists with the various spokespeople in this House on the needs of the agricultural/horticultural industry.  We are looking forward, hopefully next week, to dealing with the Committee and remaining Stages of the Bill where we will have an opportunity to get down to the more specific aspects of some of the provisions contained in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to repeal the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, and thereby abolish stallion licensing.  Under the 1934 Act, entire stallions aged two years and upwards must be licensed.  However, thoroughbred stallions which are used exclusively for thoroughbred breeding, or which are either kept in training for racing or used for racing, are exempt from licensing.</P>
      <P>The Act which I am proposing should be repealed because it is over 50 years on the Statute Book.  The reasons for this measure are very straightforward.  The position of the horse has changed dramatically since 1934.  The licensing inspection was confined to a clinical examination and had little real impact on breeding improvement.  Once licensed, stallions were not reinspected.  The number of stallions licensed declined from 1,000 in 1970 to 500 by 1984.  On the advice of its breeding sub-committee, Bord na gCapall recommended that licensing be abolished.  The board stressed that the examination for registration of stallions &mdash; which of course is voluntary &mdash; is more thorough, and more effective from the point of view of breed improvement.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that licensing has not been operated since 1984.  It has been argued that circumstances have changed since then, principally because of the dissolution of Bord na gCapall. However, the fact is that there has been no demand whatsoever from any section of the industry.</P>

      <P>There has been no demand whatsoever from any section of the industry to return to licensing and there is no evidence to suggest that the quality of horse breeding here has suffered over the last six years as a result of the cessation of licensing.  Since the last time Senator Avril Doyle and I discussed this matter and debated it in the other House, we have introduced a programme for the development of the non-thoroughbred horse industry which I am hopeful &mdash; and I am very encouraged by the response to it &mdash; will change the face of the industry and revitalise an industry which was unhappily let go into decline for a number of years.  In that positive programme for the development of the non-thoroughbred horse industry the Irish draught horse has been reinstated as a particularly important breed, especially in the nineties and going into the next millenunium when recreation and sport are such important activities.  The Irish draught has been identified for special treatment. A quite attractive programme of grant aid and support is available now for the development of not alone the Irish draught but the entire non-thoroughbred industry.</P>
      <P>I am glad that an advisory board has been appointed, a quite prestigious board of people who know the industry and are nominated from the different sectors of the industry.  That board are in place and have held a number of meetings so far to advise the Minister and the Department on the best steps to develop quite an important industry which, as I have said, was unhappily let go into decline for a long number of years.  That positive programme of development is by far the most important thing to happen to the Irish horse industry for a long number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly pleased that the Minister for Finance accepted the submission from Agriculture in relation to the racing industry in general which should be of benefit to the non-sport horse or the <Col N="2068" /> thoroughbred industry.  Provision was made for £3.5 million per annum for a minimum period of three years, to be reviewed thereafter, for the horse racing and greyhound racing industry.  This will be of tremendous importance, particularly to the national hunt sector of the thoroughbred horse industry, because there is no doubt that in recent years Irish racing had gone into decline.  The number of race tracks in serious financial trouble around the country was increasing and the number of prestigious races won by horses trained outside of Ireland was becoming greater.  We found it more difficult to win races in Ireland with our own trained horses and that was quite a serious matter.  The level of prize money for the national hunt industry, of which the Irish people are particularly fond, was a very serious matter and I am delighted that the Minister for Finance made a substantial allocation in the budget in that 1.5 per cent of the off-course betting levy is to be earmarked specifically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, a number of measures have been introduced since <Col N="2069" /> we debated this matter &mdash; one for the non-thoroughbred horse industry and one for the racing industry, which will be of considerable benefit to the Irish horse industry generally.  This is a technical matter abolishing the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, which was no longer used. There was no role for it and, as I have said, no demand whatsoever for it from any section of the industry, but there was a demand for a developmental programme for both sections of the horse industry.</P>
      <P>The decline in the number of stallions, the change over time in the use of the horse, the development of more modern breeding methods and the fact that the licensing inspection itself had little intrinsic merit, all lead to the conclusion that it was time to abolish the licensing of stallions.  Both the thoroughbred and the non-thoroughbred sectors of the horse industry accept that stallion licensing will not be required in the future and they agree that it should be terminated.</P>
      <P>It was suggested on Committee Stage in the Dáil that the question of licensing should be referred to the Non-Thoroughbred Horse Advisory Committee for consideration. This is neither practical nor necessary.  For the reason I have outlined, the continuation of stallion licensing is a non-issue and this Bill is merely a technicality to deal with the reality, namely, that licensing has not been operated since 1984.  There are no compelling reasons to continue with it and therefore it is only right and proper that the 1934 Act be repealed.  I therefore commend this Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, arrived in here this afternoon with two pages of a script.  That is the extent of the Department's interest in the Seanad debate on the Bill before us &mdash; the Horse Breeding Bill, 1985 &mdash; two single A4 pages, not back and front but just page one, page two.  The Minister valiantly tried to pad that a little bit and to expand it by discussing areas that are not relevant to the Horse Breeding Bill but indeed pertain to the thoroughbred industry generally.  I do not disagree with <Col N="2070" /> what he said on that but it is not the issue before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I also referred to the non-thoroughbred programme and the development of that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, all two pages of it.  I refuse to accept that that is the extent of this Government's interest in the matter and I hope to be proved right.  I hope the Government have an interest in what we now refer to as the sport horse industry which covers every angle of the horse industry other than the thoroughbred racing industry, as it were.  I just wish to distinguish it quite clearly.</P>
      <P>The Horse Breeding Bill before us this afternoon is a two-line Bill to repeal the Horse Breeding Act of 1934.  The main provision of the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, deals with the licensing of stallions not involved in covering thoroughbred mares for racing but for the sport horse industry as we now refer to it.  It is just that section of stallions that is dealt with under the licensing of stallions in this.  I tried on the Order of Business yesterday and again today to ask the Leader of the House to urge the Minister not to proceed with the passage of this Bill through the Seanad until the Horse Advisory Committee, to which the Minister, Deputy Walsh, referred a few moments ago have had the opportunity to consider this legislation. To say it is not practicable or necessary &mdash; if I quote him correctly &mdash; that the Horse Advisory Committee should consider this Bill is a gross insult to the wise men and women that the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, appointed last autumn to advise him on the sport horse industry.  The Government stand indicated in relation to their handling of this most important flagship industry.  I consider it to be essential that the Horse Advisory Committee should have had a chance to consider the legislation that is now before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech &mdash; not in his script as far as I can find &mdash; that there was no pressure from any section of the industry to consider licensing.  That is actually untrue; it is factually incorrect. <Col N="2071" /> Would it surprise the Minister to know that there will be a proposal before the next Horse Advisory Committee meeting in early March from the Equestrian Federation of Ireland, the parent body regulating the sport horse industry in Ireland, to consider the introduction of licensing for all stallions with a special section to register those that are particularly approved for the sport horse industry. I do not know what will happen that proposal when it is put before the Horse Advisory Committee.  It may be thrown out; it may be accepted; it may be amended.  I will not stand in judgment or even give my view as to what I think should happen or what I would like to happen.  I will just state as a fact that this proposal from the EFI will be placed before the Horse Advisory Committee meeting in March.  Here we are today abolishing the last piece of legislation on our Statute Book that governs the non-thoroughbred or sport horse industry. We had the Bord na gCapall Dissolution Bill only last year, which abolished the Horse Industry Act, 1970.  We are now repealing the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, and we will have no legislation governing this most important industry on our Statute Book if this Bill goes through the Seanad in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was no pressure from any section of the industry.  I am telling him that the EFI intend to place this proposal before the next Horse Advisory Committee meeting.  That is why I implored on the Order of Business today and yesterday that this legislation be left until after the Horse Advisory Committee had a chance to deliberate. Anything more reasonable than that, I cannot think of.  The Minister could bring the legislation straight back into this House and we could deal with it after that date.  The Minister, and all of us, would be armed with the views of the very expert committee that the Minister set up to advise him, if they had been given the courtesy of time to deliberate on it.  I will go further and say that I think a conscious decision was made not to bring this to the notice of the members <Col N="2072" /> of the Horse Advisory Committee, and I have reason for saying that.  I still appeal &mdash; and it is not too late because we have until 4 o'clock today to discuss the Second Stage; it is not being concluded today &mdash; and I urge the Minister and the Leader in the Seanad, who is one of his colleagues, not to recorder the rest of Second Stage until after the Horse Advisory Committee have made their decision in relation to this issue.  I feel I am being absolutely reasonable in that request.</P>
    <P>When Bord na gCapall was abolished I spoke at length on the industry at that stage.  I spoke at length on this Bill as a Member of the other House, but times have changed.  The reason this Bill was published in 1985 was at the request of Bord na gCapall and the IFA horse committee. I will not go through what was in their minds at the time.  Let us leave that aside now and go forward.  The Minister came in today and justified the pursuit of this Bill because Bord na gCapall, a body that his Government subsequently abolished, had so requested it.  I would prefer him to come in and say to me that the Horse Advisory Committee, upon deliberation of how to handle this particularly difficult issue of licensing and/or registering of stallions in the future, had so decided, and then we could proceed.  To refer back to Bord na gCapall who have since been dissolved and to say that this Bill is before us because they wanted it is ridiculous.  I would suggest that the real reason we are proceeding with this Bill today is not because of any concern about repealing the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, not because the Government are terribly worried about what Bord na gCapall, the IFA horse committee or any other section of the industry wanted; it is because this Government have no business for Seanad Éireann to deal with.  Since this was something that was hanging around and had been through the Dáil they decided it was not a major issue and we would not bring the country to a standstill on the Horse Breeding Bill.  This has been pursued without any reference to the expert committee that was set up in the autumn by the Minister because we have nothing else to deal with in this House. <Col N="2073" /> It is appalling that a flagship industry like the hald-bred or the sport horse industry should be treated in this way.</P>
    <P>I think we could pause for one minute by way of tribute to one of the greats of the sport horse industry since we became a Republic, the late Lieutenant Colonel Dan Corry, who was buried only a couple of weeks ago.  The man would be revolving in his grave if he knew what we are at today.  He was on the first team to represent Ireland abroad as an international showjumper in the late twenties. The Irish flag, the Tricolour, was flown abroad for the first time ever over the heads of Irish non-thoroughbreds, or sport horses, as we call them today, and the late Dan Corry was one of the greats on that team.  We should do our best to structure this industry and to have legislation in place on this great flagship industry of ours that can take its place among the other countries in Europe as we go into a Europe free of trade barriers generally.</P>
    <P>I will get down to a few specifics, having registered my disgust that we are discussing this matter at all today.  The Minister said that the procedure for licensing was a cursory clinical examination as laid down in the 1934 Act, but I dispute that.  Perhaps in practice that is what happened.  There were roving inspectors, great old men from the Department of Agriculture, I doubt if there was a woman among them.  It would not have considered right for women in those days, since 1934, to be inspecting stallions to make sure they had the necessary credentials to do the job for which they were being purchased.  It was all males from the Department of Agriculture who inspected them.  They were great characters who were known far and wide at marts, fairs and sales around the country.  Everybody knew them by their Christian names.  They would attend the RDS every year.  They were men who knew their horses and knew what they were looking for.  With the greatest of respect to the Department of Agriculture, I do not think there are many in that Department today who could wear their shoes.  I hope the Minister can prove <Col N="2074" /> me wrong in the years ahead in relation to that &mdash; I am willing to be proved wrong but I fear I will not be so proved.  Men sitting behind desks in the Department of Agriculture, reared other than on farms, who have never handled horses, find it very hard to know; you cannot pick up a piece of paper with conformation and various other aspects listed and go out and see does that fit the bill, does it fit the terms of reference of my job, let us look at this stallion and see is it on.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that under the 1934 Act it was only a cursory clinical examination but what was entitled to be done as a result of that examination?  First, the Minister of the day could refuse to grant a licence under this Act in respect of any stallion which appeared to him (a) to be affected by any contagious or infectious disease.  You do not need to be a vet to decide that.  On a clinical examination you can fairly quickly ascertain whether the horse is in good physiological health or not; (b) to be affected by any other disease or defect such as parrot mouth &mdash; the Minister will recall the Bord na gCapall stallions of not so long ago &mdash; or a defect prescribed as a disease or defect rendering a stallion unsuitable for breeding purposes, again a physical defect. Any trained eye could ascertain that if they knew what they were looking for; (c) to be inadequately prolific.  I am not terribly sure, in the case of a young horse who has yet to cover mares, how it will be decided by looking at them clinically whether they are going to be prolific or not.  I would have thought that it was in hindsight one could decide whether they were prolific but maybe there is some way that can be done, although I cannot imagine what it is; (d) the Minister could refuse to grant a licence under the Act in respect of any stallion which appeared to him likely, by reason of its defective conformation or physique &mdash; the Bord na gCapall stallions immediately come to mind again &mdash; or otherwise, to beget unsuitable progeny.</P>
    <P>I honestly think that a clinical examination which could decide all of those issues &mdash; free of disease, correct conformation, free of defects or likely to <Col N="2075" /> beget unsuitable progeny etc. &mdash; is more than a cursory examination.  If that was done properly by inspectors it would be no cursory examination; it would be a thorough clinical examination.  I suggest that it is a thorough clinical examination that is supposed to be in place at the moment in relation to the registration of stallions for inclusion on the approved list.  There is little difference in what is happening today for the approved list and what was supposed to happen under the 1934 Act for licensing the stallions.</P>
    <P>Under section 23 of the 1934 Act the Minister had authority to order castration of certain stallions found unsuitable.  I have not investigated or checked figures as to how many animals were castrated by order of the Minister since 1934 but I can assure the House that Holland and Germany and the Community countries that have positive breeding programmes for the sport horse have this requirement. There is a very strick cull on the colt foals at the yearling colt stage and again at the three year old stage for those that do not meet the strict requirements of the clinical examination.</P>
    <P>In Germany there are 56,000 breeding mares and there is a very strict breeding policy in relation to what sires are approved to cover those mares.  God help us in this country &mdash; I think we are talking about 5,000 breeding mares.  In 1970, when Bord na gCapall was set up under the Horse Industry Act, there were 12,000 breeding mares in this country but by the time Bord na gCapall was abolished the number was down to under 5,000.  I would suggest to the Minister &mdash; and I have a feeling he will agree with me but whether he will agree on the record is a different matter &mdash; that the future of our sport horse industry depends on our ability to keep a sufficiently large pool of the right type of mare.  If we have not the right type of mare we are wasting our time here today, or any time in the future, discussing the credentials of the stallions we need to cover those mares.  If the mares are not on the ground, this conversation is superfluous.</P>
    <P>Not only have the Horse Advisory <Col N="2076" /> Committee not been allowed to consider this legislation but they were not aware that it was being discussed in the Seanad today.  Apart from this legislation and the ill-timing of its passage, the major consideration of all of us interested in the sport horse industry at present should be the EC directive which concerns itself with three particular regulations which will concern all equidae &mdash; thoroughbred and sport horses, donkeys and asses &mdash; in the future within the EC.</P>
    <P>I would have thought our time would have been spent far more productively here this afternoon if the Minister could have produced legislation to us that would safely see this most important industry into the decades ahead, that would see us compete fairly and equally with our Community partners in relation to the sport horse industry generally. Where is the legislation the Minister promised in the Dáil last May?  Is that not what we should be discussing instead of removing from our Statute Books the only legislation that governs this industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister is impatient. He does not like what I am saying.  I have yet to get to the programme, for which I applaud him, but we cannot forgive the Minister the rest of his sins because of the programme in itself.  He cannot keep producing and announcing this programme, either to the industry or in the Dáil or Seanad every time he comes under criticism or fire.  How long more will the Minister hide behind the programme that was announced 18 months ago?  The programme was good as far as it went.  Having watched the industry for many years I have reservations about the marketing proposals under the programme but I will give them the benefit of the doubt and see how the matter evolves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly approve of the £400 premium for Irish draught foals that land on the ground from this year forward but it <Col N="2077" /> does not go far enough.  Producing purebred draught mares will not on is own protect the sport horse industry.  We need a pool of draught mares.  That pool had got perilously low, and I applaud the part of the programme that deals with that matter, but we should go further.  Part of that programme was the introduction of headage payments in disadvantaged areas for half-bred mares, if I recall correctly &mdash; I am speaking from memory at this stage.  With the doubling of the Structural Funds and the cry in the farming community for the extension of disadvantaged areas, under the less-favoured areas directive, I would now ask the Minister to extend that headage payment to the entire Twenty-six Counties regardless of classification.  As the Minister is aware, most of the counties where the half-bred breeding is taking place at the moment are outside the disadvantaged areas classification that would entitle the farmers to headage premiums for their mares.  The premiums are fairly generous &mdash; I think it is £66 for the first eight mares and for the next 22 mares the figure is somewhat less; it escapes my mind at the moment.  If the Minister tells me the number of farmers in this country who have 30 or more draught mares standing, I will applaud.  I hope there are some but we are talking about very few.  I support the principle of the programme but I appeal to the Minister to extend it to the entire Twenty-six Counties.  Major portions of Wexford, my own county, the heart of the sport horse industry, of Kilkenny and Waterford are not classified and the farmers there are not entitled to headage payments.</P>

      <P>The Minister devised the programme and I applaud him but he cannot use that as a screen for the non-activity in the industry generally.  Nor, with respect, can he use it as a screen for his insult of the Horse Advisory Committee which the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, announced last autumn, by <Col N="2078" /> not allowing them to consider this legislation. Not only should they have considered this legislation but we should have left consideration of suitable legislation for the industry until they also considered the EC directive I mentioned a few moments ago.  This directive involves three regulations which will govern inter-Community trade in equidae post-1992. These three draft regulations are (1) on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and import from third countries of live equidae; (2) the zootechnical and genealogical conditions governing intra-Community trade in equidae; and (3) intra-Community trade in equidae intended for participation in competitions.  I know this directive has been mentioned at the only two meetings that have taken place of the horse advisory committee since it has been constituted. This directive in relation to the trade in equidae generally is perhaps the most important issue around at the moment in relation to our horse industry. There are aspects of it that we need to consider in detail, as well as considering whether there is a future to licensing stallions or not.</P>
      <P>There is a divided view within the interest groups in the horse world generally in Ireland on the licensing of stallions. I would ask the Minister to accept that.  What we are doing today does not have unanimous support &mdash; I cannot even say it has majority support and neither can the Minister.  There is a divided view also on the final regulations that are up for consideration, I understand, at the May Council of Ministers meeting in relation to the horse industry.  That is what we should be turning our time and attention now to be sure we do what is correct for Ireland in the sport horse industry in relation to any final council decision on Community Directive 89/503, which is the one we are talking about.</P>
      <P>One part of the directive that concerns me greatly is in relation to the broad set of criteria which will concern registration generally in the non-thoroughbred industry. These criteria have yet to come from the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to be cautious.  Can <Col N="2079" /> the Minister guarantee this side of the House that no decision will be made at the Council of Agriculture Ministers on the equidae regulations until we have details of the broad set of criteria that have yet to come from the EC in relation to registration?  This is in relation to the second proposal of the directive which lays down basic rules intended to remove disparities in member states due to differences in policy as regard breeding and rearing of horses.  The proposal covers horses, their semen, ova and embryos in the Single Market.  It aims to prevent unfair practices and liberalise trade in horses generally.</P>
    <P>Essentially the second proposal is an enabling measure which would provide the Commission, we are told, with the advice of the standing committee on zoo techniques to prescribe general rules for stud-book entries, for the approval of off farm mating &mdash; I presume they mean breeding &mdash; the performance monitoring of registered breeding horses and the use of their semen, ova and embryos.  The second proposal also envisages common procedures for the naming of equidae and for a model, origin and identification certificate.  It seeks to ensure the Community standards will also apply to imports from third countries.</P>
    <P>There is an awful lot involved in that. I will not go into the details, because I believe the Minister appreciates what is involved in it.  I would ask the Minister to give a commitment to this House that no final decision will be taken on the directive until we know exactly what the board set of criteria in relation to registration of hourse that we await from the community will be.  Do not ask the Council of Ministers to vote in the blind, do not ask the horse industry in Ireland to accept good faith if we do not know what is involved in this broad set of criteria that may or may not suit us or the industry. For example, when we know these criteria, will the Department of Agriculture be able to continue to allow Weatherbys to register sport horse stallions? We do not know that.  It has been <Col N="2080" /> suggested that all stud-books and registration be kept by the Department, in the relevant community country.  At the moment Weatherbys are very involved in registration here and have done an excellent job for a long time.  Will that be allowed to continue under the proposed regulation?  It would appear to be in question. We would need clarification on that specific point.</P>
    <P>The whole directive needs a thorough evaluation.  Like many EC Directives one would need a Ph.D. to comprehend its language.  I can understand the difficulty of certain sectors in the horse industry interpreting exactly what is being proposed and interpreting even what decisions are being asked of the Council of Minister in relation to it.</P>
    <P>The first proposal provides for the approximation of the animal health protection rules to be applied in the member states.  We are, or will be post-1992, the only island nation member of the Community 12.  By then the UK will have the Channel Tunnel so there will be a land bridge between them and Continental Europe.  Do we have any claim to special treatment in relation to animal health protection, in relation to the protection of the health of our horse industry generally? There are two arguments which I am sure the Minister is aware of, those who believe we should be making a stance on this and those who believe we should be treated similarly to the other 11 member states and get on with it.  This is what we should be discussing.  With respect, Minister, we should be hearing from him what the thinking of the Government is in relation to the protection of the health of our horse industry, both thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred, taking into consideration the proposals from Europe.</P>
    <P>The removing of any existing disparities in relation to protection rules of animal health within the Community at the moment will help to foster intra-Community trade in horses while meeting certain animal health requirements designed to avoid the spread of diseases.  It will also provide the Community arrangements in respect of imports from third countries <Col N="2081" /> and specify the general animal health criteria applicable to third countries from which exports of horses of the Community are authorised.  The purpose is plain enough to see.  It is to safeguard human and animal health within the Community.</P>
    <P>Spain and Portugal have African horse sickness at the moment.  Where do the regulations proposed leave us if we wanted to object to the importing of horses from Spain or Portugal?  We have not heard from the Minister, and yet it is proposed to make a decision on this next May at the Council of Ministers.  I understand that the riding instructions &mdash; if I may use the pun &mdash; at the December meeting of the Council of Ministers was to dispose of this particular directive and get agreement.  It did not happen.  I imagine there will be extra pressure at the May Council of Ministers to dispose of this regulation and get agreement.  But the industry cannot discuss it if we do not know what the Government advisers are thinking, what line it is being proposed that the Government take on it.</P>
    <P>Just a few more thoughts on the problems that will arise in relation to the questions about African horse sickness, for example, and how we will be able to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to imports into this country.  The same will apply to the United Kingdom. I know they are putting up the same arguments in relation to it.  What will happen in relation to the other diseases that we have been free from but which are prevalent in other parts of the Community? The proposals would not permit us to require pre-export testing for equine viral arthritis, equine infectious anaemia or would not allow insisting on country freedom for six months or pre-export testing for dourine and glanders, none of which are present here or, indeed, in the UK.  I would like to know the Minister's view on that.  That would be a far more constructive use of our time than what we are at here today.</P>
    <P>The proposal in relation to registration &mdash; the second proposal to which I referred &mdash; requires stud-book arrangements in this country which have not traditionally been compulsory.  In recent times since <Col N="2082" /> the demise of Bord na gCapall, the Irish Horse Register has been taken over by the Department of Agriculture.  I commend them for getting their act together on it. There were teething problems.  They ran out of paper at one stage and could not issue passports.  That has all been overcome. A reasonably good job is being done and given a little more time an excellent job could be done.  It is not excellent yet but it is getting together quickly and I commend the officials responsible.  I have raised two or three issues with them.  I have yet to get answers to a couple of them but that is perhaps through a lack of persistence on my part.  I have not spoken to them since last spring in relation to some queries.  It will all come out in the wash at some stage.  I accept we will get our act together.  I hope their register now talks to the computer in the SJAI.  I still cannot understand why the Showjumping Association of Ireland had one type of computer at one stage and the Department of Agriculture had another type and they could not talk to one another.  I have faith that the Department will be able to run an efficient register but where does that leave us in relation to a non-Government register such as Weatherby's?  The industry awaits the Minister's thinking on that.  It will not be allowed under the regulations that are being proposed in the Community.</P>
    <P>There are horse organisations that are concerned that they should be allowed to retain control of their own stud book arrangements and that particular interests of certain sectors should be safeguarded. There are certain bodies in the horse industry that oppose the use of artificial insemination.  They are concerned that they should not be compelled to sanction its use or to accept horses' bred by this means if they do not want to.  What is the Government's view in relation to that?  Has the Horse Advisory Committee had time to go into detail on these most important issues?  The Connemara Pony Breeders' Society always operated their own stud book.  I was delighted to read in recent weeks that at their last AGM they made a big <Col N="2083" /> effort to become more democratic, if that is the right interpretation of what happened. They are getting their requirements in terms of covering certs and identification more in line with the common practices used in stud books generally.  Is it a fact that the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society's stud book will become part of the Irish Horse Register which is now operated by the Department of Agriculture?  Do they know that? Do they agree with that?  Has it been discussed?  What will be the future? Under the regulation at the moment they have to.  I am not sure whether we will be proposing any amendments.  I have never heard the Minister talk about it and I would like to hear his views in relation to the directive.</P>
    <P>The third proposal of this directive covers rules governing competition.  I wonder if any other sports governing body have had a Community directive issued in relation to how they carry on their competitions in the Community post-1992.  Will the soccer bodies be all whipped into line in relation to a Community directive?  What about the women who cannot become full members of golf clubs?  Can we expect a directive from the Community in relation to how golf competitions will be carried out in the future?  It is rather strange that the competition end of the horse industry should now be regulated under the Common Agricultural Policy.  There may be an area in terms of sporting directives where we could have looked at the competition end of the horse industry.  Where in CAP terms or under what treaty is there a directive telling us that competitions in regard to the horse industry are now being regulated by the CAP?  This is an interesting issue and I do not know where it came from.</P>
    <P>It will not trouble us unnecessarily in this country because our competitions and events are fairly open at the moment. We do not proscribe any nationalities or origins of horses.  We do hold national competitions and national classes for home-bred horses and I understand that <Col N="2084" /> will still be allowed to continue.  The Italians, for example, have a technical trade barrier to the importation of show-jumpers that are not of Italian origin in that they do not allow them to compete at novice level in showjumping and only allow them to compete at the equivalent of grade A or open level on a basis where they receive less prize money than the native-bred horses.  They segregate their open competitions &mdash; one for the native-bred horses and one for the imported horses.  I presume all that will be swept aside.  I know the Italians do not like that and they are objecting.  The French and Germans also have objections to this directive.</P>
    <P>This whole directive COM-89503 which has these three regulations that will be governing trade in equidae post-1992 raises issues of political importance. It raises issues of considerable implication for animal health and stud book arrangements generally.  A distinction now exists between horses bred for farm work and horses bred for competition. Forty years ago this did not exist &mdash; most of them were bred for farm work and used for fun at the weekends.  Now there is quite a distinction in the motivation of breeding horses today.  It is mainly for sport and a little for farm work on the side.  Once that distinction is there it is very strange to find the rules of a sporting body being treated as the sole target of a Common Agricultural Policy regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, we have a watch-dog committee on EC legislation and directives.  If you put a motion before that committee I will see that the working party and myself will be there to consider the directive you have in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Minister.  I take that as a very helpful suggestion.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC which is the Committee the Minister refers to and I have taken the liberty of asking that committee to consider this directive.  This could be helpful and would be a very good opportunity for the <Col N="2085" /> Minister and his officials to come and tease out these issues.  I also took the liberty of investigating how the equivalent committee in the House of Commons view it because in horse competition generally there is a lot of similarities between how they operate in the UK and how we operate in this country.  For the record, there was not a great opinion of the regulation in the House of Commons.  The Joint Committee would be a very useful forum in which to tease it out.</P>
      <P>May I suggest, as this matter is coming before the Council of Ministers in May, if it is within the Minister's power that he would ensure the matter is thoroughly dealt with by this committee well in advance of any deadline for decision on the particular regulation.  That would be most helpful.  Also, we should ensure that the Horse Advisory Committee has the benefit of any expertise they need to fully understand the implications of this directive. I am not sure in what depth the Horse Advisory Committee have had a chance to investigate it, but surely they would be the main body together, with our joint committee on secondary legislation, to advise you as Acting Chairman of the Council of Ministers in relation to the road we should travel on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third proposal of that directive which involves a Common Agricultural Policy regulation on sport, the competition end, is rather peculiar and should be looked at.  I do not think it will cause us headaches; it will cause some of the other Community countries headaches.  Is it a precedent?  Can we expect all sporting associations to be regulated by the Community post-1992?  This could be advantageous in some ways: it might mean that all women will become full members of golf clubs if the Community remove any inequality from the rules of such bodies. The French and Germans are against section 3 of the regulation dealing with competitions and it will be interesting to know what weight they bring to bear.  That is probably the section that will cause us the least problem, even though, to quote from the report on the regulation in <i>The Independent</i>, &ldquo;it is slightly bizarre that it <Col N="2086" /> should be considered at all in this particular way&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the most important functions of all in terms of regulating the future of the sport horse industry will be the operation of the Irish Horse Register together with whatever procedure is agreed on for issuing a list of approved stallions.  Whether that list will involve the general licensing of stallions with a specific list of those that are approved for the sport horse industry or whether the present system will continue remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably aware that there is a lot of dissatisfaction with the stallion inspections, and they are controversial. I suppose a certain amount of controversy is inevitable.  Beauty being in the eye of the beholder, all of us are inclined to think our geese are swans, whether it be our children or our animals, and are often umbraged considerably if some inspector says it does not pass because of A, B or C.  However, I think the Minister will agree that the degree of outcry in relation to the last round of stallion inspection at least warrants the system to be thoroughly investigated.  At least it warrants a review from the Minister as to whether it is in the best interest of the sport horse industry to continue.</P>
    <P>If I may be so bold as to give a couple of examples.  This is what we are talking about here today, how we regulate our stallions for the future.  If we accept the repeal of the Horse Breeding Act, which is what we are being offered today, we abolish the licensing of stallions.  There is a grade A stallion that could quite likely be on our Aga Khan Cup team this year. He has covered many mares in the off season.  His own sire was a grade A stallion, a son of King of Diamonds.  I refer to Spring Diamond and Spring Elegance. In the wisdom of the inspectors on the stallion inspection by which the Minister has set such store in his two page script neither of these was suitable to be registered. I seriously question the wisdom of what we do.  If conformation is to be 100 per cent the reason for approving of stallions and performance is not taken into account at all in proved stallions who <Col N="2087" /> have made it on the showjumping circuit, it is quite likely that we will end up with a beauty parade of wonderful looking sport horses, none of which will be able to jump a pole at all.  If you look at the horses that carried the Irish flag from the early 1930s to date very few of them would win in the show ring, but they jumped at Grand Prix standard throughout the world with the Irish flag over their heads and made Ireland synonymous with the horse industry.  They had their defects, they were not all beauties; but where would we have been had they not been around to represent this country?</P>
    <P>Conformation is essential, and there are certain defects in conformation that we cannot tolerate, but I put it to the Minister that performance-tested stallions such as Spring Diamond and Spring Elegance should at least be entitled to have their progeny registered in the Irish horse register.  I am not saying we should put them up in lights and declare them to be the ideal model of the Irish stallion; I am saying that their progeny have to be registered in the Irish horse register and by denying them approval and listing in the book of Irish approved stallions their progeny cannot now be registered in the Irish horse register.  The Minister and his Department stand indicted if that system continues a year longer.</P>
    <P>There is another stallion, John Henry, which was an international grade A showjumper.  His career was finished prematurely by an accident which damaged his back.  He does have a serious back problem through an accident.  In the wisdom of the stallion inspectors he is not fit to be on the approved list of stallions so that his progeny can be registered in the Irish horse register.  Without going into my views on AI, John Henry covered 100 mares last year by AI.  Because of his back injury he cannot be used for breeding in the more conventional way. The wisdom of the inspectors of the Department of Agriculture who are working on behalf of the Minister is that the progeny of John Henry, an international grade A showjumper, cannot be registered in our horse register.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2088" /> What is the outcome of all of this?  The outcome of it all is that mare owners will still use the Spring Diamonds, the Spring Elegances and the John Henrys standing in our country and we will continue to have more and more young horses, good horses, horses with excellent potential, that will not be registered on the Irish horse register.  We will continue the farce that has existed and is now being perpetuated by the Minister in relation to this.  It can be handled in many different ways.  I am not proposing any particular way; I would not be qualified to do so. You speak to the stallion owners and they want one set of rules; you speak to the half-bred brood mare owners and they want something else.  If you speak to the IFA horse committee they will want something else and, with a bit of luck, the EFI will have an opinion on it too. There I sympathise with the Minister, but there comes a time when the industry has to be taken by the scruff of the neck and saved from itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone a long way. The Senator has missed that part of it, but we will listen to her contribution with interest because I know she is from a county where the sport horse industry flourishes still.</P>
      <P>As I was saying, do we perpetuate this farce of having the progeny of performance-tested stallions in the true sense of performance testing excluded from the Irish horse register?  I suggest we do not.  I suggest we cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, I have serious apprehension about the timing of the discussion of the Bill, not the principle of it. There is a proposal from the Equestrian Federation of Ireland to try to resolve the farcical situation and it is doing the rounds at the moment.  The EFI will be proposing a two-tier stallion register. First of all, they will be proposing that all <Col N="2089" /> stallions, following a clinical examination, should be licensed and-or registered &mdash; in other words, that all stallions would have a number and would be in the book.  I suggest that what is in the 1934 Act is excellent.  Perhaps it needs to be added to; perhaps we will take a bit away.  But the bones of that is excellent and I read out earlier in my contribution those four criteria for clinical examination and licensing approval.  The EFI will be further suggesting that there should be a special section, or even a special register for those who go through a more rigorous inspection and want to be included in a special register or section for approved sires for sport horses &mdash; in other words, it would correspond more to those we now have in the approved list of stallions.  The important point is that in this country every stallion capable of getting a mare in foal should be put down in a book by the Department and numbered on some basis, providing they stand up to certain minimum clinical requirements on visual examination.  We must put them in the book because, if you do not, they will continue to be used by the non-thoroughbred brood mare owners, their progeny will not be able to be registered and we are making a farce of the IHR and registration.</P>
    <P>May I suggest that the marketplace will very quickly weed out progeny which cannot be sold.  The marketplace will dictate those stallions that will be progeny tested.  You cannot legislate for stupidity and if some brood mare owners use an obviously unsuitable stallion the offspring will not be very marketable and their pocket will quickly dictate that they use a stallion that is more suitable to that particular brood mare.  I am suggesting that, as we cannot legislate for stupidity, that as we must have a trace of the breeding of all our animals, you should have a general system whereby all stallions are licensed.  Within that you could have a special approved section of those the Minister states are particularly suitable for sport horses.  It is worthy of consideration. There may be difficulties I do not see.  There may be other proposals <Col N="2090" /> that would overtake this one but at least it is a genuine attempt to grapple with the problem of the growing number of progeny that are not eligible for the Irish Horse Register.</P>
    <P>Could I remind the Minister of his personal commitment as reported in column 1373 of the Seanad Official Report of 3 May 1989 on the Bord na gCapall Bill, 1988.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is intended to sponsor new legislation to facilitate the development and application in the non-thoroughbred industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister was talking about the progress being made in the development of artificial insemination, embryo transfer technology and conversion and the whole future of the sport horse generally.  This is nine months later.  I would like the Minister to inform the House of the progress he has made since 3 May, 1989 with that legislation.  I await it eagerly and I can assure him that the sport horse industry do too.</P>
    <P>I would much prefer if we were discussing that today than abolishing the very last legislation on our Statute Book governing the industry.  We might be abolishing this legislation at that stage anyway but at least we would be putting something in its place and would know the direction we were pointing the industry in the years to come.  I accept that the Minister has spoken on it before and I accept he has a personal commitment to the Irish draught mare.  I support that fully, but the issue is far greater and far bigger than that as I think the Minister probably knows.</P>
    <P>I will, if I may, plagiarise my own contribution in the Dáil on the Bord na gCapall Bill in 1988.  It saved me re-scripting it for today's Bill.  It is the same again we have all been talking about since 1985, on and off both in the Dáil and Seanad, and we appear not to be making a lot of progress.</P>
    <P>I mentioned briefly the registration system and what is now being asked of us under the EC Directive on equidae.  I asked the Minister a few questions.  I await with interest his reply to those when <Col N="2091" /> we finally get to the conclusion of Second Stage.  We need to know if the Connemara Pony Breeders and others will be compelled to use the IHR when there will be only one stud book operated by the Department of Agriculture.  I would like to know if Wetherbys will be allowed to continue to register our sport horse stallions in the future as they have been in the past.  It appears to be contrary to the EC Directive also and we must sort that out.</P>
    <P>I have also made the point that I would like a general system whereby the progeny of all stallions can be registered in IHR.  If they are no good, the market will dictate that they do not continue, that that blood-line will wane and it will not be worth covering the mare again.  At least we will know the breeding lines rather than having some of the best horses jumping in our country at the moment that are not eligible for the IHR.  That makes absolutely no sense. The Bill revolves around the system of registration in the IHR and of licensing and registering stallions in the future.  It is the kernel to the whole future of this most important industry.</P>
    <P>At least twice on previous occasions I have made certain proposals for consideration in relation to registration and I take the liberty of reiterating my views again today.  The Minister may be familiar with how the Welsh Stud Book operates. They have a section A, section B, section C and section D, all covering Welsh ponies and cobs &mdash; different types and different sections of the book.  I suggested before and I suggest it for the Minister's consideration again that we should look to the Irish Horse Register and consider different sections within it, particularly if, for example, the Connemara ponies have to come within that.  There could be four sections A, B, C and D.  Section A of the Register could relate to the pure Irish draught mare, and the produce of the appendix draught mare and the cross of the registered Irish draught sire.  We could keep our native Irish draught in the Irish Horse Register. It could have the same colour passport <Col N="2092" /> but could have a gold stripe across it just to delineate a section A registration.</P>
    <P>Section B, for example, could be the first and second cross of the draught mare or stallion, the half bred or non-thoroughbred crossed to a draught, more likely to be the half bred mare and the draught stallion but not necessarily; it is going both ways today.  We could have a section for the first second and maybe third cross, whatever scientifically would be suitable.  Again we have an Irish-bred, Irish horse.  It is not pure draught, it is not thoroughbred but it is what, traditionally, has carried the flag of the Irish showjumper and Irish eventer around the world in the past.</P>
    <P>We could have a third section, C, for the cross of the Irish-bred, Irish mare with a warm-blood.  There was a lot of controversy over the years about the introduction of continental warm blood stallions.  We have got to be very careful in this area.  The EC directive and internal Community trade will not allow us to be discriminatory in relation to the importation of stallions, semen and ova according to their proposals in the future.  The Germans have 56,000 breeding sport horse mares or non-thoroughbred mares and we have around 5,000.  We may have a rush of blood to the head and decide that the warm-bloods are the answer to all our prayers and will be the saviour of the industry in the future because it is the flavour of the minute or the fashion of the day.  A lot of these come in either as stallions, A.I. straws or whatever other way they might be doing it.  If we make a major mistake, which we possibly will not realise until hindsight, which is often the problem with a lot of breeding programmes, when you look back and say that was a wrong decision &mdash; it is very hard to be absolutely sure in forecasting &mdash; we will destroy our very small pool of non-thoroughbred brood mares &mdash; we have only 5,000 &mdash; very quickly if we got warmblood influence in most of those good non-thoroughbred brood mare lines.</P>
    <P>If we make a mistake we destroy a large section of our traditional Irish non-thoroughbred mare, the type of mare <Col N="2093" /> bought by the continentals whenever they can get hold of it, the mare that breeds stamina, good confirmation, soundness and longevity and is a good suckler. There is a mare there that has been produced over the years through natural selection because of our limestone land and our suitable climate and our good grass generally.  If, with this rush of blood to our heads &mdash; warm-bloods are the flavour of the minute &mdash; and everything is crossed with a warm-blood and we subsequently decide that is not the answer to a proper breeding policy, it will take generations of breeding before we can remove those blood lines from our horses.  If the Germans make a mistake in breeding policy, with 56,000 mares they can put a ring around 5,000 mares and their progeny and take them out of the general breeding policy for a while if needs be.  We cannot do that.  We have such a perilously low number of breeding mares that whatever decisions we take have to be vigilantly policed and guarded.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, section C of our Irish Horse Register could be the Irish-bred, Irish mare, the progeny of the Irish-bred, Irish mare crossed to a warm-blood.  It is still Irish bred but it is not Irish breeding and there is a difference: again, the same green passport but maybe with a red stripe across the front of it.  You just have a different colour stripe on the front of these passports which would distinguish sectors A, B, C and so on.  The D section could be the warm-blood, the complete non-Irish bred horse, that is registered in this country at this stage.</P>
    <P>We can have different sections in our register that will clearly protect the different breeding lines and the interests of the different stud books.  I strongly urge the Minister to consider, through his horse advisory committee, such a possibility. Above all, will the Minister have a system that will ensure that the progeny of all mares registered in the Irish Horse Register in this country are registered. Mares that are covered by stallions that are performance tested by being on Irish international teams but did not pass visual examination surely deserve to have their progeny registered.  If the progeny <Col N="2094" /> turn out to be no good it could be the end of that line very quickly and we need not worry.</P>
    <P>Irish Horse Register mares that are covered by National Hunt stallions are not eligible for the Irish Horse Register at the moment.  There is a certain arrogance about that decision.  We have some of the top national hunt stallions, and being national hunt they are to beget jumpers. What else does the sport horse want in terms of ability but to be able to jump cleanly and well?  Because they are not registered on the approved list of stallions in the Department, but with Wetherby's as the National Hunt sires, the progeny of that cross is ineligible for our Irish Horse Register.  That needs urgent attention, as well as the other points I made.  There are five or six issues in relation to licensing/ registry and the Irish Horse Register I have made there which need urgent attention.  It should not be beyond the intelligence of the Minister, his departmental officials, together with the vast experience that is now available in the horse advisory committee, to come up with a system that would put an end to the nonsense that exists at the moment generally in this area.</P>
    <P>The market will dictate what stallions will be used.  The market now dictates that Spring Elegance is being used because he is one of our Grade A horses being jumped on the international circuit. It is not deterring the owners of our IHR mares from using Spring Elegance, yet the tragedy is that the progeny of that cross will not be eligible to be registered. The Dutch, the Germans, the French and most of our continental colleagues, part of the Twelve, will all be bound by whatever regulations are finally passed in relation to this directive.</P>
    <P>They have very strictly controlled breeding programmes and breeding policy for this most important industry. We have never had a breeding programme &mdash; I stand to be corrected but I have never heard of it.  There are over 30,000 employed in the sport horse industry in this country.  We have bred traditionally from mares that were lame, <Col N="2095" /> maimed or had broken down, or those that could not be sold.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding an inverted type of policy, we have had spectacular results up to the last year or two.  Unfortunately, the results being measured by successes on the international Grand Prix circuit have begun to decline and are considerably worrying now.  I hope this legislation the Minister mentioned in the Seanad on 3 May last will include a strictly controlled breeding policy.  I imagine that if the licensing of stallions as outlined in the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, which the Minister produced in this House to be repealed today and which this party will be opposing vigorously, tooth and nail, until there is something to put in its place, was implemented strictly we would probably have had some major rows in the industry in the last few years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the stallions produced for licensing under that Act which did not pass, the Minister had the power to order their castration.  He could have ordered Sea Crest to be castrated when he failed inspection the first year.  He continued to cover mares nonetheless and he subseqently passed the inspection.  This would have been too bad if the Minister had implemented the law that is on our Statute Book and had had the horse castrated. I can imagine the outcry from those concerned if Spring Diamond and Spring Elegance, not having passed a visual inspection, had been ordered by the Minister to be castrated.  The Minister has not implemented his powers.  In fact, he has ignored the law.</P>
    <P>As I read through the Act last night what came to mind was the ballyhoo we had about rod licensing in the last two years.  The law had to be implemented in relation to rod licensing; the Minister had to be seen to implement it.  People even ended up in jail for contempt of the law maybe they were bailed out on their way to Mountjoy.  I have forgotten the details, but certainly people were convicted for contempt of that law.  I imagine that under the Horse Breeding Act, there are a number of people at the moment who, could be held in contempt too, but the <Col N="2096" /> Minister chose to ignore that law on our Statute Book whereas the rod licensing law is being implemented.  I am not saying it is a good thing to have legislation on our Statute Book that is not being implemented.  It brings democracy into disrepute generally.  I am being slightly facetious when I make the analogy between the pursuit of the rod licence and not pursuing the castration of stallions that have not passed inspection.</P>
    <P>Since 1984 the Horse Breeding Act has not been implemented by the Department. In fact, between 1970 and 1984 the number of stallions licenced dropped from 1,000 in 1970 to 500 in 1984.  The number of horses were around but there was obviously little interest in pursuing the licensing system.  On 5 December 1989, the Minister's colleague, Deputy Kirk, Minister of State in charge of Food, was in the same position on the Report and Final Stage in the Dáil as the Minister of State is today.  He is also of the opinion that there had been no demand whatsoever from any sector of the industry to return to licensing.  He said:</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that the quality of horse breeding has suffered over the past five years as a result of the cessation of licensing.</P>
    <P>It did not.  It made no difference anyway because people were allowed to continue to use stallions whether they were licensed or registered or not.  If there is a policy it must be strictly implemented and there must be some penalties for not implementing it.  There is no point having a voluntary system for producing a horse for licensing because if you did not want to licence a horse, it could continue to cover mares anyway.  If there was no material benefit or any type of benefit for having a licence, why would people bother to produce horses for licensing? What difference would it make when you stop licensing horses?</P>
    <P>I suggest that some of the very rigorous stallion inspections &mdash; I choose my words carefully &mdash; of recent times will affect the quality of horse breeding in the years to come if we do not agree on how we should move forward from here.  I gave examples <Col N="2097" /> of John Henry and the King of Diamonds horse and his son Spring Elegance.  They are but a few.  Everyone could mention sires they are aware of and problems that have arisen in different areas.  If the likes of those truly performance tested stallions are precluded from having their progeny entered in our Irish Horse Register, to use the Minister's colleagues' words, the quality of horse breeding will suffer dramatically in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Bord na gCapall were dissolved a year ago, and we all had some things to say, some good, some quite harsh, about that body.  One thing Bord na gCapall did well was the establishment of the Irish Horse Register which has now been taken over by the Department.  They also had considerable success in the establishment of an apprentice system for farriers.  At the moment there is no Irish school of farriers. Because of the nature of the job it nearly always tends to be men who are employed as farriers but there may be a few girls interested as well.  Any young person who wants to pursue a blacksmiths' career effectively has to get certification from England at the moment.  We need an Irish School of Farriers under the Irish Master Farriers Association.  I would be pleased to learn that the horse advisory committee have been considering this particular issue.</P>
    <P>Since 1980 it is a criminal offence to shoe a horse in the United Kingdom without proper qualifications.  In fact, there were 12 prosecutions in 1989 in the UK for shoeing a horse without being properly qualified.  With visions of an Irish solution to an Irish problem in mind, you would have anarchy if you prevented any unqualified person in this country from shoeing a horse, because most farmers reared with horses, most racing people and many of the show jumping fraternity are well able to shoe horses. I presume it is intended, in relation to legislation of that kind, that people such as myself or Senator Ross, who decide to shoe a horse in the morning, people who would not be qualified, would be <Col N="2098" /> liable for prosecution.  There were 12 prosecutions for shoeing horses by unqualified persons in the UK in 1989 but we have nothing governing it, we do not even consider it.  I know the ISPCA are exercising themselves in relation to this at the moment.  It is worthy of very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Western Horse Breeders group have taken a particular interest in the whole business of stallion inspections. I commend this very excellent group who are concerning themselves with the future of the sport horse industry.  I hate that expression &ldquo;sport horse industry&rdquo; but I continue to use it because, as a collective title, it is quite effective.  They are proposing for stallion inspections that 30 per cent be allocated to the performance of the horse, 10 per cent to the pedigree or the blood lines involved and 60 per cent to conformation.  I know not everyone agrees with that particular breakdown of the percentages, but they are the three areas we need to consider &mdash; performance, pedigree and conformation. The looks are terribly important but ability to jump will be what will sell our Irish sport horses in the future.</P>
    <P>I commend bodies such as the Western Horse Breeders and the Limerick Hunter Improvement Society.  I hope that many of the voluntary bodies that became defunct after 1970, when the Horse Industry Act came on our Statute Book establishing Bord na gCapall, would now pick up the reins where they left off.  There is a tendency &mdash; and I suppose it is human nature that if the Government take over any functions or duties those involved in the voluntary provision of those services take a back seat and eventually let the Government or the Government agency get on with it.  There were many registers, stud books, non-thoroughbred brood mares associations and different groups pursuing the best interests of our sport horse industry prior to 1970.  Some continued on a little while after it.  But with Bord na gCapall at the helm these groups perhaps felt they were superfluous, that <Col N="2099" /> their job was being done anyway.  Now, with the demise of Bord na gCapall since last year, I urge these various groups, particularly the breeding interest groups, to reorganise and get themselves together.</P>
    <P>There is one major problem &mdash; I feel the Minister realises it &mdash; with any aspect of the sport horse industry, that is, to be sure you are talking to some one who truly represents the broad views of the industry in a democratic fashion.  I do not know if there is an issue on the horse generally on which you will get an unanimous decision.  I hesitate to suggest there is not.  It is the nature of the game in itself.  There are very private people, they have operated individually since the fair days and indeed before.  There is a lot of dealing and trading and unwritten rules that govern it generally.  As we approach 1992 and as the directive now in relation to the governing of trade <i>in equidae</i> generally post-1992 in the Community will be foisted upon us whether we like it or not, we have to make every effort to get the interest groups together and to get a policy which will safely see this industry into the future.</P>
    <P>There are certain areas of the horse industry that are still, in my view, under-presented. These would mainly be in relation to representing the interests of what we used to refer as the non-thoroughbred brood mare generally.  The non-thoroughbred brood mare or the sport horse brood mare, as I mentioned initially, is the key to the future of this industry.  I do not apologise for coming back to this point, because without protecting our numbers of brood mares, which have fallen perilously low in the last few years, everything else is irrelevant. No breeding policy no EC regulations, no governing of the industry generally makes any sense if you have nothing left to govern.  It is as simple as that.  Every effort must be made by the Minister, and his Department, making use of the expertise in the Horse Advisory <Col N="2100" /> Committee and the various other representative bodies around the country, using the Equestrian Federation of Ireland as the unbrella group to put in place a system whereby we reward, we encourage, we cajole, we entice or even blackmail the Irish farmer, who now has one or two brood mares as part of a larger farm enterprise, to continue and to expand into perhaps one extra brood mare.</P>
    <P>A lot of thought has gone into encouraging farmers, who are now in the primary production areas of farming, many of whose products are now in surplus, to look towards alternative enterprises.  We have heard of many possibilities &mdash; agriforestry and agri-tourism and encouragement for horticulture, the soft fruit industry generally.  We all have our particular areas where we have an interest. It was even suggested that rabbits would be a good farmyard enterprise, also greyhounds and apples.  Over the years all of these alternative enterprises have been thrown up for discussion.  I suggest not enough attention has been given by the Department and by the Minister of State, as acting Minister for Agriculture and Food at the moment, if I can confer that title on him, to encouragement of the sport horse industry as a very serious alternative enterprise in our farmyards today.</P>
    <P>Tragically, very few of the present generation of farmers were reared with horses.  They were reared with the tractor in the era of mechanisation.  It is only those who traditionally had a mare or two are continuing with that tradition.  It is often hard to get the younger generation, male or female, to interest themselves in a great Irish tradition, the production of the non-thoroughbred horse generally. The incentive needs to be there.  I suggested blackmail, cajoling, carrots rather than sticks, anything the Minister can come up with.  We have got to do something now, because of the perilously low number of brood mares, to ensure it does not drop any further, that the curve turns the other way very quickly and that we <Col N="2101" /> get back up to 11,000 or 12,000 and over as were in 1970 before Bord na gCapall were established.</P>
    <P>At the Minister's prompting &mdash; I believe he was terrified I would not mention his policy of October/November 1988 in relation to the industry &mdash; I fully intended referring to it.  I compliment him on it.  But it is but the tip of the iceberg, it has not gone far enough. Would the Minister please consider, as part of a programme for encouraging alternative farm enterprises, the extension of headage payments to all non-thoroughbred mares, not just draught mares, registered in the IHR &mdash; headage payments as outlined in that announcement in November 1988, if I have my timing correct?  He would immediately encourage more farmers to consider the prospect of having a brood mare and those farmers that have the brood mares would make a greater effort to get them in foal.</P>
    <P>There is another major problem &mdash; the very poor foaling returns.  Of the 5,000 mares fewer than 47 per cent produce a live foal.  That is an appalling waste of breeding stock.  The main reason is that farmers will probably produce the mare to the horse once, cover it, bring it home, get on with the harvest or with whatever else they are doing and they will never check whether the mare has held in foal or whether she ever went in foal in the beginning.  As they say in the industry, they will not bring it back to the horse. They might give it the one jump but that is it; they are too busy or get distracted and that is the end of it.  If there was an incentive, either in terms of a headage payment for the mare or a foal premium for the production of a live foal which is another way of proceeding, farmers would make a greater effort to ensure their mares were in foal and we would immediately increase the number of fillies. On a ratio basis, you get approximately 50:50.  If the number of foals increases, the number of fillies increases; if the number of fillies increases, we <Col N="2102" /> increase our pool of brood mares.  If we can sort out the mess in relation to those that are eligible to be registered in the Irish Horse Register, we are on the road to getting that graph turned around and increasing the number from the less than 5,000 mares to what would be considered an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably thinking I have talked for far too long but I do not apologise for it.  In the last couple of years we have had one opportunity on the Bord na gCapall Dissolution Bill to talk about an industry that is very dear to many of us.  The Irish people love their horses. Whether they live in urban or rural Ireland, they follow the thoroughbred industry.  Many of them have a daily punt and would know what race meetings are taking place.  That know the breeding of all the thoroughbreds.  There is huge interest among children in ponies.  The Irish Pony Society and the Irish Pony Clubs of Ireland are doing a valiant job. There are thousands of young and not so young children who are besotted with ponies and with horses generally.  It is a very good sport; it is a very constructive, responsible way for our young people to spend their time.</P>
    <P>There are many other associations doing valiant work.  There is the recently formed Irish Dressage Society, there is the Irish Horse Trials Society, the Showjumping Association of Ireland that have done so much for us over the years. There are all of these bodies grouped under the umbrella of the Equestrian Federation of Ireland and from young and old, urban and rural, there is a love of the horse.</P>
    <P>We need to give a little time in our debates in this House to an industry which employs 30,000 people.  I do not know what the headlines would be if the Minister could announce a start-up of industries that would employ a similar number.  The country would be on its knees in appreciation and thanksgiving. Yet, we have an industry we choose to neglect.  It is a case of familiarity breeding <Col N="2103" /> contempt.  Just because it always was, we think it always will be but the Minister may appreciate that may not be so.  With the pool of brood mares now below 5,000 we will not be producing sufficient replacements in the natural order to consider the industry safe for the future unless we have a breeding policy in place, with the Minister at the helm, a Minister who knows what he is doing and what the industry needs and who understands and appreciates what this industry could do for Ireland not just within the Community but globally.</P>
    <P>We are synonymous with horses, we are synonymous with the production of the good sound horse with longevity.  A lot of the warm bloods are a flash in the pan, they are in the headlines for two years but they are gone by the time they are nine or ten years old.  They break down, they cannot stay sound.  It is often the complaint about the Irish horses that they are not in their prime until they are eight or nine years old but they are still there when they are 14 or 15.  What age was Rockbarton when he was retired last year?  Just think of the famous Irish horses that we have been so proud to identify ourselves with over the years, the famous Irishmen and women who have represented this country over the years on the Irish horse.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to take this industry for granted.  We cannot afford to take the 30,000 jobs that are there in the sport horse industry for granted.  We cannot afford to take the growing love of horses in our young people for granted.  We have got to make the provisions available for them and also access to the industry. Above all the Minister and his Department must have a policy they can stand over as being in the best interests for the future of this most important industry.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the Bill and to compliment the Minister on bringing the Bill to the House.  I am not as knowledgeable as Senator Doyle <Col N="2104" /> on the subject of horse breeding &mdash; but I could tell her I grew up with horses and know a little about the Irish draught horse and especially the Irish draught mare.  I would like to suggest here, coming from a Border county, that there were a number of applications for grant aid that were successful but unfortunately there was a larger number, 100 to 150, that were too late.  I ask the Minister to look favourably on those applications because this grant is part funded from FEOGA and also from our Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Horse Breeding Bill is very important for the country.  The Horse Breeding Association is very important.  We do not have a surplus of horses.  We do not have a super levy situation.</P>

Also, a blacksmith apprenticeship scheme is being implemented and funded.  I would compliment the Minister once again on bringing the Bill to the House and I thank him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Chair for enabling me to raise the important matter of the delay in the report being issued in regard to the pay <Col N="2105" /> and conditions in relation to the Army. It is a matter I have tried to raise a couple of times as my party's spokesman on Defence in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to welcome the Minister here.  I think it is the first time he has been in the Seanad since the election and since the new Government was formed.  I would like to wish him well.</P>
      <P>He takes over the post at a very difficult and critical time in the history of the Army but it is a time when, hopefully, he will be able to use his persuasive nature and his ability to solve the problems.  I hope he will bear with me in the few points I have to raise in relation to the issue at hand.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that the question of Army pay, conditions and service, and various matters has been ongoing for quite some time.  It goes back to the Minister's predecessor.  It is unfortunate at that time it was not reacted to with the quickness and alacrity the issue demanded.  Unfortunately, things were left to drag and we had the situation where many people were making representations and given the nature of the force, it ended up that the spouses and the Army wives were making representations on behalf of the people in the Army.  The result was that some of them ran in the election.  The issue was hot in the press at that stage but it has died a little.  While I am not saying nothing has happened, certainly we would have liked to have seen a bit more happening, and more quickly.</P>
      <P>Morale is low in the Army in various ranks.  The fact is that the Army people have not been paid well over many years. Unfortunately, all too often we pay general lip-service both to members of the Garda and the Army.  At times we take them for granted, shout when they are not there when we need them but otherwise we take them for granted.  I ask the Minister to try to bring forward the report as soon as possible.  We are aware of the timescale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission was appointed last <Col N="2106" /> summer with submissions to be received by 30 September.  Most of the matters had been well documented and voiced prior to that and I do not think there should be an extension in time in relation to bringing forward the various matters that constitute the issue.  We are now almost five months down the road and the expectation is that it will be next June or July before anything is done: given the way things happen, it could be next autumn before things are even brought to Cabinet.</P>
    <P>What we want is a simple decision in relation to money, a simple decision in relation to recognising some sort of representative body, recognising that the Army had a low base from which they were starting.  We have got to make a decision.  We have seen in recent days that there was a will in regard to the rod licence dispute and eventually a way was found out of it, despite all sorts of problems. If that matter could be solved, it should be possible in this equally important issue.  Indeed, many people would say it is a more important issue, given the Army situation, the great service the men have given and are giving and the great tradition of the Irish Army and the service it has given in many countries.  We have got to make a decision.  The money can be found.  It has been found before in relation to other areas.</P>
    <P>This country is owed something like £19 million or £20 million outstanding following our UNIFIL and other duties. That money should be got in and greater efforts should be made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this regard.  I hope the Minister here will communicate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that greater efforts should be made to get that money. It is mainly outstanding from Russia and America.  If the boot were on the other foot they would be quick enough to demand it.  That money would solve a lot of the Minister's problems for a couple of years.</P>
    <P>The Army have got to be taken seriously.  Conditions have got to be <Col N="2107" /> improved.  Pay has got to be looked at. To ask Army men to bring up families and have their wives trying to make an Army salary go a long way is just not on. While there was a certain increase when taxes and other matters are taken into account, Army personnel still lag very far behind in pay.  I hope the Minister will give this matter very urgent attention.</P>
    <P>Delay is unsatisfactory.  The matter has been well researched; there have been many representations, the Minister should ask for the report to be on his desk within weeks rather than months. Then there should be a clear commitment from the Cabinet.  The Minister is well able, and is a past master, to fight his corner in the Cabinet to ensure the necessary funds will be provided.  Obviously some of them will be a once-off payment but if we expect the Army to do the job we are asking, we have to pay them a fair and representative wage.</P>
    <P>I also hope that when the commission reports and when the Minister is looking at the report a representative body will be set up so that this situation will never happen again.  Some of the problems probably would have been avoided if there was such a forum where officers of various ranks could articulate their views, could discuss their problems without fear of getting into trouble.</P>
    <P>I hope there will not be any witch hunt in the case of any member of the force who has articulated his views and who was only saying what the Minister knows what everyone in the street is saying, what all the Army are saying.  If people have spoken their mind, let us listen to them.  There is the PDFORRA to which many members are affiliated.  Whether it is that body or some other representative body, it should be easy enough to set up a structure.  I am sure that the Minister will be able to accommodate Army personnel and that they will be able to respond.</P>
    <P>Obviously, given the nature of the Army there are certain matters which <Col N="2108" /> cannot be discused openly.  I do not think anyone would expect that.  Military matters have to be dealt with in a certain way but in relation to the welfare of officers, to their education, to in-service training, the situation that Army officers find themselves on retirement, in relation to the Navy Corps and the Air Corps, there are many matters that could be discussed. There should be a forum; there should be a body; and I hope the Minister can see his way to ensuring he can meet the demands half-way.  I am sure that the Army will respond likewise.</P>
    <P>We all know what we want this representative body to achieve.  It is not if one side is trying to out-do the other. What the Minister should indicate is that he will soon set up a forum, that full discussions will take place with the various bodies.  I am sure they can meet half-way in relation to the formation of a new body.  It is important that the Minister tries to see that matters are brought to a conclusion.  I also hope that if awards are to be made, that perhaps as a gesture they could be back-dated to the establishment of the commission, or to the date it concluded its deliberations or some months.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that some sort of a bonus or gift might have been given at Christmas in recognition of the fact that the Army have been working from a very low base for far to long.  I hope that the Minister, recognising now the problem and having seen and heard from many people, including various spokespeople, about the plight of the Army wives and the great hardship being incurred by many families, will ensure that this issue will not continue to dog us.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to say the commission's report will be available at a very early date and when it is that he will react positively to it and have a clear commitment from Cabinet that they will adhere to what they have indicated in the <i>Programme for Government</i> where they said that the long term objective was to substantially improve basic Army pay <Col N="2109" /> and reducing the over-dependence of soldiers on special duty allowances.  There should be a certain basic wage, so that soldiers are not depending on getting certain rosters or going to Lebanon in order to be able to feed their families and so on.  I am sure the Minister is fully aware of the problem.  He is a Minister who has responded in the past to solving difficulties and I am sure that he will recog-nise that there is a problem, there has been a problem.  Obviously, we do not want a piecemeal solution but want it fully thought out.  This problem did not arise just when the Minister took office. He is the person now dealing with it.  The problem has been festering for a number of years.  We will remember the Minister for many things and I hope that, among other things, we will remember him for sorting out the Army pay problem, recognising the great contribution that Army personnel have made to this country, giving them proper conditions of service and looking after their welfare in the way that they deserve.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to address the various points I have raised and once again I would like to thank him for being here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to re-echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Cosgrave in regard to paying tribute to the Army and Army personnel for their long tradition of service to the Irish community, going back to the formation of the State.  The measures that I have now in contemplation and to which Senator Cosgrave referred are matters that have not really been addressed since the foundation of the Army.  That is what makes the whole aspect of this more complex than I think the Senator appreciates.  It is not a simple problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to divide the problem into two parts, although the motion only refers to the question of the report on pay and conditions.  The Senator brought in the other aspect of the representative <Col N="2110" /> structures that are now being sought within the Army and I will also address myself to that, as the Senator has, although it is not strictly within the terms of the motion, they are two separate matters.</P>
    <P>The first matter which is the subject of the motion concerns what I would call, in short, the Gleeson Commission chaired by Mr. Dermot Gleeson, Senior Counsel, with a small group of members. It was established last July.  It was the first aspect of policy initiated by the new Government, and the Taoiseach announced the establishment of this independent commission to look into the question of remuneration and conditions of service and to carry out a major review in this area in regard to the Defence Forces.  There were some very prominent personnel to assist Mr. Gleeson in his task, the former Chief of Staff of the Army, Lieutenant-General O'Sullivan, former CQMS, Mr. Patrick McCabe, a former General Secretary of the Irish Council of Trade Unions, Mr. Donal Nevin, Dr. Eugene McCarthy, former Deputy Director of the General Federated Union of Employers, and Colm McCarthy, an economist.  That very able, top-class team was entrusted with this job last July and I await their report, which will be very detailed, the first ever carried into this whole area of remuneration and conditions of service for the Defence Force.  I might say, just to put it on the record and not in any contentious spirit, that the date for submissions before this commission was put back to November rather than September at the request of Army personnel themselves because they appreciated the importance of the work that was being done by the commission and they wished to present their own very detailed and complex case in respect to each of the sectors of the Defence Forces. They wanted to present their case fully and they appreciated the difficult nature of it.  With that in mind, they wished to take on consultants to forward submissions to the commission and I retained <Col N="2111" /> consultants on behalf of the three Army sectors who were making submissions to the commission.  I retained consultants on their behalf, Stokes Kennedy Crowley, and paid for them as well.  That was very much appreciated.  The delay has actually been at the request of the Army representatives. We set up three very effective military teams representing the three sectors of the Defence Forces, the privates, non-commissioned officers and officers.</P>
    <P>This commission has heard their submissions now.  It has heard a large number of oral submissions and it is continuing to look into all aspects of the case.  As the Senator has said, we do not want any short-term solution.  It would be very easy for me to find a short-term solution to this matter today but what the Army want, and what the personnel in the Army representing the three sectors of the Defence Forces require, the personnel in particular who represented the three sectors in their submissions to the commission, is a comprehensive structure for Army pay and conditions that will not merely deal with the present problems but will provide the foundation for this problem being addressed and met over the years ahead so that for once and all the current anomalies that exist in regard to pay and conditions will be removed.  It provides us with an opportunity to solve this problem which has existed since the foundation of the State whereby Defence Forces complaints in regard to pay and conditions were met in an <i>ad hoc</i> way by Government over the years.  It is worth waiting for the full commission report on that aspect, and I am confident that when the report comes to hand it will be fully acknowledged by the Government, who will then be in a position to take action.  That is on the aspect of pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of it, although it is not relevant to the motion, I will deal with briefly because the Senator has raised it.  We are in a public forum here <Col N="2112" /> and I think we should have an open, frank discussion on matters.  I am glad to be able to say here categorically that the Government have approved of the establishment of a permanent structure to provide for representative groups within the Defence Forces.  I want to emphasise here that I am not establishing a group to represent the Defence Forces.  I am merely establishing a structure that will enable the Defence Forces to elect by democratic vote, by secret ballot, their own members and their own executive to their own representative association or associations, whether it is a matter of one association or an association comprising three groups, men, NCOs and officers. That is all I am doing.  They will elect their representatives who will advocate in regard to areas of pay, conditions and what I might call welfare areas such as housing, health and pensions, any form of positive aid they may give to their members under the general cover of welfare. That is an important segment that I would envisage being part of a representative body's duties.  Those areas of pay, conditions and welfare are the areas that they would be mandated to work on. These are areas of discipline and policy, separate Army matters unrelated to what their particular mandate would be, and I hope to publish legislation dealing with that aspect.</P>
    <P>I want to draw a distinction here.  That is separate from the commission's work. They probably will not report until some time in May or June.  They are looking into a very complex matter in great detail. That is their area of positive recommendation with regard to pay and conditions. Before that, inside the next month, I will have legislation setting out democratic provisions that will enable democratic structures to be established in the Defence Force structures for the men themselves.  I will then meet that representative body or bodies and they can also meet the Chief of Staff or anybody else on matters related to their particular mandate.  That is the way to <Col N="2113" /> proceed &mdash; to have one such group or groups that would be recognised any protected by Statute and by regulation, thus preventing a proliferation of spokesmen and groups, which would be obviously undersirable.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that inside a month it will see the emergence of this Bill and following on that there will be an opportunity in this House to debate it.  It is very important that it should be emphasised here and now that this is not a question of the Minister or the Government bringing in legislation because they are setting up their own body.  All we will be asking the Dáil and Seanad to do is to approve of enabling legislation that will enable the men to elect their own representatives and their own body, or bodies if more than one is required in respect of different sectors.  It is important to remember that in this aspect.</P>
    <P>This will also be an independent body of the men themselves, elected by the men &mdash; it will not be within any command structure of the Army or anything like that &mdash; which will be in a position to discuss and advocate in the three areas of pay, conditions and welfare of Defence Force personnel and of the Defence Forces generally.  There would be an ongoing system of conciliation and arbitration &mdash; I am talking about the future now &mdash; in the event of such a representative group or groups seeking to have matters of pay or conditions arbitrated upon.  This system of conciliation and arbitration would be analogous to the system that operates in regard to the public service and the Garda Síochána. Something of that kind would be in place as an end result in the event of a representative body or bodies seeking to have such a matter or matters discussed and arbitrated upon, ultimately if that is necessary, in matters relating to pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>I would like this to be clearly understood because all this section has been taken in a fairly brief period of time. <Col N="2114" /> I welcome the resolution put down by Senator Cosgrave because it enables me, as Minister for Defence, to respond in this matter.  It is particularly important because there is a danger of this issue becoming clouded.  The last thing in the world we want in our society &mdash; and I make a particular appeal here &mdash; is any question of conflict or confrontation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Irish Defence Forces.  There is absolutely no need for that.  I assure the House that I will do everything to facilitate progress by way of persuasion and consensus, both in the two Houses of the Oireachtas and in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>This matter is fundamental to the security and the whole future wellbeing of the State.  It is far too important a matter to be left to nit-picking or political point-scoring.  I have outlined the position, both in regard to waiting for the commission's report, which, I am certain, will be a comprehensive one by reason of the detailed submissions they have already received, and having that report implemented when it emerges in June.  In the meantime I hope to have established a representative group structure for the Defence Forces, which can be done by way of legislation between now and June, so that some progress will be made over the next six months on the two aspects on which the Defence Forces have felt dissatisfied, and to some degree rightly so.</P>
    <P>While I welcome Senator Cosgrave's motion which enabled this discussion to take place, I want to say that it is by no means a simple matter and I do not wish to cut corners on it.  This has been with us now for nearly 70 years, going back to 1922 or 1923.  We can surely wait just a very short period of time &mdash; I am only talking about a month in the case of the legislation and about four months in the case of the actual commission report &mdash; for these two events and then we can process them fully through the Dáil with the fullest consultation and co-operation. We want to ensure that what we establish at the end of the day in the two areas I <Col N="2115" /> mentioned are permanent structures relating to the vital wellbeing of the Defence Forces.  We must get it right, to use the modern phrase, and not come in with any <i>ad hoc</i>, top of the head, <Col N="2116" /> immediate response.  It is in that spirit that I meet the point of view put by Senator Cosgrave here this evening.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 21 February 1990.</P>
