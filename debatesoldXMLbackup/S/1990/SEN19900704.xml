      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to keep St. Garvan's Vocational School, Dublin 1, open until a new second level school for the children of the north inner city is constructed in Sean McDermott Street.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to hold a public inquiry into any proposed infill and housing development at West Pier, Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to confer official sanction on Kilfinan Centre, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the recent resolution tabled at the European Parliament, the need for the Minister for Foreign <Col N="1614" /> Affairs to take an active interest in the case of Raoul Wallenberg.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Costello, Ross, Jackman and Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matter raised by Senator Costello and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Ross, Jackman and Norris may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Before I call on the Leader of the House for the Order of Business, I am sure the House would wish to pay tribute to the Irish soccer team and to the management of that team.  I suggest that we ask the leaders of the various political groupings in the House to make whatever contribution they wish in that regard and to bear in mind that they should not extend the words of congratulations into any other areas that may have arisen in public debate after the match.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying that on this side of the House we warmly congratulate Jack Charlton and the Irish team, and indeed the Irish supporters, for a magnificent achievement in the recent World Cup.  They were certainly a credit to Ireland on the football field and in the various cities in which the games were played.  I was in Palermo for one of the games, I was in Germany last year for the European games and I continue to follow the team.  I would like to congratulate them warmly on their achievements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to have the opportunity to follow Senator Fallon on this matter.  In one sense all that can be said about our team has been said and politicians should be careful about elbowing in on the act.  It is a great occasion today, an opportunity for us as a House and all parties to put on the record our sense of national pride, to say thanks for the hours of pleasure our team <Col N="1615" /> has given us, to say thanks, too, for the great sense of national uplift throughout the country and to thank them for the marvellously positive image of this country which they have conveyed right around the world.</P>
      <P>What was particularly encouraging to see was the support which our team got from all sides in Northern Ireland.  Even some of the Orangemen who came down last week had to get back on time to support Ireland in the match.  Perhaps it is too much to hope that for the next World Cup there could be a team from all Ireland playing in green and orange jerseys.  That would do more to bring together people on this island than all the speeches and motions we pass in the Parliaments on this island.  Like Senator Fallon, I would like to thank our supporters. With their sense of fun, their great behaviour and their enthusiasm, they were the best ambassadors this country has ever had.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I want to join in this vote of thanks and congratulations to the squad of 22 and Jack Charlton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with the other groups on behalf of the Progressive Democrats in congratulating the marvellous achievement of the Irish team in Rome, and indeed throughout the whole campaign. I was fortunate enough to be at the match on Saturday night and I must say it was one of the most extraordinary experiences of my lifetime.  The way in which the Irish fans conducted themselves throughout the campaign and particularly on Saturday night was a matter of inspiration to us all.</P>
      <P>I go back to a question which I asked the Leader of the House last week, and that was in what way Jack Charlton's achievement and that of the team could be marked.  I suggested that he might be made an honorary Irish citizen and I repeat that question more seriously now. That man seems to me to talk more sense in five minutes than we talk here in a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take your point, a Chathaoirligh, <Col N="1616" /> about not introducing irrelevancies but I wish to make one point.  I felt very strongly on Sunday morning about the way the people who were in Rome, who had stayed there and supported our team so well were treated so badly at the airport. I do not know who was responsible. It seems to be difficult to get to the bottom of that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad Senator Shane Ross and myself had the foresight to place on the Order Paper for today motion No. 101 which reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with pride the outstanding performance of the Irish team in the World Cup in Rome and also the exemplary behaviour of the Irish football fans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is proper that it should be marked.  It is not just a question of entertainment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the interruptions could be a little more intelligent and intelligible. I think it is important because it gave the country a great sense of pride. In the motion Senator Ross and myself <Col N="1617" /> referred to both elements, the achievement of the Irish team representing a small nation getting through to a late stage in the competition and also, perhaps even more importantly, the exemplary behaviour of the fans which gave us all a great sense of pride and unquestionably led to them being regarded as ambassadors.  I believe this is very important because there is no question of doubt that it will lead to a considerable increase in tourist revenue as a result not only of the behaviour of the team but also of the fans.</P>
      <P>The one small regret I have is that that moment of triumph was not allowed to remain untarnished by the political equivalent of football louts, the Provisional IRA, who would not even allow one night when there was unblemished praise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point at the beginning that only words of congratulations were to be allowed in the contributions of leaders of the political groupings here in the House.  You have departed from that and I must remind you that unless you get back to it I will have to ask you to resume your seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I had, in fact, concluded but I am very glad that remark will remain on the record because I feel strongly about it, and so do most of the people in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to join with all the other Senators who have spoken in adding the congratulations of the Labour Party to Jack Charlton and to the Irish team.  What was particularly gratifying for me at a local and personal level was that quite a number on the Irish team, namely, Niall Quinn, Paul McGrath and Kevin Moran come from the area of Dublin where I had the honour to try my hand during the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This success is partly derived from fundamental things such as the efforts of people who run youth and junior soccer clubs throughout the city of Dublin day in, day out, at weekends, on frosty, cold <Col N="1618" /> Sunday mornings and so on.  The success of the team derived from such work.</P>
    <P>The other gratifying thing I found about the success of this Irish team was that quite a number of them had a very strong connections with the GAA.  That is particularly true of people like Niall Quinn who played hurling for Dublin and, of course, Kevin Moran who also distinguished himself in the Dublin jersey.  It is welcome that those people who had such connections with the GAA should now find themselves distinguishing themselves in the international arena of soccer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words of congratulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>At my age one is entitled to some privileges.  I would like to join in the words of congratulations to the Irish team and to the Irish supporters.  There were so many things that were impressive about the World Cup games it is difficult to pinpoint anything but I would like to mention one thing.  During the magnificent turn-out at Dublin Airport and on the streets of Dublin for the team any man would be forgiven for being completely carried away with the visible signs of admiration shown to Jack Charlton.  Rather than being carried away, it should be noted that what he did was to sound a note of concern for the children and for the people who were assembled in the streets of Dublin.  He spoke about his terrible anxiety that children would fall under the wheels of the buses.  He asked the people to go home quietly.  Is he not a wonderful man?  With all the admiration that was being shown to him when a half a million citizens <Col N="1619" /> turned out to greet him and the team, his concern was for the people and particularly for children.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton spoke of his pride that a number of the players are from Dublin. He spoke about Niall Quinn.  I must make a comment about that.  Niall Quinn's father played for the Tipperary team. Senator Lanigan will not like to be reminded that Billy Quinn, Niall's father, scored four goals off The Diamond Hayden at a particular final.  His uncle, Niall Condon, also from Thurles, played with the Tipperary team and on an all-Ireland team.  I do not know how any man who has father like Billy Quinn and an uncle like Niall Condon, who played for Tipperary, could be from Walkinstown. However, if it gives you any satisfaction to claim it, you are welcome. We just happen to know better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the procedures followed in the other House and of the long list of Bills the Leader of the House mentioned last week to be concluded by the end of the session, could he give us some indication today when he expects this session to end and could he give us a guarantee that there will be <Col N="1620" /> no allocation of time motions between now and the end of session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning took most of the words out of my mouth.  First, I would like to reinforce what he said and to ask the Leader of the House for an assurance that we will have no Bills guillotined by the end of this session. That is most important.  Secondly, I would like to ask what we are discussing tomorrow and what is the plan for tomorrow?  Thirdly, we should have a full programme until the end of the session because it is seriously revised at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if the Broadcasting Bill will be taken in this House before the end of the current session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the latitude you granted to Senators Manning and Fallon to air their views on the Order of Business in recent weeks concerning the implications of recent court cases on the question of separation of powers, perhaps you might consider inviting Senator Manning to make a statement on current Fine Gael policy on the matter in the light&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question raised by Senator Manning in regard to the legislation for the rest of the session, as I understand it, it is hoped to take the Insurance Bill, the Industrial Relations Bill, the National Treasury Management Agency Bill and the Broadcasting Bill which was raised by Senator Upton.  I understand there is a minor amendment to the Water Pollution Bill which was a Seanad Bill and which may come to us and there is also the Pensions Bill and the Shannon Navigation Bill.  Those Bills must be taken before the end of the session. Obviously we will have to meet three or four days each week and we will have to continue until 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock each night.  These are matters <Col N="1621" /> the Whips will decide tomorrow morning when they meet.</P>
      <P>I expect that reply deals with the query raised by Senator Ross when he asked what we will be discussing tomorrow; we will discuss the Criminal Justice Bill and the Health (Nursing Homes) Bill. Senator Upton asked about the Broadcasting Bill and I have given a reply on that.  Senator Norris's query was not a query in the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Gas Act, 1976 (Section 9) (Establishment of Subsidiaries) Order, 1990,</P>
      <P>copies of which Order in draft were laid before the House on 15th June, 1990.</P>
      <P>There is no time limit on speeches.  I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Order is to confer on Bord Gáis Éireann (BGE) powers, duties, rights and obligations in relation to the establishment of subsidiary companies or joint ventures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BGE was established under the Gas Act, 1976, with powers and function in relation to the transmission of gas and the development and maintenance of the natural gas supply grid on a commercial basis.  The involvement of the board in the gas utilities in Cork, Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford in the eighties and particularly the acquisition by BGE of <Col N="1622" /> the assets of the Dublin Gas Company (in receivership) meant that the board's role expanded from being concerned solely with transmission of natural gas to distribution also.  New legislation to cater for the changed circumstances was needed and as a result the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987 and a number of subsequent orders were enacted.</P>
    <P>The board has functioned very successfully under its existing legislation to such an extent that natural gas is now the dominant fuel in the industrial sector in areas served by the gas grid.  In the domestic sector also, sales are consistently increasing and indeed, 16,000 new central heating customers were connected up in 1989 alone, an increase of 33.3 per cent on the figure for the previous year.  The various gas utilities which, prior to the board's intervention, were in very serious financial difficulties have been turned around.  Their losses have been arrested and they are now almost in a break-even situation.</P>
    <P>The success of BGE has made it imperative that we secure the future of this vital national industry.  Our identified indigenous reserves of natural gas are obviously finite and are expected to run out in the next decade.  I made it a priority, therefore, since taking office, to examine the options open to us with a view to securing long-term gas supplies. Having examined a number of possibilities, the favoured option is by way of a sub-sea interconnector pipeline to Britain.  This option will of course, also allow for export of gas from Ireland, should circumstances allow.</P>
    <P>The Government decided that now is the best time to undertake the planning which would be necessary for a project of that scale.  A project management group made up of representatives of my Department and BGE was set up.  Discussions have been held with a number of British and Continental interests in the matter, and we will shortly make a decision on which supplier or suppliers to contract with for our gas supplies.  In the course of our negotiations to date, a number of parties have raised the possibility of a <Col N="1623" /> joint venture arrangement in the construction and operation of the proposed pipeline.  This is an option which could be worthy of serious consideration if a suitable proposal were to emerge. Accordingly, I am anxious that the way should be cleared now to enable BGE to act in the appropriate way should the occasion arise.  It may, for example, be preferable to deal with this eventuality by way of a subsidiary of BGE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but the copy of his address is not in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Tuigim go bhfuil sé ar a bhealach.  BGE's existing legislation does not address in any clear way the question of the board's entitlement to establish subsidiary companies or enter into joint venture arrangements.  In effect, the board already has four subsidiaries in the gas utility companies which it acquired that is Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Clonmel Gas Companies.  I feel it is now necessary to remove any doubt there might be regarding BGE's relationship with these companies, to address the question of control and accountability, and to pave the way for any future ventures in which the board may wish to be involved, particularly at this time in connection with the proposed inter-connector project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 of the Gas Act, 1976 provides for the making of an order to confer on the board, such functions, in relation to the provision of a supply of gas, as the Minister thinks proper.  Functions can include, in this instance, powers and obligations. Such an order must be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and requires their approval before it can be made by me.  The making of this order will confer on BGE the power to set up or participate in subsidiaries, and thus to enter into joint venture arrangements.  It will qualify this power, however, by imposing conditions under which these functions may be exercised, namely, that my approval, and that of the Minister for Finance, will be <Col N="1624" /> required before BGE can embark on such a venture.</P>
    <P>Similar provisions to these are included in section 2 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1988, and in section 2 of the Turf Development Bill, 1988, for the exercise of similar functions by ESB and Bord na Móna respectively.</P>
    <P>I am adopting this procedure because I feel it to be the most appropriate and expedient way of conferring the additional functions I have described on BGE and of ensuring the appropriate control.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion. I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the order.  I would also like to congratulate Bord Gáis Éireann on the work they have done, on the development that has taken place and on their far-seeing approach to their business.  I would like to refer to the foresight of the Government at the time in 1976 in setting up Bord Gáis Éireann.  The success of the board proves that that approach was farsighted. Developments have taken place and things have changed over the period; things have certainly changed in the State and semi-State areas.  It is necessary that as many as possible of our State and semi-State bodies should operate on a commercially viable basis and be able to survive in the commercial area.</P>
      <P>We welcome the expansion that Bord Gáis have made since their foundation in 1976 and we look forward to further expansion in that area.  In my own area of Limerick it is now available and we look forward to it being extended throughout the estuarial area to compliment the development the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about recently along the estuary from Limerick back as far as Foynes and Glin.  Bord Gáis Éireann could play a very important role in making that area very attractive and we look forward to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has said, natural gas is finite and there is a likelihood that over the next ten years further finds will be made.  We support the approach of the <Col N="1625" /> Government to establish a sub-sea inter-connector with Britain and the Continent. We are now moving towards 1992 and we must see ourselves in a European context.  We must be able to tap into the energy sources available from Europe and we must contribute to those if we have the energy supplies in our own country.  We must see ourselves in the context of Europe rather than in an insular context.</P>
    <P>We welcome the approach of the Government in setting up a plan and introducing the order to allow Bord Gáis Éireann to properly enter into the various arrangements to ensure that that development can take place.  We will also welcome any future developments for Bord Gáis Éireann in entering into other successful areas, joint ventures and other commercial involvements that will require subsidiary companies to operate semi-independently of the board.  Only yesterday at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies we heard of the successful approach of Bord na Móna to some of its subsidiary activities especially in the horticultural area.  These are areas into which we should encourage the entry of State and semi-State boards.  We must see State enterprise as being viable in the commercial context, operating successfully in the commercial area and exposed to the commercial pressures and opportunities the open market creates. They will thus be successful in their own right and contribute to the national economy.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister and assure him of the support of this party for the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on bringing this order before the Seanad.  It is a very brief order in one sense and yet in another I think it is one of very considerable significance. The use of gas for lighting purposes and as a fuel goes back quite a time; indeed, in this country we were to the forefront during the Victorian era in developing town gas.  We have since gone through a period during which gas <Col N="1626" /> became &mdash; at any rate in this country &mdash; a very neglected fuel.  Yet, it has enormous potential, enormous advantages, which I will come to in a moment.</P>
      <P>An Bord Gáis have done a very good job indeed since they have been established, but it has been very much a domestic operation and limited particularly to the major cities and to the establishment of a gas pipeline from Cork and from the Kinsale Head gas field tapping into that. However, the potential for gas is really quite enormous.  In our neighbouring island British Gas is probably one of the most successful of all companies in that country and certainly sees gas as having tremendous opportunity for development. To achieve that, both domestically and internationally, it is necessary that An Bord Gáis should have specific powers to set up subsidiaries and organise their business appropriately.  Perhaps that was not thought about very much when it was set up in 1976 but it is certainly becoming very relevant now because there is virtually an international network of natural gas pipelines.</P>
      <P>One of the main sources of natural gas for western Europe is certainly from the far east of Siberia and there are continuous gas lines from that.  The gas fields of the North Sea are at least as important as the enormous oil fields in the North Sea and there are such huge gas fields as Echo Fisk.  Here in the Irish Sea &mdash; on the United Kingdom side of it, unfortunately from our point of view &mdash; is the magnificent Morcambe Bay gas field.  There is very little doubt that other gas fields are likely to be discovered.  Indeed, within our own offshore hydrocarbon exploration the one successful discovery so far has indeed been the Kinsale field and there is some likelihood that there will be one or two other fields discovered and that any discoveries in the Celtic Sea area are perhaps as likely to be gas as oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The step which has been taken by the Government and the Minister of connecting up to the grid, which is now becoming a total European-Asiatic grid, is of enormous significance for us in that on the one hand it will guarantee supplies <Col N="1627" /> of fuel for us, but on the other hand, taking it in a very positive manner, it opens up to us a direct connection with the major gas consuming countries of western Europe.  That is an expanding market.  There is basically a shortage of energy.  Although the price of oil is very low at the moment, nobody has really found any significant new accumulations of oil since the 1970s oil crisis.  Yet, there is a steadily increasing demand for energy and that increasing demand can basically be only met from three sources.</P>
    <P>One is the use of coal, which is very inefficient and of course environmentally very damaging.  Here in Dublin we are getting away from the use of coal.  One is by having nuclear power stations and there is a dilemma there indeed.  Many environmentalists react immediately and almost automatically against nuclear power stations.  Yet, others could argue that, if we wish to protect the environment and avoid too much use of fossil fuels, one of the effective ways of doing so is to extend the number of nuclear power stations.</P>
    <P>The one alternative which is very effective is the use of natural gas.  We already have one major field &mdash; we may perhaps in due course have others &mdash; and it should be available for export.  In environmental terms it is a very satisfactory substance to use and I will quote some relevant figures.  As regards the greenhouse effect, the main cause of it is believed to be the production of nitrogen oxides and this comes mainly from coal and so on.  If you use natural gas the proportion of nitrogen oxides is much less.  If we compare it with other fossil fuels or other fuels in general, we may say that natural gas is 60 per cent as compared with that caused by coal, or 75 per cent as compared with that caused by oil.  It is an enormous saving and could be very important from an environmental point of view.  It is a very clean and efficient fuel.  We have argued for some time in this country about the use of gas for the production of electricity.  It may be of some interest that British Gas in its latest annual report is talking about using <Col N="1628" /> gas increasingly for the production of electricity.</P>
    <P>Another area, and the establishment of subsidiary companies could be very important here, is to enable An Bord Gáis to follow the path which the ESB and other Irish companies have followed successfully overseas.  There is no real reason, with the expertise which we are now building up with An Bord Gáis and the use of natural gas in this country, why that technology and the personnel associated with it should not make a contribution overseas.  It is one of the main areas of development of British Gas.  In fact, it has divided itself into three major areas of business activity.  One is domestic gas in the UK, one is gas exploration and development.  Unfortunately, in this country our gas company or others are not involved at all &mdash; yet, at any rate &mdash; in exploration and development, although under the 1976 Act An Bord Gáis is entitled to be.</P>
    <P>The third area of business management for British Gas is what it calls global gas. Effectively, that is exporting expertise by British Gas to companies overseas, to cities overseas that want to bring in gas plants, to industrial companies that wish to use natural gas.  I think there could be a major area of opportunity and development here for Irish experts in the gas industry to contribute their technology, teaching and help to many of the countries overseas where gas, and certainly natural gas, is only beginning to be used as a source of energy.  It is certainly a source of energy that will be used increasingly in the future and I think the Minister is very much to be congratulated on the brief but crucial order which he has brought before the Seanad today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As my party's junior spokesperson on Energy I, too, would like to formally welcome this order.  In particular I would like to be associated with the Minister's congratulations to Bord Gáis Éireann on their success to date.  I note he stated that natural gas is now the dominant fuel in the industrial sector.  He also pointed out that in the domestic sector sales are consistently <Col N="1629" /> increasing and that 16,000 new central heating customers were connected in 1989 alone, an increase of over 33 per cent.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Senator Conroy mentioned the smog problem in Dublin and in particular the problems caused by the burning of coal for domestic purposes.  This huge increase in the consumption of natural gas is to be very much welcomed and Bord Gáis Éireann are to be congratulated on their consistent promotion of their product which benefits us all, particularly in the Dublin area having regard to the smog problem.  I would also like to congratulate the Government in general, through the Minister, on the great strides that are being made at last to tackle the smog problem and also to congratulate them on their work in promoting natural gas.</P>
      <P>As Senators know, the purpose of this order is to allow Bord Gáis Éireann to establish subsidiary companies and also to get involved in joint venture arrangements. I understand that the specific purpose of this order is to allow Bord Gáis Éireann to get involved in a sub-sea inter-connector pipeline to Britain.  That has been outlined by the Minister.  I would like to congratulate him and his Department on this imaginative step.  It is a fairly simple order and yet it has far-reaching consequences.</P>
      <P>As we approach 1992 we are very conscious of the fact that we can become isolated as a country in many respects and none more so that on the question of energy.  This is preparing for the future and is also securing our future energy supplies, particularly in relation to gas. It is important that we become tied into the European energy system.  As a nuclear-free country we should be very conscious of further entanglements with the energy question in the European context. I know the Minister is very much aware of that issue.  It is something about which we will have to be vigilant over the coming years.</P>
      <P>I welcome this order.  It has far reaching consequences and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, want to join with other Members of the House in welcoming this order.  I congratulate the Minister, his Department and Bord Gáis on the tremendous work they have done, particularly in this city.  Although I am a rural representative, most people in Ireland recognise that it was a major job to make gas safe for users in the city. While there has been inconvenience for the Dublin people, it was very necessary work.  That has now been achieved.  The use of gas is very important to city dwellers, and we recognise it as an important source of energy and wealth to the nation.</P>
      <P>The possibility of piping gas between here and Britain is to be welcomed.  I believe that a link pipe is most necessary. When the Cold War was at its height there was a very important gas link between Holland and Europe and the Soviet Union.  The world sources of energy have to be looked at in that context. I am pleased, therefore, that Ireland is not going to be isolated.</P>
      <P>I represent a part of the country that has no hope or prospect of ever being connected to the national gas grid.  The people and the public representatives in the west of Ireland are most concerned about this.  While we are pleased about the development of gas and about the gas finds, it is very hard for people in the west of Ireland not to be concerned if they are not compensated in some other way.</P>
      <P>Natural gas is a very cheap, clean form of energy.  Other speakers have identified its importance for horticulture, for the heating of glasshouses and all of those areas.  As a result, the west of Ireland, and particularly my county, are at a serious disadvantage.  While on the one hand we totally support and welcome these developments in gas, on the other hand we have to highlight our concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that when funding was being sought at European level a map was produced showing the proposed gas developments in this country.  The map showed the pipleline covering the whole of the south &mdash; Clonmel, Waterford, Cork, Kinsale &mdash; going on to Dublin and eventually to Belfast.  It stopped short of Belfast.  This was produced at the EC in <Col N="1631" /> support of a case for funding.  That map also showed a link to Monaghan, Cavan, Sligo and Donegal.  That was the basis of the case put forward to the EC for funding.  I am saddened, and so are many other public representatives, that that gas pipeline link is no longer a proposition. It is no longer on the map.  Many people in my area have asked; was the map produced only to support the funding application?  Was there ever a serious intention to bring a pipeline from Drogheda and Dundalk to Monaghan, Cavan, Sligo and Donegal?  Are there alternatives to compensate those disadvantaged areas for the lack of this cheap source of energy or are the benefits of this cheap energy to be confined to the part of the country that is already best off and certainly could not be classified as disadvantaged?  These are vital and important questions.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to cherish all the children of the nation equally, I would challenge that we cherish all the areas and the regions of the nation equally.  If we have an important source of energy I want to see the benefits accruing from it distributed nationally.  I do not want to see people who have been disadvantaged for centuries being more disadvantaged by the fact that they cannot benefit from natural gas.</P>
    <P>Whether it supports industry or provides home heating, there are many advantages that natural gas brings to a region.  I hope that the search for natural gas will continue and that we will have more finds.  However, I am concerned at the lack of planning to include part of this island.  I strongly support the continuation of negotiations to extend the gas pipeline and the importance of bringing a gas pipeline to Belfast, if it is economically possible.  I am mindful of the fact that it has to be economically possible.  I hope that when they are planning to extend the grid, first to Britain and automatically to the rest of Europe, that no part of this island will be excluded.  That is very important.  I urge the Minister not to form the impression that the people in the west of Ireland, in areas such as Sligo, <Col N="1632" /> Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal, are unaware of the potential of having natural gas.  We are very much aware of it and our interest in it will not disappear.  If there are proposals for further funding from the EC, we will continue to highlight the fact that the benefits of natural gas are not being extended to the people in the west of Ireland.  It would be negligent of me if I were not to make that point.</P>
    <P>While I am pleased at the reorganisation of the Bord Gáis Éireann, I am one of a number of people who will continue to express our concern.  I hope the Minister responds to the points I raised and that he will provide today some hope for those who are concerned that they are being left out of this very important development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few brief comments and to welcome the order.  It is important.  Natural gas is a vital source of fuel in our economy at present.  We have other sources of fuel &mdash; peat, coal and oil but natural gas is definitely the cleanest fuel of the lot. Great progress has been made in its development since Bord Gáis was established. The Kinsale Head gas field is a tremendous boost to our economy and to our fuel system.  Gas can be supplied for domestic use, industrial use and many other functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this order is to enable Bord Gáis Éireann to lend money, upon such terms and conditions as it may determine, to a subsidiary company, to guarantee, in such form and manner and on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, the due payment by a company of the principle of any moneys, including moneys in a currency other than the currency of the State, borrowed by the company, or the payment of interest in such moneys or both the repayment of the principle and the payment of interest on any such guarantee, which may include a guarantee of payment of incidental expenses arising in connection with such borrowings and may be a guarantee of payment of a promissory note made by <Col N="1633" /> the company or a bill of exchange drawn by or accepted by the company.</P>
    <P>It is important that this condition be in the order to ensure that subsidiary companies, which are doing great work in their respective areas, are adequately financed.  The Cork Gas Company deals with the distribution of gas.  There is also the Limerick Gas Company, the Clonmel Gas Company, the City of Waterford Gas Company and Natural Gas Finance Limited.  I agree with Senator McGowan that it is important that the gas pipe line from the Kinsale Head gas field be extended to Cork, Mitchelstown and then on to Limerick and then from Waterford and Dublin to Dundalk.  At the time of the construction of this gas pipe line, many farmers were disappointed that it was going through some of their land, but I am sure when they see the benefit of that they will realise it is a worthwhile project.</P>
    <P>On the map I have in front of me there is a big void in the midlands and the west back to the Minister's own area of Galway and onto the Sligo-Leitrim areas. The gas pipeline should be extended to those areas.  Gas is an important source of fuel and as we have native gas every effort should be made to utilise it to its full.  I welcome the order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to say how pleased I am at the welcome given by parties on all sides here to his order.  I am also pleased the Senators fully recognise the significance of what we are doing here today and the opportunity that will obviously open up for the Irish consumer, for Irish industry, upon completion and commissioning of this pipeline which will give us access to the European gas grid and in that way guarantee security of supplies at the European prices and eliminate any possible inequalities in energy costs which might otherwise arise.  It is a very significant measure by the Government to commit themselves to the construction of a gas pipeline connecting Ireland to Britain.  We know that Britain will be connected to the European network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the EC Energy Council, working in <Col N="1634" /> preparation for the establisment of the Internal Market by 1992, significant proposals are on the table to guarantee rights of transit through number countries' networks for gas pipelines and electricity grids.  At the recent Energy Council meeting on 21 May, the directive on electricity transit has been adopted, which is a very significant step, I believe it is only a matter of time until a similar gas transit directive will also be passed which would guarantee access to the European-wide gas network.</P>
    <P>Gas is a very clean fuel in comparison with the other fuels in general use in this country.  The Government have made a major commitment to gas because of the environmental considerations.  Our own reserves, as I have indicated, are finite. It is prudent of us to plan now for continuity of supply into the future in order to give the assurance to those who are major gas customers at present that there will continue to be a supply of gas even in the event of failure to find additional reserves in the Irish offshore.  However, the existing gas fields are expected to last another decade.  We have that window space within which to make these arrangements, and that is why we are proceeding now with the proposals we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to inform the Seanad that the European Commission recently announced a funding package &mdash; the Regen Initiative &mdash; under which 300 million ECUs will be made available for energy networks projects in several countries, including the proposed natural gas inter-connector pipeline between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The level of aid for particular projects has not been set, but the amount allocated for the programme gives cause for optimism here that ample funds will be available for the Ireland-UK project.</P>
    <P>The cost of the proposed inter-connector, including compression facilities, is estimated at between £100 million and £200 million.  That will depend on the route and the pipe sizes that are finally chosen.  Four possibly supply routes are under investigation at present.  One is Barrow in Furness to North County <Col N="1635" /> Dublin, the second is Blackpool and Barnes to North County Dublin, the third is Anglesea in North Wales to North County Dublin and the fourth route is also under consideration now, that is, a possible route from southern Scotland to North County Dublin.  This fourth route has arisen because of the great interest being shown by the Northern Ireland authorities in a possible extension from this pipeline to bring gas supplies into the Six Counties.  However, the final choice of route will depend on the choice of supplier, the terms of the supply agreement and the attitude of British Gas, through whose network gas for Ireland will be transported across the United Kingdom.  A sub-sea survey will be required before a decision on the technical feasibility of each route is taken. These surveys will commence in July this year.  In the meantime, negotiations are proceeding with prospective suppliers with a view to choosing one or an appropriate combination for a supply contract.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan and other Senators have referred to possible extensions to the national gas grid in this country and I am pleased the Senator said &ldquo;provided it is economically viable&rdquo;.  An Bord Gáis will be pleased at all times to consider extensions of the gas pipeline where it is seen to be economically viable for them to do so.</P>
    <P>The previous proposals included the laying of a pipeline not just from the Kinsale Gas Head to Dublin but a continuation of that pipeline to Dundalk.  At that time it was intended it would be continued across the Border to give a supply to the Six Counties.  That project did not proceed.  Now that we have renewed interest on the part of the Six Counties authorities there is a possibility that a supply to the Six Counties would be by way of an extension of the pipeline from Dundalk to the Six Counties area.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their welcome for this project and this order.</P>

      <P>Bovine Disease (Levies) Regulations, 1990,</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I say it is a special pleasure for me to be back in this House where I started some 25 years ago.  I am always appreciative of the role of Seanad Éireann and I look forward to having a constructive debate on this important issue.</P>
      <P>The proposed regulations are being made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979.  Their purpose is to secure an increased financial contribution towards the cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the expenditure is devoted to the TB eradication scheme which has been in operation since 1954.  Despite the expenditure of enormous amounts of public money, commensurate results have not been achieved.  The scheme has stalled at various points down through the years.  Therefore, in 1988 the Government embarked on a new initiative.</P>
      <P>ERAD was established by the Government with the objective of planning and implementing a vigorous four-year programme to accelerate the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis.  The Government undertook to maintain their financial commitment to the running costs of the eradication schemes at £31.58 million and to maintain bovine diseases levies at £22 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That commitment of maintaining that level of funding is a unique commitment in the whole programme of public expenditure. Senators will be aware of the Government public expenditure strategy. In areas of great sensitivity to many Members of the Oireachtas and the public whether it is health, social welfare, <Col N="1637" /> justice and education there have been reductions.  There is one exception and that is this area because we wanted to put an end to the stop-go experience of recent years.  In fact, we have gone further, we have increased the contribution, and that is what this motion is about today.</P>
    <P>This was a unique commitment at the time given the overriding need to restore order to our public finances.  The basis of the financing was that the farming community and the Government were to fund the running costs in a ratio of roughly 2:1 and when administration costs were taken into account the ratio worked out at 50:50.  Both the Government contribution and the rates of disease levies were increased in 1989 over and above the commitment given to provide for increased rates of grants to farmers for reactors.  Apart from the financial commitment the other significant aspect was the direct involvement of the various interests involved, the veterinary profession, the farmers and the marts through the ERAD board.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment ERAD has strengthened the eradication programme through a series of measures and many of the changes, it must be said, have been suggested by the farmer and veterinary representatives on the board.  It implemented a more intensive and sharply focused programme in 1989 involving a full round of testing of the national herd together with special measures aimed at high risk herds.  In all, about 12.5 million animal tests were carried out.  The success of this programme can be seen in the increase of almost 50 per cent in the number of reactors identified and removed from 29,700 to 43,400.  A reactor collection service has also been put in place.</P>
    <P>The programme is being further strengthened in 1990 through a series of measures aimed at remedying the weaknesses identified in 1989.  A full brucellosis round is being carried out this year with the aim of eliminating the remaining pockets of that disease.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the Government have reviewed the situation on these schemes, <Col N="1638" /> including the financial position and certain operational aspects.  A number of issues have come under scrutiny.  One such issue is the pre-movement test.  It is widely recognised that the existing 120 day pre-movement test is contributing virtually nothing to the eradication effort and that this had to be changed.  The recommendation from ERAD was a two month, two stop test under which animals which have passed a test within the previous 60 days would be allowed to be moved within seven days of sale. However, I am considering a refinement that strikes a fair balance between effective pre-movement control and avoiding undue disruption of trade.</P>
    <P>Another issue that has come up for discussion is the role of wildlife.  I recognise that this issue is highly emotive and people tend to have definite views one way or the other.  The Government have agreed to a scientific survey and badger programme in two major blackspot areas.  This, together with the normal snaring of badgers for survey purposes under licence, will enable a comprehensive programme on the badget to be put into operation.</P>
    <P>A number of other recommendations have come from the ERAD board which I have accepted.</P>
    <P>The period of restriction in the case of multiple infective herds is to be extended to three clear tests, the final two of which to be at 90 day intervals.  The procedures for derestriction of herds have been significantly tightened up, including thorough disinfection of farm holdings before derestriction.  I regard these as sensible changes bearing in mind that the object of the exercise is to identify reactors, lock-up infection and lift restrictions only when it is absolutely safe to do so.</P>
    <P>Reactor compensation has always been a thorny issue.  It and veterinary fees account for the biggest bulk of expenditure under the scheme.  Rates of compensation have been adjusted upwards and downwards and I have accepted the principle that the rates should be kept in line with market trends.  What has happened recently is that the board of <Col N="1639" /> ERAD has recommended that the categories and rates of reactor grants will be readjusted so as to keep them in line with market trends.</P>
    <P>The most immediate difficulty facing ERAD is a financial one.  While it is too early in the year to have a firm picture of the number of reactors which will be identified in 1990, it is clear that this number will exceed the annual number envisaged when ERAD was established and on which the funding provided at that time was based.  Additional funding will be required for 1990 and probably for 1991 also.  As of now ERAD, is facing a shortfall of £12/£13 million this year and, therefore, the programme could grind to a halt in the autumn.  The Government have given consideration to this matter and have decided that it should continue to support ERAD and to allow the programme to continue.  To do otherwise would be wasteful of earlier efforts and expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is reasonable that the taxpayer should be expected to meet the entire shortfall.  The Government have, therefore, decided to increase from 1 August 1990 the rates of bovine diseases levies from £6.90 to £7.90 per animal slaughtered or exported live and from 1.2p to 1.4p per gallon of milk received for processing, a modest increase in the context of the projected budget shortfall. It is estimated that the increases in the levies will yield additional revenue of over £1 million in 1990 and about £3.5 million in a full year.  Let me at this point underline that that reverses the established ratio of 2:1 in respect of contributions from the levies and from the Exchequer respectively.  What is now being proposed, as a measure of the serious commitment of this Government, is that in this year it will be reversed to a ratio of at least 6:1 in respect of contributions from the Government/Exchequer/taxpayer and from the levies.  That is certainly generous.  We have to bear in mind that we will want as early as possible to restore the normal pattern through the revenue from those increased levies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1640" /> The increase in the farmer contribution in 1990 will not be sufficient to maintain the 2:1 ratio to which I have already referred.  That is clearly so.  The new rates will, however, be maintained in force until this balance is restored.  In the circumstances, I think the Exchequer is being extremely generous.  Unless ERAD have adequate financial resources, all the other issues become academic.</P>
    <P>I recognise, of course, that all elements of the programme should operate to maximum effect especially given the levels of expenditure involved.  I am concerned that the quality of testing should be the most effective possible and I am pleased that ERAD have established a system to monitor the quality of testing as well as procedures to deal with cases where testing is not of the required standard. Furthermore, I have accepted a recommendation from the ERAD board that there should be an early detailed objective study of testing arrangements with a view to recommending appropriate improvements for the 1991 round, which is the most appropriate time for changes to be made.  In fact, it would not be possible to make radical changes of any kind during the currency of the current round and, therefore, the earliest and most appropriate time is the beginning of the next round in 1991.  Consideration is also being given to the establishment of a task force which would carry out a portion of the testing programme.</P>
    <P>A blood test would represent a major breakthrough the ERAD is associated with the most up-to-date international research in this area.  It is currently carrying out a research project on a blood test which has been developed in Australia.</P>
    <P>Computerised movement permit control is highly desirable, not just for ERAD but for other reasons and work has begun on such a project.  If this work had begun ten, 15, or 20 years ago we would all be in a better position than we are now.  If it had begun three or four years ago we would have much more effective and constant access to information. However, it began last year.  It is <Col N="1641" /> a formidable operation and undertaking but I am satisfied it is necessary.  It is an extremely expensive and complex project which cannot be put in place overnight. To Senators who might say it should be there now, I would say that I agree if it had been started years ago.  Meanwhile, I see no reason why farmers should not keep their own records which could facilitate this operation.</P>
    <P>It is opportune for me again to remind the House that enormous State funding has been provided for the eradication effort for a period well in excess of 30 years.  This Government have given ERAD guaranteed funding, it has also been given a free hand to devise programmes and I have accepted practically all the recommendations that have come from the ERAD board.  It is most disheartening in view of this commitment by the Government &mdash; and more specifically the taxpayer &mdash; to see the representatives of the veterinary profession and now the representatives of the IFA withdrawing from the board of ERAD.</P>
    <P>I would say to the veterinary profession that some form of quality control of testing is essential in the context of annual expenditure on veterinary fees in the order of £20 million.  Anything less is a disservice both to their profession and to those financing the scheme and to the farmers.  I would like to make it perfectly clear that the Government, and in reality the taxpayer, cannot be expected to underwrite the cost of these programmes indefinitely unless the full co-operation of the interests involved is forthcoming. The stark reality is that the national eradication effort has been undertaken to benefit the farming community.  There will have to be a realisation that whatever inconveniences are necessary will have to be accepted in the long-term interest of succeeding in the objective of disease eradication.</P>
    <P>Time is rapidly running out.  We are not now in 1960, 1970 or 1980; we are in 1990, less than three years before the Internal Market and the impact of the measures to implement the Single European Market from 1 January 1993 will have severe repercussions if the time left <Col N="1642" /> is not availed of greatly to reduce our levels of bovine tuberculosis.  ERAD was intended to be a partnership.  It was envisaged that the partners would take hard decisions.  If they were only being asked to take soft, easy decisions on every occasion, there would not have been a necessity for ERAD.  The Government have the responsibility for taking hard decisions when required and they have to stick to the task and complete the job. Walking out is an easy option.  In fact, it is not an option at all.</P>
    <P>We are long past the stage where we can afford the luxury of looking for scapegoats, of pointing the finger at someone else.  I would appeal to the interests involved to return to ERAD.  I would also like to disabuse farmers of the idea that they are doing the State or the Department a favour by co-operating with the scheme.  If they do not wish to co-operate &mdash; and I know there are very few who would even contemplate that &mdash; they will be doing themselves a disservice.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to draw the Members' attention to the recent EC Council decision setting the level of European Community financial participation for approved national disease eradication programmes in member states.  A request for such funding has already been made to the EC Commission.  I was very glad I was able to bring that about during our Presidency because of the significance of having for the first time a veterinary fund in place to deal with compensation for slaughter of diseased animals.</P>
    <P>However, it is stipulated that a national programme has to be prepared and approved by the EC Commission.  I am arranging to have this programme drawn up as a matter of urgency but, realistically, it is most unlikely that such funds will come on stream before the end of 1990.  If funds become available in 1991, and I intend to press very hard to secure them, then the disease levies can be reduced in line with the agreed ratio between farmer and Exchequer contribution which is the commitment I always gave when we were launching ERAD.  However, it has to be said that <Col N="1643" /> in that event the Commission will more than likely insist on specific conditions which we will have to meet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister arrived here he referred to the fact that he was happy to be back where his political career began some years ago.  I would like to welcome him here and wish him well but that is the extent of the co-operation I will be extending to him in relation to the matter before the House. In fact, I want to say now that I will be opposing this measure.  I will be opposing it as strenuously as I can and I will outline the reasons I feel I am justified in doing so.</P>
      <P>It is necessary for me to go back to the beginning, as it were, and to look at the background to this situation.  We are 35 or 36 years down the road now and we are over £1 billion down and we are down a road of failure.  I am disappointed with the content of the Minister's speech here this afternoon because what it conveys to me is that we are still pursuing the same old lines and with the same machinery that has resulted in the waste of 36 years and over £1 billion of taxpayers' and farming community money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has talked about January 1993 and our obligations in the EC at that stage.  Perhaps he should also have referred to the fact that the other countries of the EC have been successful in dealing with this problem and that we alone are the failures in this regard.  The <Col N="1644" /> Minister said he regretted the withdrawal of the IFA and the vets from ERAD. The withdrawal of both organisations has confirmed that there is no hope of achieving the results we all want to see achieved when we continue with methods that have been tried and have been shown to be failures.</P>
    <P>The experience we have had in the eradication of bovine TB for 36 years, as distinct from the eradication of brucellosis which I will deal with later, is that, taking everything into consideration, the £1 billion or more expenditure represents nothing other than a scandalous waste of public funds.</P>
    <P>There is a frightening implication in some of the points the Minister made here this evening.  There is still that myth being propagated that the responsibility for failure belongs to the herdowners. From my knowledge of the scene, and I believe it is a knowledge shared by many people in public life who are familiar with the situation, there is no farmer or herdowner who will do anything other than co-operate to the fullest possible extent, in eliminating the disease from his herd or ensuring its prevention.  The myth has been propagated that the farmers have been solely responsible for the continuation of bovine TB.  As far as I am concerned, the responsibility rests elsewhere.  It rests squarely on those who over the years organised, controlled and administered the scheme.</P>
    <P>There is another disappointment arising from the Minister's speech that the concentration here is on testing cattle. That has been the action that has been pursued since the very beginning in the scheme.  Little or no effort has been put into establishing the sources of infection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>No effort at epidemiology at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>No worthwhile effort has been put into establishing the source of infection.  Therefore, for 36 years and for £1 billion the concentration has been on testing.  We are still prepared to continue down the same road and we are still refusing to admit failure.  We are still refusing <Col N="1645" /> to place the responsibility where it rightly belongs.</P>
      <P>As I have said, to my knowledge, every single herdowner will take every possible step open to them to prevent the disease or to eliminate it but they are doing it with little or no support by way of research or advice.  The herdowner is the only player in this whole game who carries the responsibility, incurs the penalty and suffers the consequences.</P>
      <P>I wish now to refer to brucellosis in livestock and to the manner in which it was successfully dealt with.  In fact, within a few years the disease was brought under control.  What were the reasons?  I am not in a position to give a definitive answer but I would assume it was because samples were simply numbered, sent off to a lab, tested by some technicians, returned and in a very short period we had a successful outcome in the eradication of brucellosis. If brucellosis can be virtually eradicated in a comparatively short campaign why have we spent 36 years trying to eliminate bovine TB?  If the other agricultural countries of the EC can eliminate or reduce bovine TB in their herds to an acceptable level, what is the problem with Ireland?  I would suggest that the success of the brucellosis campaign alerted what I will describe unhesitatingly as vested interests to certain dangers that could arise were the successful elimination of bovine TB to be achieved over a corresponding timespan.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he would like to disabuse farmers of the idea that they are doing the State or the Department a favour by co-operating in the scheme.  He said that if they do not wish to co-operate, they are doing themselves a disservice.  I have said that I know of no farmer who is not prepared, and who has not been prepared over the years, to give full and total co-operation but I believe their patience has come to an end.  I believe that the withdrawl of both the veterinary profession and the IFA from the board of ERAD is a clear signal that this scheme is on the point of collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke about certain vested interests. Perhaps a more correct definition would <Col N="1646" /> be the dependants on this scheme.  Perhaps the Minister when replying would break down that £1 billion plus that has been spent over the past 36 years and let us know where it went to.  Who are the dependants?  They are, first of all, an army of bureaucrats and administrators who administer the scheme.  They are the meat factories.  Let us look at the situation in the meat factories.  The Minister gave a figure of the number of reactors taken out last year.  He said that the success of the scheme can be seen from an increase of almost 50 per cent of the number of reactors identified and removed, that is, from 29,700 to 43,400.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be 60,000.  He did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not.  Neither did he indicate that when these so-called reactors were examined at factory level only four out of ten proved to be reactors. Therefore, 60 per cent of the total number of so-called reactors that went into the meat plants were clean cattle; the farmer was paid a reactor price for them.  The factories were able to utilise this meat in the normal way and when it was passed on, whether to intervention or perhaps on to the shops in this city it was not passed on at the price of reactor meat.  It was passed on at the value of normal meat.  In relation to the 40 per cent, or the four out of ten, animals shown up as reactors.  I was told by a vet from the Minister's Department that the part of the carcass affected was removed but the rest went on the market as normal edible meat.  When I raised a query with regard to the safety of this meat, the answer was that there was no danger provided it was properly cooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I like mine rare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should be careful.  The meat factories depend substantially on the fund which is available under this scheme.  Of course, we cannot ignore the vets.  They, too, have an interest in the fund and the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as farm incomes are concerned, <Col N="1647" /> 1990, has been a disastrous year so far. Farm incomes are down under all the main headings; milk, beef, sheep, pigs and cereals and the Minister in a threatening mood today said he will hit them further.  I have listed the dependants but, perhaps we should include farmers as the fourth dependant on the funds of the scheme.  Then we can say that of the four groups I have listed only one will take a cut in income this year namely, the farmers.  I asked for a breakdown &mdash; if possible &mdash; of that £1 billion plus which was allocated over the past 36 years; where has it gone in the sectors I have mentioned?</P>
    <P>I now want to be parochial and to refer to the situation in my own county.  I take no pride in saying that I was involved, in my capacity as a manager of Clare Co-op Marts in the fifties, in spearheading a pilot scheme to eliminate bovine TB in County Clare and west of the Shannon. I worked in close co-operation with a number of senior veterinary people from the Department of Agriculture.  I admired their pioneering spirit in those years, the determination of the people involved in taking on the problem, to eradicate it from County Clare, from west of the Shannon, from the Shannon to the midlands and, finally, from Munster. The planning and commitment were good.  The co-operation from the farming community, which was part of my job to provide, was also highly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Clare marts were the first in the country to advertise TB-tested cattle for export and it was a successful enterprise at that time.  About two years after the scheme got underway, a blackspot &mdash; the Burren area of north Clare &mdash; was identified. In 1959 the then veterinary director in the Department of Agriculture came to the conclusion that it was necessary to get to the source of the disease as quickly as possible and he came up with the proposition that a manned research station would be set up in the Burren. That is when the problem started; the proposal was vigorously opposed and eventually smothered.  Many reasons were given but the real reason was the <Col N="1648" /> inconvenience it would cause to the veterinary and administrative staff who would have to man that station.  It was never provided and, 36 years later, the Burren is still a TB blackspot.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a couple of cases with which I am familiar &mdash; and there are countless others.  A member of my own family circle was involved at the beginning of this scheme.  In fact, it was the 16th herd in the county to be registered under the scheme.  In 1956 during the first test there were two reactors.  In spite of top-class management and a pedigree herd, in 1988, 32 years later, there were still two reactors.  There was no progress whatsoever.  I do not want to deal with the financial loss incurred there on two valuable pedigree animals but I want to refer to the total absence of research or investigation as to how the disease got into that farm as it is unusual in the sense that it is virtually an urban farm, surrounded by a golf course and housing. No cattle are within reach of the stock already there.  It is a self-contained farm and no animals are bought in.  Therefore, this was a typical case in which an investigation should have taken place to ascertain how the disease took hold but despite several requests, including one from me, there was no response.  There were visits from inspectors asking about the sale of cattle as if that mattered.</P>
    <P>I will move on to another example.  In Miltown Malbay a very good dairy farmer supplies milk to the creamery.  Since 1969 this man has had a restricted herd and no animals are bought in.  Time and time again he has requested that the source of his problem be established.  A feeble attempt was made to to do this and I will outline it to the Minister.  The testing procedure was taken over from his local vet and a Department vet was sent in. Three days later, tests showed there were reactors but no attempt was made to establish the cause of that man's problem. He has endured hardship and depression&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he check the quality of the vet's syringes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1649" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, I read that one should use disinfectant but this man has done everything within his power.  He has asked for advice from his own vet, from the Department and yet he has reactors after 22 years with a locked-up herd.  This scheme has been in operation for 36 years and has cost £1 billion.  Will the Minister tell us where we are going from here?  Does this man face a further 22 years of hardship?  Do the taxpayers and the farmers face a charge of another £1 billion?  Will we be in the same position in another 36 years because we insist in carrying on with a system that has been shown conclusively to be a total failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to a third case.  It concerns a farmer, or Mr. Willie Neylon, I do not know whether I am allowed to use people's names in the House here but this man has gone on public record about this and I am satisfied he will have no objection to me using his name.  He is involved in winterage farming in the Burren.  Let us look at winterage farming in the Burren which is unusual.  A farmer puts his cattle there in November, they need no hay or silage, they eat the grass, vegetation or whatever is there and are brought home in the spring.  Mr. Neylon was required 16 years ago under the regulations to test his cattle coming off the Burren.  He was taking them on to low land where they were to be fattened and sent to the factory.  He had reactors and his herd was restricted.  He fattened off his cattle and they were re-tested once or twice and the disease showed no further indication of spreading on his lowland farm.  He sold off all his cattle and wanted to restock his farm in the Burren.  He was advised to go back and disinfect it and he did so.  He went to the mart, bought totally clean cattle, all recently tested and out of clear herds and he put them on his winter farm.  Regulations required that he test them coming off it in the spring and he had more reactors.  For 15 years this merry-go-round went on.  He made representations to Senators, Deputies, Ministers and councillors in the county in an effort to establish the source of the <Col N="1650" /> infection on that farm but did not succeed. There was no interest in his problem. Yet, this man is expected, under this order, to contribute to what I described earlier as a scandalous waste of public funds.  For as long as the reliance remains on testing without establishing the source of the infection, it is a waste of time. However, Mr. Neylon has now got used to this and is cynical about it.  He has had the water sampled at his own expense and had cattle crushes installed.  Everything has been disinfected but he has not found the source of the infection.  He has done everything within his power and resources but the Minister's Department have done nothing to establish the source of the infection.</P>
    <P>Not too far from where I live, in the north-western side of Ennis in an area known as Shallee, Slaveen and Cragleigh there has been a major outbreak of disease in the past 18 months.  That was clear over the years.  It is a dairy farming area. In fact, a couple of herds have been wiped out.  I do not know what has been the source of the disease.  The herdowners do not know and the local DVO does not know.  I do not know whether they are trying to establish the cause but one thing that is known is that about two years ago a herd of wild goats arrived in the area.  In desperation farmers in the area captured some of the goats, had them tested and they were found to be reactors.  This has been brought to the attention of the Minister's Department but those wild goats still roam in that area and infection grows.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the area of Clooney, Carrahan and Quin in County Clare.  It lies between Dromoland Estate in New-market-on-Fergus and the forests in Tulla, County Clare.  It is a recognised track for deer moving between Dromoland Estate and the forests in Tulla. That has become a black sport area for TB.  I can, under the protection of the House, state that one or two of those deer were tested and found to be reactors. That information has been conveyed to the Minister's Department and I have been informed that the matter is being looked into.  What are the sources of <Col N="1651" /> infection?  Wildlife has been mentioned and badgers have been mentioned but as far as the depressed herd-owners in my county are concerned there is a growing feeling that wildlife whether it is deer, wild goats or badgers, is playing some role in spreading bovine TB.  The Minister's Department and ERAD have shirked their responsibilities in establishing the truth or otherwise of those allegations.  For as long as that attitude prevails, I cannot in conscience support the motion.</P>
    <P>The question of wildlife is a very emotive one but, perhaps, we can put it in context.  Are we saying that identifying the role of the badger in the spread of bovine TB, the role of the wild goat or the role of the deer in Dromoland is not important?  There is no doubt that the Minister or his colleagues at some stage in the past six months, when the VIPs were over from Europe, had the pleasure of showing them the wonderful herd of deer in Dromoland.  However they were not shown the desolation in the area of Carrahan, Clooney and Quin.  The subject of wildlife &mdash; it may be that wild goats and the Dromoland deer are included in that &mdash; is a delicate one.  That is one we have to be extremely cautious about; we could offend people or tread on people's corns by doing that.</P>

      <P>The point I was making is that this is such a delicate matter with the Minister, the Department and ERAD that they do not want to be seen to identify with creating the slightest doubt that wildlife or the goats or the deer could be responsible.  At the same time, they are all prepared to say that the <Col N="1652" /> unfortunate farm families are expendable. They have not got the guts or the courage to deal with this subject.</P>
      <P>I do not like closing on that note but we have to put everything in context.  It is unfortunate that I have to say that the chairman of the Irish Farmers' Association in County Clare, Michael O'Donoghue, has gone on public record&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not do that.  It appears that farming families are expendable but as far as some people are concerned wildlife, goats, deer and so on, are not expendable.  The gentleman I referred to has gone on public record is saying that seven suicides in the farming community in County Clare can be related to the ravages of the disease in their herds.  That frightening figure was given last March.  Therefore, while an army of bureaucrats and administrators go on from day to day getting a livelihood out of this, as do the veterinary surgeons, while the meat factories cream the scheme, and while that unfortunate situation is developing in my county can I, in reason, be expected to come in here and support the motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude on the wildlife issue. ERAD have stated that in east Offaly, where wildlife has been cleaned out, the incidence of bovine TB dropped from 27 per cent to 6 per cent in two years.  Yet, the Minister did not consider it worth his while to refer in depth either to research or the role of wildlife, goats or deer and <Col N="1653" /> he was quite prepared to leave that burden to the farmers.</P>
    <P>There has been a total loss of confidence by the farming community in this scheme.  It should be recognised that it is grinding to a halt after 36 years of failure, at a cost of £1 billion.  What can we expect now?  We are getting a re-run of the same old record.</P>

Unless research is carried out and the Minister and his Department stop blaming the herdowners we can look forward in 36 years from now in the year 2026, to a further loss of £1 billion or, perhaps £2 billion.  In view of the refusal to see the facts and the failure to face up to what is required in dealing with the scheme, I have no option but to reject the Minister's request.</P>

      <P>Many of the points highlighted by Senator Howard in relation to the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme could be applied equally to many parts of rural Ireland.  In spite of the fact that the scheme has been in operation for 34 or 36 years, one wonders why those instances are not noted and action taken to eliminate the problems that have been highlighted.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with any Minister who has to go into the Dáil or the Seanad seeking to increase levies such as we are being asked to do here.  As we all know, farming at present is going through a very trying period with cattle and sheep prices hitting rock bottom and the price of wool dropping to 25p. per pound.  Yet, the Minister has to come here seeking an increase in the levies for the elimination of bovine TB from our national herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In saying that, I want to congratulate the Minister and Minister O'Kennedy, in particular, because we have all been asking for positive action over the years to try to curb this disease.  Deputy O'Kennedy, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, did his best to try to come to grips with the problem.  He set up the board of ERAD, who were given a free hand to make recommendations and he accepted <Col N="1655" /> almost all of those put forward.  Veterinary surgeons, the IFA, the ICMSA and the Department are all involved in the board of ERAD and they have put forward those recommendations as the best way of tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>In the past year the Government have provided a sizeable amount of money to tackle this disease; in fact, £48 million has been provided, £25 million from levies and £23 million from the Exchequer.  However, not all of that money has been allocated to the farming community.  Much of it has been allocated for other purposes.  Only £17 million will go to farmers by way of reactor payments.  Veterinary surgeon's fees amount to £19 million and there are a number of other headings which make up the figure of £48 million.</P>
    <P>The debate this evening gives us an opportunity to review the activities of the board that was set up some time ago.  We know that if any positive progress is to be made certain things have to be done because, as Senator Howard has pointed out, this has gone on for a number of years and we do not seem to be making any great progress.  We are fast approaching 1993 and if we do not take the bull by the horns at this stage, in 1993 we will be told what to do because our cattle will not be accepted in mainland Europe unless we can prove that they are free of this disease.  We all realise importance of our national herd to the economy of this country, we all realise the number of jobs that are created in the meat industry, we all realise the income from sales of beef and cattle abroad.  We want to preserve that at all costs.</P>
    <P>A number of recommendations have been made to the Minister by the board of ERAD and one was that a 60 day pre-movement test with two movements only be proposed.  This would mean that where a herdowner moves animals to a mart the blue cards will be stamped and if he fails to sell the animals on that day then he will have the option to sell within seven days or re-test the animals.  That means that if I bring my cattle to a mart today and I do not sell them I am stuck <Col N="1656" /> with them or else I have to get them re-tested after the seventh day expires.  I think that is the most critical part of this proposal, especially as far as the west of Ireland is concerned, because the west does not offer farmers the same convenience as regards marts as applies in the other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>If I bring my cattle to the mart today I know I have to sell them because if I bring them back home I am going to have to re-test them.  I cannot bring them out to the mart again after seven days without having them re-tested.  When word gets round to the dealers, and they are the people who can pass the word around very quickly, it means that the farmer who has to sell his cattle is at a great disadvantage because, more or less, he has to take the price that is being offered or else bring the cattle back and have them re-tested again.  As far as the farmers in the west of Ireland are concerned, I certainly would not want to see that proposal put into effect.</P>
    <P>Instead of a 60 day pre-movement test, we could have a 45 day test?  I would recommend this to the Minister.  I believe he should forget about this idea of testing after seven days because I can see this as creating a dreadful problem for the small farmers in the west of Ireland.  I hope the Minister will be able to make some concession there and that he will be able to accept a 45 pre-movement test rather than the 60 day test proposed.  The question of wildlife has come up time and time again.  Badgers certainly have some connection with this disease.  In my own area in County Galway we had a very eminent veterinary surgeon who was testing in that area and he carried out some research into this problem in England. He is convinced that the badger is the cause of spreading this disease.  Any place where there is forestry and a large concentration of badgers there is a very high incidence of TB.  For that reason I would like the Department to redouble their efforts to check out this problem.  I would recommend that a survey be carried out to find out what is the position.  It is far better to eliminate the badger than to eliminate the farmer.  If the badger is not <Col N="1657" /> eliminated, then many farmers will be put out of business because no farmer can afford to carry this problem for too long and it has been going on for too long now.</P>
    <P>I regret to see the IFA withdrawing from the board of ERAD.  I think they should have remained there.  After all, they are the farmers' representatives on that board.  They should have remained and put the farmers' point of view and fought their case from within the board. There is very little point in asking us to fight the case for them.  They should have remained even if the going was tough. Maybe it is and they are not able to accept the proposals.  However, they would have had a far better chance of changing the regulations and making them more acceptable to the farmers from inside the board rather than from outside.</P>
    <P>The same would apply to the veterinary union.  Again, they have opted out and continue to oppose the basic changes which are necessary for the operation of the scheme, including the signing of form RS62 which was intended to give instructions to herdowners on the reasons for the occurrence of the TB outbreak and the preventive measures that could be followed to avoid further outbreaks.  I think that was a very reasonable request to the veterinary profession and I see no reason why they should not comply.  Take the case of an outbreak of disease among the general public.  Surely the doctor would be prepared to give advice and help and suggest certain preventive measures to eliminate the disease.  I see no reason why the veterinary profession could not do the same.  I have stated previously in this House farmers could not be blamed for believing that the veterinary profession had an interest in keeping this disease going and, of course, I was castigated afterwards by the veterinary union.  It looks that way to many farmers.  Certainly the veterinary profession's actions here bears out that view.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some uniformity in the method of testing because we all know that farmers seem to select certain vets whom they think it is easier to get by than others.  That should not happen. <Col N="1658" /> There should be uniformity between all the vets.  There is no reason why one should be put forward as being easier to get by than another.  If people are interested in getting rid of the disease, both the farmers and the vets should be prepared to tackle this problem seriously and there should be no difference between one vet and another.  They should be all working towards eliminating the disease as fast as they can and saving the taxpayer the amount of money that is being spent on this disease.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go on and on.  We have highlighted these problems every year and we are getting tired of doing that because we would like to see some progress being made in the eradication of bovine TB.  I do not think that farmers would mind paying the increased levies if they thought there was some light at the end of the tunnel.  I am very hopeful that the board of ERAD will eventually come to grips with the problem and that they will show the way forward in getting rid of this disease which is such a threat to our national herd.  The national herd is very important for our economy and we all know how many people depend on it.  For that reason everything should be done to try to eliminate this disease once and for all.  If we do not do so before 1993, then somebody else will do it for us.</P>
    <P>I hate at this point accepting any increase in levies but I believe the Minister would not come in here this evening looking for an increase unless it was absolutely necessary.  On the recommendation I made, that instead of a 60 day pre-movement test he should go for a 45 day, I think we could go along with that.  I certainly would be very reluctant to accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that should be said about this problem is that it is a complex one.  If it was not a complex one it would not be around for the length of time it has existed.  Some of the attitudes which people have taken here this afternoon suggest to me that they are under the impression it is a simple matter but it is not.  That is the first thing we should be clear on.  It is a multifactorial problem to which a whole series of differing factors contribute.  They vary and become more important or less important in differing sets of circumstances.  That is the reality and trying to simplify it into this group or that group being responsible for the problem is not at all addressing the full picture.</P>
      <P>The history of this is that from about 1964 onwards the levels of reactors stabilised at around something like 40,000 reactors per year, having declined from huge numbers of reactors of the order of 120,000 to 160,000 in the early years of the eradication programmes.  From 1964 to 1975 there was a fairly general downward trend and then subsequent to that the number, as I understand it, has levelled out.  In the south of the country there was something of a decline in the incidence of TB and in the north of the country there was, as it were, a corresponding increase so that the situation has tended to remain pretty stable at around 40,000 reactors per year over this period.  That level of reactors in the national herd is unacceptable and part of the reason that was put forward for the failure to solve that problem was the fact that the money was being given on a stop-go basis.  Thus, the establishment of ERAD was seen as one way of getting around that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the situation, there are three basic factors which seem to be important in the continuation of TB as a problem.  The first one is the failure to take out all the reactors.  The second one <Col N="1660" /> is the failure to lock up infection and the third one is the failure to control the geographical spread of TB.  That is very much related to the fact that here there is enormous to-ing and fro-ing and movement of animals between farms.  There are of the order of 12 million cattle movements each year in this country.  If you were into the business of spreading infection you could not think of a better way of setting about it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the failure to take out all the reactors, an enormous problem there is simply related to the test.  There are great difficulties and problems arising from the lack of accuracy of the test. Here is one area in which we in this country have been extremely negligent, to the extent that we have not set about a systematic approach to developing new tests.  Happily, that has changed over the past few years and I am very pleased to see that there is now vigorous research going ahead in the area of trying to develop a blood test.  It is going on in the veterinary college where I spend some of my time when I am not around here and I am very encouraged by what I see going on there.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think anything like enough is being done; I do not think enough money is being spent or, for that matter, that the effort which is made is coherent enough.  I would like to see the research effort involving people who have expertise in these areas outside of the veterinary college.  I refer in particular to people in University College, Galway who have a good track record in terms of developing diagnostic tests and so on.  The group led by Pat Fortune have quite a good track record in doing that and I would like to see those types of groups involved in the research effort.  I would also like to see anyone else in the country who has a contribution to make in this area row in to try to get this test up and going because it is very important.</P>
    <P>The second thing which is very important is that we maximise international co-operation in this area.  Quite a bit of work is going on overseas in America and so on.  I know there is ongoing contact <Col N="1661" /> between the people in the veterinary college and the US but there is need for more money to be put into developing and enhancing those contacts by getting Irish people over to America and getting Americans and other people to this country so that we can develop that test. If we do that it will have two great advantages for us.  First, it will help to solve our own problem.  Secondly, it will allow us to develop products and the technology which we can sell to other countries and make quite significant profits for the country and also generate for ourselves an increased technological capacity and an increased credibility in those areas. For those reasons I am very anxious to see more money put into highly focused research with the objective of developing a test which will be reliable, accurate and convenient to use.</P>
    <P>The test which is at present in use has a whole series of difficulties attached to it.  For example, there are variables such as if the animal happens to be on certain types of drugs it will interfere with the proper functioning of the test.  If there are certain types of infections in the animal it will interfere with the proper functioning of the test.  There are also whole aspects of this test which never seem to have been researched at all.  For example, is the same amount of the tuberculin delivered by the syringes that are used?  Are they adequately accurate?  There are all those elementary things which as far as I am aware have never been studied to the necessary extent.</P>
    <P>The second problem is the one of failure to lock up infection.  There is a very high level of breakdowns and people simply buy in and sell off infected animals.  That is a very touchy point with farmers in relation to the extent to which herds are locked up and it creates great economic difficulties for them.  At the same time it is absolutely imperative if we are going to succeed that we get our act together there and do what needs to be done even if it is politically quite difficult, and I do not want to minimise the difficulties which that would create.</P>
    <P>The third problem is one to which I have already alluded and that is the whole <Col N="1662" /> business of the geographical spread of the disease.  Here, it is very important that we should establish a system to make it possible to trace each animal and everywhere it has been from the day it was born to the day it is slaughtered or dies. That is very important so that if you run into infections and so on you will be able to see where the animals from the infected herd have gone, possibly taking the infection with them so that you can then go along and check those herds and set about sorting out the problem.  As things now exist, there is a great deal to be desired in how we handle that problem. Again, I fully understand that implementing the solution to that problem can create many difficulties.</P>
    <P>In relation to what is being done I am happy to quote from the Kennedy Memorial lecture by Dr. Liam Downey, the director of ERAD, who made two broad suggestions.  First, he suggested that as a country, we have become, obsessed with keeping the herds clear, and the term &ldquo;obsessed&rdquo; is his, not mine.  I feel we are a good distance away from being obsessed with keeping our herds clear. The second thing he suggested was that the ultimate responsibility for this whole business rests with farmers.  I find a lot that I would agree with in both those suggestions.  It would be very useful if they were taken up and acted upon.</P>
    <P>In many cases we have a lackadaisical enough attitude to infection and disinfection and the whole principle of cleanliness. In that area there is considerable scope for improving the amount of advice and the manner in which it is given to farmers.  There is great need to raise the consciousness and awareness of farmers in relation to the need to have the highest possible standards of hygiene and the need to disinfect their farms. Farmers should also be aware of the fact that in some cases total disinfection of areas is simply not a possibility.</P>
    <P>It is also very important that farmers should be alerted to the ease with which this disease can be spread.  I believe the tuberculin microbe can travel as far as eight kilometres in aerosols which arise from slurry which is being spread on <Col N="1663" /> farms.  I do not know whether most farmers would be aware of that.  I hope I am wrong but I do not think they would. That shows the importance of ensuring that when slurry is put out on farms people should know what they are about, that they know the risks and set about minimising them.  That is one example that illustrates the importance of a comprehensive advisory programme for farmers and for people who deal with animals.</P>
    <P>The implications of not getting the act together and sorting this problem out are enormous.  There is the knock-on effects with the Internal Market, etc.  Again, that is going to create tremendous difficulties. One thing that would be important here is if we could get some system where herds are guaranteed to be free of this disease and a special emphasis should be put on the disease history of herds and that should become a factor when animals are being bought from herds.  In other words, when you buy an animal from a herdowner it would be very useful to know the history of that herd in relation to the incidence of disease, etc. That would be an important item of information. If they were aware of a low incidence of the disease.  I hope it would also become a determining factor in the amount of money which would be paid to farmers.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be opposing the motion primarily because of the fact that the board of ERAD now seems to be in disarray.  It is certainly difficult to justify putting more money into an organisation where people are walking away from it as in the case of the veterinary representatives and more recently the farmer representatives not being prepared to stay with the board of ERAD.  That certainly has to be a very important factor in determining our position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this afternoon this House, rightly, acknowledged and celebrated the achievements of our football team and what they did in Italy as being one of the greatest achievements in sport in this country.  In this instance of bovine <Col N="1664" /> TB and disease eradication we are talking about one of the greatest failures in the history of the State.  Certainly in an agricultural sense it is undoubtedly one of the greatest failures in our history that for over 30 years and having spent £1 billion we still have not eradicated the disease. At this stage taxpayers are quite rightly entitled to ask what value they have got for the money they have invested over the years.  I do not think any Government of whatever shade can wash their hands and say they were not in some way responsible for the situation which we are faced with here today.</P>
      <P>I welcome the tone of the Minister's speech.  I hope that what he has said today will come to fruition and that, once and for all, we can get this disease under control because the consequences for us are extremely serious.  With the Single Market confronting us, what are we going to do on 1 January, 1993 when bovine disease is still in our midst and when we have to sell into that market?  We are already confronted with the situation where red meat consumption is falling. We all know the effects of Bovine Spongifom Encephalopathy, or &ldquo;mad cow&rdquo; disease as it is more commonly known, on the market for beef.  In some ways we are confronted with a similar situation here.  I can imagine our failure to eradicate bovine TB being used as a major marketing block on Irish beef when we come to export it after January 1993.  Indeed, I am sure it will be used even in the interim by our competitors to cast a finger at us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a situation over the years where we have the farmers blaming the vets and the Department, we have the vets blaming the Department and the farmers, we have the Department blaming the farmers and the vets.  We have this circular round of movement where everybody blames everybody else, the deficiencies of the scheme are pointed to by everybody but there does not seem to be a genuine will on the part of all involved to eradicate this disease.  I share what Senator Upton said in relation to the multifactorial nature of the problem, that each element within the problem is <Col N="1665" /> singled out, highlighted and all the other elements which contribute to the continuation of bovine tuberculosis are forgotten about.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard mentioned earlier the number of people who are depending on the scheme and I would share some of his views in relation to that.  I think any group of people who get £20 million from operating the scheme, as do the vets, obviously have a vested interest in seeing that the <i>status quo</i> is maintained and that we continue along the line we have been going despite their best endeavours.  I do not doubt the integrity of the majority of the veterinary profession but I do say there are members of that profession who have been less than ethical in the way they have conducted themselves over the years.  I would also say that if they were to look dispassionately at the matter they would still see that there is an income for them in relation to advising farmers on how they might prevent the disease and on how we deal with the disease, etc. There is a market there for that and I do not think that eradicating the disease would automatically remove vets from what has been a lucrative source of income.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to me earlier today &mdash; I do not know whether it is correct or not and I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that there are veterinary practitioners in this country who are qualified in veterinary medicine and who know nothing more than testing.  If they were asked by a farmer to come out and deliver a difficult calf they would not be able to do so.  I hope that is not true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That was suggested to me this afternoon.  I share the sentiments expressed by Senator Howard in relation to the whole bureaucratic process which supports this scheme and in relation to the meat factories and what their vested interest might be.  I would also say it is not right that the Irish Farmers Association and the vets withdraw from the board of ERAD.  I do not regard that as being the right thing to do.  The way you <Col N="1666" /> achieve change is to stay in the body of which you are a member, put your points as vigorously as you can, hope they carry it and at the end of the day you can at least arrive at some acceptable compromise which can be accepted across the board.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I realise that asking farmers at the moment for an extra £1 a head and an extra 0.2p a gallon to fund this scheme at this moment is not something they can be easily asked to do given the way farm incomes are going at the moment.  It may seem churlish to say that £1 a head is much money.  It is not much money but in relation to the profit or loss which people are making from beef it is quite a considerable amount of money.  I believe that any organisation or any group of people who contribute £25 million a year to the operation of a scheme and are now being asked to contribute more are entitled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for dealing with the matter so impartially, Sir.  I should like to say that this Bill is double-edged in that it gives to ICC a considerable advantage in its activities in the markets but it also gives a considerable disadvantage. The advantage which it gives <Col N="1672" /> to ICC is that it gives it a Government guarantee over its borrowings.  That is a formal guarantee which is not given to its competitors and which is not given to other merchant banks.  It is not given to other financial institutions.  It may be said, and it has been said, that other financial institutions are given some sort of implicit Government guarantee, because the Government cannot afford to allow a major bank, or a minor bank, to go under or to get itself into financial trouble.  The situation with Allied Irish Banks when the Life Assurance Company was in serious trouble is an indication that this is in fact the case, although it is not the case in law.</P>
      <P>This Bill asks us &mdash; and I am in favour of the Bill &mdash; to give a vote of confidence not only to ICC, which is the principal reason the Bill should go through, but also to give ICC an advantage over its competitors by giving it a Government guarantee over further borrowings.  It contains also a major disadvantage to ICC in that there is a limit on its borrowing which is set by statute.  That is a disadvantage to ICC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to compare it with the case of Bord na Móna, which we only found out about yesterday.  One of the principal reasons for the position in which Bord na Móna finds itself is because it has its loans guaranteed by the Government.  There is no comparison in terms of profitability and success.  ICC is a very successful company and has been since its inception in 1933.  Bord na Móna is a company in serious trouble.  But both companies are working with the great advantage of having the benefit of a Government guarantee.  One of the lessons of this Bill and of the Bord na Móna Bill is that a Government guarantee is inappropriate, in commercial terms, to those companies in trouble and it is inappropriate for companies who are doing well because it restricts them.  Bord na Móna would not be in such appalling straits if it had not got a Government guarantee on its borrowings at the moment, because it could not have borrowed as much money as it has.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but I think it is £140 million now, <Col N="1673" /> which is a massive amount of money, and there is very little chance of that money coming back and the Government being repaid.  It does not seem likely that in the near future this money will be repaid.</P>
    <P>ICC, similarly, would be a different type of institution if the Government did not guarantee its borrowings.  It would probably be a bigger and, in commercial terms, a more successful institution.  In this case you will find that Government guarantee acts as a restriction.  You will find that ICC does not compete with other merchant banks and other financial institutions on exactly the same terms because it cannot expand as fast as it wants to or freely in the open market. What this Bill shows is not muddled thinking about the ICC, but it shows a piecemeal attitude to the ICC.  It shows a piecemeal attitude as to whether we should have a State bank at all.  We have not really tackled this problem.</P>
    <P>The justification for this Bill &mdash; and it solves a short-term problem &mdash; is that ICC need this urgently.  They need more money and they need to be able to borrow more money urgently, so we have to pass legislation to give them this additional facility.  That is bad way to run a State bank.  It is a bad way to run the ACC or the ICC.  The last Bill of this sort expanding the borrowing of the ICC was in 1983, but perhaps £200 million will prove a very small amount in the short term and the Minister will have to come back to us again in the next five or six years, or maybe in three years, to ask for this facility to be extended again.  I do not think this is the way we should be approaching ICC.  We should be asking why have we got a State bank, what should a State bank be doing, and are we doing the right thing with ICC, instead of saying they are doing well, they suddenly need some more money, they are very close to their limit and we do not know how close is their limit.</P>
    <P>Should we actually change the status of the State bank and the function of the State bank?  Should we remove the Government guarantee and let that State bank go out into the open market and free it from the shackles of being attached <Col N="1674" /> to the State?  The ICC was set up as a development bank for small manufacturing industry in the 1930s when the country needed that very badly.  It gave subsidies, or hidden subsidies, and subsidised loans to manufacturing industry to nurture them in their infancy.  This is what it was about and it was a very necessary institution at the time.</P>
    <P>Since that time &mdash; and 1933 is a long time ago &mdash; the bank has transformed itself into being a financial institution which competes with other merchant banks and insurance companies in nearly all the areas in which they perform as well.  Yet, ICC is subject to the same basic constraints that it was subject to in 1933 &mdash; in other words, that when it has to do certain things it has to come back to the Government to ask permission and an Act of the Oireachtas has to go through.</P>
    <P>I can understand why the Minister is now asking us to do that.  He is doing it because he has to.  But the Minister's speech does not show any vision of what the Government feel is the future of ICC. When an institution like that transforms itself into something completely different from what it was when it was set up, it is time we did not just accept it and restrain it: we should give it a blessing and say what we expect from a State bank.  We are, after all, the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is exactly the sort of thing about which a Government should come before us and say that they think ICC should now be recognised as something different.  It should be recognised as very competent in its field but it should not have the same restraints attached to it as it had in 1933, which is basically the situation.  They are on a larger scale than they were then, but it is time the Government said: let us have a look at ICC, let us allow it to compete on an equal footing with all the other merchant banks.  That it what it is not doing.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government tackled the thorny question of privatising ICC, that they recognised the anomaly in which it is now working, the strange capitalist world in which a State bank is now operating and that the Government simply <Col N="1675" /> said: look, it is inappropriate at this stage to have a State owned body operating in a private sector.  That is something which has not been addressed in this debate.  It has not been addressed, as far as I know, by the Government in a debate for a very long time.  It is a very sensible basic question, particularly as the Government have taken a particular attitude to Irish Life, that it should be privatised.</P>
    <P>It is a logical consequence of the privatisation of Irish Life that both State banks, the ICC and the ACC, should be privatised as well.  I do not know the reasons for the privatisation of Irish Life, but I assume one of the principal reasons is that the Government want to get their hands on the loot, and that is a very good reason.  The Government feel the money can be used for something more profitable, that it can be put into something more profitable than what is is being used for at the moment, and that they can get a very good price.</P>
    <P>What should be done with ICC and ACC, and ICC in particular because ICC is a very valuable company with assets of several hundred millions?  I think it is time the Government said: we are prepared to privatise it; there are institutions out there willing to buy, willing to invest in shares in ICC, to buy the Government's shares in ICC, and the money will be used for infrastructure in education, health, in all those Departments where it is lacking so badly, where people have been crying out for help for the past four or five years. It should be used as capital investment, not as current investment, in those Departments.  I see no problem in doing that.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Government having assets like ICC unless they are going to get a superb dividend or are going to sell them and use the money for something better from which the people of this country can benefit.  Let us say they sold off ICC for several hundred million pounds.  There are all sorts of things that could be done with that money.  Some of the national debt, which is a major problem, could be paid off. Education and health matters could be <Col N="1676" /> tackled.  Basics like that could be dealt with.  I hope it is not proposed to hold back on this from some sort of strange ideological reason, which I do not think is any longer appropriate in the present context.  It is only a matter of transferring capital from one place to another and using it more efficiently and more humanely.  ICC could happily float on the stock market.  It would be bought up by several private, public and institutional investors and the Government would benefit.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister says he has asked for consultants to look at ICC, which he did in his original speech &mdash; although he did not tell us really what was their brief &mdash; that privatisation is in that brief.  I hope that everything is in that brief.  I hope specifically that he has asked that privatisation be in that brief, because it is utterly logical that ICC should certainly be the next candidate for privatisation after Irish Life.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer again to the consultants. I mentioned this in passing the last time, but it was before a different Minister, which is fairly typical of this House at the moment.  If the Minister has called in consultants to look at ICC I sometimes wonder &mdash; first perhaps he could tell us who the consultants are, although that is not very important &mdash; why neither he nor any Minister has asked the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies to tackle this problem for him.  That joint committee, which some people quite often do not recognise, writes reports on semi-State bodies.  It examines them and its terms of reference would be utterly appropriate for this mission I am talking about.  The committee has the power and the money to call in consultants to look at semi-State bodies like ICC which company has not been examined or reported on by that committee since 1980.  I have been privileged to be a member of that committee for some time.  Although ICC has been mentioned as a candidate several times, for some reason it has actually escaped the scrutiny of that committee for the last few years, mainly due, I think, to electoral interruptions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> The Minister might consider using that committee, because that is what it is there for &mdash; to examine State-sponsored bodies.  It is there to make recommendations about how the State-sponsored bodies are performing and specifically to make recommendations about their future.  Maybe it is a reflection of our general opinion of that and other committees that it obviously was not even considered.</P>
    <P>What I am objecting to really is duplication. There is duplication here as there was on Irish Life and on the B &amp; I. That joint committee is sitting with 11 Members of the Oireachtas, all competent people, many interested in that area and chosen for that area, many can read balance sheets, many would have a contribution to make on that, who could call in a consultant and go through it with them.  The Minister would have the advantage then of not just having consultants issuing a report, but he would have consultants for whom money is provided and Members of the Oireachtas of all parties making an input into the future of ICC and considering the area of privatisation. It is only a suggestion but it is one we should be considering not only in this case but in many other cases as well.</P>
    <P>I know the Fóir Teoranta Bill is in no way connected to this Bill.  I wonder &mdash; and it has not been explained to us in any detail nor has the detail of the portfolio being handed to Fóir Teoranta been explained to us in any detail by the Minister in his opening speech &mdash; why the ICC has been handed the portfolio of loans rather than the investments of Fóir Teoranta.  It appears <i>prima facie,</i> but it is very difficult to get information on this, that ICC has been handed some sort of a poison chalice.  The fact that Fóir Teoranta has had to close meant that somebody had to pick up the management of the loans and the liabilities of Fóir Teoranta, and I wonder why it was handed to ICC, why it was not handed out to tender, or why it was not competed for.  It appears that this is part of the double life of a State bank, that whereas it is competing in the market place, and presumably the Fóir Teoranta portfolio <Col N="1678" /> will be consolidated in the ICC results at some stage, its results will be affected by picking up the Fóir Teoranta portfolio.  I would have thought that that should be run separately as it is wound up.  It is possibly unfair on ICC to be handed the responsibility of that State body which was obviously not running its affairs as efficiently or as effectively as ICC was doing.</P>
    <P>The issue of Directors on State-sponsored bodies is something which constantly interests me.  On this Bill I would consider making a special plea about the appointment of directors to ICC: it is, that the appointment of directors by Government, by successive Governments of all sides, on party political and partisan basis is not in the interests of the companies involved.  It is no secret that men and women are appointed to these bodies on the basis of party affiliation. They are often competent in the fields in which they excel, and are often appropriate to the bodies to which they are appointed, but they are appointed very often, not exclusively, on the basis of their loyalty and service to a party.  It is not in the interest of any State body that the party affiliation of anybody appointed to that board should ever be considered as a factor.  It is especially not in the interests of ICC or Irish Life that this should be the case because ICC and Irish Life are investing in Government stocks, and Irish Life is the biggest investor in Government stocks in the country.  It seems that directors who are appointed by Government and the Minister for Finance &mdash; I am not saying it happens &mdash; will be vulnerable and sensitive to particular pressures from Government at a particular time.  It means that the performance of both of these financial institutions is constrained and restricted by virtue of the fact that these people come up for re-election and their re-election is determined by Government.  It means that their independence is constantly in question.</P>
    <P>I would like to see, especially in the area of finance, an independent body set up to appoint directors to these two boards and to the ACC board.  It seems <Col N="1679" /> unfair on the directors themselves that their re-election should be subject to the scrutiny of Government and the whim of Government.  We had the recent case of Mr. Willis in Irish Life; we have had cases of very strange decisions not to reappoint directors and they can only have been made on the basis of political loyalities and political affiliations.  In the case of ICC it would be an extremely appropriate gesture for Government to say: &ldquo;No, this particular institution is handling large sums of money.  It is also investing, buying and selling Government stocks.  It is utterly wrong that Government should appoint those people who run that company.&rdquo; I would ask the Minister to consider &mdash; no more than that &mdash; that the long-enduring custom of Governments appointing to semi-State bodies people who are conspicuous by their service to the party in power be ended.</P>
    <P>On a specific basis &mdash; this is more appropriate for Committee Stage &mdash; is there any particular reason we are being asked to expand the potential borrowings of ICC at the moment?  Is it simply in the normal course of business that this is happening, or is it about to indulge in some particular expansion which the Minister could tell us about, or is it just that it is expanding fast?  I can see from what it is doing in the area of finance and in the areas the other financial institutions have entered, that it would be expensive, that they would need to borrow more money.  I wonder if there is anything specific happening concerning an extra £200 million that we should know about? For how long does the Minister anticipate that this particular borrowing facility will do?  In other words, does the Minister think he will be back here in three or four years asking for more, or does he think that the consultants will have reported by then and will have given him an answer, and ICC will have been transformed?  As we are being asked to extend this facility, maybe we could be given some breakdown of what this facility is for.</P>
    <P>In the context of 1992 and beyond, in the context of the modern financial world where big is best and big will win, ICC <Col N="1680" /> will be competing with the bigger banks in many markets and in many areas where it does not have any very obvious niche and where Ireland will be open in financial terms to many foreign banks &mdash; it has attracted many already &mdash; would the Minister consider not imposing restrictions on its growth and size when we will probably have German, French and maybe American, Japanese &mdash; the Government have tried to attract Japanese banks &mdash; coming in here who could drown the ICC in terms of size and therefore in terms of competitive edge because size will be the advantage in terms of competitive edge when the barriers are opened?  Would the Minister not consider giving ICC its head &mdash; the ICC is full of very good, very efficient people who have done an extremely good job in their field &mdash; so that it can compete in the financial world with the world's larger banks?  It is unfair to restrict it in this way and to tell it to go out and do the job which other people are working without restrictions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to put on record how much I regret the insult that was meted out to the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk here this afternoon by way of innuendo that he was not competent to take this Bill.  I find that ironic given that Senator Ross in his speech indicated that on the Committee of Public Accounts there were many people who were versatile in various areas.  A suggestion that the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, had not the competence to take this Bill can only be expected from the bombastic nature of the Senator, which is apparent here this afternoon. When Senator Ross commenced his speech I felt he was hoping that ICC would be less successful than it is but as he proceeded &mdash; I must give him credit &mdash; he showed that he recognises that the Industrial Credit Company has been an asset to small and medium-sized industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for an increase in the amount of borrowing which may be undertaken by ICC.  It is timely in that <Col N="1681" /> the company reached its £800 million borrowing limit which was set in the 1983 Amendment Act.  The proposed increase to £1,000 million is modest given the growth in recent years and obviously this increase will make it necessary for the company to revise its own articles of association as specified in section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to note the profitability of the company over the years.  I go back to 1988 when profits were £3.4 million before tax: in 1989, £5 million before tax and in 1990, £10 million, which included an exceptional item of approximately £5 million resulting from the sale of Gardiner House.  In the current year profits for the half year up to the end of April have gone to £3.1 million compared with £1.9 million for the corresponding period last year.</P>
    <P>Senators should be aware that the original purpose in setting up the Industrial Credit Company was to bring Irish companies to the Stock Exchange.  This it did right up to the 1960s, but with the advent of foreign banks and the Stock Exchange itself, it adopted a role of being a lender to small and medium-sized indigenous companies.  It is particularly significant that its lending is based entirely with Irish companies.</P>
    <P>Particularly noticeable also is the diversification of the company: it provides a wide range of financial services comparable to the services provided by the private sector financial institutions, such as, corporate finance and planning, venture capital funding, stock market flotation, pension funds, management of foreign exchange, a full range of trade finance services, deposit loan facilities, hire purchase, leasing facilities and leasing business in the Financial Services Centre.  The company has already established itself as a successful innovative financial services group and its transition from being primarily a development bank to a commercially orientated entity is well under way.</P>
    <P>In terms of employment within the company it has now on its books a total of 361 persons, 20 of whom are located <Col N="1682" /> in Cork, ten in Limerick and 330 in headquarters in Dublin.  Also significant is the fact that at a time of regression in the economy it has steadily been adding ten to 12 graduates each year to its staff.  This trend, given the Bill before us, hopefully, will continue for the future.</P>
    <P>Now that the company has reached its borrowing limit it must stand to reason that if it is to continue lending more money it must be allowed to borrow more money elsewhere.  If it can go to the marketplace to borrow it will obviously increase its customer base.  The result, as we have seen over the years in terms of this company, has been increased profitability. Considering the profitability over the last number of years, my estimate, given the current trend, is that if there is a £6 million profit to the Minister this year, it stands to reason that the increase in profit could be as high as £8 million or £9 million as a result of the implementations of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Ross, I am particularly pleased, but for a different reason, that the Minister has decided to bring in the consultancy group.  The attachment to job creation of the ICC has never been measured.  The special task force that ICC has set up within its ranks to cater particularly for the hotel, catering and the Irish leisure industry, is a step in the right direction given the dramatic growth that has taken place in that sector over the last number of years and the projected growth of 15 per cent in tourism over the next five years.</P>
    <P>Given the amount of money ICC is lending to small, medium-sized indigenous industry, it should quantify the jobs that are created as a result.  That would make most interesting reading and would provide a clear indication of the major impact ICC is having in that area.  Given past experience it is reasonable to assume that extra lending and borrowing will generate more profit which in turn will create a greater return to the Exchequer which, I expect, would be in the region of £8 million or £9 million in this and ensuring years.</P>
    <P>We must welcome the fact that the Minister has decided to invite proposals <Col N="1683" /> from a number of financial advisory bodies.  Whether these financial groups advise the Minister to privatise ICC is something for which we will have to await a Government decision.  It is clear that ICC has been making the case that the present statutory restrictions on lending activities should be removed and its capital base strengthened by the State as main shareholder to enable it to develop its full potential.  The increased borrowing and guarantee proposed in the Bill would be sufficient to meet ICC's requirements over the next few years.  I want to emphasise that the Minister said that these groups would report to him, and that the report would be available in the short term.  It can be taken that the extra £200 million now being given will meet the ICC's requirements for the next two to three years by which time I have no doubt that this progressive Government will have decided their attitude to ICC.</P>
    <P>I realise that there are other speakers, on this side of the House in particular who want to come in.  I have no hesitation in recommending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on the Bill.  I wish to indicate at the beginning that I am supportive of the Bill.  I want to make a few general observations and to pay tribute to the Industrial Credit Corporation for the contribution it has made in a number of areas, in industry, tourism, services and so on.  It is of interest that the limit set in 1983 is now almost exceeded.  This reflects the valuable contribution made by the ICC and the continuing need for its services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assets have shown a growth of £340 million since 1983.  Profitability performance, as has been mentioned by other speakers, has been very satisfactory. The ICC has made a valuable contribution to Irish business more particularly to small and medium-sized business.  It has provided, again for the small and medium size business an option in business development that was not supported by the associated banks.  The principal reason I wanted to contribute to the <Col N="1684" /> debate was to make that point.  There are many small operations who have been helped by the ICC at crucial points in their development.  Had they been dependent on the associated banks they would not be in existence today.  Many of them have grown to be highly successful and the contribution of the ICC in this regard is not as fully understood as it should be.  Its value in this field has not been fully recognised.</P>
    <P>A point was made by another speaker in the earlier discussion about the balance of equity investment and loans.  The original intention was that the ICC should become shareholders in Irish business. Rather than consider the imbalance that has been suggested exists between loans and equity investment, we should have regard to the situation that existed.  The demand has been there for loans, development capital and working capital. The money was provided and the enterprises involved were successful.  It is, again, an indication that the banking system was inadequate.  The demand existed and fortunately the ICC were there to meet it in very many cases.  The State bank filled the gap to the advantage of many enterprises.  By 1992 or perhaps 1993 Irish business will have the option of dealing with European banks for finances and the ICC will have an opportunity to resume its original primary objective as shareholders in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I look forward to 1993 and a welcome freedom and access for Irish business, big, medium and small, to European banks.  I repeat something I said earlier, that I do not believe the Irish banking system has served Irish business as well as it should.  There was always an overemphasis on security as against the potential of a particular enterprise.  There was the awful emphasis on security, often involving mortgaging of the family home, without full consideration being given to the potential of the proposed operation. This was a failure on the part of the Irish banking system.  In ignoring the potential of many projects that have proved to be successful the banking system did very little to promote economic development.</P>
    <P>There is another side to the coin.  Small <Col N="1685" /> and medium-sized businesses in recent years have experienced outright opposition by the associated banks and by Irish banks to arranging capital or borrowings in foreign currencies.  It has been well recognised that foreign currencies represented a cheaper source of finance for many businesses.  I am aware of a number of businesses that had the experience of trying to arrange foreign currency loans through the banking system here only to be met with outright opposition.  On the other hand, the ICC undertook that function willingly and, in fact, provided that type of finance where the Irish banking system were not prepared to undertake it.  As a result, many small and medium-sized businesses have been successful. That factor alone in some cases represented the difference between success and failure.</P>
    <P>While the scheme many change in 1992-93, over the next two years there will be a continuing and worthwhile role for the Industrial Credit Corporation.  In so far as the Bill will enable it to fulfil that role, I am quite happy to support it. I am satisfied that the Industrial Credit Corporation has served, the Irish business community well, particularly small and medium sized businesses and that it will be needed over the next few years.  I am happy to support the Bill.  I would be very reluctant to do anything that would impede the ICC.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the Industrial Credit Corporation may well be one of the State companies that have been identified as being suitable for privatisation but that it is an issue for another day.  We will deal with it when it arises.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance made it clear he did not envisage a rescue operation for the ICC in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to welcome and support the Bill.</P>

      <P>Tugann sé an-phléisiúir dom labhairt ar an mBille seo agus, ar ndoigh, is ábhar an-tábhachtach é, go mór-mhór do lucht gnóthaí na tíre.  Tá obair nach beag déanta ag an ICC le gnóthaí a chothú agus a chur chun cinn. Is dóigh liom, i dteannta leis an IDA, SFADCo, agus an Údarás, go bhfuil tábhacht faoi leith leis na hinstitiúidí a dhíríonn ar fhorbairt eacnamaíochta le pacáiste iomlán a chur ar fáil don phobal le gur feidir leo a gcuid gnóthaí a chur ar aghaidh.</P>
      <P>The ICC has played, and continues to play, a very fundamental role in the development of our economy. It has developed, as the Minister said in his speech, new services to meet new requirements.  However, I would like to take the opportunity to spell out some of the problems facing small businesses in relation to the provision of capital.  Most lending agencies work on the basis that they will fund fixed assets reasonably readily and also, where there is good security, will give further borrowings against working capital based on mortgage debentures or similar type security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that these questions of the provision of grants, of seed capital and of borrowing be tackled in a co-ordinated way.  Many people of my acquaintance who are trying to set up in business find that the biggest problem they face with the financial institutions and the State grant-aiding authorities, is that they lack ready seed capital of their own.  Most of those institutions work on a ratio basis where they would be talking about £1 from the lending agency, £1 from the promoter and £1 from the grant-giving agency or something of that proportion. Therefore, if there is a lack of <Col N="1687" /> funds subsequently it has a knock-on effect in the help that one gets either from the lending agencies or the development authority.  I have found, in my experience, that this lack of ready cash is one of the greatest inhibitors of development, particularly small-scale development, indigenous development, throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the second problem.  It is usually fairly easy to get capital for fixed assets but I know of several cases where the provision of working capital, because of security problems, posed major problems.  What tends to happen when businesses start off with cash flow problems is that they tend to operate for cash flow rather than taking a long-term perspective and, therefore, taking the most profitable route.  They tend to be forced to sell under a system that provides a ready cash flow.  To my way of thinking, this is one of the fundamental problems we have not yet addressed when we look at industrial policy.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the idea behind the business expansion scheme when it was initiated was to try to provide capital for risk ventures.  However, experience indicates that since the number of people applying for BES funds was greater than the supply of money, basically investors had a choice and they were taking the low risk or the up and running project. There was not a source of ready finance for projects that had not yet got off the ground.  We will have to examine ways to get a pool of seed capital together.  This seed capital should be available to people with proven track records who would be accepted as having good business ideas and good business acumen.</P>
    <P>These people, if they were given seed capital, would have to accept that they would have to have the services of an adviser available to them from the agency that provides the seed capital so that they run their business according to good business practices.  Again, there is the problem of people with good technical skills and good marketing ideas not having the experience from a financial point of view <Col N="1688" /> of running a business.  Whether this role should be entrusted in some way or other to an agency like the ICC is a matter for debate but it is very important that this problem be addressed.  We should have a fund of seed capital available for likely entrepreneurs who have viable ideas.  In my experience, the main criteria &mdash; and I accept the need for security and borrowing &mdash; are the basic sense and viability of projects and then the character and ability of the person to carry the projects through.  The third most important requirement in that case is security because a bank will only call in security as a last resort.  A bank's business is to lend money and get repaid in the normal way and for that to happen, it is most important that the ideas and funding are right and that the person can promote the idea.</P>
    <P>It was announced in the budget that an agreement had been reached that £200 million would be provided this year by the banks for new business.  I suggest that the ICC should be drawn in and involved in this venture.  As regards the attraction of funds, the ICC is a State bank and I suggest that it might be possible to look at ways for people on social welfare to invest money in it.  I suggested that money invested for productive purposes and put into the productive economy, might not be assessed to a limit of, say, £5,000 for an individual for social welfare purposes.  In this way particularly in rural areas, we would be able to put an end, on the one hand, to what is called the &ldquo;mattress&rdquo; economy and, on the other hand, get capital that would be reused to develop enterprise in our communities.</P>
    <P>We have to face the fact that &ldquo;mattress&rdquo; money, as it is called, is dead money.  Unless money is reused within the market to provide development, it is not doing any good for the community.</P>
    <P>My experience in the past year has been that by the development of a local enterprise on a private enterprise basis, surrounding the co-operative for which I work, between borrowings and investment by ordinary local people, we have achieved a total investment level of <Col N="1689" /> £250,000 between about six or eight people within one year.  However, to continue that type of development we need a system under which those people will have sources of reasonably priced finance.</P>
    <P>The normal experience is that through leasing and whatever, it is possible to get finance, but for the person starting off the cost of this finance is much higher than for the established business.  This puts new businesses, particularly indigenous businesses starting off from a small base, at a very serious cost disadvantage when it comes to the cost of money.  A major impediment to development is if one has to pay rates of interest in excess of 20 per cent for borrowing for assets. It puts one at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the established businesses who are getting rates which are a lot less.  That problem should be looked at.  The IDA, in looking at new methods of providing aid to businesses, should develop some system, either by interest subsidy or otherwise, under which borrowing could be made available at what would be equivalent to the AAA rate to businesses that they consider to have a reasonable chance of success.  In this way small businesses would not start off with very high borrowing expenses and would be given a reasonable competitive profile in the market.</P>
    <P>This question of the provision of finance to small businesses cannot be considered separate from IDA policy.  The two must work hand in hand.  The experience of many people is that when they go to the grant-aid authority and get grant sanction, they find that there is no connection between that and getting finance from the financial agencies.  That operation will have to stop.  It is very important that the total financial package of a company be discussed and that a total package is put together by consultation between the financial agencies, the grant giving authority and the promoter so that one part of the package is not provided without the second part being provided at the same time.  That will ensure that <Col N="1690" /> on day one there is enough money available to start off the business on a firm footing.</P>
    <P>I would like to commend the Bill to the House.  This extra facility to the ICC is very important.  I would like to praise the work they have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mian liom anois mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí uilig a labhair ar na mBille seo agus as ucht an tacaíocht agus an t-aontú a thug siad go léir don méid atá ar siúl ag an Rialtas sa Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators who have contributed to this debate.  In their contributions they have supported the general principles enshrined in the Bill.  I agree wholeheartedly that the ICC has contributed very well to the economic development of this State for over half a century.  The proposals in the Bill will add to its capacity to continue that good work.  I agree with Senator Fallon that the company has served the country well. There is no doubt, as the Senator said, but that it has helped many small and medium sized Irish businesses to expand and prosper over the years.  This point was reinforced by Senator Howard.</P>
      <P>It is important to appreciate that the Bill is essentially a &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; exercise in that it enables the company, whose borrowing is regulated by statute, to continue its ongoing business.  As I said at the outset, ICC is already very close to its statutory borrowing limit, and without the increase proposed in the Bill, the company's development would come to an abrupt halt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take up a point raised by Senator Ross.  He did not seem to understand why it was necessary to make this provision at this time.  The company had <Col N="1691" /> virtually reached its borrowing limits, and no less than about a month ago it was of the order of £785 million.  It can vary from day to day but that is how close it was on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The ICC has evolved from a development bank in the thirties and forties to a much more commercially orientated entity today.  It is constantly evolving and expanding its services in the light of changing needs in our economy.  It is a highly regarded and respected financial institution.</P>
    <P>Senators Doyle and Ross asked why should there be a limit at all on ICC's borrowings.  For as long as the company is owned by the State it is only right that there should be statutory control over its borrowings, as there has been since its inception.  These Senators also raised the question should ICC's borrowings be guaranteed.  Borrowings by the company have had the benefit of a State guarantee since 1958.  There are many depositors relying on the guarantee and, if it were withdrawn, the ramifications could be serious.  The cost of funds to ICC would also be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>It would hardly be feasible to think in terms of not guaranteeing new borrowings, including deposits, above the current limit of £800 million while existing borrowings have the benefit of a guarantee.  ICC is a bank and as such it is important that all of its depositors and lenders should be treated the same.</P>
    <P>I did not have the opportunity to hear Senator Doyle but, generally, she is fairly sensible but Senator Ross had a problem in deciding whether he would take the penalty or would go into goal to try to stop it.  He seemed on the one hand to say that ICC was at a disadvantage because its borrowings were only being raised by £200 million.  He said it had an advantage over all other banks at the same time.  The Senator would need to address this question in a way that would enable me to do justice to his contribution.</P>
    <P>In regard to State ownership of the ICC, it should be remembered that shares in the company were offered to <Col N="1692" /> the public on its floatation in 1933 but the Minister for Finance, as underwriter, took up most of the shares.  At the moment, no more than 770 shares, out of a total of 12 million, are held by private shareholders.  The ICC, however, still retains its Stock Exchange listing.  The founding legislation allows the Minister for Finance to dispose of his shares in the company as and when he thinks fit.  The original flotation was designed to facilitate private ownership of at least part of the shares in the company but, in the event, relatively few of the shares were taken up by the public.</P>
    <P>The Government have a pragmatic approach to the question of the ownership of the company and have an open mind in the matter.  If a State company, such as ICC, needs fresh funds, the competing demands on the Exchequer may act as an inhibitor to the provision of those funds.  This Government do not wish to prevent the desirable and worthwhile development and expansion of a successful State company such as the ICC.  Far from it, what we are doing is trying to make every effort to secure the future of the company on the best basis possible.  We have no preconceived notions on this question, and we will look at the options thrown up by the consultants and their recommendations in a balanced and objective manner, and with the best long-term interests of the company and its management and staff firmly in mind.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Senator Ross that there is no hidden agenda; nothing lurking in the background.  Every option will be looked at on the basis of what is the best way forward.</P>
    <P>As regard the consultants report on the ICC, the Department of Finance are still at the stage of assessing the various tenders that have been submitted.  The Minister for Finance hopes to make a decision in this regard very shortly.</P>
    <P>The consultants will be assessing the options open to the Minister in the light of the fact the ICC is going to be under pressure to increase its ratio of shareholders' funds to risk assets very substantially over the next few years.  There <Col N="1693" /> appears to be little alternative in reality to increasing shareholders' funds in the next year or two and the various ways in which that may be done will have to be assessed.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised the question of the take-over by ICC of the Fóir Teoranta portfolio.  ICC will be managing this portfolio on the same basis that it was managed by Fóir Teoranta, that is, in accordance with the contractual arrangements entered into by client firms with Fóir Teoranta.  Firms still owing money to Fóir Teoranta will not be at any disadvantage as compared with the previous position.  Fóir Teoranta has been closed for new business since February 1989 and the cases that the ICC will be taking over in due course are existing cases where Fóir Teoranta has already invested money by way of loans or equity investments &mdash; the ICC will not be a replacement State rescue agency for industrial concerns following the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta.  I would like the House to be clear on that point.</P>

      <P>The commercial viability of ICC will not be affected, certainly not adversely, by the new arrangement.  If anything, its commercial viability will be strengthened through the fee it will be paid for administering Fóir Teoranta's portfolio.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle referred to what she saw as a disproportionate allocation of its funds by the company as between loan finance and equity investment and that this was not in keeping with the principal objects as laid down in the 1933 Act. That Act envisaged that the predominant function of the company would be in the giving of credit, while also investing in equity-shares, debentures and so on. There is no departure from the fundamental principles enshrined in the original Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ICC has been involved in equity financing since its inception in 1933.  In fact, it has operated through a specialist equity division since November 1986.  Its <Col N="1694" /> basic strategy is to build up a solid portfolio, both of quoted and unquoted shares, with a view to ensuring a steady flow of profits each year.  This strategy has been successful through judicious management of the portfolio and an active policy of acquistions and disposals. As far as unquoted shares are concerned, investments are generally confined to profitable established companies with good growth prospects.</P>
    <P>Apart from Government paper, the value of investments at the last balance sheet date, 31 October 1989, was £25.5 million, £18 million a year earlier, compared with £4.1 million five years before that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross questioned why legislation is brought before the Oireachtas every so often to increase financial limits, as is proposed in the Bill.  He also mentioned the ACC.  He referred to this as &ldquo;piecemeal legislation&rdquo;.  I could not agree with this.  It has been deliberate policy of successive Governments for many years to increase limits only to an extent which will meet the requirements of State bodies for relatively short periods of three to five years.  This allows an opportunity for both Houses to debate the financial and general performance of State bodies at regular intervals.  This, I suggest, is very healthy in a democracy such as ours.</P>
    <P>Linkage between NADCorp and ICC was mentioned.  Clearly they have separate and distinct functions, the ICC being a commercial bank and NADCorp a venture capital institution.  I take the point that there should be liaison between the officials of the two organisations who may on occasion be involved in helping the same companies.  We can and will work on achieving better cohesion between the two organisations.</P>
    <P>We had a very solid workman contribution from Senator O'Keeffe.  I only hope that the Cork team on Sunday week will not perform as well when they take on Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Cuív referred to the lending policy to industries, particularly small businesses.  He made the point that the linkage between borrowing requirements <Col N="1695" /> and IDA policy should be centralised. Clearly, modern management in the IDA requires business plans to be prepared in advance of decisions in relation to grant-aid and that should deal with that matter. I take the point that seed capital can very often be a problem for small companies trying to get established.  It is something we will have to constantly review.</P>

      <P>The essence of the Bill, as the Minister said, is a bit of housekeeping to raise the borrowing limits as required by the ICC.  I would like to thank the Minister for answering most of the points I raised on Second Stage in his concluding remarks.  There are some aspects that are still far from clear and they pertain to section 1 and, to some extent, section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he will tell this House a little more about what he has in mind about reorganising of ICC which, reading between the lines and from what has not been said, is apparently upon us.  It is a shame that when this legislation is before us we cannot <Col N="1696" /> have a broader debate on the future role of the ICC, particularly in a barrier-free Europe from 1 January 1993 and, given that the ICC was established in the mid-thirties, in a very protectionist environment. The environment we are in could not be more different to the trading environment or the industrial environment that existed when the ICC was established, and justifiably so.  It has been a successful body over the years but we are in a totally different climate now. May I ask the Minister to be more generous with his thoughts in terms of what he is looking for from his financial advisers?  He stated that there would be little alternative but to raise the shareholders' funds in ICC.  We all feel there are new fields ahead and fairly major policy decisions about to be taken.</P>
    <P>On section 1 which effectively asks the ICC to continue as heretofore, albeit with the raised borrowing limit, will the Minister develop the views of the Government and their aspirations on this?  In both Houses this has been the main area of concern of many of the Members who have addressed this.  What is the future of a Government-run bank as we approach the barrier-free Europe and the Internal Market?  Is there a need for it at all?  That is a major policy decision.  When one grants to the board of ICC what they request in terms of proper investment to allow them to trade successfully in a very competitive financial environment one has to consider what the new EC directives will bring upon us.  Will the Minister develop his thoughts on this which encompasses all of what we have said in different ways?</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that in this House and in the other House good contributions were made by all sides.  Clearly, Members wanted to elicit information as to what the picture will be for the ICC in future years.  I do not wish to be less than gracious to Senator Doyle but there is clearly no way we can discuss these matters as comprehensively as we would want to because the Minister for Finance has <Col N="1697" /> invited in consultants.  He has clearly indicated on a number of occasions that he has an open mind on this.  Looking on one side of the coin, there are huge competitive forces for the available resources of the State and there is an onus on the Government to ensure that taxpayers' interests are looked after to the maximum extent possible.  The scope for continued State investment of the order of what has been the practice in the past, without being specific to this company, is no longer possible.</P>
      <P>It would be unwise, while awaiting the consultants' report and all of the deliberations that will take place in consultation with the management of ICC, to discuss at this stage how the company will end up.  The question clearly is premature.  I take the point that Senators are concerned about this aspect and it is something we will be returning to in the course of the next couple of years.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister.  I appreciate that, regardless of what he knows or does not know, he is not in a position to prematurely announce to this House what the thoughts of the Government may be in as much as he may know them on this issue.  It is important that we firmly mark down the fact that this is a point of major concern.  While we could have limited our contributions on these two sections, and indeed on Second Stage, merely to the advisability or otherwise of raising the borrowing limits &mdash; and there is not much of a debate on that specific point given the state we are at at the moment &mdash; the overriding policy discussions which are foremost in all our minds needed teasing out here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister responded to questions I had asked on Second Stage in relation to Fóir Teoranta being embraced by ICC in future.  Could he specify exactly what the corporate relationship of Fóir Teoranta would be once within the embrace of ICC?  Will it be subsidiary?  Fóir Teoranta had many risk investments, by the very nature of being a rescue agency it had some marginal investments on hand and where the balance of advantage lay in investing in the companies, it did not do so <Col N="1698" /> because that is what we all wanted Fóir Teoranta to do.  It still carries some very risky investments and ventures while it is now being transferred to ICC.  How could these high risk companies that still owe Fóir Teoranta &mdash; and in the future ICC-repayments not put ICC at risk from possible defaulting?  In other words, looking at the corporate structure at the moment and the commercial success the ICC has been, the ICC has been told by the Government to take on high risk portfolios from Fóir Teoranta; notwithstanding what the Minister has just said about the relationship, I cannot understand &mdash; in the absence of an explanation from the Minister of what the actual relationship between the two bodies will be in the future &mdash; how these high risk portfolios could not attract some defaulters and thereby affect the profitability and commerciality of the ICC. Perhaps that could be explained.  It is important in the context of future development.  In other words, if one were to raise the shareholders' funds in ICC either through floating part of it and allowing private investment or by other means you affect the profitability and the value of the shares if you foist on ICC risk portfolios which obviously some in Fóir Teoranta must be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to make no difference how I approach this question from the point of view of helping Senator Doyle.  I have to stay in her black books as far as this question is concerned.  She asked about the future relationship between Fóir Teoranta and ICC.  Fóir Teoranta is going to be dissolved.  It will not longer exist.  It will have no relationship with anybody.  It will be gone forever. As regards the question of dealing with the risk capital, or companies which could be regarded to be of high risk, we have been at pains to say at all times that ICC will not continue the functions of Fóir Teoranta in relation to these cases. There can be no public understanding that we are continuing functions which hitherto resided with Fóir Teoranta in relation to rescue operations.  We do not want to signal to anybody, anywhere, <Col N="1699" /> that these resources are going to be available in the future.</P>

      <P>With respect, does the Minister not think he is being a little disingenuous?  I do not want to cause any difficulties in terms of profitability to the ICC, even though I have a feeling that our meagre contribution in this House will not affect too many, but I cannot understand how the ICC's commercial viability will not be affected negatively to some extent by having to take on more risky portfolios &mdash; obviously these are companies it did not choose to invest in previously because Fóir Teoranta the rescue agency, had to manage them.  Now they are going into ICC there is a higher risk of default from those portfolios than from the ICC's own portfolios it hand picked over the years.  If there is a default to a lesser or greater extent, will that not affect the profitability of ICC and thereby affect the value of the shareholding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Senator Doyle's point.  There are two or three points.  One is obviously the proportionate quantum of these risks in relation to ICC's overall size, which is very substantial.  In any commercial transaction between a bank or other financing institution and a venture company there is always a degree of profit, a degree of risk which relates very often to securities demanded or the rate of interest demanded.  I would suggest that perhaps far greater risks are encountered by the banks in matters which do not relate so much to these relatively small <Col N="1700" /> risk ventures.  In some ways I cannot help thinking that we should encourage our financial institutions to give more support to Irish venture capital situations.  This has been one of the weaknesses of our financial services market.  Very often the financial institutions throughout the world have suffered far more from lending on a basis which, at the time, may have appeared very reasonable to other countries which had perhaps at one time very large oil revenues, and then finding they are left with debts which they cannot pay and having to write off extraordinarily large sums or, alternatively, investing in something which happens to be very popular at a given time, such as the American institutions which invested in property which now appears to have been grossly exaggerated, and now the institutions, even the most conservative institutions are suffering.  Senator Doyle has a point but I would suggest that the relative quantum is relatively small in the circumstances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask one more question in relation to section 2 and the same question could be asked of section 1?  The Minister responded to a point I made on Second Stage about the change in the operations over the years of the ICC in terms of the balance of what was lent in equity investment versus loan finance and he diplomatically said we got it wrong. He put it a bit nicer than that, but that is what he meant &mdash; that there was no such change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not use words like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he did not, but I am paraphrasing rather bluntly the message he was giving.  It is interesting to note that the objectives of the 1933 Act are defined as acquisition, underwriting, <Col N="1701" /> holding and selling of shares, that is the £10 million equivalent of what the ICC is at today.  The objectives go on to state: &ldquo;They shall also include the lending of money&rdquo;.  That is not the primary objective; but it started off as the primary objective.  Equity investment has become the secondary role.  It may not be the secondary objective but it is certainly the secondary role &mdash; around £10 million is the figure that is out on equity investment at the moment.  In terms of loan finance &mdash; and I am speaking from memory &mdash; it is £608 million or £610 million, or somewhere in that ballpark.</P>
      <P>The point I have been making &mdash; and I suspect other Senators made on Second Stage &mdash; was that there appeared to have been a reversal of the role of the ICC given, quite understandably, the huge change in the industrial climate and the environment in which they were working from the protectionist environment of the thirties to the open trading environment that we find ourselves in, and hopefully that will even improve.  That was the point we were making and we would like comment from the Minister on that. What appeared to be the primary objective has now become a secondary role, and what appeared to be a secondary objective has now become the primary role; perhaps it adds strength to the case that the Government should not be in the business of owning banks at all now given the climate we are in and where we are heading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was almost tempted, in the sort of good humoured approach that very often operates on this side of the House on debates, to say that some 50 years after an Act is passed, could Senator Doyle not give credit to individuals whose perception about change could not have embraced what we have since experienced, or had written into the Act anywhere something that would cover all of the developments.  I say that rather jocosely because there is a much more easy, fundamental, straightforward, logical answer, and that is, the Industrial Credit Act, 1933, is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> An Act to make provisions for the formation and registration of a company having for its principal object the providing of industrial credit, and for the acquisition by the Minister for Finance of share capital of such company, and for other purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>To accommodate the increased borrowing.  I noted what the Minister said in his response on Second Stage in relation to misgivings I and I think Senator Ross had about the continuing State guarantee.  He made the fair point that future investors should not be discriminated against compared with the treatment given to past investors.  That point has to be accepted of course but what we were trying to find out and were not very articulate in the message we were giving, was the role of the State guarantee in the future in terms of what is essentially a commercial bank now, like <Col N="1703" /> any other bank and if there are differences perhaps it is time they were ironed out.  How the transition period could do that, or whether it could do that, I am not sufficiently experienced in this area to comment.  However, there is a feeling that the need to continue with any State owned bank in the climate in which we now find ourselves is no longer there. The same remarks would apply to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I think I referred to the Agricultural Credit Corporation in my Second Stage contribution. I would like to know if the Minister believes there is a role in the future for a State owned bank giving State guarantees, given the industrial and commercial climate in which we now operate and given the 1 January 1993 advent of the Internal Market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are interesting times ahead for Irish banking and the Irish financial sector, and I hope exciting times all over.  We are looking at EC directives. We have had the relaxing of exchange controls and it follows automatically that financial controls of one kind or another will relax as well.  Regrettably because of the restricted nature of the Bill before us as the Minister has pointed out, we could not really get the answers to the bigger questions that are exercising all our minds at the moment.  The ICC being one of two State owned banks should be afforded the increase in borrowing limits that this enabling legislation is to provide, and thereby will have our support for what this Bill tries to do, which is very limited.</P>

      <P>While we accept the Adjournment now, perhaps the Acting Leader would endeavour to see if he could give us a sos of an hour now because if we could debate the bovine disease levy from 8 o'clock to 9 o'clock, we would only need another hour to wind up.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, need not be here for the first hour.  The Government side have three speakers and we have one.

      <P>By agreement, we are withdrawing our amendment and have agreed to the motion.  I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> That, whereas freedom of movement is a basic civil right and the deliberate disruption of rail services is a denial of this right, Seanad Éireann demands that of Provisional IRA</P>
    <P>1.  stop the disruption of the Belfast-Dublin service which has linked the people of Dublin and Belfast for over a century;</P>
    <P>2.  stop putting the lives of passengers and rail staff at risk;</P>
    <P>3.  stop threatening the jobs of railway workers.</P>

      <P>I second the motion.  I am delighted the Senator has agreed to withdraw the amendments.  The spirit of the motion shows that it would have been largely irrelevant to put that amendment because, when debating something so vital, it is important that we would be in agreement.</P>
      <P>This morning we lauded the achievements of our soccer team and we are still reeling from their dazzling performance, encouraged by all Irish people, North and South; and, remembering how we heralded the Northern Ireland soccer team in 1986, surely unity of purpose from a political and economic viewpoint is possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to the motion, the first overall reference is to freedom of movement being a basic civil right and the deliberate disruption of rail service is a denial of this right.  Freedom of movement is a basic civil right and the deliberate disruption of rail services is a denial of that right. Could you imagine the outrage of Irish people during the past few weeks if we had been prevented &mdash; those of us who were lucky to travel &mdash; from travelling to Italy whether it was Cagliari, Palermo or Genoa?  Obviously, that travel was for pleasure; but there was unity of purpose for people, North and South, to cheer on our Irish team.  The fact that we had North and South did not matter, we were together &mdash; unity of purpose in sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I want to deal with the freedom of movement that really matters to the <Col N="1710" /> people of this island.  The word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; itself symbolises remoteness, perhaps inaccessibility in earlier times, when the first settlers in Northern Ireland, in County Antrim, came by sea across the narrow channel dividing us from Scotland. It is the right of every Irishman and woman to move freely on this island. Almost 3,000 passengers travel on the Dublin-Belfast line each week.  Most of them go for work, not going for pleasure &mdash; although in some cases they are visiting families on either side of the Border &mdash; or they travel because they need access to education, or for business, personal or family reasons.  In many cases people using that rail service use public transport. They may not have private transport; they may have no alternative means of travel.  The continuing bomb attacks and bomb scares on the line illustrate to us in a very ironic way the hypocrisy of the Provisional IRA, who, in their warped sense of a unified Ireland, try to blow up one basic link that unites us.</P>
    <P>We could use paradoxes, and very glaring paradoxes, in relation to their behaviour. First, they wish to eliminate the Border, but they make regular communication, travel and trade virtually impossible and, even more sinister, more dangerous.  Second, in their aspiration to unity all they do is create divisions between people; and we are not even talking about divisions between armed forces but between civilians.  We are talking about vulnerable people &mdash; women, men, children, shoppers, those visiting friends and families on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>There is further irony: we witnessed the thirst for unity and peace throughout the world, starting with the Glasnost policy of Mikhail Gorbachev, the crumbling of the Berlin Wall, peaceful democratic unifications, accelerating now at this stage to South Africa.  We in this little island are still witnessing a long drawn out and uncivilised campaign where the majority of our people seek co-operation, dialogue and understanding between North and South.</P>
    <P>At this particularly trying time of high unemployment on both sides of the <Col N="1711" /> Border and the impending &mdash; I suppose I could coin a phrase &mdash;&ldquo;doomsyear&rdquo; of 1992 looming ahead, we should put enormous emphasis on and effort into economic co-operation and unity against the background of 1992 and European political union, which is both practical and attainable.  This rail link which has been in operation over a century has far greater significance now with the impending European union.  Our transport freight costs are significantly higher than in many of our mainland European neighbours and our insularity is constantly quoted as contributing to our uncompetitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Belfast to Dublin line is the only rail link between North and South.  It is the most important part of the Euro-rail network.  We know from the European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Mr. Bruce Millan, that European funds are available for the upgrading of the line, from the southern end of the country to the northern end, and from our side the Irish Government and Iarnród Éireann would have to upgrade too.  I hope the relevant Minister has already made an application for the money that Commissioner Millan says is in Brussels and which he referred to last January in Belfast.</P>
    <P>In regard to the number of attacks on the line, on one occasion in 1989 the line was closed for almost two months as a result of attacks.  This does not augur well for confidence in integrating us with Europe.  Instead of being a mob of gangsters racketeering on cross-Border traffic, the Provisional IRA would now be racketeering on a Euro-scale.  Most ironically, the leader of the political wing of the IRA has called for European Community funding for the development of the rail line.  Between irony and hypocrisy, such double standards are extraordinary. We always associate the IRA with double standards in their idea of a unified Ireland and their ways of working towards one.</P>
    <P>The threat to the lives of passengers and rail staff is the most horrendous of all.  This refers to the second part of the <Col N="1712" /> motion, where it says: &ldquo;stop putting the lives of passengers and rail staff at risk.&rdquo; It is just sheer good luck and perhaps prayers, that no passengers or railway staff have been killed or injured.  One asks the question: what do the Provisional IRA hope to gain from a bombing campaign which puts lives and jobs at risk?  Racketeering, as I said earlier, must be the motive.  I certainly would not call it patriotism, unless in their own warped way they think of it as patriotic.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in Tralee the outgoing President of the ICTU, Jimmy Blair, reiterated his own and his union's condemnation of the continuing disruption of the North-South link.  I suppose it was fresh in his mind because of the bomb scare very recently.  Looking back at their last conference, which was a women's conference in the Slieve Donard Hotel in Newcastle &mdash; actually it was around the time of the peace train initiative &mdash; the trade union members continued on with their conference despite the harassment by the IRA in placing a bomb in the lobby of that hotel.  The IRA did not mind whether it was a women's conference or a full delegate conference, male and female.  As far as they are concerned, nobody escapes unscathed from their threats.</P>
    <P>The attacks in the vicinity of that area were clearly aimed at the ICTU members who have consistently and admirably &mdash; as shown again yesterday &mdash; conducted a positive campaign and will continue to conduct and step up that campaign in order to protect the rail link.  This shows to the IRA a resolute determination that they believe the IRA campaign will not succeed and that they will work towards the defeat of that campaign.</P>
    <P>The last point in the motion, which relates to railway workers, concerns threatening their jobs.  The trade union leaders have quantified the number of job losses at approximately 400 workers, North and South.  These people's jobs are in jeopardy and could be lost if the line were closed.  It is not just the railway workers jobs, but also ancillary jobs in freight services etc.  As I mentioned earlier, our transport costs are even now far <Col N="1713" /> too high and any additional interference can only increase unemployment and sever connections between major Irish firms &mdash; for instance, Guinness, Bell Lines, NET, who ply that line on a regular basis.  If alternative freight arrangements have to be made they can only add to costs and cause more unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is essential that at every opportunity we voice our condemnation of these cowardly acts.  We obviously must work together, North and South.  We must strive to create a unity of purpose and solidarity.  We must encourage dialogue between the democratic parties in Northern Ireland.  We must campaign across our community, North and South, to publicly challenge the activities of the Provisional IRA.  We must look again towards our local authorities to continually condemn these attacks and threats; and, because it is so relevant with the advent of 1992, we must again urge our MEPs, North and South, to move similar motions in Europe to ensure that our European neighbours are aware of these cowardly acts.</P>
    <P>As the thirst for peace has spread like wildfire from eastern Europe to western Europe, surely that torrent can touch us eventually and even overwhelm the members of the Provisional IRA.  I hope I am not indulging in pious aspirations, but I hope that even they can be affected by that tremendous torrent of goodwill towards peace.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to second this motion and I am glad that the Senators opposite, particularly Senator Fallon, entered into the spirit of unity and did not put their amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of supporting this motion because <Col N="1714" /> I am one of the few Members of the House and of the Oireachtas who has to pass through part of my own country that is obstructed and blocked and access to which is denied to me.  Therefore, it is fitting and proper that I should support the motion in the strongest possible terms.</P>
      <P>What will be achieved after we have discussed this motion in the Seanad? What benefits will accrue?  Will those involved in the disruption and bombing of the rail line link between Belfast and Dublin take any notice?  It is important for the Seanad to be involved and publicly to condemn.  It is important to condition public thinking in regard to something that is a fundamental civil right here.  We have got to say it often and not sit back and by our silence allow people to continue to disrupt a rail link which is a fundamental part of the infrastructure of our small island.  Perhaps the complacency or the lack of condemnation by this House encouraged them to believe there was tacit support from people who believed they were doing a useful job nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be spending its time wisely by discussing this motion and agreeing to condemn those involved in the bombing of the rail line.  As a member of the local authority in a county that has a big problem, as the most peripheral part of this country and of Europe, we cannot but be concerned at the activities of those people.  It is ironic that I attended a meeting of my own local authority where two Sinn Féin council members in Donegal were expressing concern and criticising the Government because of the lack of development.  They were seeking greater funding and improvement, and the building up of different industries, at a time when not only the rail line between Belfast and Dublin was blocked by a bomb but on the very day that we could not cross to Strabane because there was a bomb on the bridge between Strabane and Lifford.  Although I totally believe that the two people I referred to were not directly involved, nevertheless they were part of and supported an organisation that felt they were advancing the <Col N="1715" /> cause of the Irish people by bombing, disrupting and blocking the rail link between Belfast and Dublin and by blocking the main road between County Donegal and Strabane, one of the main outlets of our county.  Donegal people have to travel via Strabane and the outlet from County Donegal was cut off: we were then an island with an outlet at Ballyshannon Bridge.  Donegal people are entitled to be concerned and I believe there is an obligation and responsibility on me to support the motion and to be part of the condemnation by this House.</P>
    <P>Those who are involved in continuing to block the rail link do so in the belief that they are drawing in the British Army to get involved in the defusing of bombs, that they are diverting the attention of the British Army, that they are making it harder for Britain to stay in the North and that ultimately they are doing something for the Nationalists in the North.  It has to be said, loud and clear, that that is contrary to the facts on the ground. The people who are pressed hardest are those who have to depend on road and rail transport; and it is fair to state that those who are depending on rail transport are the poorer section of our community. Those who are not depending on rail transport have cars or they can take a plane.  The better off people, North and South, can use alternative sources of transport.  Those affected by the continuing blocking of the rail link between Dublin and Belfast are, apart from the workers, are the poorer section of the community.  I cannot see what advance has been made in the name of Nationalism. Even if you were a super republican and examined how best you could further the cause of uniting Ireland and the people of Ireland, I cannot see any achievement, no matter what way we look at it.  We have to continue to isolate those involved.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry has suffered much in my part of the country.  The upturn in tourism nationally has not brought its full benefit to my part of the country.  Last year Donegal had some slight upturn, but there has not been the same development <Col N="1716" /> in Donegal and in the North because of the continued disruption to transport and to travellers.  This has to be said.  The tourist industry employs a lot of people and is one of the few growth areas, but it has been restricted and retarded by the continuation of the activities of those who disrupt transport here.</P>
    <P>It is vital that all political persuasions join together and continue to enlist public support condemning those who are involved in these activities.  We must bring home to the godfathers who are directing this and to the people who are placing the bombs that they are not achieving anything for the cause they believe they are helping.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago you could have travelled across the Border without meeting a policeman or a Garda or an Army checkpoint.  Today surrounding my county we have seven military bases, with barbed wire, sophisticated communications equipment and thousands of pounds worth of tanks, armoured vehicles and equipment.  It is a miracle that we have a tourist coming into our area at all.  We have to bring this home to the people who are largely responsible for having created the situation where we have those massive military bases, which have to be there to protect the railways, to protect the links of communications. We have to tell those people who have set out to achieve a united Ireland that they have done this country a major disservice and that they have turned the clock back a century.  Twenty years ago you could have driven your car freely across the Border.  Today you cannot do that.  Most people coming from the South, or a visitor to this country, would not drive across the Border.  A visitor would not use the rail link between Belfast and Dublin because there is a danger, because there is a threat.</P>
    <P>Those factors have to be recognised. The public has to be requested continually to isolate these people at the time of a local election or a general election. Whether you are in the Falls in Belfast or in Bandon in County Cork, this island is very small and we must totally condemn the activities of those who believe <Col N="1717" /> they are achieving something for the people of Ireland by blocking the railways and the roads.  I am glad to be associated with this motion and I hope that the message gets through to those people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past 18 months or so the Dublin-Belfast railway line has been the target of a protracted campaign of disruption carried out by the Provisional IRA or by persons claiming to act on behalf of that organisation. This campaign of disruption takes the form of placing bombs on the Northern side of the line or making hoax telephone calls to the effect that there are bombs on the line.</P>
      <P>In the period in question there have been 87 disruptions of this kind of the railway service between Dublin and Belfast and it is incredible to have to say that in the course of those disruptions the Provisional IRA have placed 29 bombs which have either exploded or been defused on the railway line, a line used by the ordinary people of Ireland going about their everyday business.</P>
      <P>The most recent disruption was on the 28 June when a bomb exploded at Newry railway station, the second such attack on the station this year.  In this incident, a 13-year old boy narrowly escaped death when sharpnel from the explosion crashed into his house nearly half a mile away from the scene.  Only the previous week another teenager was injured when a bomb exploded on the line at Lurgan. This was an incident in which a bomb had been placed in a location close to the scene of an explosion the previous day and which was clearly intended to murder those engaged in carrying out a clearance operation to ensure that the line was safe to travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only through the good grace of God that a major disaster involving massive loss of life has not take place on this railway line as a result of this mindless campaign of disruption.  On at least two occasions last year, passenger trains narrowly avoided passing in the vicinity of bombs placed on the line through the sheer good luck of being slightly delayed <Col N="1718" /> for a few minutes.  Any organisation which places bombs on a railway line used by ordinary citizens in going about their peaceful everyday business shows a callous disregard for the possible disastrous consequences of their lunatic behaviour.</P>
    <P>All right minded persons are at one in calling on the Provisional IRA to put an end to this senseless campaign before there is a major disaster.  I welcome the contributions of Senators Jackman and McGowan and their condemnation of this campaign and I know that all those who contributed today to the debate will echo this call.  Only last March, all sides of the other House joined together in a motion condemning the Provisional IRA campaign against the line, not only as a threat to the safety and well being of passengers and staff alike, but also as a denial of the basic civil right of freedom of movement and as threat to the jobs of over 400 railway workers.</P>
    <P>On that occasion, the Minister for Justice emphasised &mdash; and I repeat now &mdash; the concern of the Government about these attacks and the Minister for Justice drew attention to the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had personally raised the issue with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State.  The Department of Foreign Affairs have maintained close contact with the British authorities on this matter through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat and they, the British, fully share our concern about this issue and about the importance of keeping the line open and safe for travel.</P>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge that, while the Dublin-Belfast railway link has been severely disrupted on nearly 90 occasions since December 1988, it has never been suspended or withdrawn.  On those occasions when the rail schedules have been disrupted by bombs or hoax telephone calls, services have been maintained by bus substitution between the nearest station on each side of the incident. The staff of Iarnród Éireann and Northern Ireland Railways deserve the greatest credit for maintaining the service in the face of adversity and, while bus substitution may not be an ideal solution to the problem, it is a clear example of <Col N="1719" /> the very determination to ensure that all steps possible are taken to keep the Dublin-Belfast line open.</P>
    <P>The Dublin-Belfast railway has united both parts of this country for over a century. It has provided a vital link between business and commerce as well as providing a personal link for people from North and South to travel freely from one part of the island to another.  It is not merely a link between Dublin and Belfast but a service which is available to all, North and South.  It is as important to the citizens and businessmen of Cork and Antrim as it is to the citizens and businessmen of Dublin and Belfast.  It is used by people every week for family, commercial or social reasons, many of whom have no other means of travel as was pointed out by Senator McGowan. This is a time when barriers are coming down all over Europe and it would be comic, if it were not so tragic, that those who claim the unification of the island as their primary goal seem to be determined to undermine and destroy the primary visible and symbolic link of unity between North and South.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to ask again those responsible for this senseless campaign to call it off before there is a major disaster resulting from their actions.  The people of Ireland want them to stop and to stop now, and they should heed this call.  For my part, I can assure the House that the Government recognise the importance of the railway link and will continue to take whatever measures are necessary on our side of the Border to ensure that the line remains opens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to express my appreciation to the Government side for dropping the amendment which read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following: Seanad Éireann condemns the IRA for their attempts to disrupt the Dublin to Belfast railway line, which attempts pose a threat to the lives of passengers, of staff of the railway companies and <Col N="1720" /> of the public at large, to the right of free movement of individuals and to the jobs of members of the staff of the railway companies.</P>
    <P>That is absolutely unexceptional.  Everybody could agree with that.  There is no disagreement whatever about the content. However, as the proposer of the original motion I approached the Government Whip this afternoon and explained to him that I was rather anxious that we should maintain exactly words.</P>
    <P>I think it is appropriate that I should start by explaining to the House why I made this request which was so graciously acceded to by the Government side.  This wording, which was written by a group of us on the peace train when it was stopped as a result of a bomb hoax, was deliberately written with the intention that it should be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in precisely this wording and that it should then be sent to all the county councils, both North and South of the Border, so that the 32 Counties would have an opportunity democratically to vote upon this and to express their wish.  It is our feeling that if this was done, if both Houses of the Oireachtas and each county council on a 32 county basis, voted this measure through and passed it in democratic session, it could then be transmitted to the provisional IRA or Provisional Sinn Féin as a plea to them to obey the clear and determined voice of the Irish people.  For that reason, I appreciate the fact that the Government did yield on this matter and agreed to drop the amendment.  As I said, there was no conflict whatever between us with regard to the sentiments; it was just the feeling that our case would be much strengthened if the original wording was maintained.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the peace train, because it was really in support of the peace train initiative that this wording was forged.  The peace train ran in both directions.  A train was seen off by the Lord Mayor of Belfast and arrived in Dublin on the morning of Saturday, 28 October 1989, and we were seen off at Amiens Street station by the Deputy <Col N="1721" /> Lord Mayor representing the Lord Mayor, Seán Haughey, and the trade union brass band.  It was a marvellously inspiring occasion and a mass of ordinary Dublin people and travellers joined with public figures and went up to Belfast. On the return journey a bomb hoax was telephoned to the railway authorities and we were all asked to leave the train.  Like a lot of sheep, we started doing just that and I spotted a distinguished former Member of the other House, Jack McQuillan, one of the founders of Clann na Poblachta, sitting in his seat.  I thought perhaps he had been taken ill and I said to him, &ldquo;Jack, you are going to miss the bus; are you ill?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I certainly am not ill, and I certainly am going to miss the bus.  I came up here on a peace train and I am going down on a peace train if it takes me a forthnight&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;Well, I think you are right.  Do you mind if I join you?&rdquo;  Then Monica Barnes came bumbling down the corridor and said: &ldquo;David you are going to miss the bus&rdquo;.  I said &mdash; if you will excuse the expression, I do not know if it is parliamentary &mdash;&ldquo;You are damn right Monica; I am going to miss the bus.  Why don't you miss it too?&rdquo;  It kind of snowballed from there. Nearly 100 of us, not only public representatives but ordinary people, showed their solidarity by staying on the peace train.  It really was a very remarkable, although slightly uncomfortable, event.</P>
    <P>A number of things struck me about that.  When we were lodged in the station first, the British Army gave us some of their food, and we established some kind of human contact with them which was rather interesting.  It was a gesture of charity and kindness on their part but more importantly, when we were stranded later in the night, both sides of the community and representatives of the Protestant Unionist community came and delivered food and hot coffee to the railway station.  I took great heart from the fact that both sides were able to unite in appreciation of what we were doing.  The reason is that it was a <Col N="1722" /> simple idea.  It lacked all kinds of sophisticated political folderols; it was a simple idea that ordinary people could very clearly associate with.  We heard, most interestingly, in what I thought was a very perceptive, direct and pointed speech from Senator McGowan about how this attempt to disrupt communications affects the lives of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>I have to raise another point and I do so because I want to scotch it.  We noticed on the way up through Dundalk that there were a group of protestors in the station.  They had placards and were talking about another form of disruption which I also regret, and that is the cratering of Border roads.  I raise this because it is important that we deal with this issue.  People like myself on the Peace Train committee and in New Consensus are asked sometimes to be even-handed so that on any occasion when we condemn the IRA it is assumed that we have got automatically in a Pavlovian response to launch a blast at the British Army or the RUC or something else.  I take these things into account as much as I possibly can.  May I also point out to the House that Senator Brendan Ryan in supporting our request that this motion be taken, raised that point and indicated that if he spoke &mdash; and, perhaps, he will speak later this evening &mdash; he would attempt this balancing act.</P>
    <P>I received communications from the people involved in the South-Tyrone-North-Monaghan Community Association about what they called a peace bus. They explained the disruption to the communities involved and I have a good feeling of sympathy for them.  It is very unpleasant to have this division between communities, farmlands and so on.  I was unable to go that afternoon because I was involved in charity work to which I had previously committed myself.  I wrote back to the chairman who had written to me and explained this.  However, I said I would like to be kept in touch and to be reassured that I was not unwittingly involving myself in political affiliations which I would find distasteful.  I await a reply to that letter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" /> However, I explored the matter further. I explored it when, with other members of New Consensus, I went to the North of Ireland and met senior officers of the RUC and I asked them for statistics.  I explained I had been approached and that I was concerned because I understood the human disruption involved.  I received from them some very clear facts and figures which I would like to place on the record.  There are approximately 300 milies of Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with a total of 291 recognised Border crossings which are called BCPs.  Of the 291 BCPs, 16 crossing points are land routes approved by customs commissioners for the importation and exportation of goods of every description, including vehicles.</P>
    <P>There are nine concessionary routes through 19 BCPs, that is, routes that pass from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland and back into the Republic of Ireland and on which customs commissioners have waived customs regulations.  A total of 92 BCPs are the subject of road closure orders issued for security reasons by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland under the provisions of section 19 of the Emergency Provisions Act (Northern Ireland), 1978. In addition, there are 18 permanent vehicle check points (PVCPs) on cross-Border routes.</P>
    <P>The figures that accompanied the letter I received from a chief superintendent of this district tell a very significant story indeed.  They demonstrate clearly that since the Border roads were closed in 1981 there has been a dramatic, sustained, continuing drop in bomb attacks, shooting incidents and murders, both of policemen and civilians.  That is an unarguable answer to people who accuse those of us interested in the North-South rail link of being insensitive and uncaring with regard to the rights of the people whose lives are disrupted, admittedly, by the cratering of the roads.  I have figures both in graph form and statistical form.</P>
    <P>In the Lisnaskea sub-division, in 1980 there were six deaths.  In 1981 there were <Col N="1724" /> three and after the introduction of the policy of closing the roads it dropped to none.  It went up once or twice subsequently but there were several consecutive years in which there were no murders.</P>
    <P>In regard to shootings, in 1980 there were 17; in 1981 there were 21, but immediately following the closure of the roads it was down to nine.  It now hovers somewhere between three and seven.</P>
    <P>With regard to bomb incidents, in 1980 there were 12 and in 1981 there were also 12.  In 1982, there were three.  In other words, those serious incidents have been reduced to a quarter or a half of what they were.</P>
    <P>I understand the inconvenience and disruption to people in the communities along the Border but I have to balance that against death.  If it is a choice between death, on the one hand, and inconvenience, on the other, I am sorry, but some people will have to be inconvenienced. That, I hope, puts to rest the peace bus campaign which was so actively promoted by Provisional Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>Having made that little digression which is rather important, I want to address again the subject of the North-South rail link.  Several people have indicated they consider it a very strange method of operation by the IRA.  It is difficult to understand their motivation. I do not believe there is a great deal of value in simply blackguarding the IRA and describing them as monsters, terrorists, perverts and so on because it is important that we get them to listen to us.  Like any other human being, if you use bad names and derogatory language about them they will just erect a shutter. They will not listen; it is a natural human instinct.</P>
    <P>However, it is worth while asking them simply questions.  The simple question I would ask the IRA is how they can square their stated objective of unifying the country with the disruption of the principal rail link between the two parts of the island.  I would be interested to hear their answer.  I would also like to know what is the military objective.  In a war situation like, for example, World War II <Col N="1725" /> there was, of course, bombing of railway lines for a very good reason; it was interrupting the transfer of military supplies. There is no such reason for these attacks on the railway line.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer the House also to another matter which is regrettable.  It was mentioned in Dáil Éireann by Deputy McCartan.  He placed a rather interesting piece of evidence on the record of that House.  Talking of the Dublin-Belfast link he said that this issue first came to his attention most directly when a number of train drivers, some constituents and some acquaintances, told him that they could not stand the strain any longer.  They explained that they had, in the face of unbelievable pressures, written to Mr. Gerry Adams, so-called Member of Parliament for the people of West Belfast and President of Sinn Féin, requesting a meeting.  Those train drivers, as workers, wanted to bring to his attention what his associates were inflicting on those who drove the trains on that line.  They never received a response from Mr. Adams, a Member of Parliament for the people as he describes himself.  He refused to meet them.  He refused to meet his constituents, whose lives and livelihood were threatened.  I do not wish to engage in personal attacks upon people but that stands, without further gloss from me, as a comment upon the nature of Mr. Adams' commitment to democracy.</P>
    <P>It is also important to remember that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions yesterday again passed overwhelmingly a simpler resolution to this.  In speaking on it on the radio this morning the General Secretary mentioned that he had been approached by a train driver who had driven four times over an unexploded bomb on the railway line.  It is extremely difficult to ask people to continue driving trains in this appalling situation because you never actually know when you are going to be blown into smithereens. There is a danger, not only to employment but also to lives, firstly, to the lives of railway employees and, secondly, to the lives of the innocent travelling public.</P>
    <P>I want to put two or three other things <Col N="1726" /> on the record.  There is a political dimension to this from which the Southern Government cannot escape, and that is, the necessity of investment in this rail link.  I was sad and puzzled to hear some weeks ago the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, whom I respect, saying that where it became necessary to choose between investing funds in the development of the North-South rail link on the one hand, and the suburban network in Dublin on the other, he would go for the suburban Dublin network in terms of seeking funding. Although I am a Dubliner and I tend to think in Dublin terms, I question whether his priority is right.  It is not just an economic situation; it is an economic plus a social situation, and one with a very definite political touch to it.</P>
    <P>Like most Members of the House, I get some very odd literature through the box in the morning and yesterday I got something from the <i>Societé Internationale des chemins de fer,</i> a French rail way magazine.  The entire issue was devoted to the heavy investment currently being embarked upon by both sections of Germany to increase the transport link between the two countries. In this House, and the other House, we often hear of parallels being drawn between the developing situation in the East and what we could do here.  That is one very clear development.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome this motion and, once again, I would like to place on the record my thanks to the Government for allowing us to pass the motion in its original form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on the Government side and indeed, the Leas-Chathaoirleach took the deliberate decision to withdraw our amendment and to support the motion in its original form. Effectively, the disruption of the rail link between the North and South has become, as it should, an expression of abhorrence by both sides of this House. It is, perhaps, one of our most historic links.  The old Great Northern Railway is a part of Irish history and, indeed, a part of international history.  It has been the <Col N="1727" /> form of transport by which people came from the North to the South and from the South to the North during the past century.  I particularly remember as a young person &mdash; it still happens to a considerable extent today &mdash; trains coming down from the North of Ireland for an international match in which Ireland, to which all of us on this island belong and of which we are so proud, were playing. People came from the North to join us at Lansdowne Road, shouting for their fellow Irishmen, North and South, who were proudly wearing the traditional green jersey.</P>
      <P>It is, indeed, ironic as Senator Jackman suggested, that in some wildly misguided way those individuals should imagine that by this dangerous and stupid process of bombing the rail link between the two parts of the country, they are in any way advancing their professed aims of uniting the people of this island, a unity which I, and I am sure every Senator, deeply favour and want.  One of our reasons for being so appalled by this campaign is that we know it is deferring the coming together of our people; it is not bringing us together.  We implore those responsible to call a halt to this campaign.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to Mr. Adams, a duly elected MP. Even he has come some way towards condeming the civilian loss of life &mdash; but no way near far enough &mdash; and certain of the horrible incidents that have occurred.  I would hope that all those who are committing those crimes, would pull back and think for a moment what would have happened if, instead of being unexploded, the bomb had gone off beneath a train.  It would be too late then to start making apologies, talking about a mistake and how dreadful it was that so many men, women and children had been massacred or mutilated.  As well as condemning this outrageous campaign, let us appeal, on the grounds of humanity and commonsense, that this campaign of terror be brought to an end before there is a tragedy</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure we all want to see peace and justice on this island.  I have no doubt that we are seeing in the North the last <Col N="1728" /> vestige of colonialism.  The last significant reason for our neighbouring country to an interest in the North was, of course, security.  Now with the easing of tensions, with the complete remoteness of any sort of conflict East and West, even that reason, however deeply felt it may have been by persons across the water, no longer holds.  There is no basic reason now, with goodwill on both sides, the moves which are being made at present, and hopefully further moves, should not begin to bring about peace and democracy in a true sense on this island, the peace that we all want.  Admittedly it could be disrupted by the appalling consequences which this dreadful bombing campaign may inevitably bring.  It is no use saying the bombs should not have gone off; if you plant a bomb on a railway line, just because you think you used a timer is no excuse if the train and those unfortunate people who happen to be travelling on it are blown up.</P>
    <P>Let us see this campaign stopped immediately; let there be no more of it. It is not even in any way helping the aims of those people they profess to want to help.  In fact, it is tremendously ironic &mdash; and Senator Jackman gave some excellent examples of irony.  I agree with a lot of what Senator Norris said, but I have to differ with some of his comments.  I support every word in the motion.  We are condemning the campaign to disrupt the Belfast-Dublin rail link on a number of grounds, including freedom of movement, we are not talking about the cratering of the Border roads.  Without entering into the arguments about that, I am sure the Minister will recognise that there are other reasons, not least the heroic efforts of our own security forces and Garda, to help reduce both the death rate and the number of cross-Border incidents.  I deeply regret the business of disrupting cross-Border roads.  I find it ironic that the Provisional IRA are condemning some people while they are doing something infinitely worse as regards restricting freedom of movement between one part of Ireland and another. That, to me, is a supreme irony.  Let us hope it will not be an extreme tragedy <Col N="1729" /> and that nothing further happens.  Indeed it has put an amount of stress and anxiety on the rail staff.  People continue to use the service and, thank goodness, most people have maintained their normal habits.  It is a tremendous tribute to the rail staff South and North that not once has the service failed despite all those incidents.</P>
    <P>I would like to join in supporting Senators Norris, Ross, Manning and Doyle in their motion.  I feel sure it will be passed unanimously. We want to live together in peace and unity on this island and this dreadful campaign does nothing to forward that honourable objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate those people who travelled on the peace train, and several Members come to mind including Senators Norris, O'Toole and Murphy.  I do not know who else was on it, but I was not.  I would like to congratulate those people who took that initiative.  It was a very good and effective way of highlighting this problem.  The fact that the incident to which Senator Norris referred took place only served to highlight the issue even more.  In some ways it was a good thing because it has prompted a debate in this House and in the other House.  It has also prompted a debate which is going to have that rare quality of unanimously passing a motion in this House.  I do not think there is any question of anybody opposing this in any way.  I share that unanimity, and I share the deep feelings that exist about this motion on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I should like to take up one or two things previous speakers said, specifically some of the things that Senators Norris and Conroy said.  I sympathise with those academics &mdash; and the last two speakers are academics and I am not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the arguments of academics on this issue but when Senators Norris and Conroy, in implicit agreement, say they believe that the thing <Col N="1730" /> to do is to ask the IRA simple questions, they are being unrealistic, if very well meaning.  It seems to me that the Provisional IRA by these acts on the railway and by other acts and atrocities which they have committed all over Ireland are beyond the Pale, they are beyond reason. Those who are prepared to blow up people at random, to blow up bridges, to take risks with people's lives, are not really going to listen to a person who says, &ldquo;why are you doing it?&rdquo;  or &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo;  or &ldquo;what do you hope to achieve?&rdquo;  They are not the type of people who listen to the reasoned arguments of Senators Conroy, Norris and others.</P>

      <P>No, thank God there are not many more academics in this House.  I do not wish in any way to be divisive in this debate but I believe that the encouraging words which Senator Conroy said about that, and about Gerry Adams condemning loss of life are probably a little optimistic.  Mr. Adams, MP &mdash; elected to the eternal shame of those who voted for him &mdash; who was elected by the people of West Belfast, condemns loss of life very selectively.  He condemns loss of life when he feels that public opinion is so horrified by it that it will reflect badly on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that it would be a little late after a train was blown up to apologise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I find that his condemnations of any of the atrocities of the IRA are rather unconvincing if he is going to condemn some and not condemn others.  He cannot really do that with any conviction and I find his condemnations rather hideous.  I do not see this campaign being waged by the IRA as iniquitous because it is impeding the road to a united Ireland.  It is, but it is iniquitous because it is an evil thing to bomb railways and to risk life itself.  It may be that a by-product of this is to retard a united Ireland.  That may be true and I do not find that a <Col N="1731" /> particularly horrifying prospect.  I find the nature of what is being done so horrific that it should be condemned in itself.  The political consequences at this stage are not particularly relevant.</P>
      <P>What I do find about it is that it is a partitionist thing to be doing in their own terms.  Undoubtedly, what Senator Conroy and Senator McGowan have so eloquently said is true, that what they are doing is dividing and partitioning the country further and that, on top of that, they are delighting the extreme Unionists. I have been able to talk to people in the North on the very right of the Unionist side about this and I have to say they were not too displeased about the bombing of the railway line.  They did not find that it stood in the way or obstructed their own political objectives because they found that this was a way of dividing Ireland, a further extension of dividing Ireland and ensuring that the two sides of the Border are parted even further.</P>
      <P>In political terms, we are right; it will backfire on the Provisional IRA.  In political terms, I really do not understand, like everybody else, what they hope to achieve.  In military terms, possibly, there is some merit in what Senator McGowan said, they are maintaining the campaign to distract the British Army from other areas and, therefore, more effectively waging their campaign.  I find that fairly unconvincing.  I am more convinced by the belief that they are running some sort of protection racket and benefiting from this as well, that they are gaining financially by the side-effects of what is happening on the railway line.  It is no secret that the Provisional IRA are professional racketeers and that any opportunity they get to blackmail or prise money out of people illegally, they will take.  This may well be just one more way of gaining money for the coffers of the IRA and buying guns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this as a very serious extension and escalation of the IRA campaign because even though they have tried in their cynical way to restrict their activities to Northern Ireland in order that public opinion here is not alienated, to me this <Col N="1732" /> is an attack not only on the train or the railway line, but also an attack on the Irish State.  We who have in the past been somewhat silent in certain areas to do with the IRA should take this far more seriously because it is an attack on ourselves, on our citizens, on our property, on our State and on our trade.  For that reason it is a more serious escalation for us.</P>
    <P>I would like to say one or two words about the cratering of the roads.  I take the point made by Senator Norris on this. It seems quite obvious that the cratering of the roads was not done to antagonise the local people.  The British Army at no stage wanted to antagonise them.  The cratering was done for purely military reasons.  Let us be quite straight about it, if there was no Provisional IRA campaign there would be no cratering of the roads. The people who are to blame for that are the people who are using those roads to transport military equipment.  If the IRA laid down their arms, gave up their struggle, gave up their military campaign, the cratering of the roads would be unnecessary. It probably does alienate the local population but it is in no way a parallel to what is happening on the North-South rail link.</P>
    <P>The IRA in this campaign are showing us the sort of desperation from which they suffer.  For more than 20 years the IRA have been running a similar campaign. If there ever was a possibility of a united Ireland it certainly is not going to happen in the lifetime of Professor Conroy, Mr. Norris and, probably, not mine.</P>

      <P>Youth is on my side.  If it ever was going to happen it is less likely to happen now because of the campaign of the Provisional IRA in the past 20 years.  What they are doing here is just one more sign of desperation.  They are escalating their campaign to less relevant but easier targets.  Their campaign is <Col N="1733" /> extending to the continent and soft targets there, it is extending to the North-South railway link and to soft targets in the United Kingdom.  There is no doubt that the more they escalate their campaign, the more they show their desperation, the less likely they are to achieve their ultimate objective, if they are even genuine about that.</P>

      <P>When there was a reference to age I was hoping that Senator Ross might say that maybe in his lifetime we might see a united Ireland.  I was pleased that the amendment to the motion was withdrawn because we are united in the spirit and the intent of the motion.  As happened in the other House, there is unanimity about the approach from all sides on this issue.  That is very important because it serves to underlie the totally undemocratic nature of the Provisional IRA and the lack of support for their activities.  Tonight we have pinpointed one particular activity but there are so many others that we continuously have to condemn.</P>
      <P>Often when one is addressing problems in Northern Ireland there is a degree of incredulity about them.  What can an organisation hope to achieve by the constant disruption of a rail link which unites the two communities and which serves men, women and children going about their daily business and are, as ever, the innocent and long-suffering victims of the Provisional IRA, or the so-called godfathers of terrorism?  What purpose can they possibly be setting out to achieve? Can this campaign in any way be seen as furthering the cause of Irish unity?  Of course, as we have all said tonight, it is not.  It is nothing more than cynical manipulation by a group of people who are more an example of the Mafia than anyone else.  If their cause is not in this instance Irish unity, and how could it be, then what are they aiming to achieve? Part of the answer, and it has been mentioned here already, is that they are holding up to extortion and blackmail those who are engaged in cross-Border trade in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Provisional <Col N="1734" /> IRA who have tried to destroy the rail link between Dublin and Belfast both by bomb attacks and bomb scares are putting at risk not only the lives of the staff of the railway companies but the passengers who include women and children. I cannot claim the same experience Senator McGowan mentioned about disruption to ordinary life.  I have been to Northern Ireland many times in the past few months and on the train I saw ordinary men, women and children going about their business.  They are in constant danger, at the very least, of minor disruption of their day, and are fearful of what is going to happen.  They wonder if they will get to the station on time, if there will be a bomb scare and so on. They worry if it will go off in this instance. The fear and the trauma is very real.  The fear of any parent in those circumstances is that the worst will happen.</P>
    <P>We have seen all too often, particularly recently, the sickening hypocrisy of apologies from the IRA for the &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; they made in murdering the wrong people.  When will this happen here?  Are we just waiting for it to happen?  How can they guarantee to us that another mistake will not occur and that it will be even closer to home?  This hypocrisy is sickening and that is why it is so important for all of us to join in the condemnation of the IRA campaign.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we know only too well by now that the IRA do not respond to appeals on humanitarian grounds.  That is not to say we should not make them do so.  We should spare no effort to counteract their campaign.  I welcome the initiative of the peace train as a symbol that we all refuse to be intimidated by the activities of the Provisional IRA.  I was not on the peace train but I have met many people who were.  I know of many Ulster Unionists who in their own quiet way supported it and gave sustenance on the night, as Senator Norris described, when the passengers were the victims of that bomb hoax.  We are more concerned about employment and the creation of opportunities for our people but these <Col N="1735" /> terrorists are causing even more unemployment in the areas which are most deserving of investment.</P>
    <P>The economic consequences of this campaign are well-known.  Earlier today in the House we approved an order which will, in effect, permit Bord Gáis through a subsidiary provide for a sub-sea gas pipeline inter-connector to Britain.  How ironic it is that we have had to abandon the prospect of cheaper electricity both North and South because of the activities of the Provisional IRA who destroyed the electricity inter-connector between the two parts of this island.  It is indicative of the hypocrisy of the IRA that they would seek to destroy the livelihood of the people whom they claim to represent. They say they are seeking a united Ireland but I wonder what type of Ireland we would have if these are the criteria they use.  I found it extremely ironic to discover that Mr. Adams, whom we have heard about tonight, was looking for EC aid to develop the railway line between North and South.  The final irony is that on the one hand people in his organisation, or very close to it are seeking to destroy the line and he is seeking to develop it.  It may be that Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA are going their separate ways and this is indicative of that. The irony of this goes beyond the beyonds.</P>
    <P>I am constantly amazed that when we are talking about a united Ireland the godfathers of crime are doing the very things that will destroy our economy and our Island.  There are few words one can use to describe the trauma and the sickening evidence we have seen of the campaign by the IRA.  I am glad we are united in supporting the motion.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I should like to add my support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long on this motion.  I join with the other speakers in condemning the actions of the Provisional IRA against the civilian population North and South.  We have seen over the past <Col N="1736" /> 18 months that there have been 87 disruptions on this line caused by bombs being placed either on the line or very close to it.  They were found but the danger is that there may be some that have not been found and may cause carnage in that area.  A total of 87 bombs have gone off and nobody has been injured but, to use a racing phrase, the odds are shortening dramatically.  It will be a very short time before this inevitable &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; occurs and the carnage that will result will be condemned by every right-thinking person on both sides of the Border.  The IRA will come out and say they made a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; and are very sorry, their usual response when they kill or maim innocent people.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the reasons why these bombs are placed but nobody knows the reasons exactly.  It has been suggested that they may be aimed at commercial targets, that the IRA are trying to divert the carriage of goods and people from the railway system to their own illicit transportation system.  That may be correct.  It has been suggested that the campaign may be part of their efforts to disrupt the economy of the North and that they hope that by attacking the economy they will gain in the long term.  It may be also that not alone are they attacking the Government, the economy and people of the North but that they are deliberately trying to disrupt the economy of the South.  The IRA have no intention of allowing the style of Government we have in the South to continue if they get their way in the North.  That is well known.  It may be that that scenario has not been looked at realistically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of the south-east are not affected greatly by disruptions on the line between Dublin and Belfast but, nevertheless, it is important that people from all parts of Ireland should condemn the disruptions on that line because the lives of people both North and South are being put in danger.  Tributes have been paid to those who travelled on the peace train. It was a symbol but the people who should be praised are those who travel everyday on that line without getting any <Col N="1737" /> publicity.  They are the ordinary people who get on the train and who realise what could ensure if a bomb goes off.  Those people travel day in and day out on that train.  They and the rail staff are the real heroes.</P>
    <P>The rail companies on both sides of the Border should be congratulated because the economic consequences of keeping that line open must be enormous.  Nevertheless, the bombings have not been allowed to disrupt the daily train services from Belfast to Dublin and we cannot but pay tribute to Iarnród Éireann and their staff for that.</P>
    <P>Every opportunity should be availed of to condemn the actions of the IRA.  I have travelled a good deal and I have heard many people describe the IRA as a liberation movement, as a freedom fighting movement that does not attack civilian targets.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  They are a murdering gang of terrorists who do not give two hoots whether the person they shoot, maim or kill is in a uniform or in a cot. Unfortunately, our appeals in this House over many years on humanitarian grounds to the IRA to desist from this action have never been listened to.  The godfathers of the IRA could not care less about what they describe as the utterances of the yuppies of this State.</P>
    <P>It is as certain as day follows night that deaths will occur on that line unless the IRA desist from their campaign.  We should continue to try to get home to those people that they are involved in a futile campaign.  The futility of it has been shown by the fact that the number travelling on that line has not decreased over the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure to support this motion in the hope that it will do some good in stopping the campaign of the IRA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion.  It seems totally illogical to me, and I will be quite clear and open about this, that those who seek to unite this island, according to themselves, should continuously disrupt the means of communication between the various <Col N="1738" /> parts of the island.  It is totally illogical that the primary rail connection not only between Belfast and Dublin but also between Derry and Dublin should be under continuous attack thereby reducing communications between both parts of this island.  Those of us who believe that the prosperity of the people of this island will only be achieved through unity, that the economic consequences of Partition have never been rightly estimated, and that for our survival in post-1992 Europe we must consider this island as one for economic purposes, believe we should strive in every way possible to integrate all our activities in the economic and social sphere in a practical way to promote the unity of the people of this island.</P>
      <P>This disruption has being going on for some considerable time.  The reasons for it have been speculated on here tonight but nobody can give the true reasons. However, it has to be recognised that one possible reason is that it is part of the tit-for-tat military exercise that is going on in the North, and that it is part of the campaign that has been going on between the IRA and the British Army.  This civilian utility has, quite wrongfully and I would condemn it, become part of that campaign.  However, we have to ask ourselves why society in this part of Ireland is so unstable that this type of civil strife goes on year after year.  We cannot just confine ourselves to simple ritual condemnations. We have to try once again to look at the fundamental reasons for this continuing civil strife.</P>
      <P>Many speakers have referred, for example, to the IRA and to Sinn Fein. We have to ask ourselves how a Member of Parliament can be elected in that part of this country by popular franchise who supports, tacitly or otherwise, this type of action and in what type of society this type of thing can happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all crave for stability and peace. We all crave for a situation where men of violence will have no succour in our community.  We all crave for a society where we have a lasting peace, not only as we have in this part of the island but throughout the island.  We have to do <Col N="1739" /> more than ritually condemn the people who perpetrate this type of activity.  It is also incumbent on us who believe that this is wrong to seek once again fundamental change.  Those of us who believe that the ultimate solution to the problems of this island is the coming together of the people in spirit and in fact must not let the activities of people we condemn hinder us in any way in pursuing what is a legitimate political belief.  I have always believed, and I still believe, that it is only when the people of Ireland can come together and work out their destiny without outside interference that true peace will be achieved on this island.  I would not like somebody to try to extend that belief into an association with anybody involved in violence.</P>
    <P>It is very important that it is recognised that this is a legitimate belief and that, at the same time, those of us who believe this, utterly and totally condemn the bombing and disruption of the rail link, we condemn every type of violence on this island, particularly the senseless, totally negative violence of the IRA campaign which is, in the view of most thinking nationalists, not only putting the life of all people, military, security, civilians and their own member's at risk, but is also putting back the day of reconciliation, peace and unity in this island.</P>

      <P>I do realise that it is late and there are several other people who wish to speak on this matter so I will restrict my remarks.</P>
      <P>This evening we discussed the matter of the levies being exacted for the TB scheme and the fact that there was an extra £1 being demanded from the farming community for the beef cattle and another 0.2p per gallon for milk.  I was making the point that in these difficult times it is difficult to expect farmers to cough up extra money for a scheme if they do not see it is effective and is in their interests.  I submit that the majority of farmers would be quite prepared to pay well over the odds if they could see this matter could be concluded successfully once and for all, and quite quickly, I am convinced of that. However, the reason they are so upset is that they feel they have not got value for the money they invested over the years; just as the taxpayer also got very bad value for money over more than 30 years in relation to bovine disease eradication.</P>
      <P>The question does arise as to why, 25 years later, we are still finding 40,000 reactor cattle in the herds.  Why has that figure not decreased?  Why are we not in the same situation as most beef and cattle producing countries in that the disease has been succesfully eradicated?  Why is the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis much greater in the southern part of the country than it is in the northern part, and that particularly in Northern Ireland the disease seems to have been successfuly dealt with?  These questions are matters for research and investigation, they are questions that have been addressed significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a suggestion that some farmers have not co-operated.  That may be but some veterinary practitioners may not have done their job.  Many farmers have co-operated fully, have presented all their animals at the time required, have had them tested and have had their reactors removed from the herd.  They are the people who can feel most aggrieved <Col N="1741" /> about the situation.  It is obvious that we must implement the rules.  There is no point introducing rules in relation to bovine disease eradication if they are not implemented.  In many cases in the past it appears that that was not done.</P>
    <P>I will return to a point that was made earlier in relation to what the director of ERAD had to say and the reasons eradication may not have been more successful. He said there were three very important factors which needed to be taken into account; first, the failure to take out all infected animals; second, the failure to completely lock up infection; and third, the failure to control the geographical spread of bovine TB.  In relation to the taking out of infected animals it is obvious that the present testing procedures are not adequate.  For that reason I hope the advancement and the investigation of the blood test can be brought forward as quickly as possible to introduce what appears to be a very definitive test to establish whether animals have bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>I have personal experience of it where one can go through a herd test and have it clear, send cattle to the factory and have lesions appear.  It would seem axiomatic that if there are lesions present in an animal, the test which is designed to establish whether that animal has tuberculosis should be effective and should be able to pick up that animal.  It appears that that has not always been the case and that animals which were infected were able to move about the country infecting other animals without being picked up.  That is a matter of serious concern to all of us.</P>
    <P>The quality of the testing is obviously something that must be addressed.  While I welcome many of the things the Minister said, I do have some reservations about the fact that he did not envisage that there would be improvements in this respect until 1991.  I realise that these matters take time but something must be done to improve the quality of testing, whether by supervising what the veterinary practitioners do, by introducing independent veterinary practitioners in certain circumstances or whatever, but <Col N="1742" /> certainly the quality of testing does need to be improved.</P>
    <P>The other matter is pre-movement testing.  This seems to have got to the point where on particular group of people say 40 days and another group say 50 days and somebody else says 90 days, and at the end of the period we really do not know how many days it should be.  It seems to have got to the point where, if somebody suggests 44 days, some other group with equal legitimacy will say 45 days; and it has got to a ridiculous stage. I cannot see why it is impossible for a group of experts to sit down around the table and come up with a figure which is acceptable to all.  The primary objective of the exercise must be to pick up the reactors and to eliminate them from the herd.  I agree with the Minister when he said that to identify reactors, to lock up infection and to lift restrictions only when it is absolutely safe to do so, is the correct thing.  It is as simple and as complicated as that.</P>
    <P>Several people have spoken about wildlife this afternoon.  I do not think anybody, whether it be the IFA, ERAD or anybody else, is suggesting that badgers are the primary agent of disease transfer. What people are saying is that badgers are a factor in certain areas or certain black spots in transmitting the disease.  More testing needs to be carried out in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he intends to look at two particular areas.  My understanding this afternoon is that 100 licences to test badgers for TB in known disease black spots have been applied for and that that matter has not been pursued.  If there are black spots the least we can do is identify to what extent the badger is a factor in transmitting the disease. Nobody anywhere is suggesting that every badger in the country should be eliminated.  There seems to be a perception abroad that the badgers should be removed.  That is not the case.  What is the case is that in certain particular black spots where other explanations do not seem to be adequate the badger is implicated and we must establish the degree to which he is implicated and in <Col N="1743" /> certain circumstances, in certain confined areas, if he needs to be removed.  The badgers themselves are suffering from this disease and are dying a very painful death.</P>
    <P>The other matter I want to mention is compensation.  I note what the Minister said in relation to the principle that compensation should be kept in line with market trends.  Unfortunately at the moment the market trends are going in the wrong direction, so I am a little uncomfortable about that particular matter.</P>
    <P>While we discuss the badgers and other matters relating to these transfers it is obvious that one of the biggest factors is the movement of animals, the very many movements that take place within an animal's lifetime.  Possibly that is one of the reasons the situation is better in Northern Ireland.  I would once again, as we did before Christmas, urge the Minister to introduce a computerised system of checking the movement of animals.  Such a system is in operation in Northern Ireland and seems to work well. I do not see why a programme which is available in Northern Ireland cannot be implemented quite speedily, effectively and cost efficiently here.  That is something the Minister referred to in his speech.  I would urge him to be even more vigorous in his pursuit of that particular matter.  I understand there are electronic systems now available where a vet could go to a herd, test it, and if the farmer has a modem all his records on a particular herd would be available instantly to the vet.  Then in terms of going to the mart to sell the animal that modern could be brought to the mart and a track kept on the animal's movement throughout its lifetime.  In a technological age we should be able to use the latest technology if it means that we can eradicate this disease.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the matter of the pre-movement test.  The time has come to support ERAD in what it is suggesting.  It is unfortunate that both the veterinary practitioners and the IFA have withdrawn from that body, but the time has come for plain speaking because if <Col N="1744" /> we do not get our act together before the beginning of 1993 this will have very serious consequences not just for beef production and bovine animals within this country but also for our meat trade on the export market.  There are certain aspects of the Minister's speech about which I am unhappy but I do support its main thrust and for that reason my party will be supporting this matter.</P>

      <P>We could remind ourselves what Brendan Behan's views were about farming.  He had views on farming as he had about most things.  In Holland, he said, it was a science, in England, a hobby and in Ireland a bloody misfortune. He did not use the word &ldquo;bloody&rdquo; but I will not be any less parliamentary than that.  I will use that instead of the exact adjective that Brendan Behan used.</P>
      <P>It is an awful misfortune that we are here again tonight.  Nine months ago we were discussing this very topic.  I spoke at length, as did many Members of this House and we expressed our views, misgiving, concerns and hopes of what was to come in terms of the improvements that were being made at the time by the ERAD Board.  The Minister had come back looking for more money from the farmers pointing out that it was in the farmers' interest to keep paying up, that, yes, a solution was imminent, that they would resolve the problem of bovine TB. The Minister, has nothing if not neck to come back here again tonight looking for more money.  If we had the confidence, and if the farming community had the confidence, that the answer was in the Minister's speech this afternoon, that the ERAD board had the answer, that anyone could tell them how bovine TB was spread and that this final formula or equation would reserve the problem, there would be no difficulty in getting the extra levies he is now requesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every few months the Minister comes back into this House with another solution or half solution or another version of the same solution and looks for more money.  He points out that it is in the farmers' interest that they eradicate <Col N="1745" /> bovine TB, it is in the interests of our exports, and it is in the interests of Europe post-1992.  We agree.  Of course it is in all our interests to eradicate bovine TB.  We have been talking about this in this House and in the other House for 35 years or more.  I have lost count.  I have only been about eight years in the Houses of the Oireachtas and this must be at least the sixth if not seventh occasion that I have spoken on the levy issue and on bovine TB in particular.  How many more times will we all traipse in here in the small hours of the morning to try to tease out the problem, express our fears and feel that some solution is imminent or that those who have the system in charge at the moment know where they are going.  I do not envy them their job.</P>
    <P>I notice, metaphorically speaking, the smiles on the faces of the Department of Agriculture people, other than the ERAD board, because as the ERAD board gets deeper and deeper into the mire with the vets, with the farmers, with the marts, with the IFA and everyone else at the moment there is a sort of &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; smile appearing in their corner though they would not admit to it.  There was great difficulty.  Discretion was needed and diplomacy was perhaps lacking when ERAD was set up and given money to do what the officials in the Department would like to have had a go at doing, if properly funded, for decades. There was difficulty and the thing was a little awkward all around.  The wry smiles tells another story, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>I only hope the Minister can salvage with the ERAD board and the farming community generally the awful situation that faces him at the moment.  No matter what we all say, and he will hear tonight a few home truths and we will speak frankly &mdash; I always do and I know Members of this House did this afternoon as well &mdash; but at the end of the day we have to eradicate bovine TB but we have no confidence that the Minister is going about it the right way.  Politically he distances himself &mdash; I mean the Government collectively &mdash; from the decisions and from the unpopular choices that have to be made.  He can say the ERAD board <Col N="1746" /> made the proposals so ERAD are supposed to take the ire of the public and the farmers rather than the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator would just wait I was going to make that point myself because certainly our hands are not clean on this issue.  I was frank about that fact when I spoke about it nine months ago and I will be frank again now if you will have a little bit of patience, Senator Byrne.  I shall hold my breath awaiting his contribution as soon as I sit down.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments failed to fund properly the necessary scheme.  I was extremely disappointed, to come straight to the point Senator Byrne was referring to, with the way the second last Coalition Government betrayed, as far as I am concerned, their Minister for Agriculture by withdrawing funding that had been earmarked or indicated that it would be provided in the three year programme. They got the first year and it was limited the second year and limited the third year so that the programme the Minister had in mind could not be implemented.  That was a disastrous decision.  That was one of many bad decisions taken over the past few decades in relation to TB eradication. Any time money was short when it came to Estimates or the budget a bit was lobbed off the TB eradication programme and another bit was lobbed off OPW.  They were sort of sitting ducks, and they were hard to pinpoint, no particular body would squeal and roar and normally the Minister of the day got away with that type of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is that in today's figures we have spent over £1 billion on talking about eradicating bovine TB but we are hardly any better off than when we started.  One could talk about the different methods of measuring the levels of TB but we have made very little progress. There have been blips here and there when it got a bit better, then it got a bit worse and the graph comes up again, depending on the money provided and <Col N="1747" /> on the bursts of efforts that were made intermittently over the decades.</P>
    <P>The history of the eradication of bovine TB must be the single greatest economic scandal of the past 30 years, if not since the foundation of the State.  We have spent £1 billion to eradicate one disease from one section of our animal population and we have not managed to do it. We are no closer to the answer.  We will blame the fact that computerisation should have been used many years before it was and that if animal records had been properly computerised we would now have a movement permit system which I agree is the only real way we will be able to trace and identify the movement of all animals.  Movements is the key to the problem.</P>
    <P>We do not know how bovine TB is spread.  There are different views.  Speak to any farmer and he will give you his version, speak to the vets and they will give you their version, speak to the Department and there will be many different versions.  We do not know precisely how bovine TB is spread and that is the problem.  That is back to epidemiology. How little has been spent on that?  What proportion of the £1 billion has gone on epidemiology?  Virtually none, a little bit here and there in sporadic spots.  The job of the epidemiologist would be to find out how the disease is spread and to curtail its spread.  We do not know, the money is not being put into epidemiology.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will probably tell me in his response that a unit is being set up as part of ERAD.  What are they doing?  Why have we not got these units in the blackspots all around our country? We are now having random sampling in every county.  We have stretched the DVO staff so far now that even the areas that should be having concentrated attention are not getting it.  When there is a spontaneous breakdown, there is not the staff there to go out and investigate. Surely, from the spontaneous breakdown we have more to learn about bovine TB than from any other area.  A herd has been clean for years and years, no stock bought in, where they breed all their own <Col N="1748" /> replacements, clean water supply, good animal husbandry, good housing, proper fencing, proper disinfection and total compliance with the testing requirements and suddenly they go down in the round test.  When that farmer has done everything possible by the book and has a breakdown we would have a lot to learn if we thoroughly investigated the spontaneous breakdown.  If we really put the resources into epidemiology, if we really went to look and investigate as to how in that case where you can rule out so many factors that farmer still could go down in the test, we would learn something.</P>
    <P>Why are we not concentrating resources on those type of cases?  I do not know, I can never get any reply to that specific question.  I will be told there is a shortage of money, lack of manpower, that the AOs are doing this and that.  The AOs are running round now punching ears for beef premia and checking up on ewe numbers.  They seem to be doing everything except concentrating on the disease problem in our herd.  Perhaps we need to increase the staff at that level because the strict public sector embargo is gone and apparently we can increase staff where it is essential.  Having spent £1 billion and with this, hopefully, last burst to get results in terms of funding and concentration of effort, we must ensure that the staff is where it is needed so that that is not used as an excuse at the end of the day.  Let us never hear that lack of proper staff in the right place hindered what we are now talking about, this hopefully final burst to resolve what is a major problem.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister and the ERAD board announced more tightening up in relation to the movement of cattle to try to improve the very bleak situation in relation to bovine TB.  The 120 day pre-movement test has been brought back to 60 days.  I have no argument with that. At the moment within the 120 days some stock used to move ten or 12 times.  It is hard to grasp the concept.  They must have been on a cattle lorry going from the west to the east and back to the midlands to one factory, three or four trips around the marts in between and <Col N="1749" /> finally slaughtered.  How they had time to put on weight and get any sort of respectable price I do not know, but it is a fact that cattle had as many as ten or 12 different movements within the 120 days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an exaggeration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact.  That is a fact documented by specific DVOs.  Is it any wonder that ERAD would request the reduction from 120 days to 60 days to try to control movement?  I support that but what I have major difficulty with is the two-stop concept the Minister talks about.  Basically, that means that you get your animals tested with a view to bringing them to a mart to sell them.  You bring them to the mart and it is a very depressed trade, as it has been for some time now.  All weights of cattle are back on average £100 a head on this time last year.  I am averaging that out some will be a bit more and some will be a bit less.</P>
      <P>The farmer takes his cattle to the mart but he is not getting even an economic return, let alone a reasonable profit, and he takes them home again as he cannot face the bank manager with a smaller cheque than he originally got from him to purchase the cattle.  Under the Minister's proposals the farmer must dispose of those cattle within seven days or wait to have them tested again, which he cannot do until after 60 days.  This means he might have to wait 40 days to retest if he originally had them tested specifically to sell.  In the meantime, there might have been a two or three weeks flier if intervention came in for the month &mdash; we have these short snappy periods of intervention &mdash; but that farmer cannot sell when the trade improves because he has to wait 60 days to retest and then go through the whole procedure again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The factories and the middlemen know when the farmer has his hands up, that the cattle have to be sold within seven days and they can take advantage and there is no doubt that factories will take advantage.  We are in a free market economy and there is no room for softies when <Col N="1750" /> it comes to the profit and loss game.  They will do the best job they can for their company and they will purchase stock as cheaply as they can.  They will know when a farmer is sitting at home with a star over the cattle saying, &ldquo;must be sold in seven days&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Hussey &mdash; I will stand corrected on that &mdash; who suggested to the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, that he consider reducing the 120 days to 45 days with no restrictions on stops.  I am a little suspicious of that proposal which I feel might be planted.  I know the Minister is not altogether happy with the 60-day two stop tests.  He cannot be happy politically, considering the adverse reaction it has had from the different sectors. I heard on the media only yesterday that there was consideration of a 45-day nonstop test.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister to come clean with us.  If he wants proposals we will all give him proposals. The 60 days with two stops as presented are totally unacceptable; the period of 120 to 60 days in itself is not the problem, I support that, but limiting it to two stops with seven days in between would strike at the very heart of the cattle trade. Farmers would have no option but to sell at the first opportunity, literally with their hands up.</P>
    <P>There are many variances within the 60 days which the Minister could look at. For example, if the Minister is insisting on two stop concepts, why are there only seven days between?  Why is there a limit within the 60 days?  Could he not allow the farmer to present the cattle to mart twice at any stage within the 60 days?  I presume, having talked to vets, that the reason the two stops within seven days was mooted and strongly supported by them is because when the cattle come back from the mart, unsold, they are at risk of spreading infection throughout the rest of the herd on the farm.  I fully agree that the mart is one of the major sources of infection because there are cattle coming in from all sources, badly or inadequately tested or not tested.  Perhaps tags were switched, having travelled in dirty cattle lorries, etc.  The saga goes on. Marts are, by their very nature, a major <Col N="1751" /> sources of infection and I think it was intended that the spread of infection from the marts would be limited if cattle were not sold and had to return home to the farm.</P>
    <P>However, when the cattle have visited the mart and returned home, whether they are one day, seven days or 40 days at home, the infection has come back from the mart.  Limiting it to seven days will not reduce infection from the first mart they visited.  If they come home they risk bringing back infection.  Why allow them home from the mart for seven days? Why seven days only?  Why add to the bureaucratic nightmare of monitoring and administering the system from the marts and the factories point of view? Why add to the misery of the cattle farmers who are on the floor, who have their noses rubbed in it, to use the vernacular? The Minister is compounding the misery of these farmers for no reason. I cannot see the advantage.  We would all take medicine if the reason for it was abundantly clear.  I cannot understand why to bring the cattle back from the mart and keep them at home for seven days is any less a risk of spreading infection than keeping them at home for 30 days.  If you bring cattle back from the mart at all you then risk bringing infection home.</P>
    <P>Within the 60 days there are other possible formulae which I ask the Minister to consider.  Either loosen up the two stop concept as proposed, which is unacceptable, or perhaps there should be no stops within 40 days, as was mooted by Senator Hussey this morning.  Perhaps the Minister has already agreed to reconsider the matter.  I hope he will be frank and will accept the points we have made.</P>
    <P>How will the marts implement the two stop system?  I presume when the cattle arrive to be sold, having been pre-movement tested, each card is inspected punched, marked, signed and dated.  Is the Minister increasing manpower at all the major marts?  Is he increasing the number of AOs to do this because, if not, he will have to.  In Enniscorthy mart 1,300 to 1,500 cattle are sold every Tuesday and <Col N="1752" /> that does not include calf sales but regular sale of stores, fat cattle and heifers.  Three AOs operate the present system.  If that system is slowed down to the extent that every card will have to be signed, stamped, punched or identified in some way when cattle are first presented at marts and rechecked when they are presented the second time to be sure that there are only seven days since the previous outing, the present manpower will not be able to operate the scheme.</P>
    <P>The proposed formula has caused mayhem in the industry.  The Minister has not explained how he will monitor or administer the scheme at the marts and the factories and we need to know exactly what his thinking is on this?  It might help to calm some of the fears and concerns in certain quarters if we knew precisely how he felt the scheme would operate.</P>
    <P>As proposed, the scheme will destroy normal trade.  I do not carry any particular brief for the marts.  They provide an important function in rural communities. We only have to look back at the cattle trade over the centuries to remind ourselves of the evolution of the mart concept in rural Ireland.  We have had a cattle trade for decades for centuries. In the year 3000 BC we first started livestock farming in a serious way with the neolithic agriculturalists.  They introduced livestock rearing to Ireland and that was a few years ago.  We have a tremendous natural advantage with our soil and climate.  Long ago, 3000 BC, they recognised the natural advantage we had for cattle rearing.  We are still clogging up the system here and we still cannot take that natural advantage as we look towards 1993.  This was followed by the Celts, the Brehon Laws, the Anglo-Norman invasion, the Penal Laws and up the 17th century when we were exporting cattle to Britain.  We exported store cattle to Britain until the Cattle Acts of the 1660s which we can remind ourselves of from our history books.  After the Cattle Acts, our attention turned to trade in salted meat, butter and dairy products, generally, with Europe and further afield. The internal significance of the cattle trade was just as important over those <Col N="1753" /> years as the external, as the export trade was served by cattle fairs.  Many here tonight remember those fairs and partook in them.  The cattle export trade was served over the centuries by cattle fairs with the fair day drawing business interests together and forming the first semblance of economic unity in rural Ireland.  From the fairs evolved the marts and the system we have today.  The role of the cattle mart preceded by the cattle fair can be clearly traced back to the 17th century, and we understand their importance in terms of a focal point of economic unity in rural Ireland since then.  The marts have a point but, frankly, if we stand on the toes of the marts it is not the main issue here.  They have played a very important role but what we are talking about is eradicating bovine TB. If I was convinced that what the Minister is proposing notwithstanding the difficulties it will cause to vets, the marts, the factories and even to the farmers, would solve the problem, we would have to take the medicine.  However.  I am not convinced.  I have heard enough about solutions, about different formulae from various Ministers and their advisers, all having different views.  I am sick to death of listening to the views of different sectors. We are going nowhere fast.  This is the single greatest economic scandal this country has faced, virtually since the foundation of the State and we still have no answers to it.  The vets blame the badger and the movement of cattle and the farmers blame the vets and the badger.  Every sector will blame someone else but nobody seems to be able to get all the different elements in the equation right and, therefore, find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>There have been improvements. ERAD introduced a tightening up in many areas that will, hopefully, contribute to the solution.  There is no evidence of it yet but commonsense dictates that ERAD must be making the right decisions.  The speedy removal of reactors, once identified, and having them slaughtered is important.  The checking of cattle in factories has been tightened <Col N="1754" /> up.  Again, that has to be in the best interests of a solution.</P>
    <P>The blood test has been mentioned. Hopefully, we will have early news in relation to the gama interferon test for bovine TB.  Perhaps the Minister will be a little more forthcoming in his response as to the progress and the research that is going on in relation to that test.  It must be better than the non-specific test we have at the moment.  The test we use at the moment is, effectively, a screen test for the herd.  It is not animal specific, unlike the brucellosis test which picked up each individually infected animal which could then be lifted fast from the herd.  It is a screen test.  There is a hit-and-miss element in relation to it.  There have been the false positives and the inconclusives &mdash; we have debated them all before &mdash; going to the mart.  There has been major economic misery to rural Ireland year in and year out, with all its consequences.</P>
    <P>What is the position in relation to electronic tagging?  We talked about it nine months ago but have not heard much about it in the interim.  There are fashions in terms of the aspects of this problem. At any one time there are three or four issues on the table but it is a multi-factorial problem.  What place does the Minister feel electronic tagging will play towards bringing about a solution?  When will we be in a position to operate a system of electronic tagging?</P>
    <P>Quality testing has been a sort of buzz word in terms of eradication of bovine TB.  There are many question marks over the quality of the testing that has been done during the years.  There is a major human problem here.  The farmer is dependent on his vet and the vet is dependent on his client farmer for his living.  In rural Ireland, particularly in the smaller villages and towns, everybody knows everyone else and the vet who might be knocking you in the test on a Wednesday might be the same man you would have a drink with at the mart or in the bar on a Saturday night.  It is a bit like the doctorpatient relationship.  Perhaps there is a tendency to give the benefit of the doubt when the vet knows that a farmer has six <Col N="1755" /> children, is in debt in the bank and has the bank manager screaming at him.  What is the thinking in relation to that?  What is the thinking in relation to the quality testing we must demand now to get a resolution to the problem?</P>
    <P>Interestingly, I heard from a private vet recently that a problem has arisen in relation to the syringes that are being used.  I have spoken about bovine TB umpteen times.  It is an area I have taken an interest in and I read reports on it and follow any debate on it in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> or the <i>Farming Independent</i> or whatever publication I happen to be reading.  According the vet I was talking to, it has been pointed out that many of the syringes they are using for testing are over ten years old.  Apparently those syringes are manufactured in Scotland. Somebody must have a monopoly on them if they are only manufactured in Scotland but this is my information and I stand to be corrected.  Perhaps, the Minister will confirm or deny what I say.  The old type of syringe does not have the same built-in obsolescence as modern disposable equipment might have today. The ratchets of the syringe &mdash; the little notches that decide the amount of serum that should go into the animal &mdash; are worn on the vast majority of those old type syringes which have been used throughout the country.  Instead of getting three ccs &mdash; I am not sure exactly what the dose is &mdash; the first animal might get six, the second animal one and the next animal could get none, if the ratchet slipped and did not hold the indicator at the right point on the syringe.  The needles, which were made to last the same time as the syringe, do not last as long.  They have to be replaced frequently. The point where the needle actually joins the syringe often leaks which means the accuracy regarding the quantity of serum going into each animal is questionable.  There have been cases of bent needles and all sorts of other question marks about the actual equipment that vets are using to perform the test.</P>
    <P>It all seemed highly improbable to me <Col N="1756" /> until I asked further questions.  Apparently, ERAD have issued letters to all the private vets in recent times &mdash; I do not know when this came out, it was kept very quiet &mdash; stating that they all must have their syringes serviced in Scotland and furnish two certificates or invoices proving that they had bought two new syringes before a certain date.  They are given a specific date by which they must have two new syringes to ensure that the equipment used matches the quality testing now being demanded.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that the syringes nearly all the vets use could be a major contributor to the appalling mess that has been made of this scheme over the years. ERAD are now pursuing this matter and the vet that told me this showed me the letter he had received from ERAD telling him to have two new syringes by some time this summer.</P>
    <P>Bovine TB has been virtually eliminated in Northern Ireland although there has been an increase in incidence of the disease in recent times but, officially, they have virtually eliminated the disease. The number of syringes being sent per annum by private veterinary practitioners from the North to Scotland to be serviced is six times that from the South.  This aspect has only recently come to my attention but it is something I will be looking at with interest in the future.</P>
    <P>The efficacy of the serum itself has been mentioned.  The source of the serum has been changed over the years.  It was Dutch top and British bottom.  Then they went to Dutch top and bottom, or British top and bottom.  The graphs and the whole estimation of the efficacy was based on a certain combination, on a certain source of serum many years ago. The source was changed without the equivalent testing and standardisations done in the Department.  I have always been concerned about that aspect.  It is a questionable scientific practice but it is a point we do not hear too much about from the Minister, or indeed any of the officials.</P>
    <P>I recall two or three times over the past few years asking the Minister of the day, including a Minister of my Party, to <Col N="1757" /> explain to me in simple language how calves from reactor herds were free to travel the country and be sold.  Surely calves from reactor herds are a major source of infection and yet they could travel the length and breadth of the country and be sold quite freely.  ERAD, and the chairman of the board of ERAD agreed that there was a huge anomaly there and obviously a major source of infection that had not been controlled. Therefore, they decided that all calves had to be tagged.  In other words, test the herd, tag the calves and so on.  The ingenuity of the farming community has meant that now nobody has their annual round test until after the calves are sold, in case the herd would go down and the calves could not be sold.  In areas where this is an issue, they are behind in their testing because they are cutting silage or at the mart or simply not available on the day they are asked to present for a test. They will get around to it within the year or whenever they have to, but they are way behind in terms of that round of testing.  What I thought would be an excellent solution to the anomaly of calves from reactor herds travelling freely around the country has not turned out to be so.  Now farmers are not testing until they have sold their calves.  This means the calves still travel freely around the country and we do not know until they are gone if they were from reactor herds. That area needs to be looked at and needs to be tightened up.</P>
    <P>There are 10,000 to 15,000 dangerous herds in the country, herds that have continuously been a problem, locked up most of the time or, if not locked up they are only free for a short time when there is another breakout.  Our ambition must be to keep those herds clean.  I have heard it said time and time again by the present Administration that we must keep clean herds clean.  That should be our goal but to discover how bovine TB is spread, would get us out of this appalling mire.</P>
    <P>In other countries restricted herds are given yellow cards and they can only trade with other yellow card holders, in other words, there is no risk of spreading animals from infected herds to clean <Col N="1758" /> herds.  Maybe we will have to consider that here.  There seems to be benefit in that policy but with 15,000 dangerous herds there are plenty of opportunities to trade among themselves without risking the clean herds.  If our ambition is to maintain clean herds we could perhaps consider letting the infected herds trade among themselves which would be a reprieve to farmers whose herds are locked up without enough fodder for the winter.</P>
    <P>New Zealand wildlife has caused major hardship in terms of bovine TB and they also have a problem with opossums.  If wildlife enthusiasts are up in arms about the badger in this country it is nothing to the reaction in New Zealand if you mention the opossum.  The opossum is a national emblem &mdash; if that is the correct expression &mdash; it has a particular meaning, and it is dear to the hearts of the New Zealanders but it is an active carrier of bovine TB.  It has got so far out of control in New Zealand that they have divided the country into endemic and nonendemic areas.  There are major financial hardships and implications for the beef export trade generally in New Zealand. They have lost control of the bovine TB scheme because of the wildlife factor they have not been able to control.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the wildlife factor is a big issue in this country and we have to take a reasonably pragmatic view of it.  I do not support the willy-nilly slaughter of badgers, nor would I say that no licences should be issued to take out badgers.  If we overly restrict licences, farmers will take the law into their own hands.  Frustration with the lack of progress in the bovine TB eradication scheme has driven farmers in many areas to take the law into their own hands and to take out badgers.  The way they will take them out will be far less humane than if a licence were given and it was done under controlled conditions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be sensitive, but pragmatic, in how he deals with this. Perhaps we should learn from what happened in Offaly without a licence.  There must be a balance.  We only need to protect the healthy badger.  The infected <Col N="1759" /> badger is no good either to wildlife enthusiasts or to the country generally. A reasonably pragmatic approach can be taken without over-killing in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister was rather congratulatory when he pointed out the number of reactors that have been taken out in the last year, an increase from 30,000 to 43,000.  According to dipstick and random sampling &mdash; I am only quoting that as my source, perhaps it is not gospel, but it is the only source we have at the moment &mdash; we should be taking out 60,000 reactors a year.  That means we are leaving one-third of the infected animals behind.  We do not know how bovine TB is spread but it does not take a lot of intelligence to come to the conclusion that if one-third of the infected animals are left behind, there is a major source of infection which is causing some type of lateral spread.  Much work needs to be done in that area.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the pre-movement test and its extreme restriction in terms of the two stop tests, with seven days between, has to be measured against what is happening in relation to brucellosis. Brucellosis testing has been specific, it has been eradicated and, officially, we are brucellosis free.  Nonetheless, cases of brucellosis are on the increase.  There is no pre-movement test for brucellosis and that I cannot understand. There are stories of cows aborting in the west, being presented two days later at a mart ending up at a mart in the midlands and, finally being killed.  It is an accepted fact that for 14 days after a cow calves or aborts she is at her most infectious in terms of brucellosis.  We have no pre-movement test for brucellosis and I do not know how that can be justified.  I am assuming we are talking about bovine disease levies, generally, so brucellosis needs mention.</P>
    <P>We also want to know the position in relation to leucosis.  I do not think the Department are coming clean with us on either brucellosis or leucosis.  Those diseases have very serious implications for our cattle herd.  We have heard stories <Col N="1760" /> and we can all quote instances from different marts and DVOs around the country but officially, we cannot get the answers we would like to put on record.</P>
    <P>I have not had the opportunity to welcome the Minister since his recent illness. I am delighted to see him in such good form and thank him for coming back to us this evening after his six months onerous job as President of the EC Agriculture Ministers.</P>

      <P>That is for another day. We will sort out what was done another day, but I am delighted to see the Minister in such good form here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the points that have been put by the various contributors will have reached the Minister by note.  I would appreciate a considered response to the different issues.  Many of us have spoken at length on many occasions on this issue and expressed reservations.  The Minister, who has returned to the Chamber, will be aware that I accused his colleague of having a good neck nine months ago, the last occasion he sought to increase the levies.  If we had the confidence that the solution was there we would take the medicine to cure the problem.  I can see levies being increased year in year out, and being told it is in our interests but, especially, in the farmers' interests that they should cough up.  Now, when the cattle trade is in the doldrums and the cost price squeze is at its worst, with the cyclical nature of the industry and little prospect of those cycles being ironed out, <Col N="1761" /> the Minister can understand why there is great anger all round when we have to go back to the farming community and say the levy is to be increased again.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the defections from the ERAD board.  I have some reservations about defections being the best method of expressing anger.  Maybe they are.  Since I have not had the opportunity to speak to any of the IFA members who chose to withdraw for the ERAD board, perhaps it would have been fairer to speak to them to find out exactly what was in their minds, but I would rather fight from within, to have my own viewpoint heard and to try to change their minds or modify their views or formulae.  I am not so sure what they can do from the outside except scream and roar.  The board will continue to do whatever they like and those who left are not inside affecting changes.  I have serious reservations about that as a tactic; it might not be my way of behaving.  One may get media headlines for 24 hours but then that is the end of it.  One is not at the table to resolve the problems.</P>
    <P>I also would like to put a view that is held, that the marts had a very strong influence on the IFA members who withdrew. I defended the marts and pointed out their virtue earlier but I must also say that they collect the IFA levy.  There is an opinion that the marts put pressure on the IFA to get out of ERAD on the threat that the levy collection system would be put in jeopardy.  The marts, above all sectors, have a lot to lose if the proposals as now mooted in terms of tightening down on the pre-movement tests, stick. The view, rightly or wrongly, is that the marts put the squeeze on the IFA.  When one considers the position of the ICMSA who do not have any levies collected at the marts and who to date are on the ERAD board fighting the cause from within, it adds strength of that viewpoint.</P>
    <P>The veterinary profession are peeved too, and the reasons were outlined earlier today.  They have left the ERAD board and I regret that.  We can all behave in a certain way in the heat of the moment, we can all reach the stage where we have taken enough and can put up with no <Col N="1762" /> more.  Certainly, the kind of tactics I would employ if put to the wall on an issue such as this would be to stay in and create as much mayhem and problems for the Minister, the ERAD board and everybody else in the hope of getting my own way.  In a democracy majority decision rules.  Sometimes it goes against us and on occasions we win.</P>
    <P>The two mart boards are meeting on Friday to consider whether they should withdraw from ERAD or not.  If they do there will be very few people left on ERAD.  When I consider the support ERAD got from me, from my party and from everyone else when it was established, and the hopes and aspirations we had for the ERAD board in terms of resolving this appalling problem, I am very sorry to see the board decimated.  I can only hope the withdrawals are temporary and that the various bodies will come back in and give the Minister and the board hell.  In a democratic spirit they should accept the outcome.  They should fight from within, try to modify and change and have their viewpoint heard. Nobody will listen once one has left the room and closed the door.  I have my concerns in that area.  I am not quite sure exactly what their thinking was when they left but I am concerned.</P>
    <P>The American humorist, H. L. Mencken made a point of many an Irish cynic when he said that farmers engaged in practices which would land businessmen in bankruptcy courts or in jail yet Governments simply sympathised with them, pat them on their back and remark that they were the salt of the earth and their country's mainstay.  We are all aware of the attitude, &ldquo;sure it cannot be helped&rdquo;, and &ldquo;we have survived over the years&rdquo;.  He was jesting; Mencken is a humorist, but there is a certain grain of truth in that what he says can fit the attitude of many a farmer towards disease eradication.  In defence of the farmers they co-operated fully with the brucellosis scheme.  They could see very clearly the economic impact of brucellosis on their herds.  They could quantify the economic impact on their own bank accounts and they co-operated <Col N="1763" /> fully.  For some reason everyone's efforts, those of successive Governments, of the ERAD board and the AOs have failed to raise the consciousness of farmers in relation to the importance of the eradication of bovine TB.  We all know the importance in terms of our beef exports and we are told we will face bankruptcy if we do not resolve the problem by 1993. We hear this time in, time out, but somehow it is not registering with us.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will understand if we cannot support his request for an increase in the levy.  We have never failed to give any Government, or any Minister, support on previous occasions but we cannot give him the support because of his proposals to reduce the pre-movement test to a two-stop test within 60 days.  I have no problem with the 60 days and the Minister was not here when I made that point.  I must beg the Minister's indulgence while I mention my points to him.  Is he considering a 45-day test with no stops?  Will he consider other formulae within the 60 days?  We can reach agreement on certain matters, help to modify the furious views in rural Ireland in relation to the proposals.</P>
    <P>I accept it benefits the farmers to eradicate disease but the Minister cannot go back year after year and ask for just a little bit more or say it will be gone next year or the year after.  This represents the greatest national scandal the country has ever faced and we are still saying just another £1, another 0.2p on the gallon or whatever.  When will this stop?  When will we have all the functions in the equation in place so that we can have a solution to this appalling scandal?</P>
    <P>How is it that other countries have eradicated bovine TB?  It cannot be that the farmers are fiddling the system to that extent.  They eradicated brucellosis, after all.  They had no problem in co-operating with the brucellosis scheme.  The vets cannot all be bad.  There were 12 Apostles and one was bad and in any sector, one will get a couple of bad apples.  The vets cannot all have been bad all of the time. Wildlife cannot be the only cause of the spread of the disease.  How is it that we <Col N="1764" /> are virtually at the level we were when we started decades ago?  We will trot the figures out, a bit better here and a bit worse there, but we are no nearer a complete solution and that is the problem we are facing.  That is what the scandal is all about.  I hope the Minister has some answers for us because those of us who have taken an interest in the eradication of this disease have been very patient for a long time.</P>
    <P>Slurry spreading was mentioned earlier. Have the ERAD board looked at the mechancial spreading of slurry on grassland which will be grazed by cattle? Airborne infection is supposed to be one of the sources of spreading of infection and I should like to know the views of ERAD on that.  Good farmers who understand the scientific problems only spread slurry on tillage land, not on grassland that would be grazed by cattle. Unfortunately, far too many farmers spread slurry on grassland that will be grazed by cattle because nobody has said otherwise.  It has not been an issue but could it be an issue?  We have made many points.  We have discussed the millions of pounds that have been spent but £50 million, less £1 million or so, to cover administration costs, was the cost of a scheme this year to eradicate one disease from our cattle herd.  Brucellosis is increasing and we have not heard anything about outbreaks of leucosis.  Bovine spongiform encephalopathy is causing us concern but one disease is costing £50 million in one year.  How many more years?  Is it not time those of us who are responsibly committed to the democratic system and to answerability to the taxpayer for this revenue called for a public inquiry into the entire bovine TB scheme?</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Minister to instigate a public inquiry.  It is not just the Minister, or the Government; this goes back decades.  We have spent £1 billion.  We have no answers and we are no nearer a solution.  Do the public not deserve a public inquiry as to how this scandal could have gone on for so long?  We need the matter cleared up one way or another. <Col N="1765" /> Too much is at stake.  An enormous contribution to our GNP comes directly from the cattle trade and our exports are tremendously important to us.  As we face 1993 the one point that we can hammer the table in Brussels on is production in areas where we have natural advantage and what greater natural advantage have we than grass-based production from our national herd?  There is nothing else the Minister can defend more vigorously.  He can try to defend every sector, and all primary production of agriculture, but the emphasis he can put into defending grass-based production here knows no end and I am sure the Minister will agree with me on that.  May we please have a public inquiry into the national scandal that has been the bovine eradication scheme over the last few decades?  May we please have the answers, tighten up the scheme and engender some confidence so that the beleaguered farmers to whom we are going back to ask for another few pounds all around will at least feel we will get to the end of the road some day?  They really do not think any of us will solve this problem for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to welcome the Minister here tonight to discuss the motion before the House.  I am delighted to see the Minister, and the Government, giving their full support to the eradication of bovine TB.  For the first time in the past 40 years we can see a prospect of eventually being clear of this terrible disease. Bovine TB has caused Irish farmers inconvenience, hardship and loss of revenue over the years.  Over the last number of years there was not a full commitment to the eradication of the disease.  This was because there was not full co-operation between all the parties involved, the farmers, vets, the Department and so on.  ERAD seems to be getting it all together and it has full responsibility for disease eradication. There was no cohesion before between all concerned but ERAD is now able to monitor the disease more accurately because of its present brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present outbreak of bovine TB <Col N="1766" /> started when testing was held up because of a go-slow for over two years.  This set us back years in the eradication of the disease.  I am delighted the Minister has come to grips with this.  Wildlife now and in the past has caused a lot of trouble by spreading diseases particularly by the badger.  The badger, some say, is the big cause of the problem while others say he is not.  In many parts of the country he is playing a big role in spreading the disease and in all this the farmer is the biggest loser.  There are more cases of hardship than we realise.  Many farmers have had to sell their herds and get out of milk before quotas came into existence.  Today they cannot get back into business because of the TB eradication scheme.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this urgently because those farmers went out of business through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>If additional funding was not given by the Minister, testing would have had to be reduced by September of this year. That would bring us back to the same stage we were in some years ago.  It would certainly not be in anybody's interest. Farmers will be more than willing to pay the extra £1 per beast and 0.2p per gallon of milk to rectify this problem.  I hope the Minister will look at the pre-movement of cattle and the two stops.  For the Minister to proceed with this will mean that farmers bringing cattle to the marketplace will have only one chance of selling their cattle.  The factories, and the dealers will take advantage of that.  This will also affect cattle and agricultural shows throughout the country if it is implemented.</P>
    <P>The testing at present as in the past, is the only form of check we have.  It may not be 100 per cent perfect but I think blood testing would be a more effective way of testing cattle.  For example, the brucellosis test is a blood test and we got rid of that disease in a very short time. The sooner the Minister can have blood testing for bovine TB implemented here the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to request the Minister to allow the 45-day testing to continue with no stops.  I cannot see how cattle can bring disease back from the marketplace <Col N="1767" /> as all cattle attending the marketplace have to be disease free.  I hope the Minister succeeds with the disease eradication scheme this time and eradicates it once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I am concerned about including the proposal to introduce very restricted movement of cattle from the west.  Every Member and the public representative, should be extremely concerned about it. In the west, unfortunately, too often cattle movement is part and parcel of life. For example, cattle born in the south are moved to the west and stay there for maybe 12 or 18 months.  They move to the midlands for fattening.  While in the west they may have moved two or three times.  That is the way of life there and we, and the Minister must recognise that. Efforts to restrict the movement of cattle is doomed to failure because of the type of farming that operates here, particularly in the west.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister is seeking additional funding from the farming community at a time when things were never as bad in Irish agriculture.  That is something the Minister must face.  I have been involved for a long time in farming, and with the farming community, and I have never known such a depressing time.  The price of all commodities &mdash; milk, beef, lamb, mutton and wool &mdash; has dropped drastically in the last 12 months.  While tillage is not popular in the area I come from those involved in it are also going through a very difficult time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad that a Minister in any Government should go before either House of the Oireachtas and seek to extract additional money from farmers at a time when they do not know how they are going to met their repayments.  The price for every product has dropped drastically in the last 12 months and unfortunately, there is no end to that trend.  Interest rates are substantially higher than they were last year and we are talking about 17 and 17.5 per cent.  The motion before the House proposes to increase the amount of the contribution which has to be paid for milk <Col N="1768" /> and beef from £6.90 to £7.90 in the case of beef.  The timing is disastrous.  I regret that the Minister did not seek to have additional funds raised in some other way.  As unpleasant as it may be, it could have come from taxation.  I do not believe that farmers should be asked for an additional contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to introduce sweeping changes in an effort to come to grips with the bovine TB problem.  By and large every Member of the Oireachtas will be prepared to support the Minister in this drive.  The only thing about it is that the vast majority of the farming community have lost confidence in the way testing has been carried out over the past 30 to 32 years.  In 1956 when testing was optional I remember a veterinary surgeon testing cattle on my father's farm.  There was a reactor and that animal which was purchased the previous year had reacted in a herd in Clare. However, because there was no restriction on the movement of reactors at that time the animal was brought to the west and sold there.  That was the first reactor on our farm and we have been involved, like every other farmer, in a testing campaign since.  What has gone wrong with the whole testing programme that this disease has not been eradicated?  Senator Doyle mentioned the success of the brucellosis scheme and Senator O'Brien suggested that we should try to identify bovine TB by blood testing.  I share Senator O'Brien's view on that.  Blood testing would be a major step forward. There is a certain amount of research going on in regard to that but until such time as we have blood testing we will never come to grips with this major problem, the cancer that has developed in regard to bovine TB testing.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts I was extremely concerned about the vast sums of money spent on the scheme.  I hasten to add that the farmers did not gain anything from it, the money went to civil servants, veterinary surgeons and a very small percentage in compensation for cattle removed from the national herd.  Everybody else was on the gravy train.  Very <Col N="1769" /> often one reads in the papers about the cost of the bovine TB testing to the taxpayer. One would imagine that the farming community was getting this money.  The percentage the farming community got as compensation for animal disease &mdash; of course I have never known compensation to fully cover losses &mdash; has been very small.</P>
    <P>In 1986 the then Secretary of the Department of Agriculture stated that extensive examination of electronic tagging was taking place.  Will the Minister say what progress has been made in that regard?  I have always shared the view that it was a tragedy to abandon the tattooing system.  It would have to some degree, eliminated some of the abuses that went on in the scheme.  All of us know that a percentage, very small I hasten to add and mostly people who were in the dealing business, were involved in tag switching.  Very often they got caught with animals they wanted to sell or were forced to sell for financial reasons.  I have no doubt that at times diseased animals were sold with false identification and, unfortunately, that led in certain circumstances to the spread of disease.  That is why I share the view that either a system of tattooing or electronic tagging would play a major role.</P>
    <P>The Department did a considerable amount of work producing what they called a tamper proof tag but we all know that that was not a success.  I understand that upwards of 40 per cent of the animals which were tagged in that way lost their tags within 12 months.  I am sure the Minister is aware that this tag was manufactured here.  Unfortunately, a vast quantity of them was purchased and left lying on shelves.  They cannot be used because the system was not a success.  I am not blaming the Minister for this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to ask why <Col N="1770" /> such vast quantities of tags were purchased without being fully checked.  We have heard a lot about the contribution of the badger to the spread of animal diseases.  In the past we did not spend enough money trying to ascertain where and why outbreaks of disease took place. We can have, for example, an area free of bovine TB for five or seven years and within a short time 50 per cent of the herds in that DED will be infected.  There is a reason for that but a proper examination as to why that happens has never been undertaken by the Department of Agriculture or, indeed, by ERAD.  I cannot understand why more effort has not been put into establishing why those outbreaks occur.</P>
      <P>In my county many farmers are convinced that the badger has contributed substantially to the spread of animal disease. A number of DEDs in south and mid-Roscommon were adversely affected and they found it very difficult to get a licence to eliminate the badger. When the badger was eliminated there was a considerable drop in animal diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to a restriction period of three clear tests, the final two of which to be at least at 90-day intervals. How does the Minister expect the farming community to comply with this? It would mean locking up their animals for 240 days.  How does he expect them to survive for those 240 days or a period of eight months?  Many of those farmers may have no feed.  They may have to back up the animals coming towards the back end of the year or they may have to no money and a bank manager pressing for repayments.  The money they borrowed may be at 17.5 per cent.  This is a real problem and I suggest to the Minister that there is no way he can impose this regulation without being prepared to pay compensation to those people who overnight have their assets frozen.  This has happened before but for far shorter periods than is being envisaged here by the Minister.  Once a farmer has his herd <Col N="1771" /> locked up, if this regulation goes through, it will mean that the bare minimum the herd is locked up for is eight months but it could be locked up for a year or two years without any income for the farmer. I honestly believe that if that man or any farmer were to contest that regulation in court it would not hold up.</P>
    <P>Major questions have arisen recently with regard to the members of the board of ERAD &mdash; a number of them have pulled out.  Is the Minister aware of the reason they have pulled out?  If so, perhaps he would inform the House.  I certainly have not got it quite clear.  I have heard reasons why they have pulled out but I do not know for definite what is the reason.  This board was set up as a result of demand by some of the farming organisations. I was one of those who was not as enthusiastic as Senator Doyle about it. I found it difficult to understand what this board could do that the Department of Agriculture had not done for practically 30 years.  I never expected there would be any major changes because they were limited as to how much opportunity was there for change.  There must be some reason people have withdrawn from the board and I would like to know it.  We are entitled to an explanation and perhaps the Minister might be able to inform us here tonight.</P>
    <P>Again, I appeal to the Minister to examine what I would see as disastrous regulations he intends to introduce having regard to the major difficulties they are going to create for farmers.  If he intends to introduce such very difficult regulations he should ensure that there is ample financial protection for the farmers who will find themselves trapped in this situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief and will not hold the Minister, although he is well used to burning the midnight oil on behalf of the farmers of this country, if not of Europe.  I would like to acknowledge the <Col N="1772" /> excellent job he did with his colleague Ray MacSharry for all farmers throughout Europe and particularly for the people in Ireland where our livestock industry means so much to the economy. We would have a lot more to whine about here tonight if that effort on the part of the Minister and Commissioner MacSharry did not go right.  I am sure it does not give the Minister any great pleasure to come in here tonight with this bovine disease levies regulation but he has to face reality, as the Government had to do over the last three years.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Fine Gael Party, in particular, cannot see the fair play in this because we cannot recklessly borrow any more to carry out the eradication, we cannot tax people any more. Progress must be made and the effort must be made to clear our herds in the national interest.  That is the bottom line the Minister has had to face.  It would be grand if he had plenty of money tucked away somewhere at the back of Leinster House.  Nobody likes to be asked to pay anything.  I am a farmer myself and that is the reality of it.  For the past 20 years in this country we have borrowed recklessly in areas that produced very little and we are paying for it now.  Thanks be to God, we have a Government who have brought that under control and there are good days ahead.</P>
      <P>I have my reservations about what has happened over the years.  We cannot blame the present Minister.  This has gone on and on and I agree with Senator Doyle, to a point, when she said it is a national scandal.  Indeed it is.  We cannot even make a tag that is foolproof in this country.  I agree with Senator Naughten about the tattooing of the calves.  It prevented a lot of the dishonesty that might go on in certain areas.  It is not all farmers; indeed, very few farmers are involved in the cattle dealing business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have this thing about the badgers, etc., but I know the Minister, his officials and ERAD are making much progress in relation to a better type of testing &mdash;<Col N="1773" /> possibly a blood sample system.  The Minister is also thinking seriously about the demands made about the waiting period for testing.  I am disappointed the IFA pulled out of ERAD because the Minister could not have done more to bring the people who represent farmers into his confidence, with his Department officials and the veterinary people &mdash; the IFA, ICMSA, Macra na Feirme to mention but a few.  It is a pity they pulled out. Senator Doyle said she was disappointed. I am disappointed also.  They should stay in there and get on with the job.  There is no point in running away from the problem.</P>
    <P>I have my reservations &mdash; and I would ask the Minister to have another look at this &mdash; about the control of locked-up herds.  We heard Senator Upton say that the spreading of slurry can cause this virus to travel a long distance.  I know of a few cases where herds were locked up and then the farmer in question rented land.  There was an outbreak of disease because these cattle were allowed to be taken from the farm in which they should have been held.  The whole thing is very loose and I ask the Minister and his officials to look into that.  There is a reason for it.  In the North of Ireland they have double fencing, etc.  These are the areas where the breaking down is taking place.  People with herds locked up should have it pointed out to them that they will put their neighbours in trouble if they move their cattle.  That is happening in many areas.  People take cattle away from their own farm.  They might close up some land for silage, but they rent land and the next thing there are two or three herds infected.  Some herds are locked up for a long period.  That is an area that should be looked into.  This country should have enough experience now in this area.  We should have all the ends tied up and get on with the job.  I will not go into the figures.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister.  He knows I do not always throw bouquets at him.  He has some money coming from <Col N="1774" /> Brussels to help us out and anything we get is welcome.  If we get £8 million or £10 million it could be used next year to help the eradication programme.  It is stated here in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> that the people in Europe will have a sharp look at the way the money from Brussels is spent.  They go on to refer to the manner in which the scheme has been carried out over the years.  There is no point in blaming the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, for this.  We should be ashamed of ourselves nationally &mdash; farmers, veterinary people, Department officials, etc.  To say the least, it is a very sloppy system at enormous expense.</P>
    <P>It is petty to say the Minister should not be brining in this order.  He has to do it.  He has to try to keep a balance with the taxpayers so that they will not be up in arms, going on strike and putting the country down the chute again.  We went through all that some years ago. We cannot borrow any more recklessly. There is too much to pay back.  I do not like farmers having to pay more but unfortunately that is the reality of it.  We are a small country and everybody must carry the can.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced in recent days an increased grant for farm pollution control. That alone will help to prevent the spread of TB and brucellosis.  I will not go into the grants at this hour of the night but they are there in the public press for everybody to see.  It is not all doom and gloom.  I am disappointed that the IFA people walked away.  They should stay in there and listen to the advice they are getting from the farmers.  Let us all work together in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister and join with my colleague, Senator Byrne, in congratulating him on the great work he is doing for the farming community and the economy in Ireland as a whole especially during his Presidency of the Agriculture Ministers of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the money is needed for the <Col N="1775" /> eradication of bovine TB and the programme of eradication has been going on for a long time.  It was initiated in 1954 and after all those years it has been a failure.  The farming community are anxious to see bovine TB eradicated as soon as possible and for all time.  I know levies are not popular and I sympathise with any Minister who has to come in here and introduce an order to increase levies, but I would not mind paying levies if I thought we would get results.</P>
    <P>The ERAD was established in 1988 with representatives from the various interest groups to speed up the eradication of bovine TB and I think it had some success.  Compensation has improved and the supervision of testing has improved.  More reactors are being found as has been noted in the Minister's speech.  The administration of the scheme is of vital importance.  I know there can be improvements as regards wildlife and the testing is not up to standard.  The identification of animals also leaves a lot to be desired.  In this respect, I had experience myself this year of having an exhibit at an elite bull show and sale in Limerick. I got my animal tested and his tag was on the evening before but next day when I arrived at the sale his tag was missing.  I could not show the animal and all I got was a permit to bring him home and get him re-tested after so many days.  I agree with Senator Naughten that tattooing should be introduced.  This problem puts farmers and people in the pedigree business to enormous expense and it is making life most difficult for them. Senator Doyle mentioned electronic tagging. Anything that would make this foolproof is most desirable.  It was also mentioned that there was switching of tags.  Present tagging is not adequate and is not helping the situation.</P>
    <P>There was mention of wildlife.  I understand that according to some survey 16 per cent of badgers show up as having lesions, whereas approximately two per <Col N="1776" /> cent of cattle tested react and of the reactors a very small percentage show up as having lesions.  That proves that our system of testing is not up to standard and I agree that a system of blood testing should be introduced.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention the concern there is as regards the change from the 120 day test to a 60 day test and that under the rules of the 60 day tests cattle will be only allowed two movements per test.  This would cause severe hardship on farmers and would definitely have a very bad effect on agricultural shows throughout the country.  This regulation, if it were allowed, would effect exhibitors at agricultural shows and it would mean that there would be hardly any cattle shown at shows which are a social necessity in rural Ireland.  They bring townspeople and country people together.  I was delighted that in the Minister's speech he said:</P>
    <P>The recommendation from ERAD was a two month, two-stop test under which animals which have passed the test within the previous six days would be allowed to be moved within 7 days of sale.</P>
    <P>Then he stated:</P>
    <P>However, I am considering a refinement that strikes a fair balance between effective pre-movement control and avoiding undue disruption of trade.</P>
    <P>I have confidence that the Minister will come up with a solution that will be to the satisfaction of the farmers and the organisers of the agricultural shows.  I have confidence in him because of his record.  He is serving the farmers well since he took up his portfolio and he will come to a satisfactory solution to this problem.  I wish him every success in his efforts to eradicate bovine TB in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with <Col N="1777" /> the compliments extended to the Minister here this evening and to congratulate him on his success with his portfolio during the six months of the EC Presidency. My brief contribution will be to give support to the motion before us.</P>
      <P>The Minister has set out in precise detail the reason for these levies having to be increased.  In his statement he said that the success of the ERAD programme can be seen in the increase of almost 50 per cent from 29,700 to 43,400 in the number of reactors identified and removed in the 1989 programme.  These greatly increased figures present a frightening picture.  What if the 1989 programme had been less than intense? What would be the result of many thousands of unidentified reactors still remaining within our national cattle herd?</P>
      <P>One clear point emerges from all this, namely, the money must be provided. The programme must continue.  The disease eradication programme must not be looked on as a kind of everlasting annual report.  It is something which must be tackled, as it is now being tackled, with determination, efficiency and with the national interest in mind.  The sooner the programme is completed the better.  For that reason, I fully support the motion.  I only regret that, as has been the case in the past, the general taxpayer is being asked to shoulder an unfair portion of the burden until such time as a somewhat less unfavourable system for the taxpayer may be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best thing that can be done in the interests of everybody concerned is that this eradication programme should have as much money as is necessary so that the disease can be cleared quickly and once and for all.  The Minister has announced that certain changes are being made in the control over movement of animals. He also referred to the need for ensuring that the quality of testing by veterinary surgeons should be as effective as possible. These two types of control are at <Col N="1778" /> the very kernel of the success of the eradication programme.  I have noted with satisfaction what the Minister has said in this regard.</P>
    <P>Nobody likes to see levies or taxes increased, I certainly do not.  I can understand that farmers would not welcome these increased levies especially at a time when cattle prices are not as good as we would like them to be and when there have been reductions in the high prices for milk which were paid in the past year or two.  However, in what we are doing here today, there is a single common interest whether looked at from the national point of view or the farmers' point of view.  For the good of the whole economy, we must clear our herds of bovine TB, on which huge sums of money have already been spent.  That responsibility is being well met by the contributions now and over many long years by the taxpayers and the farmers but the agriculture industry in general and farmers individually have to remember that their personal fortunes are very much affected by the success or failure of these eradication programmes.  Farmers have a responsibility and they accept that.  They expect to be asked to make a fair contribution.  This they have done in the past and are still prepared to do. Taxpayers are not withdrawing from the programme.  I hope the farmers will not either, I do not believe they will.  At times they have found it hard.  They have many other commitments.</P>
    <P>When I was in the other House I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and each year when the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was discussed, bovine TB was picked out and highlighted.  It was not the farmers who gained financially from it but many other people.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the two bodies closely connected with major interests and professional responsibilities for what we are talking about.  I have never seen from either of them the kind of commitment which I would expect. <Col N="1779" /> Perhaps this will change now.  The veterinary profession should take note of their position and accept that they have a very high responsibility towards the industry they are serving and towards the general economy and future of the country which is paying them the very high fees the Minister quoted.  I do not wish to offend the veterinary profession by this reference but I would appeal to them as a responsible body which they are, to accept the obligations of the profession and to rejoin the ERAD board. They have a positive contribution to make.  I know there are many veterinary surgeons who have a sincere interest and work long and hard hours in their profession. I can see that throughout North Kerry.  I do not think many of them would agree with this attitude of with drawing from an important national body such as ERAD as their representatives have done.</P>
    <P>The farmers' representatives have also withdrawn from the board much to the disappointment of many farmers.  I find it hard to comment on that action.  I fear that anything I say might be taken out of context.  They, too, should reconsider their position and I hope they will.  One farming organisation was very strongly in favour of having a system like ERAD set up a few years ago.  It was set up, they had representatives on it and now they have withdrawn from it.  Is this an indication of some national malaise which seems to affect people who are connected with these eradication programmes?  I call on the farming organisations to accept their responsibilities and to get back into it, and to be active members of the board the setting up of which they had much to do with.  Farm leaders should not, as I am afraid some of them sometimes tend to do, stand back from the action they know is right and play too much to the popular gallery.  Popularity has its place.  It has much to do with the profession of politics.  I am a politician <Col N="1780" /> but popularity and the wish for it must be tempered by responsibility and courage. I hope this motion will be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Senators for the interest they have taken in this motion and for the facility they have given me and the Government to introduce and pass this resolution to enable this programme to be continued and strengthened.  This is not an hour of the night that is convenient for any of us.  I had the impression that the business would end earlier but I appreciate that I am not here by my own at this hour of the night so I want to say thanks to all for contributing and for enabling this motion to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome a significant degree of unanimity in the contributions from all sides of the House.  That is what one would expect from an objective assessment of the issue before us.  Particularly I welcome the fact that since I came back this evening I have heard almost every speaker appeal to those who have withdrawn from the ERAD board to get back to the only forum where their views can be properly heard.  Withdrawal is no answer to anything.  It is not the way the democratic exercise functions and certainly not the response one expects from those to whom I responded when I set up ERAD.  The farm organisations wanted a direct involvement, the veterinary profession wanted a direct involvement and each of them were particularly clear that they did not want the exclusive right to be determined and dictated by the Department.  We did as they asked.  I believe it was right, not just because they asked it, and I believe it is more necessary now.  I thank speakers for the very practical and consistent appeal which has emerged from this debate.  I regret that there is no representative of the print, radio or television media here at this time to reflect that unanimous opinion because it is important.  A lot of publicity was <Col N="1781" /> given to the withdrawal.  It would be helpful if the same publicity were given to the fact that the Upper House of the Oireachtas was unanimous in this view.</P>
    <P>During my absence from this House, with representatives of Bord Bainne I was meeting representatives of other State purchasing companies from other countries who purchase very significant quantities of Irish dairy products, more from us than from any other country in the world.  I am thinking particularly of Conasupo in Mexico and Peru and places like that.  Those markets that are so valuable to all of us, to farmers particularly and the economy generally, are at risk if we do not now face the disciplines and the actions that are necessary to deal seriously with this problem.  Ten or 20 years ago we could have said: &ldquo;There is more money in that pot.  There is no great immediate deadline and there is no absolute urgency&rdquo; but that is no longer the case.  We are at the end of the road. We have the Internal Market staring us in the face.  We have the GATT negotiations. We have a new international environment, and even though some people would like not to face the reality and to ignore the disciplines, at the end of the day &mdash; and that is only a few years down the line &mdash; they will pay the bigger price.  It is a price that neither the Government nor any responsible person would want to see paid.  That is why we are here.</P>
    <P>We are here for another reason too.  I do not want to over-state this and to be seen to be too smart or smug, but in a sense we are here as a consequence of success.  The reason for the extra expenditure is that ERAD, the board representing farmers, veterinarians, the Department, the Government and consumers, has responded to a comprehensive round of testing.  It means that we have taken out more reactors than was envisaged in the Estimates at the beginning of the year.  In many ways one could say that it had been a failure if we had not taken out more reactors because <Col N="1782" /> it would have meant our tests were not comprehensive.  Apart from the fact that we had comprehensive test rounds last year and this year, we also had been doing spot checks, not throughout the country but in catchments of the country. That back to back testing has identified further reactors that otherwise would not have been identified.  It is because of this that an extra £13 million is required this year to keep the programme going or to throw away all we have done before.</P>
    <P>Can you imagine what a Minister for Health feels like when the Minister for Agriculture and Food comes to Government and says: &ldquo;I want an extra £11 million for the bovine TB programme&rdquo; and the Minister for Health is saying: &ldquo;Imagine what I could do with that money,&rdquo; and imagine what the Minister for Social Welfare or the Minister for Education would say.  I want to express my appreciation to my colleagues for acknowledging at the same time that this was essential to ensure that the programme did not stop at this time.  It is the consequences in that sense of success that has us here.</P>
    <P>A number of points have been made in relation to the reasons for failure. They are many and varied and I have listened very carefully to all of those. There was the question of epidemiological surveys which we are looking into in great detail; there is a research programme going on that was not previously in place and the question of the pattern of movement.  There is a unique pattern of movement of cattle in Ireland, where the natural movement during a lifespan is of the order of six movements to a pattern of two in other countries at the most from birth of the animal to slaughter.  That is a factor.</P>
    <P>Wildlife is a factor.  We are now undertaking major surveys and I mentioned that in my introduction.  Apart from the pilot schemes, particularly in east Offaly and Galway which in those areas at least give reasonably conclusive evidence of a link &mdash; I do not say an exclusive link <Col N="1783" /> because there are other factors also &mdash; we are now going to undertake further surveys under licence in an organised scientific way because wildlife is an important feature of our environment. Let me assure the House that I respect that aspect as much as anyone.</P>
    <P>Having listened to this debate, I am confident I will get a response, that we can conduct this survey and our analyses in a detached, objective and responsive way.  That will be my intention.  There will not be any wholesale attack on any wildlife species.  At the same time, equally, where there is evidence that in a particular area it is a carrier, we must look at it in an objective way.  We all care for wildlife, particularly the shy and very affectionate badger and we do not want to see that species being subjected to a slow death through TB infection.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say, as I mentioned earlier, the taxpayer through the Exchequer, and in this instance through the Government, is making the major contribution because of the immediate need to keep the programme going.  It is unprecedented.  If we are talking in terms of £9 million extra &mdash; and I mean extra &mdash; in 1990 to bring the total figure up to £50 million, that £9 million compares with something over £1 million by way of levy, although we cannot put a precise figure on it now.</P>
    <P>The only slightly jarring note came from Senator Naughten, though he did not say it in any vindictive sense, when he suggested that we should raise it from taxation.  We are getting the £9 million from taxation and, God knows in fairness, can we ask the taxpayers to pay the whole lot, with no response at all from the immediate sector who benefit?  That is not reasonable and the farmers themselves do not expect that.  As the Minister for Agriculture and Food, I am not prepared to put that before this House.</P>
    <P>Things are not quite so bad as Senator Naughten said.  He said &ldquo;things were never as bad in Irish agriculture&rdquo;. Senators may have noticed that in the <Col N="1784" /> course of my introduction I made no reference to the conditions in agriculture generally but if I were to I could do no more than quote from a totally objective independent source, the &ldquo;Household Income Survey&rdquo; which was published very recently, and not by the Department of Agriculture or the Minister.  It came up with the interesting and very significant conclusion that for the first time in the history of the State agricultural household incomes were higher than urban household incomes.  My case rests on that.  It does not do anyone a service to over-state a point and say &ldquo;things were never as bad in Irish agriculture&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Much has been mentioned about tags, tattooing, blood tests all of which are important.  Only the lateness of the hour prevents me from going into detail.  In fairness to Senator Naughten, he made that point as well as did Senators O'Brien and Byrne.  I have listened to the points made by Senator Doyle also.  I want to assure Senators we had taken all of these points on board and the standard of testing also is being taken on board. Although I accept that Senators could not be expected to confine themselves just to the matter of funding, the only real issue I am in a sense authorised to address this evening is that of the funding. However, I want to assure the House, notwithstanding that, I have taken on board many of the points, if not all, that have been mentioned particularly in relation to the nature of testing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Doyle also referred to public inquiry.  It is time that we faced another reality.  There is the old story we sometimes hear, and I heard it in this case.  It is the attitude, &ldquo;it is not the principle I am against in terms of the levies.  I am not against the idea of levies&rdquo;.  How often we hear this in Irish life, this Irish political expression, &ldquo;I am not against it; it is the timing of it&rdquo;.  The timing is always wrong. The idea is all right but the timing is wrong or it is the way in which it is being done.  How often have we heard that, too.  The same thing has been said in one sense tonight.  I was asked to have a public inquiry as to how the scandal went on for so long.  If Senator Doyle does not mind me saying so that is another one of those sacred Irish political clichés, public inquiries for everything.  We have gone beyond that.  I say this even though I was a member of a profession, I practised over a long period, who benefited considerably from public inquiries.  Let us recognise the public responsibility of those of us who are here.  I see no cause for a public inquiry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very considerable sums are spent on public inquiries. ERAD are now equipped to do the job. Having said that, if ERAD recommend <Col N="1786" /> to me that an issue of considerable importance such as, for instance, the farmer-vet relationship and whether that is a significant, positive or negative factor should be examined independently, not by a public inquiry but by competent independent consultants, I would certainly be disposed to consider that positively. It would not obviously take the length of time a public inquiry would take.</P>
      <P>Clearly nobody likes restrictions; farmers do not like them, marts certainly do not like them.  The more movement there is, the more sales there are; the more constant movement there is, the more constant sales there are, and the more profitable it will be for the marts. We must be realistic &mdash; that is the percentage business.  It is legitimate but vested interest.  It is not my job in this instance to promote constant movement through marts again and again.  If that is the criterion and priority, I am afraid we will never get to the root of eradicating this problem.  Clearly a lot of lobbying has been done of Members of the Oireachtas over the last couple of weeks from vested interests, but that is not to denigrate them.  I have taken account of what I can identify as being legitimate, objective and significant points.  I hope that fairly shortly the decision I come to &mdash; I have not come to any decision yet despite newspapers reports &mdash; will reflect that I have listened to this debate tonight and to those points.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I thank the Seanad for what has been for me a very worthwhile debate and I particularly thank them for the consensus in respect of the responsibility which we all have and which I have seen reflected tonight.  I hope that those to whom we have appealed, the IFA and the veterinary profession, will see it is their responsibility to be involved in the issue they want to see dealt with rather than to remove themselves and luxuriate in the business of complaint.  That is not the reality that is going to bring us forward at this stage.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the Adjournment debate at this somewhat unearthly hour.  The fact is the Minister has been here on a number of occasions &mdash; I think this is the fourth occasion that I have had an Adjournment debate and the Minister has attended in person &mdash; and I would like to thank her for that.</P>
      <P>The motion tonight is the need for the Minister for Education to keep St. Garvan's vocational school, Dublin 1, open until a new second level school for the children of the north inner city is constructed in Sean McDermott Street.  I have particular interest in St. Garvan's school because it was the school where I did my first teaching.  I did my higher diploma in St. Garvan's, and that is where I got my first educational experience. Obviously it is an area I am associated with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Monday, 25 June, the parents were asked by the school authorities to come to an urgent meeting &mdash; it was described as an important meeting &mdash; where the future of their school would be discussed. They were certainly very surprised and disappointed to learn that what was being discussed was not the future of the school but the end of the school.  There was no future for the school; the school was to be closed, and to be closed down immediately. It would not be continuing in the autumn.  I consider this a disgraceful way for the education authorities to do business &mdash; that they would not afford the parents the courtesy of giving them some prior indication that the school was due <Col N="1788" /> to close, and that it would not be phased out in an orderly basis as is common practice at second level establishments in relation to rationalisation throughout the country.  This is an unsatisfactory way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>The school has provided a service for almost 50 years in the area.  It was set up in the 1940s and provided an educational service of a vocational nature to boys from the vicinity, and at the same time a school was set up for girls in Parnell Square to provide the same type of service. It is an extremely important school because it is the only school that provides that particular type of service of vocational, manual and practical nature for youngsters in the area.  If the vocational school was not there they would not be going to any second level education.  The percentage of youngsters in the area who attain second level education is very low by comparison with the national average: it is in the region of 28 per cent which is less than half the percentage in the city as a whole.  It is an important service, it is an essential service, it is serving working men and women and unemployed people in the area.  In that immediate area there is a high unemployment ratio, in the region of 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>The school has conformed to new developments and new courses.  It is the only school in the area that provides the pilot scheme in the humanities.  If this school is closed there will be no such scheme available in any neighbouring schools for youngsters who will have to find another school in the autumn.  That is not very satisfactory.  The danger is that without a similar type of vocational educational facilities and without the school in the locality, many youngsters will drop out altogether.  It is providing the services for the flat complexes in the area and there is not another school that is providing this service in the immedate vicinity.  Because of the nature of the decision, the manner in which it was made, the suddenness of it, the lack of <Col N="1789" /> preparation, information and consultation with parents, youngsters who are badly in need of a second level education, simply will not be able to avail of it.</P>
    <P>There have been closures of other schools in the area.  Secondary schools have been closed in somewhat similar circumstances where religious orders &mdash; without proper consultation &mdash; or the educational authorities have not enforced any proper rationalisation in terms of school closures or school replacements.  I have seen the other school I have been teaching in, the Loreto College in North Great George's Street, close down as have the school in Gardiner Street, the school in Eccles Street and this year another secondary school in the inner city George's Hill, is due to close.</P>
    <P>The inner city area is being devastated of second level educational facilities and nothing has replaced them.  Perhaps the writing was to be on the wall in relation to St. Garvan's school in Denmark Street because a principal had not been appointed for over two years.  The same is the case in relation to the girls' school in Parnell Square; no appointment has been made, but there was no indication given to the parents or to the pupils that there was any intention to close the school, and now they have been told that the closure will take place immediately without any interim phasing out period. What will happen?  A situation developed over the years; the buildings which are over 200 years, are not suitable for a permanent school and the VEC addressed that problem.  In 1973 the City of Dublin VEC asked the Department, and made an agreement with the Department, that replacement educational facilities would be established for Great Denmark Street and for Parnell Square. The Department agreed and asked the VEC to identify a site and in 1978 a site was identified in Waterford Street, the Sean McDermott Street area, and the site was purchased.  In 1981 the decision was made to go ahead with the construction, with the intention that a replacement <Col N="1790" /> second level educational facility, a community college, would be built and in operation by 1985.  That did not take place.</P>
    <P>In 1987 in response to a question in the Dáil, the Minister said it would cost £3 million to construct the school and that in the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> there were such budgetary constraints on spending that the Government could not do it at that time.  Nevertheless, the Department were committed to the building of a replacement school.  It was disappointing in December 1989 when, in response to another parliamentary question, the Minister indicated that a much less positive approach towards the school had been adopted.  She indicated what she felt was a decline in population in the area; she said there was a surplus of school accommodation there already and if the school was to be constructed, it would be on condition of the closure of not just Parnell Square and St. Garvan's in Denmark Street, but also the North Strand.</P>
    <P>My response is that there are sufficient pupils for a replacement school as earmarked in the Seán McDermott Street area.  The Minister has already indicated her decision to go ahead with the reconstruction of Marlborough Street school &mdash; there will be a permanent primary school available there for the future.  The numbers in Marlborough Street have stabilised and are on the increase.  Likewise, the pupils of the local feeder schools in Gardiner Street, Rutland Street and St. Mary's Place, have gone to Denmark Street and would go to an inner city community school.</P>
    <P>At the present time, we have a different vision of the inner city.  In the seventies and the eighties the perception of the inner city was that it was on the decline.  People were leaving and going to the suburbs, and were being transferred out to housing in the suburbs.  This has all changed.  There is at last a future for the inner city.  We have the development of the Custom House docks area. <Col N="1791" /> We have new designated areas in the inner city.  We have a commitment by the Corporation to rehouse the tenants in Sheriff Street &mdash; there will be 350 units constructed in the locality.  We have the commitment to get rid of the smog problem. Inner city living is desirable.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest issues of all is the untapped number of youngsters who are not availing of second level education who could be persuaded to avail of it if there was a sufficiently attractive educational facility, such as a community school or community college, that would have courses and facilities both for youngsters and for adults.  That is the type of school that was envisaged, one that was almost a home from home, one that would have a broad range of subjects and that would be designed to accommodate a very broad range of people, both youngsters and adults.  That would cap a whole new group of young people who have not been getting education in the past.  These young people are there but they are not being educated.  In my view, the replacement school would be ideal to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>This is an area of great disadvantage. It is an area where unemployment levels are extremely high.  It is an area where there is a lot of public housing, poor quality health services, maintenance and very few facilities.  A community school would provide not just formal education but it would be of immense value to the community.</P>
    <P>In the context of our present situation, in 1987 I admit there were budgetary constraints, and we all contributed to getting the country back on the rails with the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> but now we do not have those same budgetary constraints.  Education, which made a disproportionate sacrifice to get the debt back in line, is an area we should put extra funding and extra facilities. Having sought a new replacement school since 1973, this is the time for the Minister to make a commitment to get the <Col N="1792" /> funding under the 1991 budget whatever it would cost &mdash; it was £3 million in 1987 &mdash; and that she would give a commitment to a living city, to the people in the city, the people who will not otherwise be served by educational facilities, that he will sanction the construction of that long promised school, and that she will phase out St. Garvan's, and not close it down, until such time as the replacement facility is in place.</P>
    <P>It was with a sense of <i>déjá vu</i> tonight that I was in the other House when we were discussing the closure of the Arigna Mines and the power station.  What they were looking for was a phasing in period where the mines that had been open for over 100 years and which provided the life force for the community would not close until such time as alternative employment facilities were put in place. We are talking about an equally important matter here, we are talking about the education and the future lives and training of youngsters.  We should retain St. Garvan's until such time as the replacement community school is constructed in Sean McDermott Street.</P>

      <P>First, let me correct a very grave error which, as usual, Senator Costello has made; it is not to be a community school, it is to be a community college under the City of Dublin VEC. There is a distinct difference between community school and community college.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Secondly, I am not closing any school.  The City of Dublin VEC, by a democratic decision, decided in their wisdom that this is what they would do.  I would like to thank the <Col N="1793" /> Senator for raising the matter.  St. Garvan's vocational school for boys in Denmark Street operates under the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. As Senator Costello knows, vocational education committees are semi-autonomous bodies.  While they are under the aegis of my Department, they have their own discretion in relation to the provision of second level educational facilities within their areas of responsibility. Let us have the facts.</P>
      <P>In 1980 there were 370 pupils in this school; in the school year just ended there were 142 and the enrolment expected for September was to be 100.  They are the facts.  They are not fairy tales.  In those circumstances and in the light of the continuing decline, the City of Dublin VEC decided to rationalise its north inner city services from September by arranging for the vocational school for girls in Parnell Square to become co-educational to cater for St. Garvan's boys.</P>
      <P>Co-education is greatly to the fore and is put forward by all teachers unions' and anybody involved in education.  There are two schools involved, St. Garvan's with 100 pupils and the girls school in Parnell Square.  It was not I but the VEC who decided to do it.  The VEC also arranged that the pupils taking VPT programmes &mdash; I understand there are excellent ones in St. Garvan's &mdash; would be facilitated at the nearby vocational school in the North Strand.  First, the decisions have been taken by the VEC, secondly, they are taken for very sound educational reasons because, as everybody knows, a school with 100 pupils at second level will find it very difficult to give a broad range of curricular activities in their school. Those decisions were taken in a co-ed sense so that pupils will be able to avail of a greater number of curricular subjects and have a greater and wider range of VPT programmes.  The background to those decisions was fully explained to parents at at a reent meeting by representatives of the VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1794" /> The new arrangements will operate from 1 September 1990 and will, provide a wider range of subject options.  The committee are of the view that the revised provision of educational services will enhance the educational opportunities. Already, I understand, they are making arrangements for more subjects, particularly for a wider range of VPT.  The teachers currently in St. Garvan's will be assigned to other schools as is the remit when they take up employment with the City of Dublin VEC.  I understand from the VEC that they will be facilitated in this matter as far as possible.  The Teachers' Union of Ireland have been advised of the closure arrangements.</P>
    <P>The proposal to provide a new post-primary school in the north inner city of Dublin is directly related to this matter. My Department are committed to the provision of a community college &mdash; not of a community school &mdash; under the aegis of the City of Dublin VEC at Sean McDermott Street.  It is intended that the new school will replace the existing schools in Denmark Street, Parnell Square and North Strand.  Again the proposal was made by the City of Dublin VEC.</P>
    <P>The advancement of this project, as with all other such projects, is dependent on the availability of capital resources and on the Department's other commitments and priorities.  The Senator bemoaned the fact that between 1983 and 1987 nothing happened.  I should remind Senator Costello that his party were in office from 1983 to 1987, in partnership with Fine Gael and this project did not advance during those four years.  Now the City of Dublin VEC see the number of pupils at St. Garvan's decreasing and want to give those 100 boys a better chance in life by giving them a wider range of subjects, still within the north inner city of Dublin.  Let us not fool ourselves; we are not talking about miles and miles, we are talking about giving 100 boys a better range of subjects in their own locality.  That is exactly what the City <Col N="1795" /> of Dublin VEC's proposal is about.  The broader range of VPT programmes which they are going into will ensure that pupils who wish to partake of its programmes can do so.  There will also be a wider range of academic and practical subjects. A post-primary school of 100 pupils would find it very difficult to give a wide range of curricular subjects.</P>
    <P>The Senator should get his priorities <Col N="1796" /> right; he wants a debate on a school every night.</P>
