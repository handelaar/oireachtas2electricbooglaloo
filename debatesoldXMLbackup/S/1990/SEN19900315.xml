      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Jackman that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to immediately provide temporary accommodation for the pupils of Richill National School, Lisnagry, County Limerick, so that they can avail of their constitutional right to education.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Pat Upton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The discontinuation of grants for smokeless heating conversions by virtue of the Government's refusal to make any further special control area orders with particular reference to the Crumlin, Drimnagh and Bluebell areas of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Labour to intervene in the industrial relations dispute, which is threatening the survival of 120 full-time and 180 part-time jobs at a meat plant (details submitted) and the need for the Minister to make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> I regard the matters raised by Senators Jackman, Upton and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Jackman's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Upton and Neville may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Yesterday an appeal was made in this House to the Government of Iraq to spare the life of the Iranian journalist working for <i>The Observer</i>.  Unfortunately, as we all now know, our appeal &mdash; indeed, one of very many appeals made right across the world&mdash;- has fallen on deaf ears.  This morning in the early hours the execution took place.  This morning I do not feel under the same restraint as I felt under yesterday morning in conveying the feelings of most Irish people at this outrage, our sense of this evil regime and the evil man who runs that particular country.  I hope that this will be the view of all Members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>My group will have to oppose this proposal.  We feel that this is a matter of importance which has received very wide publicity.  There are Members <Col N="759" /> in the House who will be called upon to vote upon this matter and it is only fair that they should at least hear the outlines of the case.  I, for my own part, want to put firmly on the record the reasons why our group are taking the particular line we are taking.  In fairness to everybody else, it is important that, in a low key and courteous way, we can put the reasons on the record.  We would ask the Leader of the House to allow perhaps one speaker per group, but at least to allow a debate on this subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify the matter of the taking of item No. 1.  This matter has been discussed at great length at the Committee on Procedures and Privileges.  Most of the people outside that Committee do not know what happened at the Committee.  Those of us on the Committee are bound by confidentiality. The Constitution demands that anybody answerable for any utterances made in the House be amenable to the House.  The House is entitled to know what happened, how it was dealt with and the reasons for the proposals from the Committee.  It is a straightforward position.  I do not intend speaking on the issue.  I am speaking directly on the Order of Business.  It cannot be under any circumstances acceptable that something of such seriousness can be dealt with and disposed of simply by the proposal of a motion and one speaker from each group. I am not sure that is what the Leader has in mind, but it would be utterly irresponsible for us to do that.  It will only exacerbate an already difficult position. I am a very firm believer in talking things out.  Any effort not to talk things out means that the energy will appear and reappear somewhere else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>All right Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make one other point on the Order of Business, totally unrelated.  It is this.  I wish to clarify <Col N="760" /> through you, a Cathaoirligh, to the members of the Press that what the Leader of the House referred to yesterday as the motion from the Independent group, which is a matter of some discussion in the media at the moment, is not a motion from the Independent group; it is a motion from certain Members of the Independent group which is taken in the Independent group's time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with Senator Manning in expressing my deep regret and disgust at the execution of the Iranian journalist who worked for <i>The Observer</i> newspaper?  It is absolutely appalling. Indeed, I must also say it was something of an oversight on our part yesterday that I did not join in the appeals.  It certainly was not because I had forgotten it but because I felt that I should not burden the Cathaoirleach by trying to get back in again.  That is why I did not join in the appeals which were made from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>In relation to item No. 1, our group will also be opposing it.  We believe that there should be a discussion on this matter.  It is an important issue for people such as myself who are not members of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges. We simply have nothing to go on beyond what appears in the newspapers, what appears in the motion and a very brief report.  That is not acceptable to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to those who have expressed concern and revulsion at the execution of a journalist in Iraq.  It leads me to wonder what this country is doing having diplomatic relations with that country and whether that will not be altered.  I sincerely hope that it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to address the question of item No. 1.  If there is not to be a full debate, I wish to place firmly on the record my amendment that item No. 1 not be taken today and that instead items Nos. 2 and 3 be taken.  That is a conditional proposal and will, of course, not take effect if there is a full debate.  A full debate, I believe, is required because, <Col N="761" /> first of all, in my opinion this is already a flawed report in fact and in the procedures which produced it.  I have also instructed solicitors to seek in the High Court this afternoon a judicial review of the procedures of this committee which will clearly have a bearing on this outcome. The Members of the Oireachtas would be taking an unwise step if they gave a precedent to citizens of the country who normally have a respect for the <i>sub judice</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow the Senator to continue to make a speech on this matter.  There will be time to make a contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where will there be time to make a contribution, as a matter of interest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>A suggestion has been made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you know something I do not know, but as of now there is no provision for anybody to say anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude simply by saying that those are my serious reasons for objecting to what I regard as a dangerous proposal from the Leader of the House: that a report should now be passed without any discussion.  I would like the record very clearly to show what the Leader of the House has asked this House to do &mdash; to pass sentence in this way with no effective hearing.  I consider the matter an outrage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first, to add my voice to those who wish to express their horror at what happened in Iraq yesterday and to hope that it just will not end there with a little trickle of protest. Perhaps the Leader of the House will go back to the Government and tell them what this House feels about the regime in Iraq.  Perhaps we, of all countries, could take some concrete action against that particular country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I would like to second the amendment put forward by Senator <Col N="762" /> Norris.  I suggest that this House is taking a very dangerous precedent when it is on notice that this issue is going before the courts &mdash; that it just ran through something without discussion.  It seems to me it would be far more sensible if we took a mature decision to postpone this matter, the urgency of which is non-existent, for at least one week until the courts have decided whether it is worthy of a judicial review.  This is an incredible suggestion from the Leader of the House to come before us and say that this issue, which has been discussed behind closed doors, cannot be discussed in the open.  If Senators think the Independent group can tolerate that without taking action, the House is wrong.  The Leader of the House now may be prepared to make a cosy compromise with the Opposition whereby there is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I utterly resent that remark.  There is no arrangement of any sort being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I said a cosy compromise may or may not be arranged.  If that is so, it deprives many of us, who have strong views on this issue, of the opportunity of speaking on it.  It is not tolerable that a man should be put before a committee which is now going to be looked at by the courts and then a decision rushed through this House on the nod.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Manning, I wish to express sympathy to the family of the Iranian journalist who was executed this morning and with Mr. Donald Trelford and the management and staff of <i>The Observer</i> newspaper with whom he worked, and the family of the nurse who has been sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. I hope that the Government will convey the feelings of revulsion one feels at the decision to execute Mr. Bazoft. Surely there must be some international forum such as the United Nations or the EC institutions, through which human rights issues of this nature can effectively be highlighted and action taken. However, the reality is that, unless the major powers take a moral stand on <Col N="763" /> issues of this nature by withdrawing diplomatic recognition and cutting their links, then it is unlikely that anything will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are into the area of making a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Cathaoirleach's accommodation of this issue, but it is something that angers people who have an interest in human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to express my sympathy with the family of the Iranian journalist who was executed yesterday.  We are in a position where something specifically can be done with the Taoiseach being President of the EC at present and the Minister for Foreign Affairs at present President of the Council of Ministers.  Our horror and detestation of what has happened can be expressed through those channels.  It is time we looked at all those complaints that have been coming through in relation to Iraq from Amnesty International and at the whole area of diplomatic recognition that has to be examined in the context of this country and the context of the EC.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I may say that I also would support what my colleague, Senator Upton, has said.  We, in the Labour Party, want a full discussion of this matter dealt with in item No. 1 on the Order Paper.  It is a more serious matter considering the remarks that have now been made by Senator Norris &mdash; that the matter is being taken to the courts today and that a judicial review is being sought in relation to the committee.  It would be most appropriate that the matter would not be dealt with at present and that it would be left until such time as we have an indication of where the courts stand on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I join with the other Members of the House in asking the Leader to convey our views to the Government of our utter condemnation <Col N="764" /> and rejection of what happened in relation to <i>The Observer</i> journalist?  We convey our sympathy as well.  As a working journalist myself, it is a fundamental principle that people should be allowed go around, inquire and make matters public.  This is an appalling penalty to have to pay for doing that.  I hope the Leader will convey our deep concern and grave rejection of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to join with Senator Manning and the other Senators who have expressed their revulsion about the barbaric regime that executed the young <i>Observer</i> journalist. We are at one in this here this morning. Again, need we say it is but another example of how effective an all-party foreign affairs committee could be?  It could have met in emergency session today and put forward the views that have been expressed here in a very co-ordinated and coherent fashion.  I just make that remark in passing.  I feel very strongly about the lack of a foreign affairs committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise primarily in response to Senator Ross's suggestion that the opposition would rush item No. 1, through &ldquo;on the nod&rdquo;.  There is absolutely no question of Fine Gael being prepared to rush this item through &ldquo;on the nod&rdquo;.  We have very specific views which we wish to place on the record in relation to this issue.  It is an issue concerning many matters, not the least natural justice involving two Members of this House.  We must hear it in this House. Fine Gael are quite happy for Senator Maurice Manning, our leader, to put our views on the record, but we support the views of others in this House who would like individually to put their views on the record.  That is the Fine Gael position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a particularly sad day to be talking about the execution of a journalist who was simply doing his business.  I would also support Senator Doyle on the issue of how we should express the views of the Oireachtas in <Col N="765" /> these matters.  Those of us in what used to be called the free world, in the days when there was a clearly defined &ldquo;unfree&rdquo; world, whatever it was, now are in the position of having some of the most unsavoury friends in the world, from the murderers and those involved in the massacre in Tiananmen Square and who were approved of by most of the western democracies, to the murderous regime in Iraq.  It is time we told our so-called friends that we expect them to live by the values we claim to subscribe to.  Therefore, we ought to record in a most vigorous way our disapproval of what happend in Iraq this morning.</P>
      <P>I am used to various forms of outrage in this House, varying from the real to the pseudo, but I have rarely felt so outraged as at the suggestion that a report on an issue which was discussed in private, which was formulated in private, which was based on procedures that are essentially private and of which there is no formal record in proper detail, would now be voted on by this House without anybody in this House having a right to say anything.  I find that entirely astonishing.</P>
      <P>What is not astonishing, and what is, unfortunately, a characteristic of a large section of this House on the other side is the unwillingness of any Member over there even to explain why there should be no debate.  Nobody on that side has offered to explain why there should be no debate.  We cannot have a debate in this House and they have not even got the guts to say why.  I know why.  It is because they are afraid of what might be said.  They are also afraid of debate.  They are consistently afraid of debate.  They are afraid of democracy.  They are afraid of thinking.  I do not very often get angry in this House, but I am angry now because they are unthinking, uncomprehending, uninterested and incapable of free thinking they have a majority to suppress debate.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Order of Business and the concern which has been expressed in relation to the appalling outrage in Iraq, I would, first of all, like to join in condemnation of that &mdash; and I say this as somebody who has been out in that part of the world on many, many occasions.  I find it absolutely appalling and I hope that the Leader of the House will convey our feelings in the matter to the Government.</P>
      <P>However, I would like to refer specifically to the nurse, this girl who is a nurse employed by an Irish company. She is one of the very many health care personnel who have gone out to the Middle East. Many of them are organised from this country, either by Irish institutions or by Irish companies.  Unfortunately, we cannot do anything more about the journalist but I think we should take every measure possible to see that something is done about this appalling sentence on this girl who simply drove that journalist on his ill-fated journey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I. too, would like to join in the condemnation of the regime. But I have risen to say a word on item No. 1 and I appeal to the Leader of the House at least to permit a discussion on this matter.  I am speaking as one who is not a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges; one of the first voices from those who are not members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, because Senators who have spoken are members, with the exception of some Independents.  Many of our utterances here and much of our behaviour in this session is not bringing credit to this House.  I have observed that over the period.  I believe that if this matter is voted on without discussion it will add to <Col N="769" /> that list, because we spend time here condemning countries for undemocratic behaviour.  I received this document for the first time as I walked into this House for the beginning of this session this morning &mdash; and I think that goes for most Members.  In fact, I arrived here without it.  I am not faulting the staff because I understand it was distributed in Members' pigeonholes during the night or early morning and I should have had it.  It is probably on my desk.  I glanced through it here this morning.  If we were doing what the Leader of the House has asked us to do, the vote that has just taken place would have been the vote on this matter, without my having an opportunity of knowing the facts or studying the implications.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Leader of the House either to change the Order of Business or at least to allow a discussion on it.  I would much prefer that this matter be deferred to another day.  We have just heard that a court hearing is expected this evening.  In the light of that information the Leader of the House should be big enough, and man enough, to recognise that and to at least put the matter in abeyance.</P>

      <P>I wish to withdraw a remark I made earlier about the Opposition party.  My understanding was that there was some arrangement to exclude the Independents.  I want to apologise to Senator Manning and Senator Doyle if there was any such implication in what I said and I withdraw it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of points raised.  First, the most important issue that has been raised here this morning is the execution in Iraq of the British journalist of Iranian extraction.  I join with the other Members of the House in my abhorrence at the execution this morning of that man.  I was woken up by one of my children to listen to a very early news bulletin, and it was indeed a very sad awakening for me this morning. There is no way that we can condone the execution of that journalist.  Without going into the rights and wrongs of the <Col N="770" /> issue, we must totally and utterly reject the execution of a journalist who, it would seem, was working in a normal fashion.</P>
      <P>I take the points raised by Senator Conroy and again appeal to the Iraqi Government to reconsider their position on the question of the nurse.  The Iraqis should remember that without the dedication of Irish nursing staff and Irish medical personnel during the war quite a number of Iraqi citizens, military or nonmilitary, would have died horrendous deaths.</P>
      <P>I join with the House in the rejection of what happened in Iraq and I will convey in the strongest possible manner the sentiments of the House.  It should not be forgotten that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, was one of the first to appeal to the Iraqis not to go ahead with this sentence.  Much was not made of that, but he was one of only three European Ministers who got involved in the issue on humanitarian grounds.</P>
      <P>On the question of item No. 1, this will not be deferred, and there are a number of reasons for this.  Mention has been made here of closed doors.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is a committee of this House set up by the House to address itself to problems which arise in the House or to address itself to the future of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Item No. 1 will not be deferred under threat of court action.  I will not allow this House to defer anything under threat of court action.  This is a House of the Oireachtas and I will not be bulldozed into deferring anything because of the threat of court action.  The courts can do what they want.  This House is a House of the Oireachtas and will not be bulldozed by anybody threatening court action.  If that were to be allowed we could come in here every morning under threat of court action, and this is not a place I am going to allow to be threatened by court action.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business I did not suggest that there would be a guillotine or that there would be no debate; but I did suggest, after somebody made a point, that we would have no debate. Listening to the wishes of the House, yes, we can have a debate.  Since each group was represented on Committee on Procedure and Privileges, it might be the proper procedure that the members of Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be the people to get involved in this debate.  If they so wish, the leaders of the groups, whether they be the Whips or not, should make a statement after listening to the report.</P>
      <P>I reject what Senator McMahon said. The report was circulated yesterday.  It is not my fault or the Chair's fault if he did not receive his copy of the report until this morning.  That is a matter for himself and his secretariat.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the debate should be of limited nature.  We have to get through all Stages of a Bill today, because of time constraints, and I suggest that there be a limited debate until 12 o'clock.</P>

      <P>I think the Leader of the House is being unwise.  I know from <Col N="772" /> our group that we have one speaker of five or six minutes.  I suspect that other groups may have short contributions as well.  It would be wiser to let the debate take its normal course because if you try to impose a time limit it will almost certainly be opposed and we may well have further time wasted.  Therefore I suggest the most sensible thing is to let the debate roll.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges (T.279) be adopted and accordingly, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders relative to Public Business and in view of the findings and in pursuance of the recommendation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges Report (T.279) Senator David Norris be suspended from the service of the Seanad forthwith for one week.</P>
      <P>In view of what has been said, I believe the report should be read.  It reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  The Committee on Procedures and Privileges met on the 14th, 28th February, 7th March and 14th March 1990 to consider &mdash; at the request of <Col N="773" /> Senator Mick Lanigan, Leader of the House &mdash; allegations made by Senator David Norris when moving an amendment to the Order of Business in Seanad Éireann on Thursday, 8th February, 1990.</P>
    <P>2.  The Committee took into consideration the allegations made by Senator Norris concerning the composition of a Cumann Parlaiminteach na hÉireann delegated to Nicaragua when he stated (Ref. Official Report Vol. 123 &mdash; No. 16, Col. 1774):</P>
    <P>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business.  The amendment I wish to move is that Item No. 58 on the Supplementary Order Paper be taken first today because a properly convened democratic meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union was subverted by a reconvened meeting which altered the composition of the delegation to exclude all representation from the Seanad.  It is a matter of particular regret to me that his motion was proposed by you, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
    <P>3.  The Committee having heard members' reports from their representatives who had attended the Executive Committee meetings of Cumann Parlaiminteach na hÉireann in question noted that, with the exception of the Independent group's report, all of these reports and the official minutes of these meetings did not substantiate Senator Norris's allegations.  The Committee in its consideration as to whether the allegations made constituted a breach of privilege decided to invite Senator Norris to appear before the Committee to discuss the allegations.</P>
    <P>4.  The Committee regrets that when Senator Norris subsequently attended a meeting of the Committee he peremptorily withdrew from the meeting without affording the Committee the opportunity to interview him on the substance of his allegations.  However, before he withdrew from the meeting Senator Norris submitted an unofficial <Col N="774" /> report from the Independent group representative who had attended the Executive Committee meetings in question.  And Senator Norris confirmed that this document was the only source to and formed the basis of his allegations.  The Committee examined the unofficial report and found it to be flawed in a number of important respects; namely it does not substantiate or make any reference to either a proposal being made by the Cathaoirleach to exclude Seanad representation from the delegation to Nicaragua as alleged nor how a properly convened democratic meeting of the Executive Committee was subverted by a reconvened meeting as alleged.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Committee is satisfied that on the weight of the reports received from representatives of members of the Committee who had attended the Executive Committee meetings and the official minutes of these meetings, the allegations made by Senator Norris are without foundation.</P>
    <P>5.  The Committee wishes it to be noted that notwithstanding its view that the allegations made by Senator Norris are without foundation, the manner in which Senator Norris made the allegations would of itself constitute a breach of privilege.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, is it not normal practice for the Cathaoirleach to present the reports of the Committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The report continues:</P>
      <P>6.  Accordingly, while the Committee gave careful consideration to establishing whether the allegations could be substantiated or not, its primary consideration was whether a breach of privilege had occurred or not.  In this consideration the Committee feels it was not engaged in a disciplinary hearing or trial in any shape or form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> 7.  The Committee feels therefore that it could not entertain requests made by Senator Norris in regard to the manner in which his attendance at the meeting was to be conducted.  To grant any of Senator Norris's requests would have put the Committee's examination on a quasi-judicial footing which the Committee feels was not warranted due to the relative straightforward nature of the allegations and because in these circumstances it would deflect the Committee from its main purpose of establishing whether a breach of privilege had occurred or not, which as stated, was not dependent on finding the allegations to be without foundation.</P>
    <P>8.  The Committee finds that&mdash;</P>
    <P>the manner in which the allegations were made by Senator Norris and the use of words by him &ldquo;a properly convened democratic meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union was subverted by a reconvened meeting which altered the composition of the delegation to exclude all representatives from the Seanad. It is a matter of particular regret to me that this motion was proposed by you, a Chathaoirligh&rdquo; constitutes a serious breach of privilege.</P>
    <P>9.  The Committee regrets that though Senator Norris declared that it was not his desire to unwittingly impugn the honour of the Cathaoirleach, the Chairman or other members of the Executive Committee of Cumann Parliamentary na hÉireann he was not prepared to withdraw his allegations on the record of the House when invited to do so by the Committee.</P>
    <P>10.  Accordingly the Committee recommends the following composite motion be placed before the Seanad in conjunction with the motion to adopt its report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders relative to Public <Col N="776" /> Business and in view of the findings and in pursuance of the recommendation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges Report (T. 279) Senator David Norris be suspended from the service of the Seanad forthwith for one week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with anybody who has been involved in this affair I think it has been one of the most unpleasant affairs in all our experiences in this House, that it has done a great deal of damage to the standing of this House.  I hope we can get a result as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>I want to put our view as clearly as I can on this matter.  When an allegation is made in this House it is made under privilege.  Consequently, in our view there is a particular onus on the person who makes the allegation, especially if it is a personal allegation, to ensure that the allegation is accurate and certain. To make an allegation which cannot be sustained or over which there is reasonable doubt is, in our view, to abuse the privilege afforded this House under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>In this case two allegations were made. They were two very specific and very particular allegations.  One was about the nature of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Committee and one was about the personal role of the Cathaoirleach &mdash; specifically that he was instrumental in excluding all Seanad represenation from the trip to Nicaragua.  Those are the two specific allegations that were made in the House and with which we are here concerned today.  Everything else, to my mind and the mind of my group, is irrelevant. I know from my discussions that these allegations were made in good faith.  I know they were made on the basis of what was regarded as bona fide, but what had to be secondhand information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It subsequently emerged that the allegations were substantiated either by the official record of the meeting or by the recollection of most of the other Members who had been present at that meeting.  I checked this with the Members of my own party who were on <Col N="777" /> that committee, none of whom, I have to say, has any particular axe to grind and none of whom has any particular reason to protect the Cathaoirleach.  All of these Members were certain that the allegation was not accurate.  I conveyed this information to Committee on Procedure and Privileges and to Senator O'Toole, who is a member of that committee.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to what is the central point at issue here today.  When an allegation is made, and made under privilege, there is an absolute onus on the person making the allegation to ensure that it is certain, accurate and truthful.  I repeat, the onus, the obligation, is on the person making the allegation to ensure that it is accurate.  In this case there is at best a very strong doubt as to whether the allegation is accurate; there is no certainty at all that the allegation is accurate and truthful.  In these circumstances it is my view and the view of my colleagues that the only reasonable and fair course for the person who has made such an allegation is to come to the House and say &ldquo;I am sorry.  I may have been wrong. Doubts have been raised.  I withdraw my allegation.&rdquo;  Certainly there is no way that that sort of an allegation can be supported with a certainty which is doubly protected by the rights of constitutional privilege.  As I say the burden is on the person who makes the allegation. I am satisfied that at the very least there was sufficient doubt in this case to oblige the person who made the allegation to have doubts themselves; and in the case of such doubts about a very serious personal allegation made against the highest office holder in a House of the Oireachtas, I believe that these doubts and the uncertainty should have been expresed, and this was not done.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that the matter has dragged on.  I regret that it has to a great extent got totally out of proportion.  I regret thet it has engendered very bad feelings in the House.  If there are lessons to be learned from this unhappy experience I hope that we on all sides can learn these lessons, but I have to repeat the reason we take the strong view we do is that of allegation made under privilege <Col N="778" /> must be certain and accurate and, where there is doubt, the burden is on the person who makes the allegation to satisfy himself.  If that cannot be done &mdash; and in this case it cannot be done &mdash; I believe the allegation should have been withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is widely known in this House and outside it what the attitude of the Progressive Democrats is in relation to the House.  Certainly, since I arrived in this place in November many of the things I have heard would confirm us in the view that the House should be abolished.  Nevertheless, I realise that it is an important institution of the State, that it is unrealistic to expect it would be abolished without major redrafting of the Constitution and, indeed, that there is not a will among the vast majority of the Members within this House to abolish it. Within that context, and in view of the fact that we are Members of this House, we intend to defend the institution and to defend the position of Cathaoirleach, which is, as Senator Manning has said, a very important office of State.</P>
      <P>Within that context it is my view that what has happened within Procedure and Privileges is quite within the remit of that committee, that it is quite within their remit to examine whether people are in breach of privilege so as to regulate the conduct of the Members within this House.  I share fully the view that the onus is on the person making allegations to substantiate those allegations.  I do not share the view that the onus is on the Chair &mdash; and I speak of the Chair and not the person.  The onus is not on the Chair to defend those allegations.  From that point of view I must say that if I or any Member of this House made an allegation in perfectly good faith and believed it to be true and if it were subsequently shown to me to be not accurate, I would feel it incumbent on me to enter this House, apologise to you and apologise to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is not a court of law.  This matter has dragged on for weeks and weeks.  It should certainly have been dealt <Col N="779" /> with.  It is my extreme regret that it has come to this stage.  We have had people standing up here regularly complaining about the fact that the business of the House is not being got through.  We had a particular situation where An Bord Glas Bill was held up significantly.  I submit that it is far more important to the generality of the people and for the welfare of the people that we discuss the legislative programme and not get hung up about nitty-gritty as we do every week. We have a situation here that when we see people in the press gallery we stand up and act like performing seals.  On behalf of the people on this side of the House I resent the allegations &mdash; some of them were made here this morning &mdash; that we came in here as cannon fodder, that we are unthinking, unknowing.  We may be peasants, Sir, but we are thinking peasants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to observe, first, that it was not the wish of the Leader of the House that we should have this debate.  The intention clearly was to force through this document without any discussion whatever.  That, to my mind, is all of a piece with the proceedings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I would like to put on record the reasons I had reservations about it and the important principle that when a process is itself vitiated the result emerging from that process must also be suspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House, of course, will now know that I engaged in lengthy correspondence on this issue seeking to ascertain precisely what were the procedures under which this inquiry would be conducted.  I had six principal reservations.  The first was that certain allegations were made in the House but the committee which was to inquire into those allegations was chaired by the person against whom those allegations were made; the committee contained a built-in majority along party lines which was guaranteed to be hostile &mdash; we have seen a vote here today on the expulsion of a Member &mdash; the expulsion of somebody who would have been one of my principal and ablest supporters in <Col N="780" /> this; I was denied the right of legal representation; I was denied the right to a full and accurate record of the proceedings &mdash; and this is a very important point because I want to put on the record of this House that the very report itself is flawed, it is inaccurate.  It reports me as saying things which I did not say and imputes to me certain characters in my action that were incorrect.  For that reason I wish to have a full record.  I was denied that record.  Who can say now what was said in that committee?  There are no detailed minutes as there were no detailed minutes of the Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting which was changed. Is this House not aware of the fact that there was at one stage a properly constituted delegation selected to go, that I took part in that process and it suddenly, mysteriously, changed?  How did this happen?  Why is there no record of it?  It is not my fault if full and accurate minutes are not kept.  I was denied the right to substantiate my case by the summoning of witnesses.  I quite agree with Senator Manning, I thank him for his reasoned observations and I concur with him.  I have to say that if a full, impartial and reasonable inquiry was able to determine that there was no substance in what I said or thought, of course I would withdraw my remarks.  I would have no alternative. But, when Senator Manning says that it is up to me to ascertain, up to me to substantiate, I have to point out that I was not afforded the opportunity of substantiating them.  I was not allowed to call a witness and I confirmed subsequently with the person who sent me the memorandum, my representative on this committee, that he stands fully and foursquare behind this.  The committee also refused to disclose to me what penalties would be inflicted upon me.</P>
    <P>I would like to say &mdash; this is a very important matter &mdash; that I respectfully asked the committee to adjourn yesterday to allow me recourse to the courts. I had no intention of trying to bully, just to determine certain processes.  I would ask the House to bear this in mind: it is highly significant that the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges <Col N="781" /> does not impugn the memorandum from Deputy Eric Byrne.  It does not say it was inaccurate or wrong and I maintain that any lawyer would find it possible to place upon the memorandum of Deputy Eric Byrne precisely the interpretation that I placed upon it and I would like to read it into the record.  This is what I received the day after the disputed meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union:</P>
    <P>At the opening of the meeting Deputy John Ellis and Deputy Ned O'Keeffe objected to the minutes of the meeting of 14 December 1989 being agreed.  They claimed that it was not a true reflection of the agreement arrived at on Item No. 9, Observers at Election In Nicaragua.  The Minister of State and Government Chief Whip, Mr. Vincent Brady, TD, said that the numbers should correspond to the formula which is used to decide party representations heretofore.  During debate Deputy Joe Jacob argued against sending anybody on the grounds of cost, £13,000.  Senator Seán Doherty in supporting Deputy Jacob seconded Deputy Jacob's proposal. Deputy Tom Enright opposed this motion and as a compromise Senator Doherty withdrew his motion and recommended two observers, one Fianna Fáil and one Fine Gael.  My arguments and protestations throughout the debate were defeated.</P>
    <P>Note: Deputy Ned O'Keeffe at the meeting on 14 December 1989 had been actively supportive of the composition of the delegation then. He completely reversed his position on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Based on the minutes of the meeting of the Irish Parliamentary Association on 14 December 1989 the representative of the 18 members, both TDs and Senators that I represent, would be going to Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>I arranged for a lottery which was held in the General Office on 9 January 1990.  Present were Senator David Norris, Senator Shane Ross, Deputy Tony Gregory, Senator Joe O'Toole <Col N="782" /> and Deputy Eric Byrne.  The result of that lottery was that Senator John A. Murphy was chosen to represent the group.</P>
    <P>I maintain that that document sustains the interpretation that I placed upon it. I was not told at any stage that it was not true.  I was not asked by the Cathaoirleach, uncharacteristically, to withdraw the remark at the time I made it.  I was not asked in the House.  I may point out that although it is said that all reports and the official minutes of these meetings did not substantiate Senator Norris's allegation, neither did they contradict them.  I would like to say that in the report there is one major flaw.</P>

      <P>There is an inaccuracy.  It says that I confirmed that this report was the only source and formed the basis of my allegations.  That is not true.  This flawed report proves that I was right to suspect the procedures of inquiry and that I was denied natural justice.</P>

      <P>I agree with the suggestion that this is a very unpleasant business.  I also believe that it has got out of proportion and does not reflect well on the priorities we set for ourselves in this House.  There are fairly fundamental matters which it has been attempted to have discussed here in the last few weeks without success.  There are a number of questions raised: The question of Irish Life which was raised yesterday; the debate on the Buildings Control Bill which is before us today and which is limited to two hours; there are ongoing requests for a debate on Northern Ireland; there are issues relating to health and emigration and so on.  All these matters have been sought as topics for debate, all without success so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially there are two problems as far as we in the Labour Party are concerned with what is being proposed today.  First, we believe that we have not been given enough time to consider the <Col N="783" /> evidence, although I want to thank Senator Lanigan for the extent to which he has facilitated people in allowing the debate and in allowing the report to be read into the record this morning. However, I have to say that we are still not satisfied with the amount of time we were given.  I obtained this document at approximately 10.25 a.m. as I was about to leave my office for the debate in the Chamber.  In the meantime, I have been simply working my way through this document while keeping an eye on what is going on.  That is an unacceptable way to reach decisions on matters such as we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>The second reason we are concerned is that Senator Norris believes there are issues involved in this which should be adjudicated upon by the courts.  He will set about implementing that process by going to the courts later this afternoon.  I believe we should wait until the courts give its decision before we decide on the issues raised in item No. 1.  I do not believe there is anything of sufficient urgency to force us to decide on this matter today.  It is for those two reasons that the Labour Party Senators will be opposing item No. 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to hear from the other side of the House, from the Fianna Fáil Party in particular, a little more about this than we have heard.  The issue merits that and it is an absolute contempt for the matter involved and for the House that all we have had is the bland reading of the report by the Leader of the House.  I want the reasons, the procedures and the way they came to this conclusion spelt out here.  The Government party have a continuous contempt for this House which was manifest by the attempt to push this through initially without discussion. Indeed we have had no discussion from that party so far.</P>

      <P>Maybe I will get injury time for that interruption.  I do not know if the allegations or the statements made by Senator Norris are true or not.  I seem to be one of the few people who do not know whether they are true or not.  Many people seem to say with a great deal of certainty on either one side or the other. I do not think that is the issue involved and I do not think that is particularly important at this stage.  What I think is important is the way the conclusions of this report were reached, the composition of this report and the composition of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  To a large extent the composition and the procedures of this House are on trial today and so are you, Sir, because what is so important is whether they are exposed by this report and whether they are adequate.  What we maintain on this side of the House is that that report was flawed from the beginning and the reasons are as follows: because the statements were against the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad was chairing the committee looking into those allegations. Not only was the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad chairing it but the report is in the name of the Cathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="785" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order I would like to draw the Senator's attention to Standing Order No. 69 which says:</P>
      <P>There shall be apointed at the commencement of every Seanad a committee to be knows as the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who shall consist of the Cathaoirleach (who shall be Chairman)...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point I was making.  I thank Senator Dardis. What I am asking is: considering that the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad was so deeply involved personally in the issue, why did he not withdraw?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot involve the Chair and you cannot ask questions of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I will ask it rhetorically without expecting an answer.  It would seem that all natural justice requires is that when an allegation is made against someone and when there is a committee looking into it, the person involved withdraws immediately from that committee. That is the only sensible, honourable course.  The committee's report would have had some credibility had the Cathaoirleach not been personally involved, had the Cathaoirleach not signed the report, had the Cathaoirleach not been the person against whom allegations were made and had the Cathaoirleach obviously not had contributions to make in the discussion.  We do not know the details of that discussion or what happened behind those closed doors.  What we do know are the conclusions.  We also know that the result would have been predestined and determined, by a vote if necessary, and that a majority of those on the committee belong to the governing party.  It is not acceptable that decisions of this sort should be made on a party political basis in the ultimate.  I do not want the Opposition to take umbrage at this.  In the end, whichever way the Opposition had gone, the decision would have been a party political decision.  It discredits the committee and this House <Col N="786" /> that the Cathaoirleach did not withdraw from that committee and have it chaired by someone else or refer the matter to completely different procedures.  The decision is flawed and cannot be defended in future if someone involved in the allegations chairs the committee and issues the report.</P>
      <P>Finally, I do not think Senator Lanigan has taken seriously enough the decision of Senator Norris to seek a judicial review.  This is not a tactic.  There would be nothing to be lost by postponing such a decision until this was resolved elsewhere. We are going to get into an almighty mess if this is subject to judicial review.  There is no rush to go through it today.  I will ask him to hold this back for maybe, another week until we can see more clearly where the end of the tunnel is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put on record a number of facts about this case. The difficulty in trying to deal with something in such a short space of time is that there is utter confusion.  I would like to make two separate elements in my contribution &mdash; (1) the allegations and (2) the method of dealing with them.  On that second part I would also like to look at the continuation of authority by the investigation committee.</P>
      <P>The facts are very simple.  Senator Norris spoke in this House and made allegations against the Cathaoirleach on the basis of the written report to him by our representative on the Irish Inter-Parliamentary Association.  On that basis he made allegations here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the motion before us today &mdash; I would like to put this question to the Leader of the House &mdash; the word &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; is used to describe the report received by Senator Norris from our representative on the Inter-Parliamentary Association.  I would like to know why the word &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; is not also used to qualify the word &ldquo;reports&rdquo; when talking about the other parties making investigation themselves.  There is only one official report, that is the record of the meeting.  All other reports are unofficial. There is only one being described as <Col N="787" /> unofficial in that report and that is the one that was presented by Senator Norris.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a written report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the case the only hard evidence, the only evidence that was not hearsay, the only written evidence, given to the members of the Committee was the evidence on which Senator Norris made his allegations. Everything else that was used to disagree with that was merely hearsay &mdash; dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi.  I make that point quite clearly.  I have represented Senator Norris to say, and he has said it himself here this morning, that in the event that his allegations were proved to be unfounded he would immediately withdraw them as he would have no alternative. That has not been done.  Therefore, nothing has changed for Senator Norris from the day he made the allegations here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have made a lot of effort in the meantime to meet with people to substantiate or refute his charges.  I have met with representatives of other parties.  I have talked to people who were at the meeting and I have not been able to find out if the question was asked: &ldquo;If you did not do what Senator Norris did, who did it?&rdquo; I would put a question to the Leader of the House, as I cannot address the question to the Cathaoirleach.  The Cathaoirleach was at that meeting.  I asked the Cathaoirleach, while you were there, well, if you did not propose it, Sir, who did?  All he could tell me was that he had no recollection.  The question was repeated to him by a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges representing the Fine Gael side and again the Cathaoirleach said he had no recollection. I want to put it on the record that if Senator Norris is incorrect about who made the proposal, then let us hear who made it.  That has not been put on the record of Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It was never given to us. That is the fact.  Let me be very careful. That is not me saying that Senator Norris is right.  I was not at the meeting; I do <Col N="788" /> not know.  I am making the case that his evidence has not been subverted.</P>
    <P>We will then go to the position of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I want to just go very quickly through the process of the continuation of authority. The Constitution decides on the workings of this House.  The Constitution states two points of interest, one of which has been widely quoted this week &mdash; Article 13.10</P>
    <P>In respect of any utterance made in the House, a Member shall not be amenable to any court or authority other than the House itself.</P>
    <P>There is no argument about that fact, that the Member will be amenable to the House.  Then it says&mdash;</P>
    <P>The House shall make its own rules and Standing Orders with power to attach penalties.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about that either.</P>
    <P>The House, on this occasion used the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is set up under Standing Order No. 69, which has been quoted by Senator Dardis, some time ago.  I want quite clearly to state &mdash; I would appreciate the attention of the leader as I am directing the question directly to him and this is a matter on which I interrupted him in his first presentation &mdash; that you were incorrect, Sir, in your interpretation of the powers of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Committee's powers are outlined in Standing Order No. 69.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, should not the Senator address the Cathaoirleach rather than the Leader of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The record will or should show that I am speaking to the Cathaoirleach. I would appreciate an extension of time as the leader will have no other chance of hearing.  (1) The Committee may consider matters of Procedure.  (2) It may recommend any additions or amendments to Standing Orders.  (3) It may report as and when requested to <Col N="789" /> do so as to the privileges attached to Senators and (4) may also consider matters relating to the condition of premises in which Senators carry out their duties if no other committee does it.</P>
      <P>Those are the four authorities of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Somebody might say that it is ridiculous that they do not have the authority to set up the examination of a situation like this and I would agree with that.  But just because it should be the case does not mean that it is the case and I have not the slightest doubt in my mind &mdash; and I am prepared to wager money on it &mdash; that any court in the land will support me on that and that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges does not have the power to do what it did, though maybe it should have the power but it does not.  That is the fact of the matter. Words do not mean what I say they mean; words mean what they say in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would say, in terms of the allegations of the Senator and in terms of the position of the Cathaoirleach, I have served on many committees, from humble boards of management of primary schools to very senior national committees and in every single one of them whenever a matter was personally related to the Chair of that committee, the Chair always withdrew &mdash; in every single one of them.  That does not take from Senator Dardis's point earlier, that the Cathaoirleach is the chairman of the committee. Of course, the Cathaoirleach is the chairman of the committee, the same way as the local parish priest may be the chairperson of the board of management of the school; but if there is some allegation about him or some relation of his applying for a job or something he honourably leaves the Chair.  That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I would make is that any principle of natural justice would indicate that when allegations are being made or investigated there is a very simple procedure indeed: both sides of the argument are equally represented with an independent person in the middle.  I can give you example after example on this matter.  There is not the <Col N="790" /> slightest doubt about it.  The reason I say that that is important &mdash; and I am not saying that that committee might investigate and come up with something different, I do not know, I am not making that point &mdash; I am saying that no court in the land, no independent person considering this matter, would say for one second that there was any other way of investigating allegations except both sides being represented and an independent in the middle.</P>
    <P>That concludes what I can say in this time.  I have dealt with the allegations, with the procedural matter and with the authority of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate because I hope &mdash; perhaps I should say I had hoped &mdash; that the Leader of the House having made his statement, the Leader of the Opposition having made his statement, the Leaders of the other parties having contributed, Senator Norris having the opportunity of putting forward his views and Independent Senators having the opportunity of commenting, I did hope that this debate having taken place, it would be in order for me, even at this late stage to suggest to Senator Norris that he consider withdrawing his allegations.  I do this having some consideration for the contribution which Senator Norris makes to the House.  It is not a contribution with which I always agree, or even often agree, but it is always a very independent and stimulating contribution and it is a great sadness that this contribution should be spoiled by an attempt, first of all, to abuse what is, with great respect &mdash; forgive me, but to me it seems an abuse &mdash; the great privilege of the Members of the Oireachtas.  It is, in some ways at the end of the day, our basic privilege and that is, to say in this House without fear or favour what we believe and if we feel an allegation should be made against anyone or anything, including indeed your good self, a Chathaoirligh, that we have the opportunity to do so and cannot indeed be brought before the courts.  We have this enormous immunity which nobody <Col N="791" /> else in this State has.  But equally, if I may say so, it does also carry a very grave responsibility.</P>
      <P>If I may disagree slightly with the previous speaker, I do not think it is a question of people having to prove that allegations are untrue.  That would be &mdash; through the Chair &mdash; a totally untenable situation.  If there is any doubt over an allegation that allegation should be withdrawn. I do make this appeal to Senator Norris to withdraw at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the last moment &mdash; and I speak as a Member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; I would support the view of Senator Conroy at this very last minute.  I would have to say that Senator Norris, probably in all good faith &mdash; not probably but surely in good faith &mdash; made the allegations which he made believing them to be accurate and correct and it is probably true to say that he is relying on the word of one person who was present at the Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting.  There are a few points which I would now like to refer to. Senator Norris was asked to come to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to meet us, to talk to us and generally chat over the problem and to answer the allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Straightaway I would have to say this, and I do not mean it in any hostile way, but Senator Norris did use the word &ldquo;hostile&rdquo;, that the members were hostile.  I took exception to that.  I was not hostile to the Senator.  I went out of my way to find out things.  I had an open mind on the issue.  I went out of my way to speak to Fianna Fáil people, to Fine Gael people who were on that committee.  I have yet to find some one person who will confirm that Senator Doherty proposed that no Senator would travel to Nicaragua. No one can tell me who did but certainly they all would say it was not the Cathaoirleach.  People who said that whispered to me that they had no joy in the sense that they would be of a different political persuasion from Senator Doherty, but in fairness they would have <Col N="792" /> to say it was not the Cathaoirleach who seconded that proposal.</P>
    <P>Natural justice has been referred to and it is natural justice on two sides, on the side of the Cathaoirleach and on the side of Senator Norris.  It demands of Senator Norris &mdash; and I say this in all good faith &mdash; that he should have checked out fully, not just with one person, but with as many people as he could meet of all political persuasion what actually happened on that particular day.  I have done so.  I have seen the minutes of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and it does not confirm that the Cathaoirleach made the proposal or seconded the proposal.  I am certainly satisfied in my mind that on this issue Senator Norris was incorrect.  I am totally satisfied, having double checked, almost treble checked, with as many people as I could meet on that committee.  To save all of us not so much embarrassment, but a situation that we would prefer not to have, I appeal to Senator Norris, even at this last minute, to make the apology and we will get on with the business of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to this debate.  I thank the Leader of the House for giving the House the opportunity of debating the matter.  I regret very much the remarks and allegations made by Senator Norris.  I agree with most of what has been said in this debate, but I would like to support Senator Conroy's appeal to Senator Norris to consider at this late stage withdrawing the remarks.  There must be doubt in his mind now, as there has always been in all our minds from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much the manner in which the matter was handled by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  In my long experience of serving on committees I have to agree with those Senators who say that when allegations are made againts the chairman of a committee that chairman should withdraw. Perhaps there is no provision in the Constitution or in our rules for such withdrawal. If there is not, it is a matter we <Col N="793" /> should now look at.  I have been involved in many committees where a number of allegations were made but I have never seen the chairman of a committee against whom allegations were made chairing the committee and hearing an investigation of those allegations.  The whole matter is a sorry day for this House, as I said earlier this morning, I hope before we are asked to vote on it we will find a resolution other than the one that is in this report. I appeal to Senator Norris to be man enough to withdraw the remarks today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene but I have listened at length and very carefully to all the contributions that were made and I am a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so I have heard this debate now for some weeks.  I have only one sentence to put on record.  I say to Senator Norris that at very least there is doubt and uncertainty. I will not go any further.  There is an element of doubt and an element of uncertainty in relation to the allegations that we address ourselves to this morning and that the Committee on Procedures and Privileges has been addressing itself to.  I plead with Senator Norris &mdash;&mdash; this plea comes from all sides of this House: it is not political in any way &mdash;&mdash; to consider withdrawing, to go no further with the allegation because of doubt and uncertainty and on nothing else.  I ask Senator Norris just to consider it on that fact.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris is a regular contributor to this House.  Not everybody agrees with all of his contributions, but he is a very valued Member of the House and represent a very particular point of view that is very much in the spirit of the Seanad as the Upper Chamber.  I plead with Senator Norris, notwithstanding everything that has been said over the weeks and all the discussions, that on the basis of the uncertainty and the doubt, and for no other reason, to withdraw the allegations that were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that this is a rather sad business we are dealing with today and that there are matters of considerable priority in relation to legislation <Col N="794" /> that the House could better spend its time on.  I have listened to the discussion that has taken place on both sides as well.  My concern, which was also expressed by Senator Upton, is the whole area of natural justice in relation to the operation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the developments that have taken place in relation to the court.  We would have preferred a situation where this matter could be postponed and dealt with at another time when matters would be clearer and we would have an opportunity of digesting the information that has been proferred, taking a proper decision and being able to vote if the matter came to that.</P>
      <P>I note also the remarks that have been made in relation to Senator Norris withdrawing his allegations.  That is a matter entirely for the Senator himself.  It is not for us to suggest to him that he should or should not because he is the man who has the fullest facts in this matter.  If such a path were taken and the allegations were withdrawn at this time, what is the situation in relation to the motion on the Order Paper?  Does that mean that the motion is also withdrawn, that everything falls, that we continue with the business and that Senator Norris will be in the House to discuss the amendments he has on the Building Control Bill this afternoon.</P>

      <P>As someone who is not a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and speaking as a Member of the House who is concerned about the standards of this House, may I, in the context of Senator Doyle's contribution and articulating the attitude of Senator Fallon, say to Senator Norris that there is no hostility towards him, either personal or political.  Those of my colleagues to whom I have spoken are sad at the developments.  All of us, I am sure welcome the Senator's contributions, whether one agrees or disagrees.  I have respect for public representatives who take unpopular stands and who have the courage of their convictions.  I also, in a <Col N="795" /> strange way, have respect for people who are sometimes imbued with passion and fire in the heat of debate express opinions or make statements that in retrospect they possibly regret.  Surely politics and political debate is as much about fire and passion as it is about cold logic &mdash; least it should be.  Nobody would have any sense of triumphalism at any Member of this House making allegations to any other Member or to the Chair and subsequently withdrawing those allegations if an element of doubt has crept in in the interim.  That point has been made repeatedly by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I take particular note of Senator Manning's contribution, not only in his capacity as a representative of Fine Gael on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but as the Leader of the Opposition in this House.  Senator Manning is not given normally to wild, inaccurate statements and he certainly in most cases brings a finely tuned academic mind to bear on many matters that are discussed here.  I listened to his contribution with great interest because it was obviously drafted and executed with great care.  That articulates the general attitude in this House.  Certainly, the contributions that have been made here have all been drafted and executed with great care and sensitivity notwithstanding any of the other points of the argument.  I take note of Senator O'Toole's contribution in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential point is that a doubt exists and where a doubt exists &mdash; all Members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who were present agreed with the conclusions based on their knowledge &mdash; I, as an ordinary Member of this House, must accept the conclusions of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in so far as they are made on issues, and make up my mind accordingly; I have no other option unless I listen to my more learned colleagues, who may have access to information that I and other Members of the House do not have.  Taking all of those points into consideration and concluding as I started and in the manner and spirit in which I started, I ask that Senator <Col N="796" /> Norris would reflect on the contributions that have been made in this House today and make the decision most appropriate to his own situation as only he can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest and I can understand Senator Norris' frustration with the approach the Committee on Procedure and Privileges took in looking into this matter.  I am sure Senator Norris was genuine when he made the statement, that he believed it to be correct.  On reflection, I certainly have a doubt that the Cathaoirleach made the proposal in question, and, having listened to the debate, I suggest that the Senator, if he, too, reflects, will have that same doubt.  He should consider the position and consider the loss to the House in the next week of his valued contribution.  I also feel that the procedures of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be addressed at a very early stage to ensure that such confusion and such frustration will not occur again.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House too long.  I have been a friend of Senator Norris since he was elected to this House. In the sense that I am well known for losing my head at other times, in other places and, I might add, probably regretting it afterwards, I appeal to the Senator to reconsider this matter.  I am not saying that Senator Norris has lost his head but he has certainly got himself greatly upset about this whole thing.  This is doing nothing for the House.  The other side of this argument is that there are no winners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning's contribution was positive, as is typical of him.  Since this sad business has arisen the Progressive Democrat Members, as Senator Dardis has said, are confirmed in their view that this House should be abolished.  I have been committed to this House.  As Cathaoirleach I lifted it to an even higher level and, if I may say so, contributed to the Seanad becoming a more respected House than was the case before my taking the Chair.  Early this morning here we lost the services of Senator Brendan Ryan.  I <Col N="797" /> am sure he would have liked to have contributed again today.  As I have said, I lose my head at times but I kept my cool when the Cathaoirleach took my job.</P>

      <P>That was the first time in my life in politics that I was able to keep my cool.  I appeal to Senator Norris to withdraw his allegation.  Otherwise, he is not likely to be here for a month and I would not like to see that happen.  This thing could be finished right now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong this debate any more than is necessary.  I will address my remarks to a question that was asked by Senator Costello.  Of course the withdrawal of the allegations would result in this motion being withdrawn. That is quite obvious.  It is no great pleasure for me to have to bring a motion such as this before the House.  As most people know I have been working extremely hard over a number of years to try and have this House made more relevant.  I have agreed on occasions to do things that were against my better judgment and I have suffered as a result. I make no bones about that.</P>
      <P>Allegations in this House have been withdrawn on much more serious and substantive items than the item before us today.  If Senator Norris this morning made a simple statement to the effect that he was not able to substantiate the allegation and that, consequently it was being withdrawn, I do not think anybody in this House would think any the less of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Points have been raised about the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. These matters can be addressed by the committee at their next meeting, and there can be an urgent meeting on these matters.  Matters have been raised which need to be addressed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I will not got into allegations of misconduct or misrepresentation. If, say, my name was <Col N="798" /> mentioned in the newspapers in a derogatory way I would have to consider the matter though I have read in the papers references to conversations I felt that took place in private.  Nevertheless I do not think that these are matters we need go into.  Before putting the motion I make a simple appeal to Senator Norris to withdraw the allegation which has implications for the House and for the Chair. I will allow him the opportunity to do that before I put the motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat in a difficulty because I wish to be fair.  My understanding is that my interpretation of the document is regarded by the House as a possible one although doubts have been raised now.  I have constantly appealed to the legal process.  I am aware of the situation where, when doubt is raised, a difficulty, is created.  I would also point out that the report says I am in breach of privilege and ought to withdraw the remarks whether or not they are substantiated. In that light, certainly if a withdrawal is required in order to allow me to remain within&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, if such a statement is made by the Senator then, of course, the report and the motion will be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  It is a very delicate and complex situation. What I would like to remain on the record is, that notwithstanding what I have heard here today, I maintain resolutely that my interpretation of the document, which has remained unchallenged, is a sustainable one.  However, a doubt clearly exists in the minds of a number of Senators and in that light and in the tradition of the late President, Eamon de Valera, placed in a similar situation, I am prepared to accept that it is necessary for me, technically, to withdraw that allegation regardless of my position with regard to whether or not I believe this allegation <Col N="799" /> to be capable of being sustained from the documentary evidence which I produced, which was the only written evidence.</P>
      <P>I am trying to move towards a situation where I am not being obstructive to the House in an understanding of the genuine concern that is being expressed on both sides of the House about fairness and impartiality.  I have to say that as I appealed to the rule of law, to fairness, to my right to call witnesses and to have my character vindicted I believe that the Cathaoirleach also has the right of vindication. It was precisely for that reason, that I asked that he should leave the Chair and witnesses should be called.  I am not certain if that form of words will meet the requirements.</P>

It too, cannot be impugned.  It is for that reason alone the Chair cannot enter into discussions in this debate.  The Chair cannot make any contribution in this debate and it is the Chair that is being impugned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2) (c), line 3, after &ldquo;persons&rdquo; where it secondly occurs to insert &ldquo;other than the person or classes of persons responsible for the design or construction of the building concerned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What we have seen in this Bill is a matter that is welcome in principle, namely, an extension of a regulatory system on a national basis.  What we are opposed to is the self-certification process which is established in this Bill.  We believe that that particular process has no merit.  In the earlier stage we pointed out that when such a proposal was being put forward in England it was totally rejected because in the words of the Attorney General, it was legal nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose that we provide a third party method of certification so that it is &ldquo;other than the person or classes of persons responsible for the design or construction <Col N="806" /> of the building concerned&rdquo;.  That is extremely important because we have experience of unscrupulous builders.  We have experience where buildings have been constructed in terms of design and they leave a lot to be desired.  We have a situation in relation to what we regard as the quality, safety and standards that are necessary for the construction and occupation of buildings.  From that point of view we in the Labour Party, believe it is very important that self-certification does not occur in the manner envisaged in this legislation.  There should be outside certification that would include not just the people who are responsible for the design or construction but there would be some outside private certification. Even if the local authority is not the body that does it, at least there would be some outside body that is also responsible for certification.  That was referred to in a number of reports &mdash; the Raglan House report and the task force that was established. It was agreed that in relation to certification very stringent conditions are required and they are not covered in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I very strongly support this amendment.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the proper role and function of the Seanad and to favourably view the amendments we propose here today which, perhaps, initially were not included in the legislation or were not considered suitable, if that is the correct word, when the legislation was passing through the Dáil.  If this House is to have any meaning we must be able to tease out legislation in detail and try to improve where possible the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise this is enabling legislation. This amendment is tabled out of concern that not the Minister, but perhaps some Minister in the future, might feel that self-certification is the only type of certification that would be needed in relation to building controls generally.  Could I ask the Minister to consider this section of the Bill?  Perhaps this is the most important amendment we will be dealing with today.  It is one of the few amendments I will be getting exercised about, <Col N="807" /> over and above the norm.  The alarm bells rang, if they had not already rung, with many of us when the Irish Housebuilders' Association raised their arms in delight at the prospect of this Bill as it stood with no amendments.  They were viewing a future of no by-laws and no inspections. To be fair to the Irish Housebuilders' Association, it was only those builders who would not have the same regard for standards who were particularly delighted.  This Bill would be a charter for the cowboy builder, if the Minister allowed self-certification to be the norm.</P>
    <P>The good builders, the builders who can stand over their work, those builders who have built up a good reputation, who are good employers and who know what they are about, welcome and want certification, not self-certification.  They want third party inspection of their work because they have nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that if self-certification is what we are looking at in the future we are playing into the hands of the cowboy builder and the unscrupulous professional whose standards are, at the very least, questionable.  If self-certification is the order of the day they will be the builders whose business will be enhanced.  Naturally, they are the builders who will get extra business if a quick certificate can be produced that will not be stood over.  The &ldquo;i's&rdquo; will not be dotted and the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; will not be crossed.  I am extremely concerned about the implication of self-certification as is now proposed in the Bill.  May I also draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in those countries where they have self-certification &mdash; and I think I am correct in saying France and Belgium &mdash; it is backed up by an insurance policy so that, in the event of difficulties with the building subsequently or a claim by the person who has either purchased or constructed the building subsequently, they are fully covered by insurance for faulty workmanship, faulty design and construction.</P>
    <P>Self-certification without compulsory back-up of insurance is just not acceptable to the trade.  The reputable members of the building trade and the <Col N="808" /> reputable professionals who service the building trade in design and in engineering technique donmot accept this as a positive move forward as we enter the Internal Market post-1992.  We must at least have the same standards as other EC states.  We cannot foist on the Irish people lower standards in relation to building control regulations.  I am urging the Minister to concede on this point. Perhaps the motion as worded does not please you or does not please the parliamentary draftsman 100 per cent. We will not be pedantic.  Certainly I will not stick out for the actual wording if you feel you can incorporate in the legislation the sentiments we are expressing today perhaps in a better way.  I will be advised by you and your advisers.  But what we must pursue &mdash; and I feel very strongly about this &mdash; is that the sentiments being expressed so strongly today by Senator Costello and myself be incorporated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to exclude a possibility that certificates of compliance may be given by persons or classes of persons who designed or constructed the building; in other words, it would do away with the option of self-certification. I cannot accept this amendment and I shall elaborate.  Under the self-certification system the designers and builders of individual projects would on their own responsibility provide certificates of compliance with the requirements of the building regulations.  There is a clear recognition under this system that the primary responsibility for designing and constructing buildings rests with the persons involved and in my view it should be that way.  I would remind the House that the powers of inspection and enforcement conferred on building control authorities elsewhere in the Bill can be used independently of any control system under section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a few brief words on each of the control procedures that can be put in place under the provisions of section 6 of the Bill.  Under the self-certification system the designers and builders of <Col N="809" /> individual projects will on their own responsibility provide the certificates of compliance with the requirements of the building regulations.  There are a number of attractions.  Delays in starting up construction projects will be minimised, thus reducing costs and allowing simpler administration; and this type of system can be more easily introduced into those areas of the country where formalised building control systems do not operate at this time.</P>
    <P>There is a clear recognition in this system that the primary responsibility for designing and constructing buildings rests with the industry itself and in my view this, as I said earlier, is as it should be.  I would remind the House that the powers are there to deal with that also.  Subsection 6 (2) (a) makes a provision for a full approval-type system similar to the present system of control which obtains in those areas where building by-laws are in operation.  For a design-orientated approval system this would involve the submission of plans and specifications to the local authority for approval before work commences.  Provision could be made for requiring approval to the completed building, but this would only be used in some exceptional circumstances that might arise in the future.  Such a system would have significant implications for a building control authority's liability and any Minister for the Environment would be slow to invoke it. Nevertheless, I consider that a provision should be made for this system in broad enabling legislation of this type.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this, I might say that approval systems generally have been criticised by the industry.  They are considered to be too cumbersome because of the delays and increased costs.  From a local authority point of view it is a costly system and one which could only be introduced with significant additions to the staff of many local authorities concerned. I need hardly add that the financial implications are obvious and are of such magnitude as not likely to be set aside.  I will not say much more on this part.</P>
    <P>Purchasers of dwellings or any building <Col N="810" /> can look for a certificate in connection with a building or a property they intend to purchase.  They also realise they can insist that they receive a competent report from consulting architects or consulting engineers structural and so on.  If I was purchasing a house here in Dublin I would ask a competent surveyor to inspect that before I paid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of anybody going to pay substantial money for any property it would be foolish of them not to do so.  That is why I want to put it on the record of this House.  If I was buying a house, let it be new or secondhand or an industrial building or whatever the case might be, I would demand a certificate of approval from competent architects for the type of building concerned. It is open to people to do that.  If later that certificate does not stand up, they have options open to them then which you all know.</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear I am satisfied that what we are doing here is correct.  I understand the reservations &mdash; if that is the word to use &mdash; that Senator Costello and Senator Doyle have in respect of this, but on the explanation I have given on this I feel the protection is satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely important amendment.  What is really the nub of the question is that we are deregulating the existing controls that are there, the existing requirments for regulation in relation to buildings in Dublin and the by-laws that are there.  We are providing a national system, but what we are doing in the process is providing a self-certification system on the spurious grounds that this will speed up the planning procedure and so on.  The real nub of the question is that we are now taking out of the control of the local authority a procedure and a statutory duty in relation to inspection and substituting a system of self-compliance, the certificate of compliance that is provided now by the <Col N="811" /> person who will be constructing and designing.  It really is the nub of this whole area of this Building Control Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say that if we are thinking of buying a house we can employ a surveyor or an engineer.  There are many people trying to put together money to buy a house.  It is not something people do with a surplus of money.  They are scraping to put the money together.  Now, with this relaxation that is taking place in relation to building regulations, they will be obliged to employ a surveyor or an engineer. There is no other way out of it in order to ensure that they will have a proper structure.  It is a question of <i>caveat emptor</i> that the Minister is presenting here.  That is unsatisfactory.  We should be concerned with ensuring that there is third party certification, whether that be the local authority or a private individual. The intention of this amendment is to ensure that situation continues, a situation which to a degree continues already here.  What we would wish is that that would be extended on a national basis under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I must disagree very strongly with the case put by the Minister of State in support of his viewpoint.  There are may aspects that need underlying in our quest for third party certification.  As I said in my initial contribution to this amendment, it is perhaps the most important amendment. The fact that the industry itself fully supports third party certification should be indicative to the Minister that this is the line we should be following.  I understand that the technical regulations which are being drawn up are equivalent to the UK technical building regulations.  But where we differ to the UK is that they refuse to accept self-certification.  We will take what suits us from the British experience and throw out other issues.  If the technical regulations are good enough for us to put down and insist that these are the regulations that the building industry will comply with, surely we should look to the fact that in the UK they have a full <Col N="812" /> approval system in operation, which apparently according to his response, the Minister is not contemplating here.  The lodging of plans and the indication of when work will start would be other areas that would improve this legislation &mdash; good legislation that is flawed in just a few areas.</P>
      <P>It is on a constructive basis that we raise these points this morning.  I know the Minister has heard them previously in the Dáil.  I know that the Second Stage contributions dwelt on these to some extent.  Would the Minister not consider, from the constructive way these points are being made and the amendments put, that there is real concern &mdash; not just in this House or in the Dáil but also in the industry itself &mdash; about what we are proposing to do?  Why would the British, the Germans and the Belgiums not allow self-certification unless it was backed by an insurance system?  Most countries will not allow it at all.  In the two countries who have it &mdash; France and Belgium &mdash; it is backed by an insurance system.  Why is it that the cowboy builders are welcoming with open arms the prospect of self-certification, the prospect of the deregulation of the by-laws?  It will be a retrograde step in Dublin and indeed in the other urban areas, though they are not perhaps as strict in their implementation of the by-laws as is Dublin.</P>
      <P>This Bill represents a retrograde step in relation to building control from what we have now.  That cannot be acceptable, given the standards and the competition we are going to face post-1992.  It is a charter for the cowboy construction industry.  It is nothing less.  Those builders &mdash; they are not many, but they are out there &mdash; who will cut corners and will keep down costs by doing shabby work and who can then self-certify their work as being up to standard without any fear of third party inspection from any source must be laughing all the way to the bank because the Minister refuses to accept what I think is a very reasonable amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, there have been two major reports &mdash; the Cramer and Warner report, and indeed the task <Col N="813" /> force report on multistorey buildings &mdash; which were issued recently.  The recommendations of both those reports are out of line with what the Minister is proposing. I support the recommendations of both of those important reports, as do Members from both sides of this House. The tragedy of Raglan House was something we all hoped &mdash; the industry, the public and the politicians &mdash; we would learn from and, if at all humanly possible, prevent happening again.  There are many points in those reports that do not apply just to the Raglan House situation but from which we must now learn.  Both of those reports do not accept the Minister's view on this particular aspect.  I would urge the Minister strongly to consider that.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat again, because it is important, that with the advent of the EC internal market, control regulations and regulations across the board in the different areas should be brought more into line: we should have similar sets of regulations and control of those regulations in all 12 EC member states so far as is possible.  I am asking the Minister to consider that.  We have the opportunity now to update our legislation.  It has been a long time hanging around.  I accept that. Indeed, when I was Junior Minister in the Department of the Environment this passed through my desk &mdash; and that is not today or yesterday.  I would ask the Minister, with the advent of the EC, with the two major reports that do not agree with him, with the only people supporting him on this point being the cowboy construction element in the industry, to reconsider this matter.  We feel very strongly on this.  The legitimate construction industry and the professionals who service it feel very strongly that third party certification is essential; or, if the Minister insists on self-certification, it cannot proceed without a compulsory insurance backup.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I would fully support the sentiments expressed by Senator Doyle with regard to the whole area of self-certification.  Indeed, I would appeal to the Minister at this stage to accept <Col N="814" /> the amendment.  There is no doubt, as Senator Doyle has pointed out, that the only people who welcome this clause in the Bill are the cowboy builders.  Let me put it clearly on record that the vast majority of builders are responsible people and do an excellent job.  Unfortunately, as in other areas there are the people who move in for the fast shilling. Those people are presented here with a golden opportunity &mdash; this whole question of self-certification.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that this will create major problems down the road, whether with regard to the type of building being constructed or the defects in it or indeed with the whole area of insurance.  I believe it will increase the cost of insurance and will make it far more difficult for people to get insurance on a building rather than if this building was certified by a third party.  I would appeal in all sincerity to the Minister to accept this reasonable amendment.  When one carefully examines the situation one will acknowledge the need for this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if I were to accept the amendment, this amendment is flawed.  If it means anything, it means that the class of persons who designed the building cannot certify the design. This is serious stuff.  In other words, if an architect designed a building no other architect could certify that design because he would be of the class of persons responsible for that design.  Similarly, no other engineer could certify engineering work.  I am sure that the Senators do not want that to happen. The amendment would rule out both self-certification and third party certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to the report of the task force on multistorey buildings, which recommended that the Building Control Bill should be enacted as soon as possible.  The task force reported in August 1987, three years after this Bill was published.  The task force were fully aware of what was contained in the Building Control Bill before they recommended that it be enacted.  Senator Doyle &mdash; I am not saying intentionally &mdash; seems <Col N="815" /> to be linking cowboy builders and the House Builders' Association.  I cannot accept this view.  The vast bulk of the builders today are very decent, honourable people.  I would point out also that all new houses especially are inspected under the structural guarantee scheme. If you want a design for a building, a new building, an extension to a building or whatever, you have to apply for planning permission to the local authority.  They will be examining that also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only speak about the authorities I deal with.  Some would say, and some of my colleagues of all political parties on local authorities say, that the local authorities are over-exact in regard to planning and so on.  We cannot wear two hats when it suits.  We have to be honourable, and I am not saying that we are not.  We cannot toss the coin any way if it comes down in the favour of what you want yourself.  That is not the right way of doing things.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a number of crucial matters outside section 6 &mdash; the building control regulation section.  It will (a) establish building control authorities for the whole country, county councils and boroughs; (b) give these authorities power of inspection.  Section 11, enforcement; section 8, prosecution; sections 16 and 17 ensure compliance with the building regulations.  These powers are generous by any standards and can be exercised independently of any building control regulations.  They are in line with other legislative codes for which the Minister is responsible and are arguably adequate in themselves to enable building regulations to be put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inclusion of the self-certification system as an option in section 6 does no more than acknowledge the fact that primary responsibility for maintaining standards in the construction industry rests with those directly involved &mdash; the designers and builders.  The designers have a lot of responsibility to-day.  As you all know, builders and so on have to have <Col N="816" /> special insurance to cover claims of faulty workmanship.  I know buildings that have been built and major repairs have been carried out where faulty workmanship insurance had to be produced or they would not be allowed inside the front gate.</P>
    <P>In general, we have a very fine group of architects and consulting engineers.  I have been in many other countries where I have observed the designs of buildings and I have to say that our design teams are top class.  They are designing in the Far East and many parts of Europe and great credit is due to them.</P>
    <P>There are strict criteria laid down.  If anyone were to ask me as a public representative for advice if they were going to do something major I would be able to put them on the right road.  I am glad to say that I am able to do this in the constituency I have been fortunate to represent for so many years.  Therefore, they know exactly what is happening and how they should approach it.  There is no problem.  The architects and consulting engineers draw up the plans for new buildings or extensions.  There is an update of the Planning Bill going through the Dáil at the moment &mdash; it will be coming to this House &mdash; which has tightened up many areas, giving the planning authorities more power to deal with many matters.</P>
    <P>I hope I have explained this as clearly as possible.  There have been no convincing arguments put forward against the concept of self-certification.  I am satisfied that self-certification can operate satisfactorily.  I cannot accept this amendment.  If self-certification becomes the option to be chosen it is not giving an open door to shoddiness of any kind. Other sections of this Bill give far-reaching powers to the local authorities in all of this.  I see this as the best way of approaching the matter.  In the housing grants area, which is under my responsibility as designated by the Minister for the Environment, I see that most houses today are being erected with a six years structural guarantee.  Many of the house buyers qualify also for the £2,000 new house grant.  The inspectors in the <Col N="817" /> Department of the Environment are very competent people to examine houses.  In fact, the complaint I usually, get is that they are possibly too exact in all of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that no convincing arguments have been put forward against the concept of self-certification. Certainly, the corollary is true that no convincing arguments have been put forward in its favour.  What is particularly dangerous in this legislation is the combination, where there is self-certification on the one hand and on the other hand there is no statutory duty of inspection.  If there was one or the other, where there was third party certification, then the duties of inspection would not be so great; but where there is a situation where there is neither third party certification nor a statutory duty of inspection, then that is a recipe for disaster in terms of building regulations.  It is that dual loophole in this legislation that is causing consternation and is the reason we are so opposed to the concept that is being put forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister has some problems with the wording of the amendment.  We are not requesting the Minister necessarily to accept the wording.  There is no reason why the Minister should not restructure the amendment but he must accept that what he is producing in this legislation is a wide loophole that will allow for abuse. Once there is scope for abuse, that scope will be availed of by those who have the power.  We want to close that loophole and that is why we are so insistent that the Minister would accept the amendment or accept the spirit of it and restructure it to a wording that would contain the spirit of it.  If that was done, undoubtedly, we would have a much better measure.  The Minister must realise that what he is doing here is deregulating a system that is in existence and that is satisfactory at present in Dublin and other areas where the local authority has the responsibility for certification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an even wider matter.  It is third party certification without specification as to what that precisely is.  We are giving <Col N="818" /> a further option there and we would certainly urge the Minister to take the spirit of the amendment on board and to plug one of the two critical loopholes that are in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a couple of points on what Senator Costello has said relating to the arguments for self-certification. The first thing to be said is that when somebody submits an application for planning permission to the local authority, obviously those plans and specifications have to be examined in their own right and if the specifications are not up to scratch, then obviously planning permission will not be forthcoming. Might I also re-emphasise what the Minister said in this regard, that with the vast majority of houses being built nowadays, we are talking about a six-year structural guarantee, whereby people who involve themselves in purchasing such a house have a guarantee over a six year period. The third point referred to by the Minister is in relation to the new house grant whereby Department inspectors are in the position of regulating and examining the finished product.</P>
      <P>Over and above all of that, one has to look at, for instance, the people who designed and constructed these buildings. I would be inclined to suggest that any third party or local authority would not be well positioned to certify that the building had been constructed according to the building regulation.  Indeed if you had certification, are you not imputing to the local authority or building control inspectorate some of the blame that might rightly fall on the designers or planners of such buildings and perhaps defeating the purpose of the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure what words the Minister was putting in my mouth in relation to the Irish House Builders Association and cowboy builders.  I will state my view quite clearly lest there be any ambiguity.  The Irish House Builders Association is an extremely reputable body.  Not all builders are reputable.  They are two separate and distinct statements of fact and the Irish <Col N="819" /> House Builders Association would agree with that view.  I do not want to see us being party to any charter for the cowboy, be there only one out there or be there several.  They are in a minority but like any other industry or business, they are there, and let us face up to it.</P>
      <P>Self-certification as it is here, with no back-up, without any third party inspection would appear to me &mdash; and, might I say, to the professionals in the industry and to the reputable builder and to many other people involved in the construction industry &mdash; a matter of concern.</P>
      <P>I read with interest Senator O'Keeffe's contribution to Second Stage which led me to believe that he might have had a word in the ear of the Minister between Second Stage and Committee Stage in relation to control regulations and inspection. I hope I am not reading more into what he said than was actually there but I felt he was coming some way down the road of this discussion here this morning. I was hoping we might be able to call on his support for what we are asking this morning.  I feel there is some sympathy there from what the Senator was saying and I hope I am not putting words in his mouth when I say that.</P>
      <P>When I stood up initially to support the amendment I did say that it was the sentiments of what we were saying here we wanted incorporated.  We will not quibble with the Minister.  He has perhaps a reasonable point in his criticism of the wording.  That was in the back of my mind when I said I would not get hung up on the words being used, that it was the sentiments we would like incorporated. The Minister can have a word with the parliamentary draftsman as to how best to express the point that we want third party certification and we will be advised by the Minister and his technical people as to how to do that.  The amendment is not a tablet of stone but in what we are saying and in our sentiments we believe most passionately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why we are asking the Minister to consider what we are saying and to <Col N="820" /> come back on Report Stage with the Minister's own amendment that would incorporate our request for third party inspection.  I would be satisfied, and I suspect that Senator Costello might be satisfied, if the Minister would state that to us now, and we can then move on to the other important sections.  We believe passionately in this section.  The loopholes that appear to be there we want plugged just for the cowboy builder and the cowboy element of the industry.  We want to protect the legitimate and reputable construction industry.  We want to ensure that standards in Ireland are equal to those in the rest of Europe as we enter the internal market.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he heard no convincing arguments against self-certification. That is the fact that the cowboy builder is thrilled at this prospect; that it is a charter for the disreputable people in the construction industry; that they are the people who have most to gain, those who take the short cuts, those that are on to the quick buck by not maintaining standards that we feel are necessary, and who can then self-certify their own work. That is the most convincing reason of all, as well as the necessity to protect John and Mary Citizen from lower standards than their counterparts in the rest of Europe can expect and do now enjoy. We are also protecting the Dublin John and Mary Citizen from lower standards than they now enjoy under the by-law regulations.</P>
    <P>I find those extremely convincing arguments and I would urge the Minister please, to accept the arguments made from all sides of this House.  It is not just our view or the Minister's view.  We are united on this.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to section 11 in relation to the local authorities' involvement. Yes, they certainly have powers, but they have no obligation and no duty. Let us not play with words.  All we are asking the Minister here is to put the powers referred to in section 11 on to a statutory basis and we are with him.  What we are asking is a very small step from what the Minister is saying is in the Bill. I would ask the Minister to come with us <Col N="821" /> that step and we will all be united in relation to it.  The Bill is fine but it is the enforcement procedure here that we are not satisfied with.  Would the Minister, please, move just one step down the road from the powers of inspection by authorised persons to the obligation and put it on a statutory basis?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the use of arguments to suit ourselves in different contexts.  I did not quite understand the Minister's point.  He referred to the planning system and the development control system.  He must be aware of the document published by the Environmental Research Unit, formerly An Foras Forbartha. It is a survey of 1986 planning applications and development based on them in 1989.  The Minister knows perfectly well that even if things are put on a statutory basis, work does not necessary get done but you can be quite sure that if it is not on a statutory basis it will certainly not get done.  The Minister must appreciate that.  There is no guarantee that if what we are requesting this morning was put on a statutory basis every person who constructs or purchases a house or building will be protected but there is certainly no guarantee of protection unless it is on a statutory basis. We must go as far down the road as we possibly can in this regard.</P>
    <P>I referred previously to the Kramer and Warner Report and to the task force report.  The Minister quoted selectively from that report when he said they welcomed the enactment of the Building Control Bill we are talking about here this morning.  He omitted, however, to quote the parts we are talking about now. For the record, the Government task force on multi-storey buildings which reported, as the Minister said, in 1987, dealt with the concept of building control. That report recognised that the implementation of building regulations is of little value unless they can be effectively enforced.  There is no point in having regulations unless we are able to enforce them.  All the regulations in the world will make no difference unless we enforce them.  The report did not even consider having certain buildings exempt. <Col N="822" /> They wanted all buildings to be within these controls.</P>
    <P>Specifically, in relation to a certification system, the Government task force on multi-storey buildings reporting in 1987 stated:</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the system is dependent on a high level of technical competence and professional responsibility among those certifying and would need a high degree of policing to support certifiers in carrying out their duties diligently.</P>
    <P>The task force went on to recommend:</P>
    <P>The task force recommends that the Building Control Bill should be enacted as soon as possible&mdash;</P>
    <P>that was the Minister's point; he selectively took out that sentence.</P>
    <P>&mdash;so that building regulations and an effective building control system can be put on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister was being disingenuous.  He quoted that the task force recommended that the Building Control Bill should be enacted as soon as possible.  He did not even get to the end of the sentence which said: &ldquo;... so that building regulations and an effective building control system can be put on a statutory basis&rdquo;.  The Minister accused some of us of being selective but he is also selective.  I accuse him, without fear of contradiction, of being very selective in his quotations.  I urge him to accept our amendment which has the support of the legitimate people in the industry.</P>

      <P>Local authorities will have the very same powers of inspection under this Bill as they have under by-laws in Dublin at present.  I do not think anyone is suggesting that the Dublin authorities are not doing a good job and I cannot see that they will do any less in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must point out that the amendment, if accepted, would place a building control authority in an impossible position.  In practice, they would be obliged to supervise every building.  Otherwise they <Col N="823" /> would be open to the accusation that they had not carried out sufficient monitoring every time a breach of the building regulations came to light.  They could also be open to claims from the very people guilty of a breach of the building regulations, if they did not pick up the defects.  What would that mean to Wexford County Council, for example, as the Senator is a member of that authority?  They are a very competent local authority as I know quite well, but human nature being what it is, say there was a breach, then the developers, the tenants or the owners could take an action against Wexford County Council.  Who would pay the compensation?  My Department would not pay.  Who then would pay the compensation if it is not Wexford County Council?  Rightly or wrongly the taxpayer in Wexford would pay.</P>
    <P>I am noted as being as helpful as I possibly can.  I appreciate very much the Senator's point of view, and I would not like anyone here to think otherwise. However, I am sorry that I cannot agree to the amendment.  I will not be rude to the Senator &mdash; far from me to do so &mdash; but in a very long debate I have explained why I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that. The local authority always had a right to inspect.  Under this Bill a local authority can inspect a building if they so wish but the Senator wants to make it mandatory. I am not prepared to go down that road. I have spelt out in simple, plain, humble language what is involved.  If the local authority in Wexford do not comply in the eyes of the law or in the eyes of the <Col N="824" /> developers, and they are caught for £1 million, will they be able to pay it?</P>

      <P>No.  The taxpayers in Wexford would not thank you for it.  They would be disgusted.  I want to be very clear on this.  There are laws there and when planning applications are made the premises will be inspected by the firm's chief or the designated officer of the fire chief's office for the country.  If it is housing &mdash; house improvements and especially new housing &mdash; it comes under my Department and others.  I stated very clearly, and I cannot be more precise, that if I was purchasing a building today I would get a consultant engineer or an architect to certify it.  If they point out defects, the purchaser will know about them.  The Senator is under-estimating the intelligence of the Irish people.  I find them most intelligent and they understand all this.  I am putting it on the record that a purchaser should employ the services of a competent firm of architects or consultant engineers to certify the conditions of the property.  I would not buy anything without such certificate.</P>

      <P>Considering what the Minister has said it is amazing that it is so difficult for us to cover this area whereas the rest of Europe seems to have no trouble in doing it.  We are unique in Europe proposing a system of self-certification. How can that be the situation if the Minister is now presenting to us a barricade of legal problems and responsibilities in relation to the local authority, if we are to put into operation a system whereby we have a third party certification? I find this impossible.  Surely the responsibility of the legislation is to <Col N="826" /> ensure that every individual buyer will not be faced with a problem of tracking down a certifier and having to take that individual to court if the self-certification does not comply with the regulations as it purported to do?  There is a role here for protection of the citizen and we are saying that third party certification built into the law will provide that protection.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept the generality of the statement by the Minister that if we go down this road we are into a morass, that we find ourselves with more problems than we are solving.  In having self-certification without statutory responsibility even to monitor the self-certification we are going into a morass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Certification is only one option but if we have a system of certification I would argue that the best people to certify are the people who designed and constructed the building. Any third party or a local authority would not be as well positioned to certify that the building had been constructed according to the building regulations. Responsibility should rest with the people involved in the project.  So involving others would tend to muddy the waters.  I cannot put it more clearly.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendments No. 4 to 6, inclusive, not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (3), line 2, after &ldquo;regulations.&rdquo; to add: &ldquo;Notwithstanding the generality of this subsection, the Building Control Building Regulations shall provide for domestic dwellings&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The area of domestic dwellings and alterations thereto has been exempted from the Bill.  I feel that is a serious exemption that should be addressed and it is the intent of the amendment to address it.  In recent weeks we have seen in the newspapers various reports, particularly emanating from the West in the counties of Clare, Galway, Mayo and Sligo, of a very high level of radon seeping through the floors of buildings.  Radon causes cancer.  If we look at the development control system &mdash; I refer to the 1989 report of the Environmental Research Unit, even where planning permission is given there is a tremendous amount of ignorance in relation to proper protections. In relation to sewage, ventilation and this new area of rural dwelling that will affect rural dwelling, particularly in the West, it is important that we have proper building regulations to protect the safety and the health of people who would be at risk if these regulations are no longer in operation.  This report, which Senator Doyle has already referred to, states on page 33:</P>
      <P>While all septic tank systems are planned to use percolation areas there is strong indication that very few actually do.  In almost all cases where it would be easily investigated it was found that a soakage pit rather than a percolation area had been used and that occupants were quite unaware of the pollution risk to ground water involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> It is very important to make sure that the safety, health and hygiene of people is covered by safety regulations.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is extremely important that we cover the whole area of insurance.  If dwelling houses are to be exempt from regulations in terms of design, construction and if self-certification will not apply, can the Minister guarantee that people buying houses, making the most substantial purchase of their lives, will have the protection of that particular aspect of consumer legislation? Will we be able to guarantee the safety, quality and the standards of dwellings that will cover requirements for insurance purposes?  I am very worried about this development.</P>
    <P>It will be totally disastrous if we have a system whereby compliance with a control system in relation to regulations will not apply to dwelling houses.  By specifically exempting them from this Bill we are once again indicating the loopholes in the Bill.  These loopholes should be filled.  The Bill should be as extensive and comprehensive as possible and its intent should be to protect people rather than to put them at greater risk in terms of the dwelling place that they will have to spend their lives in.  It could be a risk to their health and to their financial security in terms of insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support very strongly this amendment.  I know the Minister is aware of the fact that a Department of the Environment memo on the administration of building control in 1982 proposed that low rise housing be exempt from the necessity to comply with the control system.  Obviously, this concept has found its way into this section of the Bill before us.  The views generally are that it would be a considerable disaster to the consumer generally if this were allowed to stand as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Costello said, the purchase of the family home is the single greatest consumer purchase in the lifetime of any family or of any individual.  All we are asking the Minister in the wording of this regulation is to extend the building <Col N="829" /> control regulations to domestic dwellings, that they should provide for domestic dwellings as well as all other construction with the exception, I understand, of prisons.  Could I ask the Minister to take the sentiments of what we are saying on board.  If he quibbles with the wording we will stand corrected.  It is not a tablet of stone, but we are very strongly of the view that domestic dwellings must be included in this particular section under the building control regulations.  I direct his attention to the particular need to add to what little protection there is there to the consumer in the single greatest purchase in his or her life.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably come back and tell us that the national house building guarantee scheme is in operation but this has a limited life.  It only applies to six years after construction and then it is no longer there as a fallback or as a protection.  There is an interesting point here which I think needs to be put on the record that is that that scheme does not only apply to domestic dwellings.  Under the building guarantee scheme &mdash; these are not my figures, they are not local authority figures but the figures of the CIF &mdash; claims for faulty construction and claims in relation to problems of one kind or another are eight times greater outside Dublin than they are in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I might also make the point that we have the by-law regulations in the Dubln area at the moment.  They will go when this legislation is passed.  That just shows that the controls that are in place in the by-law regulation have a positive effect in ensuring there is a minimally acceptable standard of construction.  There is eight times the number of problems outside the Dublin area, where there are no by-law regulations with their inherant controls as there are in Dublin at the moment. In this case we are asking for domestic dwellings to be brought into the legislation. If the Minister could ensure that we would reduce the number of claims of ordinary John and Mary citizens by that amount it would be well worth while accepting our amendment.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, in view of the importance of the purchase of the family <Col N="830" /> home by the individual or indeed by families generally, to accept the sentiments of the amendment.  Hopefully he will be able to accept the wording, if not if he incorporates his wording in the Bill, but taking on board our suggestions, this would be acceptable from our point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that no decisions have been taken to exclude housing from any building control regulations. The type of controls and the buildings to which they apply are matters for the regulations.  I see no reason to single out housing for the type of special treatment which this amendment proposes. In starting up a particular system of control it may be - I say &ldquo;may be&rdquo;&mdash; necessary to exclude certain types of buildings, even domestic dwellings in the interests of curtailing to a reasonable degree the workload arising for building control authorities.  This is a very important point.</P>
      <P>I would make the point also that there are <i>de facto</i> controls on housing already in place, including the new house building guarantee scheme and housing grant inspections.  The amendment could also have the effect of forcing a building control authority to apply for approval for the building of houses which they undertake while wearing their own housing authority hat.  For these reasons I am not able to go down that road with the Senators.  I would like to relieve their anxiety if I possibly can.  It is important that the Bill should be flexible.  I am not saying that housing or any other type of building will be excluded.  These are options which should be available under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello states that dwellings are excluded from control systems under the Bill.  This is not the case.  I would like the Senator to show me where he found this exemption.  I can guarantee Senators that dwellings will be covered in the building regulations and they will have to be built in accordance with the regulations. Senator Costello mentioned radon.  The question of this is one to be dealt with in building regulations not in <Col N="831" /> the control system.  This is an area where a lot of work is being done at this time.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will have the very same powers of inspection under this Bill as they have in the Dublin area at the moment under the by-laws.  I do not think anyone is suggesting that the Dublin authorities are not doing a good job.  I am saying that I do not see a need for this amendment because I do not want to tie it up too much.  I want to leave flexibility in it.  That is my aim now.  I am not excluding housing or any other type of building and I am not saying it will be excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&mdash;) Building control authorities shall carry out such checks of certificates and documents lodged and work in progress and completed buildings, as they consider necessary to satisfactorily monitor the effectiveness of the control system in their area.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with self-certification and this is the second crucial amendment in relation to monitoring. We have lost the vote on self-certification, so that now will be part of the Bill.  Therefore, it is absolutely essential <Col N="833" /> that we have a means of monitoring that self-certification and that we have more than simply a statement to the effect that power to inspect is available to the local authority.  It is essential that that be made a statutory obligation and duty.  That is at the nub of what we are saying here, that there be a minimum a random inspection obligation on the local authority to look into the area of certification, to see that standards are maintained and that what is stated in certificates is factual rather than individuals entering these certificates without complying adequately, effectively and correctly with the requirements.</P>
    <P>Following the Raglan House disaster report, the task force recommended that there be an effective building control system established on a statutory basis. We are not taking this out of the air and saying that it is not necessary.  We are stating what has been stated by a Government body set up specifically to look into one of the most serious tragedies in the building industry.  If we are to have this certification process I think everybody will accept that self-certification, self-assessment or self-monitoring is not sufficient. You must have some outside agency with a specific duty to assess, to examine, to monitor.  The very fear of that happening would have a certain effect on those who might be tempted to abuse the system, which I believe is quite open to abuse.</P>
    <P>There must be an obligation to have random checking of certificates.  It is not much use putting into position penalties for fraudulent abuse of the system unless those people who might be tempted to indulge in such abuse realise that an effective monitoring system is in operation.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  He has not chosen to take on board the other important amendment. I do not think we can allow the legislation to go through with self-certification taking place on the one hand and no statutory obligation to monitor on the other.  That combination is a recipe for disaster.  If the Minister looks at any other area of society where such a system has operated in this country or other <Col N="834" /> countries, he must recognise that it is wide open to abuse.</P>
    <P>Could I urge the Minister most seriously that of all of the amendments that remain here this is the one that I consider to be the most important for him to accept, again not necessarily the exact words but certainly the sentiments and the spirit that is in this amendment.  Let him reword it if he thinks fit but certainly provide a statutory obligation for monitoring of certification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support very strongly the case outlined by Senator Costello in support of this amendment.  Interestingly, thinking back to my short tenure at the Department of the Environment, I understand it was the view of the Department of the Environment in the early eighties, as they were drafting this Bill before us, that such a system should be in place.  In fact, their views were expressed in a memo at the time in words almost identical to the amendment that is here before us today.  We are not preaching heresy.  I know there is a strong body of opinion in the Minister's Department that would support the concept we are moving in this amendment.  I ask the Minister to please ensure that there is a control system, a monitoring system, a spotcheck system of some description, in relation to the self-assessment that it appears we will now have in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When self-assessment became the order of the day, in relation to taxation, the tax inspectors were given the power of random checking, of random monitoring that the assessment was being done on a correct and legal basis and that there was no fraudulent assessment. There are severe penalties for fraudulent self-assessment in the taxation area.  We are talking about self-certification in relation to building construction.  If self-certification is going to be effective at all &mdash; and we have expressed our doubts already here today &mdash; there must be a system of monitoring the control regulations or monitoring the self-assessment to be sure that it is working effectively. If builders &mdash; again we are talking about <Col N="835" /> a minority of builders who are not reputable and who do not enhance the reputation of their honourable profession &mdash; feel that they are never likely to be monitored and that the certificates they issue will never be checked by an outside authority there is little incentive for them to be sure they have their act in order.</P>
    <P>Certification without an adequate policing role for building control authorities will, as the Minister will realise, be absolutely meaningless.  I have already quoted from the task force report on the Raglan House disaster.  That report recommended that an effective building control system be put on a statutory basis.  That is all we are asking from the Minister &mdash; that to support his views in relation to self-certification he should now, on a statutory basis, have an effective building control system backing that self-certification. If certification is to have any useful effect at all in maintaining standards in public health and safety, self-certifiers must be conscious of the fact that any negligence by them has a good chance of being discovered.  In other words, they must be aware that there is an outside body that can inspect and monitor and that can &ldquo;pull them to book&rdquo; and they will have to answer for any irregularities that may have occurred.</P>
    <P>There would be little point, when we come to section 16 (7), in providing penalties for fraudulent certificates unless we have an effective monitoring system able to pick up these fraudulent certificates. The logic of the argument outweighs any contrary argument.  In view of the fact that there is a major body of support for the sentiments contained in this amendment within the Department of the Environment and in view of the logic of the argument and the need to be able to monitor self-certification and the effectiveness of the control system, I urge you to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed to place a statutory obligation on building control authorities to take enforcement action.  This is totally unnecessary.  It is unusual.  It is out of <Col N="836" /> line with other legislation for which the Minister for the Environment is responsible. Local Government legislation generally confers power on local authorities on the basis that these bodies, as responsible public authorities, will use these powers properly and with due regard to the objectives of the legislative code in question.  For example, fire authorities are not required by any specific provision in the 1981 Act to satisfactorily monitor fire safety provisions, but do so because of their general enforcement powers and responsibility.  It is interesting that Senator Doyle is now trying to put statutory obligation to inspect on the local authority.  It was the Senator's Government and Senator Costello's party who produced this Bill.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I am, and always have been, a man with my own views.  I touched on this earlier.  I must point out that this amendment, if accepted, would place a building control authority in an impossible position.  In practice, they would be obliged to supervise every building.  Otherwise, they would be open to the accusation that they had not carried out sufficient monitoring every time a breach of the building regulations came to light.  They could also be open to claims from the very people guilty of breaching the building regulations, if they did not pick up the defects.</P>

      <P>The Minister is seeking to put the &ldquo;frighteners&rdquo; on us on this particular issue.  It is not necessary to have 100 per cent inspection.  We are talking about a random inspection which is what takes place at present under the Dublin by-laws.  This is what is going on at present.  The Minister is telling us, here and now, that Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation are being taken to court because they have not inspected every single one of the buildings they are in the process of inspecting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We can do a random inspection.  The Senators seem to be suggesting that there is a statutory obligation on local authorities to enforce the by-laws. I am not aware of any such statutory obligation.  For example, the building by-laws in force in Dublin city contain no such provision.  We all know that regular inspections are undertaken by the building by-law staff here in Dublin.  The local authorities operating the building by-laws have discretionary powers of inspection at the moment.  They will have similar powers under this Bill.  May I say also that there will be no change?  I would not like to put a statutory obligation on the authority to examine every building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking up some of the points the Minister made, this amendment deals with a monitoring system in relation to the control system the Minister is putting in place.  It is monitoring the control system rather than monitoring the construction.  That is the important point here.  That is the important point rather than detailed inspection of the building at every stage of construction. We want to be sure that the self-certification system that will be put in place is operated above-board and that there is no fraudulent self-certification. The penalties, which we will come to in section 16, will be irrelevant if we do not have a checking system to be sure that the self-certification is working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then dealt with the Dublin by-laws and with the question of whether they were on a statutory basis. In relation to that point, I would like to state yet again the point I made earlier &mdash; that the very fact that Dublin local authorities are using effectively their controls and their monitoring system has meant that there are eight times the number of problems in the construction industry outside Dublin than there are in Dublin at the moment.  That point cannot be forgotten.  They are using their powers of monitoring, inspection and control. They do not appear to be afraid &mdash; as the Minister has led us to believe that local authorities will be in the future &mdash; of claims on them by either the certifier who is being called to book or by the builder, architect or engineer concerned with the particular building.  Apparently, in Dublin the &ldquo;frighteners&rdquo; are not on those operating the by-laws at the moment.  I wonder why the Minister feels that the &ldquo;frighteners&rdquo; now will be on all local authorities if they were to get more involved on a statutory basis with either the certification or the monitoring of self-certification that we will have.  It does not add up.  The Minister made the point <Col N="839" /> earlier that we cannot have jam on both sides of our bread, if I interpret what he was saying to us and with respect, I do not think he can, either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is stating categorically that this cannot be done, because any system of statutory obligation on the local authority would have dire consequences in relation to responsibility and financial responsibility.  What <Col N="840" /> we are proposing here is effectively what the task force proposed, namely, that an effective building control system be put on a statutory basis.  Is the Minister telling us that he got legal advice from the Attorney General to the contrary and that this is not permissible?  If he is saying it cannot be done and we cannot have a system of random checks because he got legal advice that there are too many complex implications for the local authority, then that is a different matter.  If the Minister is simply stating that he is not prepared to employ or put in place a monitoring system because that is his opinion, then we are certainly not prepared to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of misdirection on this.  There certainly is not the slightest difficulty about implementing what is in this proposal.  I have seen it work.  The red herring of liability does not stand up to legal examination for the simple reason that a local authority could make it a requirement, as they do in Dublin, that at every stage of the building documentation has to be submitted to the local authority &mdash; for instance, when the foundations are laid, when the sub-floors are put in, or when they put on the wall plate, etc.  There is no difficulty whatsoever in implementing the first part.  The requirement then on the local authority is to spot check the regulations.  The local authority are not required to give any commitment as to safety with responsibility attaching.  That is not the way it works.  The requirement would only be whatever they wished to do themselves.  Because what they wish to do would be widely known among the building fraternity they would not have created an expectancy that every contractor or builder who submitted the appropriate piece of paper was going to have a full check, and therefore it was not a clarification by the local authority. Liability would only arise if an expectancy were created that every building would be inspected and passed.  Only following some form of certification like that in that arrangement, would liability attach.  Liability cannot attach where <Col N="841" /> there is not an expectancy of every building being required to be tested to meet the requirements.  That is the reality.</P>

      <P>I asked a specific question. Is the Minister stating that as his opinion, or has he got legal advice on the terms of liability on the local authority if <Col N="842" /> this system of monitoring is put in place? The Minister has not replied to that.  My view is that what he is referring to is an inadequacy of staffing and a lack of good intention to provide the necessary resources to ensure that there is an effective system of monitoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a case where a local authority gave a loan, and subsequently serious defects showed up and the local authority were liable in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?  Before issuing and granting the loan, they sent an architect of their own to check the building. Having satisfied himself on behalf of the local authority that the building was in a satisfactory condition, they then issued the loan.  They made three or four decisions before they handed out the money.  When they employed an architect they accepted that liability.  It is important to look at the words again &mdash;&ldquo;in order to satisfactorily monitor the effectiveness of the control system&rdquo;.  One would imagine the Minister would be appreciative of this help but he would have been expected to understand, and the Department to accept, that it is not to satisfactorily implement the building programme, but just to satisfy themselves as to the effectiveness of the monitoring programme.  It is not a way of satisfying themselves that all the building regulations are complied with.  It is a checking of the checking system and a checking of the checkers.  It seems to me a very reasonable way of doing it.  I think the Minister knows &mdash; and I know &mdash; that in planning and building matters there is absolutely no limit to how human ingenuity can get around regulations and rules. I have seen it happen myself.  There is not the slightest doubt but if we put this into operation without a monitoring system then we might just as well deregulate the whole building industry and let the people build wherever they want and how they want to, without any planning authority.  We must have a checking system.</P>

      <Col N="845" /> Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&mdash;) Every person who shall proceed to erect any building or otherwise any work to which the Building Regulations apply, shall submit to the Building Control Authority at least seven clear days notice in writing of the date on which the erection of the building or the execution of the work will commence.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to recognise that any process of checking must begin with the beginning of the building.  The requirement under this amendment is that the person who is proceeding to erect the building shall submit to the authority seven clear days beforehand notice in writing of the date on which the erection of the building or the execution of the work will commence. This seems to be an eminently suitable amendment; but more than that, it is also necessary.  I have been through this process myself.  The first inspection under the Dublin building bylaw regulations in many cases would be the inspection of the foundations.  This fits in very snugly with the general thinking of what is in section 6.  The building authority office will have a lot of useful information about the areas in which building is taking place.  For example, the information on soil type or depth of top soil or subsoil that would be available in the planning authority to the officers there would allow them to be clear about the areas of their county which would require special attention in terms of foundations.  The particular aspect of importance in this would be the foundations.  I do not think we need argue the fact that without a firm foundation the house will not see out its time.  All we are trying to do here is to ensure that the foundations for the house are properly structured.  Therefore, if it would appear to the building authority <Col N="846" /> that in a particular part of the county difficulties may arise from too shallow foundations or whatever, they can then also make sure that those are checked. In other words, if building takes place in an area such as north County Dublin where there might be ten or 12 feet of top soil there is a need for a much deeper foundation than might be required in stoney Kerry, for instance, where it would not be necessary to go to the same depth.  Similarly, within a county or area similar differences do arise.</P>
    <P>More importantly, the amendment would allow within the office a system of planning to take place &mdash; planning to decide at what stage they could check on a particular building.  In my own case I was required to inform the planning authority when the foundations were available for inspection.  I was also required to inform them when the sub-floors were ready for inspection and when the walls were built.  At all levels &mdash; I want to stress this because I do not want the Minister coming back telling me it cannot be done &mdash; this was done. However, under the proposal here it need not necessarily be the requirement that all these stages would be checked.  A requirement to do it could very well get us into aspects of the liabilities mentioned earlier.  There could be an understanding that the builder would bring it to the attention of the housing authority that the foundations were due for inspection on a date given and some days a further certificate would issue to say work had reached the sub-floor level and inspection could take place.  There would be no requirement on the builder at this stage to wait for this to take place.  It would be a matter for the housing authority to decide whether they needed to make the inspection.  This is an efficient way of going about the business of inspection.  It puts every builder on notice that his or her building may be inspected at any given time.  I commend this amendment to the Minister and hope he will look positively on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  It is an extremely important <Col N="847" /> amendment.  It is difficult to see how matters of construction can operate unless commencement notice is given to the building control authority.  Otherwise, there will be a situation where the building control authority will be chasing its tail all over the place trying to find out how this is going to take place.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important that the Minister accept this amendment so that the building control authority is aware of what building is being undertaken in the areas in which they operate.  Could I ask the Minister himself whether he has any intention, in relation to the building regulations he would be drawing up, of entering a clause to this effect &mdash; that there would be a requisite of commencement notice to be given by the particular builder so that the local authority, who would be the control authority, would be in the situation of knowing what was going on.  It seems to me absolutely ludicrous that you could possibly have a situation where the building control authority are not made specifically aware that commencement has started on a particular construction.  This amendment we are putting forward here contains, in fact, the existing wording in the Dublin by-laws at present, so it is not an unreasonable one.  I would expect the Minister either to accept the amendment or to address the question I have put concerning what his intentions are in connection with the content of the building regulations on this matter.</P>

      <P>I agree very much with the two previous speakers and I support this amendment.  I do not think this is too much to ask of the Minister when you think in terms of the importance of the resources of the building control authority &mdash; that they would not be wasting their resources in trying to track down situations after a building has commenced. After all, all that is being looked for here is seven day's notice so that the building control authority would be aware.  It is a simple logical step, to my mind.  Also, as Senator O'Toole said, where you are talking about multi-storey <Col N="848" /> buildings, where you are talking about poor ground and the difficulty of foundations, there are certain types of buildings which would need to be policed by the authority.  Again, I would ask that the authority would be in a position to make selections for random checking.  It is a safeguard.  We do not want a situation of closing the door after the horse has bolted.  It is a simple amendment.  It is something that is logical.  It is the proper use of resources of the building control authority so that they will not have to come when building has commenced and cause problems and delays.</P>

      <P>May I just advert to two points?  First, I think there is certain merit in the amendment, given the fact that under the by-laws in Dublin you have a two-day regulation.  Could I refer the proposers of this amendment to section 6 (2) (k) requiring the giving of notice to building control authorities.  Therefore, the Minister can in fact introduce such a regulation under the Bill itself.  Perhaps the Minister might address that when replying to the questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Senators mean in connection with this amendment.  I would point out that under the structural guarantee scheme notice of opening foundations must be given and an inspection carried out before the foundation is poured.  A further inspection has to be carried out at roofing stage also.  This is a matter which is more appropriate to be included in the regulations. I will give this assurance.  I am favourably disposed to meeting that under the regulations.  I understand what you mean.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that commitment. I will have things to say later on about the introduction of regulations under this Bill which I have difficulty with.  I just want to make a further point which I did not make when I was making my initial presentation.  It is this.  I think one of the great reasons for having this is that the building control authority will know that building is going to commence. <Col N="849" /> Under the Bill as it is at the moment, and as I read the Bill, there is no requirement on anyone to give notification that they have begun to build.  I think we would all agree &mdash; and I think the Minister is agreeing &mdash; that that would be a good thing.  You then say that for those and for other reasons you take on board the merit of the argument we are making and that you would then feel that it could be covered by regulation.  I welcome that commitment, but would the Minister tell the House today that he would, as part of the regulations which will issue following the enactment of this legislation, make it a requirement on local authorities that they would seek commencement certificates?</P>

Requiring the giving of notice to building control authorities of the erection of such buildings or classes of buildings or the carrying out of such works or classes of works as may be specified in the regulations, I think this power is adequate to deal with the subject matter of the amendment.  I would ask you to trust me in regard to the regulations.  I see your point and it can be done by a regulation.</P>

      <P>In page 17, line 30, to delete &ldquo;£10,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£25,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What we are seeking to do here is to delete £10,000 as the penalty and insert £25,000 in relation to matters on indictment. This refers to the fact that the Bill was drafted in 1984 and that was the type of sum of money envisaged at that time. Now we are talking six years down the road and inflation has taken place.  It is now reasonable to reassess the amount of money that would serve an an appropriate penalty and I am suggesting there that it would be much more appropriate that we put in a figure of £25,000.  Even in another area I have been dealing with &mdash; the Casual Trading Act passed in 1980 &mdash; there was a figure of £5,000.  That was to deal with poor, honest-to-goodness street traders who are part and parcel of the colourful life of the inner city.  If we cannot up the ante in this respect to increase it to something substantial, where we are talking about very large sums of money being involved, I do not think we are putting in a penalty that has any teeth.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that a fine of up to £10,000 on conviction on indictment is a reasonable penalty taken together with the other penalties provided for in section 17.  Apart from the fine, the courts may at their discretion impose a term of imprisonment of up to two years.  The maximum amount of a fine is a matter of a judgment.  The Government decided that £10,000 was reasonable and this was accepted by the Dáil.  The penalties in this Bill are severe and I do not see any reason to change them.  Some Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas thought the penalties a little severe, even as they stand now, with the right of the court to impose a prison sentence of up to two years as well as a fine of £10,000.  I think it meets the situation.</P>

      <P>It may be perceived as being severe by the Minister.  In legislation dealing with other areas &mdash; cases where there is quite obviously an inability to pay and ends up in people going to prison &mdash; exorbitant amounts are imposed, and I just quoted one sample. There is also a substantial period of imprisonment specified in that.  I will not press the amendment as we have a couple of amendments to go through.</P>

      <P>In page 19, subsection (4), line 16, after &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and building control regulations&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> I consider this an important amendment. Section 22 (4) states:</P>
    <P>In this Act &ldquo;the operative day&rdquo; means, in relation to any area, the day on which building regulations first come into operation in that area.</P>
    <P>The amendment is to include there &ldquo;and building control regulations&rdquo;.  It is extremely important that the two come into operation on the same day.  It is vital.  There is not much sense in having a situation where building regulations come into operation without the control mechanism in place.  If building regulations are introduced without a control mechanism that would mean that the building industry would be operating in an uncontrolled and potentially dangerous manner.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that the two will come together in tandem.  He will recognise that it would be a dangerous situation if you had an open-ended situation in relation to the building control regulations with no determined or definite time limit on their coming into operation. Could we get an assurance from the Minister that both would come into operation at the same time?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be brief on this.  I am not ruling out that both sets of regulations will not come into operation on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope not to be negative.  I have to confess that when I first looked at this amendment I had difficulty in understanding the intention. It seems that the intention is to ensure that building control regulations are <Col N="853" /> made at the same time as building regulations. I am far from certain that this is the effect of the amendment.  What would be the operative day?  Building regulations and building control regulations come into effect on different days.</P>
      <P>It is clear from our discussion on the Bill that there is general support for the concept of the building regulations while on the question of building control regulations there is, to put it mildly, something less than general consensus in this House or, indeed, outside it.  I have already explained that the powers of inspection and enforcement which the Bill gives the building control authorities are substantial and will enable building regulations to be monitored without necessarily depending on any of the options for control systems set out in section 6.  This is not to say that I am in any way against the making of the building control regulations.  But I can envisage a situation where it may be possible to make building regulations more quickly than building control regulations because of the more extensive potential difficulties surrounding the latter regulations. My position, therefore, is that it would be wrong to risk holding up implementation of the building regulations until all the difficulties with the control regulations are ironed out.  In view of this I do not wish to accept the amendment.  I do not want to give a commitment in regard to that but I am not ruling out that I will not be able to put the two in place on the same day.  However, I do not want to tie myself because there might be some ironing out to do in regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still somewhat worried about what the Minister has said.  He says we just have to get the building regulations into operation &mdash; so, obviously, that can go ahead &mdash; but that there might be difficulties in relation to the building control regulations.  My worry about that is that this could go on <i>ad infinitum</i>.  We might have some committee or some commission established to look into the matter of building control regulations, because there is a <Col N="854" /> greater complexity about that matter, and this could just operate and the control mechanism might not be put in place. Once the Bill has passed through these Houses do we have any guarantee?  I know the Minister has the best of intentions, but the best of intentions are not good enough.  What we need are intentions translated into legislation.  I wonder could be get something more specific on that.  The Minister has expressed it in somewhat negative terms.  We would like it expressed in positive terms.  This amendment would be very beneficial to the Bill to ensure that you had the control mechanism put in place once the building regulations were in operation.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Incomes) (Variation) Regulations, 1990</P>
      <P>a copy of which Regulations in draft was laid before the House on 1st March, 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to be in Seanad Éireann to introduce our annual adjustment to the income ceiling for health contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 9 of the Health Contribution Act, 1979, provides that the Minister for Health may vary the income ceiling which determines the amount payable by an individual, in a particular contribution year.  Subsection (5) of section 9 of the Act requires that a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution has been passed, by each House, approving of the <Col N="856" /> draft regulations.  The draft regulations now before the House shall apply in relation to the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1990.</P>
    <P>The income ceiling is at present £16,000, and it is proposed to increase this to £16,700.  In determining the proposed increase in the income ceiling the Minister for Health has taken into account, as required by the Act, the most recent information available regarding the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries since the last income ceiling was adopted.  The latest recorded information on average weekly earnings in those industries relates to March 1989, when the average figure was £208.79, which was an increase of 4.41 per cent on the March 1988 figure of £199.97.  When this percentage increase is applied to the current £16,000 ceiling a figure of £16,705 emerges.  It is proposed therefore to set the new ceiling at £16,700, an increase of £700.</P>
    <P>Following upon the increase in the ceiling, the maximum contribution payable by any individual will be £212.50, that is, 1,25 per cent of £16,700.  Persons with incomes of £16,000, or less, will not be affected by the increase.  Those with incomes over £16,000 will pay at most, an additional £8.75 in the coming contribution year.</P>
    <P>The additional income which is expected as a result of the proposed increase in the income ceiling will be approximately £1.5 million in the contribution year 1990-91.  Most of this will accrue to the Exchequer in the first quarter of 1991.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have been responsible for the collection of current health contributions from all sectors since 6 April 1984.  The health boards remain responsible for the collection of arrears due from farmers, for periods up to that date.  Health boards can retain these arrears as additional revenue for local health needs.</P>
    <P>The total amount owned by farmers to health boards at 31 December 1989 was about £3.9 million.  The amount outstanding at 31 December 1988 was £4.6 million.  While the amount which is still <Col N="857" /> outstanding is a cause for concern, I am pleased that this amount has been reduced by approximately three-quarters of a million pounds in the past year.</P>
    <P>The Health (Hospital In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1984, came into effect on 1 June 1984.</P>
    <P>These regulations allowed for an admission charge of £100 to be levied on persons admitted for hospital in-patient treatment in a public hospital who were in arrears with health contributions.</P>
    <P>This amount was increased to £150 from 1 July 1986.  This has proved to be quite an effective measure in inducing defaulters to pay their health contributions. However, it is important to mention that persons in arrears are not refused admission to hospitals, but the collection of the admission charge and the arrears is pursued later.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that outstanding arrears should be collected as soon as possible as it is clearly unfair that those who do not honour their obligations with regard to health contributions should continue to obtain health services at the expense of others.  Health boards are continuing their efforts to recover these arrears.  It has been necessary for them to initiate legal proceedings in some cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health will be reviewing shortly the income limit for free consultants' services.  The latter income limit is based on income distribution data which only becomes available around this time of the year.  Consequently, I am not as yet in a position to say what the limit will be.  The proposals before you are a routine yearly measure.  I now ask the House to approve the regulations before it in draft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want at the outset to say that my party will not be opposing the regulations as such.  We will be facilitating the enactment of the regulations but I do want to say that, while we are so facilitating enactment and will not be formally opposing, we must draw the attention of the House and the Minister once again to the fact that these regulations are being passed against a background of continuing crisis in the health <Col N="858" /> service, a background of continuing crisis in patient care, in staffing and in general medical care.</P>
      <P>I want, first of all, to bring to the Minister's attention a very startling and a very dramatic case that has been brought to my attention recently.  I suggest to the Minister that it is not a unique case.  Last Friday night a lady was taken into the Meath Hospital in Dublin for surgery on the following Saturday morning.  She fasted overnight and on Saturday was told that there were no facilities to go ahead with the surgery.  She left the hospital. One can imagine that for an elderly person it was a traumatic experience.  She went home, and was readmitted to the hospital on Sunday for surgery on Monday.  The person who drew this case to my attention is an extremely responsible individual and telephoned me yesterday evening about it.  It is possible that they are not right but all evidence would suggest that they are.  I did my best to double check.  On the Monday the lady was refused surgery again on the grounds that there was no facilities or that there were not adequate staffing arrangements at the time.  She then stayed in hospital and had the operation yesterday, Wednesday.</P>
      <P>I want to draw that case to the Minister's attention and to say that it is an appalling one.  I am aware of similar cases in Blanchardstown Hospital and in my local hospital and around the country.  It is an horrendous, unacceptable state of affairs.  The trauma involved for an old person, the harassment they enduce in having surgery at the appointed time is bad enough.</P>
      <P>There is a waiting list for hip operations of about three to four years and there is a waiting list for cataract operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is important in the context of the regulations to draw the attention of the House and the Minister to the fact that good value and good <Col N="859" /> hospital care are not being delivered to patients.  The 1988 debate provided a precedent for broader discussion.  I will do my best to be as specific as possible.</P>
      <P>The final point I was making is that people are waiting for cataract operations for a period of up to two years.  People are waiting for orthodontic treatment for long periods to the extent that the illness is irreparable when treatment is started. There is no proper programme of dental care for public health patients and no evidence of one being instigated.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board have lost 818 beds in the last three years.  These figures were ascertained in a reply to questions to the Minister for Health in the Dáil.  The Midland Health Board lost 508 beds in the last three years; the Western Health Board lost 615 beds and the North Eastern Health Board lost 147 beds.  In St. Phelim's Geriatric Hospital in Cavan a waiting patient has to depend on the death of an inmate in order to gain admission.  I am not being colourful about that.  There is no room.  That presented problems during the particularly bad weather this year and the outbreak of flu.  There is a crisis about availability of hospital beds.  There is a crisis with regard to staffing levels.  In the period from 1986 to 1989 there has been a reduction of 6,124 medical staff employed by the Department of Health, including nursing and general medical staff.</P>
      <P>Another matter that requires urgent attention is care of the aged.  Because of demographic patterns there is an obvious increase in the number of aged persons in our community.  If an adequate care structure is not provided soon problems will arise.  There will be 7.4 percentage points increase in persons over the age of 65 in the period from now until the year 20001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study has been done called <i>The Years Ahead</i> pointing out that there will be a major increase in the number of the aged and it would be my contention that the question of care has not been addressed adequately.  The recent cutbacks have affected people suffering a whole multitude of illnesses.  I await the Minister's <Col N="860" /> response because I have to say, in fairness to this Minister, that the last time he was in the Seanad he was extremely constructive and helpful in addressing the questions raised on the health services and I hope he will do so today in reply. I have to say to the Minister that it is my party's contention that we are developing a two &mdash; tier health service in the broad sense that only those who are members of the VHI or who can afford private treatment can have a reasonable expectation of a proper health service.  There is a two-tier health service.  That is a bad situation which needs reversal.</P>
    <P>The problems of the health service are specifically manifested in the waiting lists, particularly for hip and cataract operations.  They are certainly manifested in understaffing and in cases, such as I have drawn attention to, of persons being released from hospital without surgery. The Government, and indeed all Governments over the last number of years, have said that community health care must be the vanguard of the health service, the jewel in the crown, the method by which we reduce expenditure in that better community care prevents hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that the Government are about to instigate a proper programme of community care.  There is a tremendous need for extra public health nurses.  There is a definite need to increase the allowance for home help which is at the discretion of individual health boards.  In my area a home help is paid £1.20 per hour.  We need extra public health nurses, we need increased payment for home help.  We made a mistake when we got rid of the Health Education Bureau because we must&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was making some concluding remarks but I will return to community care for a moment.  We need an increased number of community care and public health nurses and extra allowance for home help.</P>
      <P>I was making the point that we should not have abolished the Health Education Bureau because by prevention and education of people we can limit the number of hospitaised cases.  While we will not oppose these particular regulations, my party remain alarmed at the crisis in the health service, at the level of personal hardship being suffered.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, my party remain alarmed and can miss no opportunity to remind the House of our concern and alarm at the failure of Government to address the fact that we are developing a two-tiered health service, that there is great injustice and great personal suffering.  I am reminding the House that we consider these things in the context of our Christian philosophy as a nation and ask ourselves to what degree is the kind of health service we are developing now in tandem with our supposed Christian commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it was with absolute <Col N="862" /> sincerity that I intervened.  It is a matter that both Senator O'Reilly and I feel strongly about.</P>
      <P>The Health Contributions Act provides for an annual increase in the ceiling on contributions in order to keep pace with the rise in the average earnings. These regulations before us today are a routine procedure and give effect to that provision.  The regulations raise the question of efficient savings and the value of money in the health services.  We have to be careful that we maintain the service and get effective and efficient savings and value for money.</P>
      <P>Like Senator O'Reilly I think some of the problems in health and the worries and deep concerns about efficient spending of money arise from mistakes made in past years.  No party, least of all my party, has a great record on that.  We all made mistakes and I put that on the record.</P>
      <P>The increase in the limit means an additional income of about £1.5 million in the health services.  As Senators know, there are many calls on the resources available to the Minister.  I appreciate deeply Senator O'Reilly's and Fine Gael's support in not opposing the regulations.  If I remember correctly, the regulations were opposed last year.  We have to be careful that the money is spent wisely and that we keep the confidence of our people in the service that is in place, which is an excellent service.</P>
      <P>Confusion is caused by all the hype about cuts.  The budget for health is £1.4 billion and the Exchequer amount is £1.24 billion.  Comparison could be made with the cost in 1974, which was, £174 million.  The health contribution is small but very important and will bring in about £128 million or roughly around 10 per cent of the total cost of the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Revenue Commissioners are responsible for collection since 1984 and the health boards are responsible for collecting arrears.  I had intended to ask questions but he answered them in his early address to the Seanad when he said some arrears are still outstanding.  Have they succeeded in getting more of that money?  As in every <Col N="863" /> other section certain taxpayers are responsible and pay the contribution while others have no conscience about not paying.  Unfortunately the contributions make very little impact on the cost of the health services today.  We must ask if we are getting value for the money being spent on health.  This increase in the limit will not involve hardship.  Anyone earning up to £16,000 a year does not pay the contribution.  Persons earning £16,700 per annum will have to pay £8.75 a year.  So a person earning over £16,700 per annum is being asked to pay 20p a week.  Any increase is another increase in taxation.</P>
    <P>I, like Senator O'Reilly, would like a longer debate on this subject some time. I pay tribute to the Minister Treacy because the last day he was in this House on health he was excellent and I hope when he comes again he will have this long awaited debate on health.  I am grateful to Senator O'Reilly for his support of the draft regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to sincerely thank Senators O'Reilly and Honan for their very positive contributions to this important debate on a regulatory change and we appreciate the unanimous support it has got.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly referred to some general issues concerning hospital services.  I do not think it would be appropriate for me to deal with such matters in today's debate which after all is concerned only with the income limit for health contributions. However, Senators will be aware of the action programme for the health boards and health services announced recently by the Minister which includes the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An efficiency drive for health boards and hospitals headed up by Mr. Noel Foxe of Spicer, Oppenheim, Consultants. This will be done in conjunction with the efficiency added group and will review efficiency in all acute hospitals throughout the <Col N="864" /> country.  The Dublin hospitals' initiative to promote integration of Dublin hospital services is headed up by Mr. David Kennedy, former chief executive of Aer Lingus.  This will include an initiative on admission policies, out patient arrangements and discharge arrangements for the patients needing support outside of hospitals; a new emphasis on the patient as a consumer which will require hospitals to operate efficient appointment systems, a patient's charter ensuring more information before, during and after treatment, a new appeal system for medical card holders.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, my colleague Deputy O'Hanlon, announced that recently and we believe it will have a major impact on the management of the health services in the years ahead, particularly in the acute hospitals and in the Dublin area where a vast amount of resources are being expended providing services for our people.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly also talked about the fact that health boards have lost a lot of beds.  Perhaps they have lost beds in particular areas but if examined in detail it will be found that many of these beds have been transformed and allocated to the geriatric area in particular, and perhaps the mentally handicapped area so that the total number of beds available for health services has remained virtually the same over the last few years.</P>
    <P>He also spoke about the need for orthodontics.  I would like to remind the House that over the past four months we have allocated £3.3 million for the dental services and a good percentage of this is for orthodontics.  He also spoke about the need for care of the aged.  I would remind the House that we included £5 million in our recent budget specifically for geriatric care.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly talked about extra public health nurses and extra money for home helps and so on.  We would all love to be able to pay more money to home helps and to provide vast resources both by way of personnel and facilities and expenditure.  As Senator Honan said, we <Col N="865" /> are spending £1.4 billion on health services this year.  This is in stark contrast to 1974 when the health services only cost £174 million.  While we would all love to provide more resources the fact that we are spending 21.5 per cent of our Exchequer resources on the health services this year is positive proof of the commitment of this Government to maintain a modern health care service for the people.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly spoke about the abolition of the Health Education Bureau.  As somebody who had doubts about that when it happened and now find myself in the Department of Health, I am delighted to say that one of the most positive public service agencies in the country, and one of the agencies doing the best job in the country at this time, is the new Health Promotion Unit in the Department, which is strategically located, which is headed up by very good people and which is doing an excellent job.  It is flexible and innovative in the job it is doing.  It is doing tremendous work for health promotion and health education throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Health Education Bureau has been replaced by the Health Promotion Unit is only of greater significance in the creation of a better and more informed public and in the promotion of our health services.  I am sure Senator O'Reilly is pleased with the performance of my Government colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, who is one of his constituency colleagues. He is a very caring, calm and compassionate man who is doing an excellent job as Minister for Health.  I am very proud to be working with him.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Honan also for her contribution.  We are committed to collecting the arrears of health contributions. We have reduced the arrears by approximately £.75 million in the past year and we hope that the health boards will be in a position to increase that further over the next year.  The Minister and the Department have agreed, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, that any moneys collected by way of <Col N="866" /> arrears for health contributions will go directly to the local health board as local funding.  It is very important that everybody would pay their way, that the money that should be paid for health services is paid by those who owe it, that we can maintain our services and make sure that there is equalisation in the delivery of service to everybody and that everybody pay their way for the services that are needed.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank the House for their very positive contributions.  I am very grateful that Senators have accepted these regulations unanimously, I know they will be to the benefit of our health services.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - County Limerick National School Extension.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Minister for the fact that the building of the extension for Richill National School, Lisnagry, County Limerick, is commencing. It is a happy ending to a long saga that started some years back when two schools in the parish of Castleconnell were in a deplorable state and the first school in Castleconnell got its extension and Richill National School extension, I suppose for lack of finance etc. did not go ahead at that particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is in the environs of Limerick city. The urgency with which the parents, teachers and pupils pushed for this extension to be built relates to the fact that what one would call commuter people and locals, folk indigenous to the area, are under intense competition from city schools nearby and likewise neighbouring schools.  It is a credit to the excellent teachers who are in the school and the parents that they actually tolerated the <Col N="867" /> conditions of that school over a long period.  They understand the importance of school to the life of a rural area.  It is quite rural though it is within the city environs.  The fact that the extension is going ahead now will mean that those parents and other parents in the area will choose that school for their students.  This raises the point of the loss of a teacher over the last year because of falling numbers, not because of the lack of interest in the school but because the conditions were so deplorable that parents could not subject their children to this.  As a teacher I am aware of the difficulties in relation to prefabs and so on, but that school was just unbelievably dilapidated, rat infested, no toilet facilities, with prefabs that really had seen a better time.</P>
    <P>There are 250 children attending the school with eight teachers.  At present they have just four classrooms.  I want to refer briefly to the motion for the Adjournment of the Seanad, which I raised regarding the night of the big storm under Standing Order 29 some weeks ago, on that night, when fortuitously, as I said, the students were on a mid-term break, one pre-fab was actually blown down.  The destruction to furniture etc. was so serious that if students had been in that classroom on that day I shudder to think what would have happened.  It was an act of God but that focused the mind of both the media in the mid-west and the Minister on the situation.  It was unfortunate in one way that it had to reach the stage where a serious accident could have happened.  I am sure the Minister can understand the concern of parents.</P>
    <P>That pre-fab was part and parcel of the pre-fabs in existence, so for the last number of weeks the children are sharing days.  One half of the class comes in at 9 o'clock until 12 o'clock and the other half from 12 o'clock until 3 o'clock, so really the children are only getting a half day's education.  The Minister smiles.  It might be all right for one week to get the odd half day off.  This has happened since that particular storm night in February and <Col N="868" /> will continue until the pre-fabs are erected on the site.</P>
    <P>The Minister has sanctioned the extension. I have some questions for her.  First, has the contract been signed once and for all with the builder who actually appeared on the site today?  It is very important that we have that clarified.  Secondly, the completion of this building is very urgent because the situation with those students is still the same as it has been for the last few years.  In fact, some students attending that school have never sat in a decent classroom for the whole of their primary school life.  It is a credit to them and their parents that they feel so strongly about keeping their students at school that they have put up with this over such a long period.</P>
    <P>The level of teaching is extraordinarily good in this school.  The results are likewise. It is one school &mdash; I know this is something the Minister is very very keen on &mdash; where there is tremendous empathy between the parents, the staff and, of course, the students.  All concerned are very anxious that the children are not left in the present circumstances for much longer..</P>
    <P>I know that porto-cabins which have been sanctioned by the Office of Public Works.  The Department pay nine-tenths of the overall price, of these which is quite sizeable but they will not arrive on site for six to eight weeks so we will have another two months at least of the half day student situation going on.  That is something I, as a teacher, feel very strongly about.  This whole school year, from September on &mdash; by March two-thirds of the school year has elapsed &mdash; has been completely disrupted for the students.</P>
    <P>In regard to the pre-fabs is it within the power of the Minister's Department to see that they are placed quicker than within eight weeks so as to avoid any further disruption to the 250 students who are still attending school in these deplorable conditions where the pre-fabs they had have been blown away and they are left with four rooms.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will treat this as an urgent case and that there will be <Col N="869" /> monitoring of the pupil-teacher ratio at this school.  The Minister's commitment to the replacement of a teacher when the numbers increase would give the school the support it needs at the moment when there is such commitment on behalf of the parents and teachers.  They are very pleased that the extention is going ahead but it was as a result of intense lobbying and intense pressure continuously by the parents and teachers.  I have visited that school on several occasions at different times and I found the conditions deplorable.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible to have the school completed as a matter of urgency?  The builder has to go through the various motions but I hope money will be forthcoming and that the whole operation will be speeded up.  Secondly, when numbers increase &mdash; they decreased because parents took their children out and sent them elsewhere because some of them were not able to put up with the conditions &mdash; I trust that the teacher replacement will be forthcoming.  Could something be done about the temporary solution of the porto-cabins to ensure that they are installed within a shorter period than eight weeks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the first time I have met Senator Jackman in the Seanad.  She is a member of the honourable profession to which I also belong.  That does not mean that politics are not honourable, too.  I am glad to be here to answer the debate. The whole chain of events relating to this school was most unusual in how it developed.  The Senator spoke of her domestic knowledge of the scene and I have the political knowledge and the knowledge from within the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman asked when the contract would be signed.  I am glad to tell her that the contract for the major extension was signed last week.  The builder has advised my Department that he will commence work on the site at an early date so events have overtaken the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator asked if we can ensure that the building will proceed with all <Col N="870" /> speed.  I do not personally watch every builder on every site in Ireland.  I have enough to do.  It is a matter for the builder as to how he proceeds.  I hope the local management and the various political interests, who have taken such a huge interest in this matter, would also keep an eye on the builder.  I certainly would not have responsibility for the speed or otherwise at which various builders throughout the country operate.  That is certainly a matter to which the local management can apply their energies.  The builder in question has been in touch with the architect regarding the necessary arrangements for starting on site.  I stress, from our side of it, that the contract was signed last week.  After that it is out of my hands, as to how quickly the builder starts.</P>
    <P>The temporary difficulties arise from a situation over which nobody had any control.  A storm is an act of God and is so defined for insurance purposes.  The severe storm on the night of 26 February damaged the three classroom prefabricated unit.  It is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the board of management to deal with matters arising from storm damage including consultation with the school's insurers.  Notwithstanding that, we intervened in the situation.  Normally we would not.</P>
    <P>My Department and the local architect have been very much involved in trying to secure an acceptable short term solution because let me stress that arrangements for the long term solution, i.e. the invitation for tenders, the arranging for tenders, the placing of the tenders and the signing by the builder had all gone ahead prior to any storm.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department met the principal on 1 March 1990.  He said he was considering a number of options for the administration of the school.  It has now emerged that the board of management of the school wish that four prefabricated classrooms be provided as temporary accommodation while the local architect takes up another point of view.  They are talking to one another. The board of management are meeting this evening to finalise what they think <Col N="871" /> should be the position.  Because of the urgency of the case the local architect is awaiting tenders from suppliers of prefabricated classrooms.  Talks are going on on that between the principal, the manager and the board of management.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the school's difficulties in trying to continue classes in present circumstances.  I know the Senator will accept that we have spared no energies in trying to secure a solution to the problem.  The long term solution was, thankfully, arrived at some time before the storm ever erupted so that the future of Richhill school is well assured through the provision of the permanent accommodation.</P>
    <P>The provision of the temporary accommodation arising out of storm damage is a matter for the board of management but because of the unusual circumstances and because of the urgency we have intervened and are making all possible haste in consultation with the board of management who must have the say finally on that matter to see what acceptable solution can be arrived at.</P>
    <P>With regard to the supply of the extra teacher, as the Senator will be aware, there are arrangements with the Irish National Teachers Organisation for the retention and the acquisition of teacher appointments.  Into this matter would fall the issue which the Senator has raised. On a general level the school at Richhill is regarded as a very well run, with excellent teachers who have a great rapport with the pupils and the parents.  On a broader issue the Senator will be aware that there are huge demographic changes taking place in Ireland and there being fewer pupils in Richhill has nothing to do with either the conditions of the school or the nature of teaching.  The teaching there is excellent, as the Senator has said. A reduction in the number of teachers would result only from a reduction in the number of pupils.  Between 1980 and 1990 there has been a 28 per cent drop nationwide in births.  While the provision of the excellent new permanent facilities will be <Col N="872" /> of great benefit to the school and something which they are well due, I hope that the short term arrangements can be worked out satisfactorily.  The overall question of numbers remains to be seen. It would be taken into account in the demographic changes.</P>
    <P>Teacher appointments depend on pupil enrolments and they, in turn, are contained in the arrangements worked out with the INTO and the Department.  I enter a caveat that they are now based as per the arrangement on the 30 September enrolment of the previous year.  That is contained in a written agreement between the union and the Government. It is mostly for the good of schools.  If you are looking back in a situation where numbers are falling then you stand to retain for a longer period.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter, I am glad to have been here to put on the record my commitment to Richhill school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask another question?  It is in relation to the demographic trends.  I appreciate the Minister has to consider the falling numbers throughtout the country.  I am just two miles from that school.  Numbers are increasing in that area because there is intense building going on.  It happens to be on the periphery of the city and I do not think there will be any fall in numbers. I have to disagree with the Minister there and say that the fall in numbers was due to the fact that some parents would not subject their children to the prevailing conditions there and had a choice of taking them to nearby schools on the outskirts of the city.</P>
