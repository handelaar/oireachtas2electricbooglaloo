      <P>I have notice from Senator Murphy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to reverse the decision to withdraw field staff in the Ordnance Survey service.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Upton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The discontinuation of grants for smokeless heating conversions by virtue of the Government's refusal to make any further special control area orders with particular reference to the Crumlin, Drimnagh and Bluebell areas of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Labour to intervene in the industrial relations dispute, which is threatening the survival of 120 full-time and 180 part-time jobs, at the meat plant &mdash; details submitted &mdash; and the need for the Minister to make a statement on the matter</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase funding to enable Dublin Corporation to continue their programme of upgrading their housing stock.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to immediately outline the future employment prospects for all our customs officers in the light of the free trade position in the EC from 1 January 1993, and in regard to his recent announcement concerning the introduction of automatic entry processing and direct trades input, on 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The unacceptable delay in the processing of investigations by the Garda Complaints Board and the need for the Minister to allocate additional staff immediately thereto.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to take urgent action to prevent the unauthorised demolition of three Georgian buildings on Arran Quay, Dublin.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The concern of employees in Irish Life regarding the proposed sale, with the necessity for full consultation with and information to be made available to all employees regarding their future.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to appoint a temporary teacher to Killaloe national school to cover the period September 1990 to 1991.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Murphy, Upton, Neville, Costello, Doyle, Ross and Jackman as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have <Col N="619" /> selected Senator Murphy's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Upton, Neville, Costello, Doyle, Ross and Jackman may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule that the matters raised by Senator Norris and Senator Cosgrave are not suitable for discussion &mdash; Senator Norris's on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility and Senator Cosgrave's as it advocates legislation.</P>

      <P>It is intended that, as agreed, we take the report on the Nicaraguan elections from Senator McKenna and Senator McDonald for half an hour, that we take the Derelict Sites Bill: Committee Stage (Resumed) to 5.30, that we take all Stages of the Decimal Currency Bill from 5.30 to 6.30 and that we take the Private Members' motion from the Independent group from 6.30 to 8 o'clock.</P>

      <P>I was extremely pleased to know that the Irish ambassador was among the three ambassadors who spoke last weekend to the Government in Iraq about clemency for the two people who are now under sentence from courts there.  I would like to urge that this House, in a way that would not unduly affect the sensitivities of the authorities in Iraq make a further plea for clemency in the case of these two people.  I realise it is a sensitive matter and that the crescendo of condemnation from the West may well exacerbate the situation but there is a special relationship in some ways, in trade especially, and in other areas, between this country and Iraq.  I hope we can have all-party agreement on this.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to give notice that my group will, under Standing Order 29, be raising the question of the illegal demolition of houses on Arran Quay.  I will give notice now that we will be raising that issue this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express concern at the slowness with which item No. 10 on the Order Paper, the Committee Stage of the Marine Institute Bill, is being approached.  In my contribution on Second Stage I pointed out that it is very important that this Bill be passed expeditiously because there is a question of various fundings being involved which await the succesful completion of the Bill.  May I also suggest, in very general terms and without any specific reference, that it is a question of the good name of this House that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should now consider the implications of Article 15.13 of Bunreacht na hÉireann in relation to behaviour of Members of this House?  Let me add my mystification that certain matters on the Order of Business are apparently approved, others are not.  I am in favour of any relevant matter which has come up since the previous sitting being discussed if it is not simply a particular publicity tactic on behalf of Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I offered the comment in good faith.  That is a cheap retort. What intrigues me is that Senator Manning has just made quite a lengthy statement on the Iraqi issue and while I was glad to hear what he said, I would like to be assured that were I or other Independent Senators to raise a similar topic of public importance, which has nothing directly to do with the Order of Business, we would not be shot down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I want to make a few comments concerning the sense of frustration there is in this House regarding our lack of liaison with the European Community which I regard, and as others do, as being completely inadequate.  There is no scope within the present framework of things for serious Members of the Oireachtas to <Col N="621" /> consult with the European Community. The Community committee of the House concerns secondary legislation and is thus reactive and there is scope for a committee to consider this EC situation.  I want to contrast that with the powers of the Executive at present.  In that context I would ask the Leader of the House to give consideration again to the establishment of the foreign affairs committee about which there was a consensus politically in this House.  Since the debate last week there has been seething discontent and much public comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was debated last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, and the Cathaoirleach has been very good in giving me some latitude, but there is frustration and we are so powerless in the matter.  There is even a rumour circulating at present that the Oireachtas may not sit in April and June this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Leader of the House to give consideration again to this whole question of a foreign affairs committee.  In the absence of a Government initiative, perhaps we in the Seanad should now seriously talk about the formation of our own committee until such time as a wider committee gets established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he would be prepared to allow time for a debate on developments in relation to Irish Life which were announced on Monday?  These developments have taken place without any consultation with the Houses of the Oireachtas and certainly it is a fundamental change of policy and therefore I think it would be appropriate that we have a debate on it immediately, in other words, today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully endorse what <Col N="622" /> Senator Staunton had to say about the increasing irrelevance of Parliament in this country as a balance in the process of democracy.  We are effectively an elected dictatorship which is accountable once every four or five years and in the intervening periods the role of the Oireachtas is no more than that of a classical Eastern European rubber stamp which does what it is told.  I think it is time the Oireachtas reasserted itself.  I would fully endorse what Senator Staunton had to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt Senator Ryan but I think he should withdraw the statement that we are in a dictatorship. We are in a democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said we were in an elected dictatorship which is arguably within the definitions of democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the sort of genial tolerance that you have shown, a Chathaoirligh, today I am sure you will not prevent me from complimenting the Supreme Court on its vindication of the rights of Irish citizens yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hear &ldquo;hear hear&rdquo; from the opposite benches.  The opposite benches could have ensured that we did not need the Supreme Court to do this vindication.  It is a pity they did not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a great latitude to interrupt on that side of the <Col N="623" /> House.  May I say, as a matter of clarification, for the Leader of the House, that the motion being taken this evening is not a motion from the Independent group, it is a motion from some members of the Independent group and he ought to be precise on these issues.  We do, among the Independent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They seem to be in the humour for interrupting but the answer to Senator Fallon's question is yes, we are a group, we are actually a group who believe people are able to make up their own minds about issues and do not need party Whips or dictatorship from on high to tell them what to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We believe in democracy. Is that not a surprise?  That is our view.  I fully support Senator Murphy.  I think the precise meaning of constitutional privileges for Members of this House ought to be investigated with considerable urgency by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is a considerably more important issue than some of the trivia to which they have devoted an enormous part of their time in recent weeks.  I think it is extremely important. May I say, a Chathaoirligh&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you a question for the Leader of the House relating to the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope, through you, a Chathaoirligh, that the question of the propriety of the behaviour of a Member of this House being discussed in the other House is raised vigorously with those who do business in the other House.  I think <Col N="624" /> this House is responsible for the behaviour of its Members, not the other House. We are not a secondary House to be run from somewhere else.  We run our own&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not, I hope, engaged in a discussion of this matter because it was described as being <i>sub judice</i> and it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I never mentioned the matter.  I mentioned the discussion of the matter in another House which I think is a grave breach of the privilege of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a particular ruling in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, a Chathaoirligh, I am not attempting even to discuss the issue.  I am discussing the propriety of it being raised in the other House which I would have thought would have been a matter of concern to you as the one who vindicates the dignity of this House.  That is the view I would take of it.  I would ask the Leader to ensure that matters to do with this House are not discussed in other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if any progress has been made on the establishment of the committee of the Seanad to examine the possibility of extending Seanad voting rights to the two universities and other appropriate institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House that motion 90 would be debated by the House as a matter of urgency.  It now emerges that the particular district justice, who is no longer a justice, in fact, reached a total of 111,000 cases, and the Supreme Court has now said that the person who was accused in this case was never tried by a constitutionally competent court for the alleged offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, there has been very strong, unanimous criticism by the Supreme Court of the effort by the Oireachtas to <Col N="625" /> convict people rather than have the courts do it.  There are many thousands of citizens who are not concerned about this matter and it is a matter that should be debated as a matter of urgency by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Seo é seachtain na Gaeilge.  Tá slogan speisialta sa tír anois &mdash; labhraimis Gaeilge.  Nuair a bhíos i Seanad Éireann ar an gcéad dul síos bhí liosta focal Gaeilge le fáil chun cabhrú linn.  We used to get lists of words from the translation service.  It was a great help to those of us who falteringly wished to participate in debates in the first national language.  I hope that during Seachtain na Gaeilge this procedure might be reinstigated.</P>
      <P>With regard to item No. 30, the Leader of the House gave an undertaking that he would continue to press Government with regard to what their reaction would be to the decision of the European Court. With regard to item No. 14, the Irish Nationality and Citzenship (Amendment) Bill, 1989, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would seek clarification on this so that those who have a personal interest in this Bill &mdash; it is a matter that affects families &mdash; could have some news on the matter.  I would like to welcome the statement from Senator Manning, the Leader of Fine Gael, that he will be raising the matter of the demolition of the houses on Arran Quay, under Standing Order 29, and I look forward with great interest to the ruling that will be given on that.  I hope he will be successful.  It is a most important matter which many of us take to heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I understand provision is being made for an item which is not on the Order Paper, that is the report from certain Members of the House who were in Nicaragua.  I welcome this.  I think it is part of the democratic process.  It would be rather more democratic if provision were also made for a member of the House who was duly selected, Senator Murphy, to make a contribution, as I took part in the process by which he was selected for that delegation.  He was not <Col N="626" /> able to go and I think his views would be most interesting.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Senator Staunton's comment on information being fed back to us as a House of the Oireachtas from Europe.  I feel strongly about information not coming directly back from Europe, whether we hold Presidencies or not, and I have many times proposed that this House should be used at times for some of our MEPs to come in and speak to us.  Certainly it was relevant in the three months that have gone by.  I feel strongly that ordinary backbenchers of all parties should be kept up to date on the information coming through from Europe, which is dictating nearly all of our lives now.  I support Senator Staunton.  I am not asking for a foreign affairs committee but I am asking for more information from our Ministers. Only the Members of parliamentary parties who are lucky enough to be selected for committees are told what is going on and the rest of us are not told at all.  I support Senator Staunton and I hope this will be taken up by all parties and that we will be listened to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House whether the Government have given consideration to having a discussion in this House on one of the most serious national issues in recent times, the shocking haemhorrage of our population and the massive numbers of emigrants to England and America, in particular, and to mainland Europe.  It is particularly pertinent now, as St. Patrick's Day approaches, that we should consider the fact that such large numbers of our young, talented population are now across the water.  It merits discussion by this House and serious analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support my colleague, Senator Upton, in his <Col N="627" /> request that time be given at least for statements to be made in relation to Irish Life and the implications of the steps that are being taken at present in relation to it by the Government.  This is the first step towards major privatisation of the semi-State sector.  It is too important a matter to go without a full debate in this House.  I would like the Leader of the House to indicate if he will give time for statements to be made for a full-scale debate to take place today or tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to raise again the question of Northern Ireland and to ask the Leader of the House when time will be made available to discuss this very important matter.  We have requested this again and again since the House resumed at the beginning of November. We have an enormous number of events unfolding in relation to Northern Ireland. We had the Supreme Court case in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution last week.  This week we have the whole question of extradition.  We had also the Anglo-Irish parliamentary tier the week before and we have the whole question of statements being made now in relation to the validity of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It is extremely important that a full-scale debate take place.  This House has not yet been given any time for such a debate while one has taken place in the other House.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Leader of the House whether something is going to be done in relation to Article 15.13, of the Constitution and if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are going to look into that matter because of the events that have taken place recently.  It is, as stated by Senator Ryan, unacceptable that matters that concern this House should be dealt with solely in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like to support Senator Manning in relation to the unauthorised demolition of Georgian houses at Arran Quay.  It is an insult to this House that while we are about to debate the Derelict Sites Bill, which is intent on closing loopholes in relation to planning permission and in relation to dealing with derelict <Col N="628" /> sites, we have developers who we can only describe as speculators&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Manning in his comments in relation to the unfortunate affair of the Iranian journalist who has been sentenced to death in Iraq and to the English nurse who is employed by an Irish company PARC.  I am rather disappointed also and I do not mean to cast aspersions on my colleagues on all sides of the House, but I have listened with interest to the various contributions on the Order of Business and nobody has, as yet, made any comment in support of Senator Manning. We are dealing with a human rights issue here.  We have a very strong trading link with Iraq and here is an opportunity for a country like Ireland with enormous influence, particularly in the context of the Presidency of the European Community, to raise what is fundamentally a human rights issue.</P>
      <P>I am a working journalist.  I am a member of the National Union of Journalists so I have a certain interest in cases like this.  There are many of them around the world.  I wanted to support Senator Manning and I am delighted that he raised the issue in this House.  I know he spoke for all of us.  It is just a little unfortunate that there was not more support given to his intervention by the other Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I hope his remarks to the Leader of the House will be conveyed to the Government that here is an opportunity for us. It is impossible at this remove to know the rights and wrongs of the case but the reality is that a man is fighting for his life and a woman has been given 15 years imprisonment under a regime which does not have a very good record in regard to human rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few points on the taking of the Order of Business which need to be clarified. There have been at least five or six speeches made here today on the Order of Business.  The difficulty is that there is a lack of understanding among Members about how it should be taken.  I think it should just be clarified that it is not a speech that is out of order.  It is a speech on the topic.  My understanding, and I certainly looked back over the years in the Seanad Chamber, is that there is a very strong, long tradition of speeches being made on the Order of Business but they were speeches in favour of the taking of something rather than on the Business itself.  That is one issue.  Today, at least three Members referred to the introduction of a Standing Order 29.  This has become an increasingly accepted practice in the House and I would like to have your view on that, a Chathaoirligh.  My understanding is that it is not appropriate to make a formal pre-announcement that a Standing Order 29 is going to be requested.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to bring clearly to the attention of the Members on the far side of the House that a group is a group as defined in the Standing Orders of this House.  There seems to be a great many problems for some people who do not know the difference between a group and a party.  Parties are not envisaged in the structure of this House under Standing Orders.  A group is a group as outlined under the Standing Orders of the House. That does not require people to vote the same way on every issue because they are part of a particular group.  It seems unnecessary for me, as a new Member of this House, to have to bring that to the attention of a much esteemed and senior Member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to respond to those who asked for a debate on Northern Ireland by just stating that I requested a matter under Standing Order 29 on the breakdown of the extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and here as a result of yesterday's court <Col N="630" /> decision, which I have submitted for your discretion for later in the day.  I would just point out that a similar type debate was allowed under the Standing Order in the last Seanad on the same issue, in similar circumstances.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to ask the Leader of the House a non-contentious, factual question from which nobody could take any offence whatsoever, on any side of the House, which is something fairly unique I suppose, and that is whether we will be taking the B &amp; I Bill today or tommorrow.  I gather it is an emergency Bill for early signature and is going through the Dáil at this moment.  I imagine we might be taking it tomorrow. I would like to know when we are taking it so that we are prepared for it.  I would also ask the Leader of the House to ensure that we are given substantial time to debate it.  I know it is something which has to be passed fairly quickly because it is a matter of money which the company need but I hope we will be given time for a full debate on it because it is a very important issue.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to support Senator Manning's appeal for mercy for the journalist in Iraq.  I would like to say to Senator Mooney that I am sure everybody on this side is extremely apologetic that they did not get up in support of Senator Manning.  It is a human rights issue but I do not really see why this side of the House should take lectures from the other side of the House on human rights and I do not see why this side of the House should take lectures from the other side of the House on Iraq because one of the reasons why that man is condemned to death is because whatever offence he committed was committed in a tyrannical fascist regime.  I have not heard the Government here raise their voices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would ask the Leader of the House if we could possibly have, when this matter is resolved &mdash; I regard it as sensitive and I accept Senator Manning's assurances &mdash; a full debate in this House on our relations with Iraq?

      <P>On the last intervention by Senator Neville, may I just point out that Supreme Court decisions are made by the Supreme Court and it is up to the Supreme Court to make their decisions. I think, in all fairness, that the Supreme Court acts exceptionally well in its decisions.  I was asked what the Government's attitude is on this motion No. 90. I will pass that question on and request a reply for Senator Kennedy and Senator Neville on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first item raised by Senator Manning, I concur with him that this House should, on humanitarian grounds, ask the Iraqi Government to rescind the death penalty which has been imposed on the journalist from <i>The Observer</i><Col N="632" /> newspaper.  I do not think the comments made by Senator Ross will do the case very much good.  It was unfortunate, when we were speaking on a humanitarian issue, that other extraneous issues should have been brought into the argument. I do not think it was helpful.</P>
    <P>With regard to the B &amp; I Bill, this Bill has to be taken eight days after it finishes in the Dáil.  We will be taking it on Wednesday of next week.  There will be ample time to discuss the matter in full on that day.  Standing Order 29 applications are not a matter for me as Leader; they are a matter for decision by the Cathaoirleach. The question of Arran Quay is a matter for decision by the Cathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>I accept what has been said by Senator Murphy on the Maritime Institute Bill and the need to have it passed as speedily as possible.  I had hoped that we would have it this week, but hopefully we will finish it next week.  I will put it to the Whips to try to make arrangements for that for next week.</P>
    <P>The question of co-ordination between the European Parliament and the Houses of the Oireachtas was mentioned by Senator Staunton and Senator Honan.  It is a matter of concern that there is not a better liaison between the European Parliament and the Houses of the Oireachtas.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of Irish Life was raised by Senator Upton and by Senator Costello. We must remember that the matter of Irish Life was raised only this week and I would suggest that it will be at least 18 months before any conclusion is reached <Col N="633" /> on that matter.  I have no doubt, since it is a Government body, that the matter will have to be raised in the Houses of the Oireachtas before any decisions are finally arrived at.  I do not think it is a matter of urgency at this stage but I accept what the Senators said and I have no doubt that it will come before the House at some stage before the matter is concluded.</P>

      <P>In regard to Senator O'Toole, he said that they are a group.  I accept that they are a group and there is nothing further I can say on that.  Article 15.13 of the Constitution is not a matter for the Order of Business.  Senator O'Reilly asked for a debate on emigration.  The Senator is entitled to put down a motion on this and he can put it down as a matter of priority if Fine Gael decide to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give a report on our visit to Nicaragua.  I would like to compliment Senator Manning for proposing that this should be allowed and also the Leader of the House for allowing both my colleague, Senator McDonald, and myself to make statements.</P>
      <P>I was, indeed, honoured to be appointed a member of the Irish delegation to Nicaragua, which comprised Deputy Dick Roche, Deputy Bernard Allen and Deputy Michael Higgins.  In the first instance, I think I should give a brief background to the history and the lead-up to these elections.</P>
      <P>In February 1989, President Ortega offered to have the elections held in February 1990.  To say that that was a surprising decision is an understatement, because the economy was in a dreadful state.  Inflation in 1988 was running at a massive 30,000 per cent and the economic crisis was having an adverse effect on the FSLN, the ruling party, the Sandinista National Liberation Front.  President Ortega's offer was aimed at President George Bush, who had been newly installed in the White House, in the hope that, if it could be proven to the United States and to the world at large that free democratic elections could be held, then the way could be paved for a restoration of peaceful relations between the US and Nicaragua and to bring to an end the dreadful Contra war that had needlessly cost so many lives and maimed many others, as indeed is the case with all wars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The election campaign formally began on 4 December 1989.  I must say that the Government went to extraordinary lengths to ensure that the democratic credentials of the election would be above reproach.  The election was supervised by the Supreme Electoral Council, which was comprised of five magistrates &mdash; two Sandinista, two opposition and one independent. There was an army of some 3,000 observers from numerous international bodies, including the United Nations observers, who had been in Nicaragua since August; the Organisation of American States observers, <Col N="635" /> who had been there since April.  Former President Jimmy Carter had a team of observers there, as had Raul Alfonsin, the former Argentine President.  The European Parliament had a delegation and there were numerous other international parliamentary delegates, including, of course, our own.</P>
    <P>The two main parties were the FSLN, or the Sandinistas, headed by President Ortega, and the UNO Alliance of some 14 parties, ranging from the extreme right to the extreme left in the political divide, and had as presidential candidate Violetta Chamorro, who is editor of the paper, <i>La Prensa</i>, and whose husband had been allegedly murdered by the Samosa régime in 1978.</P>
    <P>The two main issues that dominated the campaign were the Contra war and the economic crisis.  The Contra war had claimed in the region of 30,000 lives and had injured as many more people.  That war, plus the US economic blockade, had a devastating effect on the economy, with many of the population not being able to afford the basic necessities of life.  Housing conditions in Nicaragua are absolutely appalling.  The people have just grown weary of their plight.  The political debate dominating the campaign was over who should take the blame for the crisis.  The Sandinistas, while admitting that they did make mistakes in managing the economy, blamed the crisis on the war, while the UNO Alliance put the whole blame on the Sandinistas.</P>
    <P>The voting age in Nicaragua is 16. Registration is mandatory, but voting is not.  Members of the armed forces did not vote at military barracks but at their local polling booth where they registered. Nicaraguans who were abroad at the time of registration, which incidentally took place on the first four Sundays in October, could register at Nicaraguan consulates abroad but had to return to vote.  The country was broken into nine regions for electoral purposes.  The Supreme Electoral Council elected nine three-person regional electoral councils who, in turn, elected three-member ballot receiving boards, or presiding <Col N="636" /> officers, for each polling place in their respective regions.  There were 4,394 polling places with an average of 450 to 500 voters at each polling place.</P>
    <P>In relation to the funding for the campaign the Supreme Electoral Council had allocated 700,000 US dollars in public financing for the political parties.  Half of this allocation went to the political parties in equal parts and the second half was divided among the parties according to the proportion of votes gained in the 1984 elections.  The law was also changed to permit foreign contributions to political parties and candidates, but 50 per cent of such contributions had to go to the Supreme Electoral Council's Fund for Democracy to cover the electoral expenses.  The regulation of that particular funding was one of the most difficult tasks that was undertaken by the Supreme Electoral Council.</P>
    <P>All political parties had access to television media at various times.  Parties could also purchase time on two channels from a minimum of three minutes to a maximum of ten.  Access to State radio was also available, and again the parties could purchase time on the private radio stations.</P>
    <P>On the days prior to the election we interviewed numerous people &mdash; from members of the Supreme Electoral Council, the United Nations representatives, Organisation of American States representatives, members of the Carter delegation and through to representatives of different political parties. While we did find normal accusations and counter-accusations associated with electioneering, all involved were quite satisfied by the manner in which the electoral process was being conducted.</P>
    <P>One serious allegation was made to us by the legal representative of the UNO Alliance, which was the leading opposition party.  He claimed that the number of their poll watchers &mdash; we call them personation agents &mdash; had been arrested and put in prison to prevent them from acting on election day.  When we offered to investigate the matter the representative told us that it would be a waste of time, that we would be told by the <Col N="637" /> authorities that those people were not being held and that there was no way to prove that they were.  However, we did follow up the matter subsequently ourselves and received the information that, of the list that was supplied in relation to the alleged people who were put in jail, only three of them had been detained and none of those three was in fact a poll watcher.</P>
    <P>Polling began at 7 a.m. on 25 February. We visited some 50 polling stations, both in and around Managua and outside, including the northern territory where the Contra war had been fought.  We found without exception that the voting procedures were carried out in the strictest and most stringent manner and there was absolutely no way that either impersonation or any other act of fraud could succeed.  I was quite amazed at the rigour with which the officials at each polling place carried out their duties.  Queues had formed at all polling stations hours before they were due to open.  The patience of the people and their determination to exercise the franchise was a revelation.  Some of them told us they had been queuing for seven to eight hours to vote.  Only one voter was dealt with at a time and the scrutiny to which each one subjected himself or herself had to be seen to be believed.</P>
    <P>One would have to acknowledge that the procedures were so stringent that there is no way that some of them would be agreed to or adopted in Western democracies.  One example of how stringent the regulations were is this: where there was any doubt about the identity of a voter then that person could not get a ballot paper prior to it being signed by a number of the poll watchers verifying his or her identity.  The voters identified themselves by presenting registration cards.  When they were accepted as being bona fide they each got a separate ballot paper for the elections taking place &mdash; one for the President and Vice-President, one for the National Assembly and one for the Municipal Council.  Each ballot had a stamped number on it corresponding to the number on the voting table at which they voted.  This number <Col N="638" /> was chosen by the officials at the table just before the polls opened on the morning on 25 February.</P>
    <P>Poll watchers from each of the political parties were entitled to be present to verify that no fraud was attempted either before, during or after the vote.  At one polling booth we visited the poll watchers were taking their job so seriously that they were signing all of the voting papers and this led to considerable and enormous delays.  When the polls closed at 6 o'clock the polling officials counted the votes in the presence of the poll watchers and the final tally was entered.  Poll watchers could then receive copies from each polling place.  All the tallies were eventually sent to the headquarters of the Supreme Electoral Council in Managua where they were processed through a most sophisticated computer network.</P>
    <P>The first results indicated that a surprise was possibly on the cards, but as the results continued to come in it became obvious that a major upset was going to take place.  In the end, the UNO Alliance received&mdash;these are the official results &mdash; 777,552 votes or 54.7 per cent of the vote; the FSLN received 579,886 or 40.8 per cent; MUR &mdash; Movement of Revolutionary Unity &mdash; 16,751 votes or 1.1 per cent; and the PSC &mdash; the Social Christian Party &mdash; 11,136 votes or 0.7 per cent.  There was also a provision in the Constitution whereby defeated presidential candidates who received a minimum specified vote could also be elected to the Assembly and under that regulation Daniel Ortega of the FSLN and Mosises Hassan of the Movement of Revolutionary Unity also became members of the Assembly.</P>
    <P>During our stay, we were treated at all times with the utmost courtesy and hospitality.  We were allowed access to every place to which we wished to travel and we were never hindered or questioned about our movements.  In short, we were treated extraordinarily well.</P>
    <P>Questions have been asked as to why the result was as it was.  My own view is that two factors had a very important bearing on the outcome.  The first I have alluded to already: the economic crisis &mdash;<Col N="639" /> poverty and lack of services.  The second reason, I think, was conscription.  The people just grew tired of the plight and, rightly or wrongly, saw the election as an opportunity to get some relief from the dreadful conditions.  In fact, an FSLN supporter, to whom we were talking subsequent to the elections, when asked why he thought that the result turned out as it did, said: &ldquo;The Sandinistas promised the Nicaraguan people bread, housing and dignity.  We gave them dignity and now they want the bread and houses&rdquo;.  I think that is an accurate estimation of how the people felt at that time.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that there will be no triumphalism on the part of the UNO Alliance.  There were no major victory parades or anything like that at the time we left there.  I have to say also that I was very taken by the gracious manner in which Daniel Ortega accepted the outcome in a speech he gave subsequently. I would also have to commend former President Carter, who accompanied President Ortega to the home of Violetta Chamorro when the results became known.  I think that if there was any type of triumphalism on anybody's part it would be a recipe for disaster under the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Nicaraguan people are left in peace to sort out their own affairs, that whatever outside aid, in the form of finance or advice, which they so urgently need will be given without any conditions and that the whole purpose of any assistance, financial or otherwise would be to let those people get on with their own lives and to try to pick up the pieces without interference from any side whatsoever.  That is absolutely crucial. The elections in Nicaragua will have a very important bearing on all activity in Central America, so it is extremely important that the people who have exercised the franchise and brought about the result would be left to sort out their own affairs.</P>
    <P>It is important also to mention that when we were interviewing Carlos Munez, who was the President of the Assembly, he made an important point <Col N="640" />&mdash; and this was prior to the voting day &mdash; putting the election in context, saying &ldquo;It is great to have so many international observers here with us at this particular time, but I would appeal to you not to forget us when the elections are over. There are people here from throughout the world, but we need you people to look to Nicaragua when this is over and to keep an eye on what happens afterwards. It is one thing to come here and spend a week or a fortnight seeing what is going on, but what we would ask you to do is this.  When you go back to your own countries and governments encourage those people to take an active part in affairs in terms of what support and assistance can be given to the people of Nicaragua and stress that this is extremely important.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nobody was left in any doubt as to the enormity of the problem they had in relation to trying to rebuild the economy of Nicaragua.  All I would hope is that they are left to get on with the job.  The job of rebuilding the economy is an extremely important one.  I could just say, in passing, that I became a millionaire in Nicaragua because I changed $20 and in exchange for the $20 I got 1,200,000 cordovas.  That in itself is an example of the extremely difficult economic situation those people found themselves in.  I must say that the capacity of the people to endure enormous difficulties, enormous poverty and dreadful conditions was absolutely amazing.  I think it would put things into perspective. All I would wish is that everybody who complains about little things could see for himself or herself at first hand the tremendous difficulties under which those people exist.</P>
    <P>Briefly, that is a very broad summation of what went on.  There were so many different aspects to the campaign that one could go on indefinitely talking about it.  But I hope that I have given a broad outline of how things were in Nicaragua. The coming years will be extremely important for those people.  The eyes of the world will be on them.  They deserve their place in the sun.  I hope that over the coming years they will be able to sort <Col N="641" /> out their own affairs.  I would love to go back there in five years' time and see what sort of changes have taken place.  I sincerely hope they will be all for the better of the people of Nicaragua.</P>

      <P>I would just like to place on record my appreciation of the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition in arranging this kind of debate to give a follow-through to the decision of the Inter-Parliamentary Association to accept the invitation to send observers to Nicaragua.  I think it is very appropriate.  On the Order of Business there were a few points raised about a foreign affairs committee but I do not think we have really cottoned on to the situation where we, as a nation, have such a strong voice in international politics at the present time and especially through the period of the Presidency.  One notices the fact, when one meets colleagues or politicians from other countries, that they are very conscious of the input we have the possibility of making.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to cover the same ground as Senator McKenna.  I very much agree with the points he made.  I will try not to go over the areas he covered.  Before Christmas, I declined to let my name go forward for consideration for inclusion as part of the Irish delegation, although at the executive meeting of the IPA I did propose that the Oireachtas should be properly represented.  That proposal was very kindly seconded by the Cathaoirleach, Senator Doherty, and carried. When the composition of the Irish delegation had been settled, just last month, I did accept an invitation from the International Union of Christian Democrat Parties to join their international team of senior politicians to observe the elections in Nicaragua.  The reason I received that invitation was that I was part of a similar team which observed the first free elections after dictatorship in both Spain and Portugal in the seventies.  Both were very sharply fought contests and there was a little more than skin and hair flying.  With that experience, I was not altogether an enthusiastic volunteer to take on the role in Nicaragua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> We spent some 12 days there.  The delegation consisted of members of Parliament from practically all of the European countries &mdash; from the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain and Italy &mdash; and also from the Dominican Republic and from Venezuela.  We had the opportunity of speaking with &mdash; I think it was 30 &mdash; people representing that many organisations. We visited nearly all of the electoral headquarters, not just of the UNO and the FSLN but of the constituent party organisations &mdash; the 14 parties that comprise the UNO &mdash; and then there were eight other parties apart from the UNO and the FSLN that contested the election separately.  We had the opportunity of having discussions with those, mainly with their presidents, and after the elections we were given the opportunity of a review of the elections and to listen to their hopes and aspirations for the future.</P>
    <P>Among the people we had the opportunity of holding discussions with and being briefed by were the Commandante Bayardo Arce who is about third in command of the FSLN.  We met him at the election headquarters.  We met the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fr. Miguel D'Escoto and the Secretary General of the Foreign Affairs Department, Senor Alejandro Bendana.  We had discussions with Dr. Mario Fillos, President of the Supreme Electoral Council, with Mr. Elliot Richardson, the personal representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations, with Dr. Jennifer McCoy, the director of the Carter Centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>We met the President-elect of the Republic both before and after the elections.  I hope to deal very briefly with our hopes and aspirations. During the lead up to the campaign we received a number of complaints.  The main ones were from the various components of the UNO parties who complained that materials donated from abroad for the elections, such as posters, photocopiers and telex machines, were held up at customs until the week before the election, practically the end of the campaign.  We also received complaints <Col N="644" /> on election day where the presiding officers refused voters voting papers because the identity cards were not acceptable.  There were obviously two types of identity cards and they would accept only one.  The Opposition parties felt this was a planned strategy by the Government.  We met it in one state in the region of Greneda.</P>
      <P>Another series of complaints which were fairly widespread were that the police in the week leading up to the election were arresting people and taking their identity cards which, in effect, were their voting cards and destroying them during the course of interrogation or not giving them back.  It was very difficult to follow through on those complaints. Nevertheless, we did pass them on.</P>
      <P>In the entire system the Government of Nicaragua invited three observers, the United Nations observer mission to verify the electoral process in Nicaragua, the Organisation of American States and the Carter Organisation which was funded by a foundation organised by former United States President, Jimmy Carter.  We recall that President Carter was in office for the first of the problems between Nicaragua and the United States.  The contribution that the Carter Organisation especially made to the election process is very significant.  From speaking to ordinary members of the public there, they felt very secure and very safe in the knowledge that there were so many observers.  There were over 3,000 observers altogether many of them from voluntary organisations.  There were American Veterans for Peace who were numberically very strong.  There was the International Commission for Justice and Peace of which there is a very strong sister organisation here in the Republic, who do marvellous work on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator McKenna so rightly said, the organisation of the election on election day was exceptional.  I wish we could borrow a few of their procedures.  They had, for instance, no propaganda, no posters, no T-shirts, no party ads, in effect, no hassle.  People just queued up <Col N="645" /> to vote and each voter took almost four minutes.</P>
    <P>During the discussions with the Foreign Minister and the Ministry for Economic Affairs many things came to light. The economy there is particularly bad at this time.  Inflation two years ago was 3,300 per cent but after the imposition of the IMF programme it reduced last year to 1,700 per cent and in January this year it was 138 per cent.  At least it is moving in the right direction.  The big problem facing President Chamorro at present is, will the Sandinista-owned army, the Sandinista police and the Sandinista public service be able to work for their country and for the new government?  It is very important that this House make a very clear call to our Foreign Minister to ensure the European Community would make a financial contribution to grant aid the development of Nicaragua. It is a country with considerable natural resources by way of land and there is the possibility of an irrigation programme with two large freshwater lakes there. Peace in Nicaragua is a start towards peace and contentment in the whole Central American hemisphere.</P>
    <P>Inflation is a big problem and since no one doubts that the people of Nicaragua were given a chance freely to express their will, there are no grounds to doubt that the victory of President Chamorro and the people elected to the national assembly are not 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the last election, the opposition gained 20 of the 99 seats but this time the situation is significantly different.  President Chamorro's victory is far from complete and her Sandinista opponents are still very much in power.  Many of her own supporters are divided by virtue of the multiplicity of parties in the UNO. The country's economy is in a mess and inflation is exceptionally high.  This country will need generous help, not only from the US.  I was glad to see yesterday that President Bush promised $500 million. The USSR have indicated that they are prepared to continue to give financial aid, if requested.  The Organisation of American States hopefully, will make a <Col N="646" /> contribution for the development of the country also.</P>
    <P>In our discussions with the secretary general of the two trade unions there the very cool approach and the very factual appreciation of their situation that these people have came through to us.  I have great hopes that this election will mean an awakening of democracy in Nicaragua, and will bring about a complete change from the difficult situation that the people have lived in for some years back.  I hope the international community will rally towards them to get them off the ground, to give the population a chance to look forward to a smooth and non-violent transition of power on 25 April next.  Although the <i>interregnum</i> is a little bit long, hopefully the three official observer organisations will be able to stay in place until after that date, which would probably give the people more confidence that peace would be maintained.  The election result must be regarded as a triumph for the Nicaraguan people.  The result of the election was the exact opposite of the widespread predictions on posters and by commentators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I raise a point with the Minister on section 9?  Section 9 imposes a duty on every owner and occupier of land, including a statutory body and a State authority, to take all reasonable steps to ensure that land does not become or does not continue to be a derelict site.  I want, in relation to that section, to ask the Minister if this power, as I am sure it does, but I simply want confirmation of it, applies to land that has once being mined.  I say this with regard to certain mines which are no longer in production and have not been for a number of years.  I refer in particular to one in east Galway.  While I want to say to the Minister that I have no objection, as other people may well have, to the mining of certain minerals, if it is to the benefit of the country and of the community, nonetheless I strongly object to a situation where the wealth of a particular area can be extracted and those who extract it leave that property in a derelict situation.  That is very true of certain properties in east Galway at present.  It may well be true in the future of certain properties in Senator McKenna's constituency.  So I am simply raising the point with the Minister to confirm that the power will be in this legislation to compel the owners or may I say, those who mined the minerals from areas to restore the land and the countryside to an acceptable appearance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the amendment that I wished to make the comments on. It arises out of the discussion we had this afternoon on the Order of Business when we raised the question of property developers making application for a particular set of houses on Arran Quay, planning permission having been lodged, not waiting for a response from the authority, going along with unauthorised demolition on a number of houses on Arran Quay.  This has taken place in the face of us here in this Chamber, debating the <Col N="652" /> Derelict Sites Bill to prevent dereliction and you have property developers showing scant respect for property retention of fine Georgian houses.  There is unauthorised demolition taking place. Could the Minister reassure us that that situation would be covered in relation to restoration?  The amendment specifies that measures would be put in place that would require the proper restoration of any structure, building or dwelling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may just clarify, what I was seeking to do is to give an example of a situation whereby dereliction can take place and unless there are measures to ensure that retrospectively that dereliction will be set right, we have a situation where we are passing laws but are being pre-empted by people who are taking the law, so to speak, into their own hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Costello, I appreciate his position but that question will be decided in another area.  As section 11 stands, a local authority may require any measures to be carried out to prevent property from becoming or continuing to be derelict. The underlying principle is that a property owner has a duty to ensure that his property does not, by its derelict condition, seriously detract from the amenity of neighbouring properties.  It is right that <Col N="653" /> this obligation should exist and that local authorities and the Minister should be able to require the measures necessary to uphold it.  The amendment, however, appears to introduce a more onerous requirement.  It would permit local authorities not just to protect the public against the harm of dereliction but also to require landowners to engage in proper restoration of their buildings.  If proper restoration simply means restoring a structure to a non-derelict condition then the power to do this is already contained in section 11 as it stands.  If, however, as seems more likely, proper restoration is intended to cover more ambitious works then this would mean imposing a positive duty of architectural or historical restoration on private landowners in excess of what would be necessary to render a site non-derelict.  How could this extra duty on certain landowners be justified when we do not impose an equal duty on all landowners and when there is no regard to the financial capacity of the landowners to carry out these extra works?</P>
      <P>We can all understand and sympathise with the intention of this amendment. Proper restoration of buildings of character is a very desirable objective but, realistically, it is not an objective for which we can reasonably legislate in this Bill under pain of criminal sanction.  If dereliction is caused by pollution it is right that the polluter should have to pay for the cost of remedying the effects of the pollution.  The polluter pays a principal. That is not, however, generally taken to justify the imposition of obligations on polluters once pollution is prevented, to promote positive schemes of environmental improvement at their own cost.  That is the situation.  While I sympathise with the Senator, what we have done here is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reasonably satisfied with the Minister's response.  For the first time since we began discussing this Bill I feel I am interpreting the Minister, particularly in the light of his reply, by <Col N="654" /> saying that there are particular circumstances &mdash; we mentioned the financial capacity of the owners and so on &mdash; that can, as it were, come into play as to whether a derelict building or house can continue in that state.  If it is a question of introducing a human face into certain aspects of it, maybe there is not a lot I could quibble with in relation to it, but I know how easily it would lie in relation to certain structures that have been mentioned here in the last week.  In relation to what Senator Naughten attempted to achieve here I feel the Minister has met the situation in a reasonable way.  Therefore, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection 1 (a) deals with the power of the local authority and requires them to take measures in relation to derelict sites if in the opinion of a local authority, it is necessary to do so in order to prevent lands situated in their functional area becoming or continuing to be a derelict site.  In the discussion last week &mdash; I want to emphasise it again at this point today &mdash; I tried to draw a distinction between buildings, structures, houses and so on, certainly in an urban setting as against rural agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am raising the same query with the Minister that I raised on a number of occasions on the last day here.  In relation to preventing land situated in their functional area&mdash;I can only take it that we are talking about county councils throughout the country &mdash; how do you assess rural agricultural land that is likely to become derelict?  It is either derelict or it is not derelict.  The Minister is up against a problem.  I am talking about agricultural land in rural Ireland.  It is a matter of opinion as to whether it is derelict or not. The Minister is really stretching judgment and opinion a very great distance for somebody to decide that this particular field may become derelict and <Col N="655" /> the power is there to prevent that.  I want verification on that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Following our debate on this last week, I undertook to consider a number of points raised about the application of the Bill in relation to rural situations.  The important test as to whether land or a building is or is not a derelict sites is whether it detracts materially from the amenity, character or appearance of neighbouring land or the buildings on it.  What might be derelict in an urban situation would not necessarily be derelict in a rural situation and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
      <P>I am confident that the definition of derelict site set out in section 3 is flexible enough to allow for this necessary discrimination between different kinds of location.  I have looked into this carefully over the last few days.  I consider now that it does not require this special amendment to deal with agricultural land or even other rural situations.  I have looked into this, being from a very rural ara in the midlands, and I am satisfied that everything will be looked after in a commonsense way in all of this.  I do not think the Senator has anything to worry about because I would be as concerned as any Member is here, especially coming from a rural area or even in an urban area as well.  The section that I referred to, section 3, caters adequately for all of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for having further considered the matter.  He has attempted to deal with the points that I raised.  Perhaps we have reached the point where it is obvious that the Minister will stay with his interpretation of it which indeed, is his right.  It does not convince me that the fears I expressed have been fully met.  I have always felt, in relation to legislation coming before us that one of the strengths of this House is to examine it and to try to visualise the difficulties that may or may not arise.  In view of the Minister's statement, there is little point in labouring the issue.  As we go through further sections I will have certain views <Col N="656" /> to express on them.  Therefore, at this stage I would like to say &mdash; I am responding to the Minister's observations &mdash; I believe the Bill is badly drafted, that it is deficient and I am quite confident that certain sections of it will be found in the courts to be in conflict with the Constitution. I am prepared to leave it at that.</P>
      <P>In relation to the query I raised, I want to segregate the two points.  Land that is derelict is an obvious condition but we are dealing in section 11 with measures to prevent it from becoming derelict. Therefore one is at a stage before land becomes derelict.  Who defines the fact that there is a possibility some time in the immediate future, in the mid-term or in the long-term that a particular field is likely to become derelict and therefore that necessary preventative steps must be taken?</P>
      <P>I accept that there can be a derelict stage but this section is dealing with that point in time before a field becomes derelict. The Minister is talking here about preventing the situation from arising.  The assumption has to be that nothing is derelict at this point in time.  Who makes the judgment that certain machinery must be put into effect to prevent a situation from arising?</P>

      <P>The manager or the designated official, as the case may be.  I have great faith in our local authorities and that they will use common sense and understanding.  Local representatives in rural areas are very conscious of this and landowners, when this Bill becomes law, will be anxious, for value purposes to keep their agricultural land, development land, or whatever the case may be in good condition.  They will be vigilant with regard to looking after this land.  I have great faith in them.  Senator Howard is under-estimating landowners.  They will use their understanding and judgment and members of local authorities will see <Col N="657" /> that that is done.  I ask that it be left in their capable hands and, I expect, as has always been the case with local authorities that I know of, common sense and understanding will prevail in all of this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) direct the local authority to take such steps as may be necessary so as to ensure that a development objective or objectives for the purpose of reserving land for roads or parking places or for any of the purposes of reserving or preserving land indicated in Part IV of the Third Schedule of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, does not result in any land subject to any such development objective becoming or continuing to be a derelict site,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> The amendment is self-explanatory.  Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on it.  He may well satisfy the intention that is behind the moving of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's concern that the objectives of the development plan, reserving or preserving land, should not give rise to dereliction. However, I would not be too happy that this Bill should be used to provide formal inputs into a planning system.  This is more appropriate to planning legislation and, moreover, is expressly provided for in that legislation.</P>
      <P>Under section 7 of the Planning Act, 1982, the Minister for the Environment is empowered to issue general directives as to policy in relation to planning and development to which planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála must have regard.  The Minister is also empowered by section 23 (3) of the Planning Act, 1963, to require a planning authority to vary their development plan in such manner as he may specify.  The powers which the Senator proposes to confer on the Minister by this amendment are adequately catered for in planning legislation. Accordingly, the amendment is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point the Minister is making.  Of course, one has only to drive around the country &mdash; the Minister is as much aware of this as I am &mdash; to see land owned by local authorities left in a most neglected and objectionable state.  That is what we are anxious to prevent.  When we arrive at this point we will have a situation where the local authorities will be judge and jury or, perhaps, executioner in relation to property owned by private citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to the property that is in local authority ownership.  If we go on their performance regarding land reserved for road widening, or for the purpose of housing or small industrial development, that land includes the dumping of rubble and other materials, is overgrown with weeds and generally is in a derelict state.  Is the Minister satisfied <Col N="659" /> that local authorities will now act as he suggested they will act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might just expand on that.  Under section 13 the Minister is empowered to take some action against a local authority where obvious dereliction is taking place within their jurisdiction. What the Senator fears is covered under section 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the response of the Senator.  I accept his intention to be very constructive in relation to the debate.  Basically, the point I was asking the Minister is, that going on the record of local authorities in relation to land already in their possession what is his expectation of their response without compulsion from him &mdash; I know compulsion is provided for later on &mdash; at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises just as section 13 is also relevant to it.  We are talking about where the Minister has power to give direction to a local authority to take such steps as may be specified by him to prevent any land occupied by them from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site.  That is notwithstanding what has <Col N="660" /> been said in section 2 where there are exclusive powers given to the local authority. It is one thing to state that the Minister can intervene in relation to the operation of the local authority and then in another section say there are sections specifically excluding any intervention. Section 2 states that the local authority can accumulate sites for particular purposes which may lead to dereliction. Then we have section 12 stating that the Minister may direct the local authorities, so there is a conflict there.  Which section supersedes the other?  Has the Minister got authority to override the local authority if he feels that in relation to section 2 there is an assembly of sites for whatever good purpose, road widening, parking or whatever compulsory purpose, that leads to dereliction?  Is the Minister saying in this section that he has the authority to override a previous section if that leads to dereliction, in his view?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on section 12 but in response to Senator O'Keeffe's suggestion and supported by the Minister I withdrew my amendment, I accepted the suggestion made to me in good faith that the fears I was expressing in section 12 were taken care of and would be disposed of under section 13.  That is my <Col N="661" /> understanding of section 13 which I am simply referring to in relation to what I undertook to do.  I am not saying that anything was done deliberately but my understanding of it was that the fears I had expressed would be taken care of when that section came up.  That is not the case.  We are not dealing with section 13 now.  That section deals exclusively with the disposal of sites by statutory bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply making the point to lead back to section 12 which we are on now.  I am drawing the Minister's attention to the history of local authorities in relation to the upkeep of land in their possession.  I was asking him to comment on the powers he has under section 12 to ensure that the land in the possession of local authorities would not become or would not remain in a derelict condition.  I was more or less accused of being frivilous in relation to raising this matter and told my fears would be dealt with under section 13.  They are not. Before we dispose of section 12 I want to be satisfied in relation to the points I have raised about the derelict condition or otherwise of sites and land now in the possession of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can direct the local authority to put their house in order.  In regard to land, that comes under section 13 but it is linked to section 12.  We can make them do that.  There will be an awareness now of all this.  I am realistic enough to know about local authorities and what the situation is.  The Minister can compel them and he can also direct that the local authorities sell off that land if they do not get it into order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going very far now in this Bill. We are putting a Bill into law now and we are giving a lot of power to the local authorities.  I will not get into a legal mine field.  I have put a number of Bills through both Houses in my time.  I do not know <Col N="662" /> what is constitutional and what is not but the best legal advice that we have &mdash; I must accept it &mdash; is the advice of the Attorney General.  Successive Governments who have put legislation through the Dáil and the Seanad have found through a Supreme Court judgment that parts or a section of a Bill were found to be unconstitutional.  I am satisfied with this and I want to make that very clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest to Senator Howard and anyone else who wishes to contribute that the argument that has been made is now being repeated and it is obvious the Minister has made his response and will not vary that response.  Unless Senator Howard has a further point to raise separate to what he has already made I would like to put the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read section 12 dealing with the power of the Minister to direct local authorities I do not see what teeth will be in that power.  That is the point I wish to raise.

      <P>I will conclude on this point.  I want to assure the Minister that I have no wish to be unreasonable in relation to this but I am simply discharging my duty as a legislator here to be satisfied as to the effectiveness of any <Col N="663" /> particular piece of legislation.  I intend to discharge that no matter how long it takes or how difficult the going may be.  Like the Minister I am a reasonable person and reason can prevail.  A lot can succeed in situations like this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I do not wish to antagonise the Minister at all who is very direct and extremely clear, I share some of the concerns of Senator Howard to this section, its absence, as he calls it, of teeth.  I am not a member of a local authority so I am not a bit worried or intimidated by threats to abolish local authorities, I have to say to the Minister that the situation is a good deal more complex than an entirely black and white one.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be placed in the invidious situation of appearing to condemn local authorities.  I know they do a lot of very good work.  However, that there are circumstances where there is a genuine conflict of interest, I regret, for example, as a matter of general principle, that local authorities are exempted from the operation of their own development plan.  They do not have to go for planning permission for their own developments and so on.  There are a lot of exemptions. I may, perhaps, have technically got some of them wrong in the way I am expressing it but the Minister I am quite sure will know what I mean.</P>
      <P>I speak principally from the experience of urban areas, the kind of thing that people like myself are concerned about. The Minister has assured Senator Howard that in certain circumstances he could and would be prepared to abolish councils, which seems quite extreme. That might be a good idea &mdash; I do not know &mdash; but it certainly would be interesting and exciting and make for good lively local politics.  In an urban area, for example, the kind of thing that can happen makes me regret that Senator Howard has withdrawn amendment No. 11.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that what people are concerned about is a situation which is frequent in local authorities and the Minister may very likely be aware of it where road development comes into play and strategic houses along the line of road development are acquired by the local authority by compulsory purchase order.  They are then allowed to go derelict and this reduces the value of the adjacent properties so, in fact, it allows local authorities to buy in property at a very reduced rent and that militates against the interests of local house owners.  For that reason I would like an assurance that there are indeed teeth in the provisions and I regret that the amendment has been withdrawn.  Perhaps the Minister can give some assurance on this matter.</P>

      <P>What had we up to now? Basically there was nothing we could do until dereliction was upon us.  Under section 12 what is happening basically is that the local authority can be asked by the Minister to put their house in order.  In section 13 if the local authority is not prepared to do that the Minister has the power to suggest to that local authority: &ldquo;You are making no use of this land so therefore I direct you to sell it off.&rdquo;  I cannot see what the major problem is here.  There are more teeth in this Bill than we ever had previously and, therefore, I cannot see any reason why we cannot agree to section 12.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1), lines 1 to 6, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>This deals with the question of compensation and with a further question of interest on any compensation that is payable under subsection (1).  What we are seeking to do is to ensure that no interest is payable on compensation.  The reasons for that are fairly valid and straightforward already in section 19 (1) (a) compensation is available to an amount equal to the value of the estate. Why then should there be interest payable on compensation that has already been given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the person may apply to the local authority not later than 12 months.  A period of 12 months may elapse and then it is quite possible that the person or the body in question may appeal any compensation that is being offered and may go through a system of conciliation or arbitration.  This may take another period of time, which could be two to three <Col N="666" /> years, and while the site may remain derelict they will not only get compensation for some dereliction they have brought about but they will receive interest, even though they have been negligent in the first place.  It seems to me contradictory that they should be doubly compensated first by getting compensation to the value of the property and, secondly, interest on any intervening period before they actually received it.</P>
    <P>I gather there is no such provision in the 1961 Act for interest to be given on compensation so it does seem to me to make a mockery of the intentions of the Bill that we should not only give compensation but that we should give that extra bonus of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can accept the amendment.  The Derelict Sites Act, 1961 contains no provision on the lines of paragraph (b) and on that basis it is arguable that paragraph (b) is not essential.  The CPO procedures of this Bill are very simple and they do not involve a notice to treat.  Any automatic provision for the commencement of interest is therefore somewhat problematic in the context of this Bill.  This matter will be better resolved by agreement between the parties or in the context of arbitration itself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with workers and compensation.  I notice that under sections 4 and 5 certain sections of the Land Clauses (Consolidation) Act, 1845, are being amended and are being referred to.  The Minister spoke earlier <Col N="667" /> of having had the best legal advice available to him, but there are very important land Acts from the end of the last century and the earlier part of this century and it has not been necessary to amend sections of them to accommodate the sweeping powers that would appear to be conferred on the Minister, and indeed on local authorities, under this legislation.</P>
      <P>I am dealing with rural farmland and, as I said, there have been very important land Acts dealing with the ownership of land throughout the country at the end of the last century and the beginning of this one and they seem to be totally ignored.  Why has it not been necessary or what advice is available to the Minister that indicates it was not necessary to deal with the matter of land ownership at the time of the enactment of these Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for another arena.  Subsections (4) and (5) apply to certain standard provisions of CPO law relating to payment of compensation to persons not fit to manage their financial affairs or to owners who cannot be traced.  Sections 69 to 79 of the Land Clauses Act provide a mechanism for dealing in the context of a CPO with these circumstances.  Essentially, they involve the lodgment of the compensation sum for administration by the courts.  In all of the codes involving CPO, for example, the Housing Act, 1966, the Planning Act, 1963 and the Canals Act, 1986, these Land Act provisions are expressly applied to compensation payments.  They were omitted from the compensation by the provisions of the 1940 and 1961 Derelict Sites Acts.  However, it is considered opportune to state them explicitly in the Bill.  This means, for instance, that where a person is not capable of transacting his or her own affairs, it will then be decided by the court.  In the case where a landowner cannot be traced, that, through the courts, is paid into a fund and held there until such time as the normal arrangements are made.  This complies with all the Acts on our Statute Book.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now proceeded down through all the measures which involve compulsory acquisition and so on.  Section 20 deals with the use of derelict sites as acquired under this Act or indeed, other enactments.  In relation to subsection (2) &mdash; again I am going back to a rural context &mdash; I now visualise that we have arrived at the stage where local authorities have become owners of substantial areas of farmland.  In fact, they are the new landlord class because land on the hillsides, particularly in the west, has been seen to be derelict or in danger of becoming derelict.  As a result of that, and as a result of the opinion of new people who have come to reside in the area, and the acquisitiveness of certain officials at local authority level, now we have a local authority with a substantial territory of farmland.  They are almost farmers at this stage.  The disposal of this land arises.  The Minister is giving them authority to sell it, to let it, to transfer it or to exchange the whole or part, as the case may be, of that derelict site.  That is the problem I see arising.  That is the problem that I want to confront.  Perhaps the Minister believes there is no problem there.  Maybe he does not share my views on it but nonetheless I wanted to raise the point on section 20.</P>

      <Col N="669" /> In County Westmeath, where I am chairman of the local authority, we have undertaken the biggest single individual programme ever undertaken by the county council, the Athlone by-pass, at a cost of £37 million.  We had to purchase an enormous number of small holdings over the last number of years and we had to negotiate because we were the people on the ground and we knew the local people, we knew the best possible price at which we could purchase the land on behalf of the Department.  That is the real importance of local authorities and the real part that they can play in buying small parcels of land.  I would be totally opposed, of course, to their becoming enormous landowners and buying up land for speculation.  As chairman of a local authority I can say that we do not do that. It is vital that we purchase land.  We have the Mullingar by-pass and the Kinnegad by-pass to do.  It is important that we acquire land at the right time.  When the market was easy over the last two or three years we were able to buy land competitively.  We have effected a tremendous saving for the Government and for the country as a whole while improving the whole road structure of the Midlands.  I would ask the Minister to clarify this.  It is of strategic importance and the local authority are playing a fantastic part in that at present.</P>

      <P>May I short-circuit this because I know the Minister of State is anxious to get in?  Senator Cassidy has totally misunderstood my contribution. At no stage did I oppose the wish of the local authority to acquire land for road widening, for industrial development, for housing or for any other purpose allied to that.  The point I was making was far removed from that.  Indeed, I join with Senator Cassidy in applauding the local authorities for the magnificent work they have done, not alone in his area but in many others throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Before anyone became involved at all in industrial promotion, the IDA or private enterprise, the local authority were building small industrial <Col N="670" /> units.  Senator Howard suggested that they were buying land and holding it in order to sell it off at vast profits.  I would say what they did was strategic planning. They bought land and they made good use of that by promoting small industries within their own jurisdictions.</P>

      <P>I admire Senator O'Keeffe's southern capacity for putting his own interpretation on it.  I was simply making the point &mdash; I am sure it will be wearing on the Minister if I continue to make it &mdash; that at this stage with the various sections that have been agreed to and on the assumption that the Bill goes through, we will have conferred on the local authority the power to acquire derelict land.  I was speaking about derelict agricultural land.  I was speaking about what would be described as derelict farms and, indeed, more so than that, the power to acquire farms that in the opinion of somebody were likely to become derelict. I am speaking about lands on hillsides and the valleys throughout the country that are not required for road widening, not required for housing, not required for industrial development and so on. Therefore I was concerned at the methods which are open under section 20 to the local authorities to dispose of these particular lands.  I was simply asking for the Minister's observations on it.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are responsible people and the members on local authorities, irrespective of who they may be, appreciate their position.  Under this section which largely reinstates section 13 of the 1961 Act, a local authority may use any land acquired by them under this Act or under previous derelict sites legislation for any purpose connected with their functions.  In the context of possible redevelopment of the land, a local authority would be required to respect section 39 of the 1963 Planning Act which prohibits them from affecting any development which would contravene materially their development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of this provision is to be non-restrictive.  The legislature can <Col N="671" /> anticipate all of the circumstances relevant to particular sites which may be acquired by local authorities under this Bill.  It is appropriate that it should, therefore, give full discretion to local authorities with regard to the best use of these sites.</P>
    <P>We are all striving to have a good and appropriate Bill.  A local authority does not go through a CPO procedure very lightly.  They must show good reason for doing so.  Perhaps I am pro-local authority membership; if I am, then I must be forgiven.</P>

We cannot have it both ways.  We have to be positive and understanding. This debate is now covering all aspects in great detail.  I am answering the Senators' questions and problems to the best of my ability.  I fully believe we are doing the right thing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 4, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I trust the Minister will accept this amendment and that we can continue in the same vein of goodwill.  What we are seeking to do here is to discourage dereliction. The market value of the land would be assessed every three years rather than every five years.</P>
      <P>It is a simple amendment.  The appropriateness of this can be seen if we look at the market value of urban land five years ago and at present and if we contemplate what the market value will be in 1995 when there will be a European market as distinct from simply a national market.  We have to take the future into consideration.</P>
      <P>If we look at the record of the past we can see where there has been huge dips in property value and huge depressions and also times where property values have been shooting through the roof. That is purely in the national category. When we talk about the European category we are talking about a totally different matter entirely.  I am not satisfied it is sufficient to say that a register must be updated once every five years because, in practice, local authorities or agencies or bodies responsible for matters of this nature take that as the norm, even though it does not specify the norm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should take that amendment on board and that it would have the benefit of helping to <Col N="673" /> discourage dereliction once the people who might be involved realise that they would have to pay the full market value of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should not adopt this amendment. The county development plan is a five year plan.  What Senator Costello is exhorting the Minister to do is to bring in an administrative structure after three years which would be very expensive and very difficult for hard-pressed staff in local authorities to do.  What can be done under the Bill if the local authority members decide they can bring in a review after the three years.  I am suggesting to Senator Costello that what he actually wants he can do within the power of a local authority with the agreement of the members of that local authority.</P>
      <P>I respectfully suggest that in view of the fact that our development plan is a five year plan he should accept the section as it appears and I urge him to withdraw the amendment on the basis of the information I have furnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator O'Keeffe because we in local authorities know that county development plans by their very nature are very sensitive issues and take a long time to tease out.  The local authority I am associated with takes up to one and a half years to update our local authority plan because we take so many sections at every monthly meeting.</P>
      <P>In relation to valuations and land valuations, anyone in the property market will tell you that you have an increase in the market for about three years and you have a downward trend in the market for another future three years.  I think that the five year cycle gives a much more level overall indication and overall picture of what is really happening on the ground.  As Senator O'Keeffe has stated, we in the local authorities, if the members wish to, can review the matter after three years or within the three year period if it is required, and that would probably be the best suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with Senator O'Keeffe in <Col N="674" /> asking Senator Costello to consider withdrawing this amendment, because the one great thing we have at local authority level is that we have total freedom to discuss all matters pertaining to things like this.  That is the one great open forum we have.  However, there is a time constraint. If you have discussions at local authority meetings, perhaps taking six or seven hours, and they have to be adjourned, as in the case of bigger cities, not once but four, five and six times, then the putting together of a county development plan can represent a two year working programme for a local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself supportive of Senator Costello's argument &mdash; perhaps not for exactly the same reasons &mdash; but nonetheless I think there is quite an amount of merit in looking seriously at his amendment which would substitute three years for five years, because I believe the Minister is entering a minefield in this whole question of attempting to put a market value on urban land. There is only one market value; and it is expressed rather colourfully here in regard to the price it would &ldquo;fetch&rdquo;.  I do not think I have come across the word &ldquo;fetch&rdquo; in this context before, but I understand it and that is good enough. There is going to be a minefield here in regard to this whole question.  I find subsection (2) particularly loose, because it refers to the local authority authorising a person &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; to inspect urban land.  I would certainly like to know what sort of a genius we are talking about here.  Are we talking about a professional valuer or an official of the council or corporation? Senator O'Keeffe is trying to help me but he has not an opportunity of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this whole question of attempting to value urban land is a minefield.  If you spread it over five years, fair enough. You can take a particular piece of property, put a value on it now in 1990 and the local authority would not be required under the Minister's proposal to look at that valuation again until 1995.  We all know the fluctuations that can take place <Col N="675" /> there and what might happen in 1993 to attempt to enforce this value.  You have the various steps open to the person who owns that piece of property.  He can appeal to a tribunal and he may finish up going to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I think the whole system is going to get knotted up in trying to determine this.  A lot of it is going to be determined in the High Court anyway.  At least the three years would shorten the gap, having the requirement, as it were, to revalue it within three years.  Attempting to enforce in 1995 the value put on it in 1990 is only going to cause confusion of all kinds.  I support Senator Costello on these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly Senators O'Keeffe and Cassidy have been helpful in putting this section in its context in relation to local authorities, stating that it coincides with the cycle of the county development plans and that, therefore, it would fit in very suitably in that area and that it does tie up into the local authorities.  However, my concern in the matter is that we have to look at the Bill in its separate operation and what it seeks to do; and what it seeks to do is to deal with the problem of dereliction.  The fact that it is located within the context of the local authority is another matter, but we must introduced in the Bill sufficiently rigid proposals to ensure that we are dealing with the problem of dereliction.</P>
      <P>What I have pointed out is the enormous fluctuations in market values that have taken place in the past five years.  I could at this stage, without being a crystal ball gazer, project that there will be even far greater fluctuations in the next five years.  Senator Cassidy has presented the situation which may have existed from time to time, namely, that there is a three year increase and then a two year decrease, that there are certain cycles where there are valleys and peaks in the market.  I think you will find that for the next two years there will be a different situation developing, where we will have a continuing increase followed by a dramatic increase in the following three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> As I said, we are now entering into a whole new market area &mdash; pretty much an international market area &mdash; where the price of Irish land may very well be the price of European land.  We are an open market from 1992, beginning in 1993 onwards.  That is a whole new situation. If we take it that there is an average increase of 10 per cent per annum in the market value at the present time &mdash; of course, it is much greater; away in excess of the rate of inflation; property prices are going through the roof &mdash; and if we take that on a five year basis, that is 50 per cent before it is even reassessed.  That is not a sufficient timescale to deal with the question of dereliction if we allow the market value to get so far out of line with the real value, the value that is on our register compared with the market value. I regard this as an important point.</P>
    <P>While I have listened to the points which have been made by the two Senators, I think we must take this Bill as a unit.  Certainly, we take into consideration the plans of the local authorities and the county development plans that are made, but unless we have provisions that are of a sufficient structure to ensure that dereliction does not take place, that there is financial penalty for doing it and that our register is up to date in relation to the money market and the value of land, I think we will have failed. Therefore, I am not prepared to withdraw this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this argument a little difficult to follow.  I would think that a period of five years is a very reasonable period.  Putting through these processes can be very prolonged and I think that three years would be far too short a period.  The argument being used about variations in the value of land is like saying &ldquo;How long is a piece of string&rdquo;? At least five years gives a reasonable spread, which can be repeated every five years.  Three years, two years, one year &mdash; you can have fluctuations in six months, as far as that goes.  Once we go down that line we would never be finished changing and chopping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="677" />
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understand it, the local authorities and the executives of local authorities always get the best price possible; so if something is valued today it changes daily.  I fully take Senator Costello's point that in the future there may be a great increase in price &mdash; but there may not.  We have seen marvellous changes in the early seventies and we have seen the complete reverse in property for the last five years in the eighties. I know in my heart and soul that a chief executive officer, irrespective of what authority he represents, of what Department he represents, will get the best possible price on the market.  They will call in their experts, and, as far as I know, they never call in one expert in any particular field &mdash; they call in two.  They always get two opinions.</P>
      <P>For that reason I think the safeguards are built in here.  No matter what derelict site may come on stream, it is the location of that derelict piece of property which is important.  It may not be worth a quarter to the person who owned it for that period of time, but on the property market if you get two people bidding for the same property they will determine what the market price is.  The amendment seeks to empower the Minister to make this change mandatory.  That is what causes me concern.  I have no doubt that in the market-place the valuation is the best possible price that can be got on the day.  It does not matter what valuation anyone puts on anything, it is a matter of how many people you have on the market who are going to purchase the property at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think five years is reasonable.  I would not like to have a mandatory review every three years. What we are forgetting here is that the local authorities can review it earlier than five years.  That is a matter for them. They have the powers under this Bill.  It is stated in many places that local authorities are losing their powers.  You should be all kind enough to admit that I am giving members of local authorities plenty of powers now.  I do not wish to elaborate on that.  I think you should <Col N="678" /> leave it to my good judgment.  I appeal to Senator Costello to leave it to my good sense of judgment.  The local authorities in Dublin have the same powers as any of us in the country.  If they wish to review this earlier I am not standing in their way.  I am saying to the councils and corporations that they may review it earlier if they wish.  I do not want to make it mandatory on them to review it within three years because, if you look at other Bills, the general term is five years.  In the UK, where they put in five years, there was a slippage there; it was not spot on.  It is now over to the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point made by Senator Cassidy, the question of the market value being whatever it is and that it will be there anyway, the problem we are referring to, of course, is the question of the levy, the levy of what might be much less than the actual market value five years, three years or four years down the road.  Therefore, it is not so onerous on somebody who has accumulated derelict sites to pay a levy once it is nowhere near the real market value.  That is a consideration.  While I accept the Minister's trustworthiness and his good intentions in this matter, I am still worried that, even though the section states that the market value for the land on the register would be reassessed at least every five years, in these matters five years would become the norm.  While the local authority have the option of having it less&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt, but I am trying to strike a balance here.  What the Senator is forgetting &mdash; I am not saying intentionally &mdash; is that Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and every local authority have the right if they wish to do it.  I am trying to be helpful here.  If you think there is something wrong, go to your local authority. What could be better?  I appreciate the Senator's concern, but I am trying to be helpful.  I am only putting in five years because it must be done in five years.  But the local authority, corporation or county council can do it more often if they wish <Col N="679" /> to; every year if they wish.  What could be fairer?  I am given you a good assurance now, but I cannot assure you that a local authority will do it.  That is a matter for that local authority.  I would not interfere in any corporation or local authority because I have found them to very capable of dealing with all these matters in a very effective manner.  What really concerns me is that on one hand it is being said that powers are being taken away from local authorities, but here we are giving them power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely that the Minister has the very best of intentions with this legislation.  The one last point I have to make is relevant to what he is saying, the question of staffing.  While it is all very well to say that the local authority have the option and the discretion to go about re-assessing the value of the land after two, three or four years rather than the five year period, the question is: what local authority will do it unless they have to do it, considering the staffing levels they operate under at present and will have to for the forseeable future?  That is why I am worried that, when this states the least, this must be the norm.  Can you name a local authority in the country who will go out of their way to put some resources into assessing the value of the land in their area in respect of the register in fewer than five years when they are short on resources already?  While the Minister has the best of intentions in saying that the powers are there, what use are powers if you do not have the resources to implement them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one point on that by way of further elaboration.  It seems to me that there is no impediment, for instance, to Senator Costello, if he finds there is a piece of derelict land for sale, <Col N="680" /> bringing that to the attention of the local authority and making his case felt that perhaps it has not been valued properly and asking for a valuation to be set.  There is no difficulty there and I cannot see why we cannot get agreement on this section. By tying it down you are making something mandatory; and already under the Bill there is a facility whereby the local authority, if they wish, can have a revaluation every year.  There is no difficulty with that.  Why make it mandatory?  It does not make sense to me when the facility is already within the section to do that if it is so desired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment corrects a drafting error.  The intention of paragraph (a) was to fix the amount of the derelict sites levy at 3 per cent for the first year in which the levy will operate. Instead, paragraph (a) referred incorrectly to the first local financial year after the passing of the Act.  For a start, this expression is not entirely clear.  If, as <Col N="681" /> seems likely, this Bill is passed early in 1990, would the first local financial year be 1990 or 1991?  The main point, however, is that section 23 (1) already provides that the levy shall begin on such year as may be prescribed by the Minister. It is essential that the initial 3 per cent rate of levy should be co-ordinated with this provision and the amendment does this.</P>

      <P>In page 16, subsection (7), lines 34 and 35, to delete all words after &ldquo;owner&rdquo; down to the end of sub-section.</P>
      <P>Subsection (7) states:</P>
      <P>Where urban land ceases to be derelict at any time during a local financial year, any amounts paid by way of derelict sites levy in relation to that year shall be refunded to the owner and any amounts due or owing in relation to that year shall be waived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very similar to the first amendment which was accepted by the Minister, that is, amendment No. 11, where I sought to delete the section relating to interest being given as well as compensation.  The principle here is very similar, namely, that we should not once again be encouraging people responsible for a derelict site by allowing them to have refunded the amount they may have paid in <Col N="682" /> relation to a year.  What should be inserted there is &ldquo;in relation to the remainder of that year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What the provision itself is stating is that the person responsible for a derelict site would get a refund in respect of the entire year, whereas the amendment is saying that it should only be given for the remainder of the period for which the site does not remain derelict.  This could be a quarter of a year, half a year, three-quarters of a year, or 12 months.  It does not seem proper that people should be rewarded by being given that extra bonus when they have been responsible for dereliction coming about in the first place. For that reason I believe it would be useful if the Minister accepted this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would just say by way of comment on that that, first of all, finance is, generally speaking, on a yearly cycle.  Could I suggest to Senator Costello that actually what he is proposing is being destructive rather than constructive? Would it not be a lot better to have a carrot there for an individual who has a derelict site and to say to him, &ldquo;If you bring your site into order within the 12 months you are going to get back the payment of the levy that has been set against you&rdquo;?  Surely that would act as an incentive to the individual, to make sure that the derelict site was brought into proper condition before the end of the year.  It would be far more constructive to allow the section to go through as it is, as against the amendment proposed by Senator Costello, and I hope he agrees with me on that.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Senator from Cork about the compensation for the local authority in view of the scarce resources they have.  Why would you give back the levy to the person who has mis-demeaned in the light of the additional extra work on the local authority staff to acquire this site in the first place?  At the initial stages of the Bill we said that the Bill would be a good one if it could be <Col N="683" /> effectively implemented by a local authority with additional resources.  I certainly would not see that any moneys should be handed back, except perhaps with deducted expenses for the local authority in following through the whole derelict site acquisition in the first place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the intention of these amendments.  However, they are based on the premise that the derelict sites levy is apportionable over different periods of the local financial year.  This is not the case.  Under section 23 (1) the levy is to be charged as an annual one in relation to each local financial year.  It is true that subsection (6) permits a local authority to allow for payment of the levy by instalments, but this does not alter the fact that the levy has been designed as an annual tax.  As I have said, there is no means of legally apportioning the levy over different periods of the year.  Therefore, these amendments would be unworkable.  Apart from this technical problem, subsection (7) has in any event been deliberately drafted so as to encourage landowners to avoid the levy by undertaking remedial works within the year in question.  The ultimate purpose of the levy is not to enhance local authority revenues but to promote better land use.  That is the situation.  So, I think there has to be a little bit of common understanding here.</P>

      <P>The Minister states that it is in the context of the local financial year and that therefore we should not be chopping and changing.  But then, of course, section 23 (6) states that the levy may be paid by instalments &mdash; so, in fact, there is chopping and changing within the legislation.  I do not see why you apply one rule to the payment of the derelict sites levy by instalments and then suggest that the payment by the local authority back to the person who would be paying the levy should not be by instalments, or at least that the option should not be <Col N="684" /> there, and that the payment by instalments could reflect at what stage of the year the derelict site ceases to be derelict. I am not sure that the Minister's argument holds good because of the provision in the Bill.  In relation to the statement made by Senator O'Keeffe that we should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be here to present this Bill to the Seanad.  The Bill deals with three different aspects of the coinage &mdash; a proposed new £1 coin, the issue of a series of ECU commemorative coins and a change in the metal composition of the 1p and 2p.</P>
      <P>I know that Senators have commented in the past on the design of our coins and many have expressed the desire to see the continuation of the Metcalfe designs. Therefore, I hope Senators will be pleased to know that the new £1 coin, proposed in this Bill, will feature a red deer in the Metcalfe style.  The design specification is not part of the Bill.  This will be done at a later stage by order under section 3 of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969.  However, given the importance of the design I felt that this should be mentioned at the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the design will find favour with the public.  The red deer is native to this country.  The Government feel that such an animal would be very <Col N="685" /> suitable for use on the coin and would fit in well with the Metcalfe style and design. I have made available several sample coins for Senators to inspect.  The Metcalfe designs have served us well over the years and are pleasing to the eye.  The Government have decided that these designs should be retained as the uniform design theme of the coinage and that the existing motifs on the 1p and 2p should be replaced by two of Metcalfe designs dispensed with on decimalisation.  I will return to this later on.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tom Ryan, President of the Royal Hibernian Academy was commissioned to prepare the drawings of the new coin. These were based on photographs of actual red deer submitted by Mr. Seán Ryan of County Cork, an acknowledged expert in this field.  I should like to express the Government's thanks to both these gentlemen for their contribution.</P>
    <P>The question of a £1 coin has been under consideration for some time.  The proposal was mentioned in this Chamber as far back as 1986 when the order approving the issue of the 20p was introduced. The short lifespan of the pound note and the increasing production cost has made it unattractive to continue to produce £1 notes.  I think all Senators would agree that the tattered condition of our £1 notes, which arises all to quickly after their issue, is not good for the country's image.</P>
    <P>The coin itself will be made of cupronickel material similar to the 50p, 10p and 5p.  It will be 31.1mm in diameter and will be lighter than the existing cupronickel coins.  The coin will be issued in June and the £1 notes will be withdrawn from circulation from that date over a period of months.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the £1 coin should be seen as a first step in the Government's overhaul of the coinage over the next three to four years.  The first priority in 1991 will be the issue of a new, lighter and round 50p.  The coin will be reduced in size by about 5mm and will carry the current woodcock design.  I am aiming to reduce the weight of our coins generally for the convenience of the public.</P>
    <P>In 1992 it is planned to issue a new <Col N="686" /> 5p and 10p on which the two existing designs, the bull and the salmon, will be reversed to face left.  This will give a uniform orientation to all the motifs. Both coins will be reduced in size and weight.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, I am pleased to say that it has been decided to revert to the Metcalfe designs for the 1p and 2p. The 1p will feature the Irish wolfhound from the old sixpence while the 2p will have the hare which appeared on the pre-decimal 3 pence.</P>
    <P>As with all new coins, many organisations have been consulted in relation to the new £1 coin.  For example, the users and makers of coin-operated machines and representatives of the visually impaired have been consulted. Sample coins will be made available prior to the issue to allow any necessary changes and familiarisation to take place. The visually impaired should be able to distinguish the £1 coin from other coins.</P>
    <P>The size and weight alone will be of assistance to the blind.  In addition, the milling on the edge has been so constructed that it will be recognisable by touch.  This milling is unique to the £1 coin as it contains a milled edge with inset beading.  There is a clear size differnce between the 2p and 10p and the new coin.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council were consulted on the design of the £1 coin.  They agreed with the choice of the red deer and supported the retention of the Metcalfe theme for the coinage.  In addition, we sought their advice on a number of other matters relating to the coinage generally and we have taken on board most of their suggestions.  I would like to thank the Arts Council for their advice.  We will be consulting them further as individual coins are redesigned.</P>
    <P>The other main purpose of this Bill is to allow for issue of a series of commemorative ECU coins.  These will mark the Irish Presidency of the EC Council and will be issued in June to coincide with the EC Council meeting in Dublin Castle. Nineteen hundred and ninety is an important year in the development of the Community and will see the finalisation of some of the legislative framework for <Col N="687" /> the 1992 objective.  The commemorative coins will be an enduring reminder of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to issue the coins in gold and silver.  The coins will be purely commemorative and not legal tender.  Other member states have issued commemorative coins in the past.  Most recently, Spain produced a set of five coins in precious metals to mark their first Presidency of the Council.</P>
    <P>The coins will be issued through the Central Bank and will consist of a series of three &mdash; a gold 50 ECU piece, a silver coin 10 ECU, and a silver 5 ECU piece. The gold coin and smaller silver coin will be roughly the same size as the 10p while the larger silver coin will be of &ldquo;crown&rdquo; size, that is somewhat larger than the old half crown.</P>
    <P>The gold coin will be 22 carat gold and the silver coins will be sterling silver. They will be issued in proof standard to encourage interest among coin collectors.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the gold coin will be priced in the region of £250.  The larger silver coin will cost £20-£25 while the smaller silver coin will be priced at £10-£15. These prices are tentative since much depends on the value of gold and silver at the time of purchase of the metals.  However, while the gold coin and larger silver coins will be of interest mainly to collectors, the smaller silver coin at £10-£15 should be of interest to the ordinary citizen who wishes to have a keepsake of the occasion.</P>
    <P>This is our first step into the market of specialised coins.  There are certain risks associated with the issue of precious metal coins.  The metals must be purchased in advance and may fall in price subsequently, thus affecting market value.  There is also the risk the market demand might not be as strong as anticipated.</P>
    <P>On the advice of the Central Bank, it is proposed to issue 5,000 gold coins and 20,000 of the larger silver coins and 20,000 of the smaller silver coins.  These are the minimum levels necessary to offset the manufacturing costs.  An issue <Col N="688" /> of this size will, it is felt, minimise the risks and enhance the scarcity value for collectors.  Initial indications of interest in the coins are good and I believe that the issue will be a success.</P>
    <P>The Government decided that the design of the red deer should be used for the ECU coin.  Given the increased concern about conservation of the environment, the symbol of the Irish red deer is very appropriate.  The use of this theme will also increase awareness of our coinage abroad.  On the obverse side, it is intended to reproduce the harp surrounded by the 12 stars which is the logo of the Community.  The coin denomination will appear on this side also.  The use of the stars is common to issues by other countries and again symbolises this country's adherence to the Community.</P>
    <P>The final purpose of the Bill is to allow for a change to the 1p and 2p.  These coins are made of bronze at present and cost more than their face value to produce. Consequently, the Central Bank has recommended that the metallic composition of these coins should be changed to a copper coin with a steel core.  There will be no change in the outward appearance of the coins.  This change will enable the Bank to break even on the production of these coins.  Coins of this sort are common on the Continent and I note that the UK Royal Mint have recently announced a similar change in the UK coinage.</P>
    <P>I now turn briefly to the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 deals with definitions and is self-explanatory.  Section 2 relates to the ECU coins.  Subsection (1) allows for the issue of coins in ECUs in such sizes, metallic composition, design and weights as the Minister for Finance may decide.  Sub-sections (2) and (3) allow the coins to be sold through the Central Bank at a price determined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) provides that the coins will not be legal tender.  Subsections (5) and (6) apply certain sections of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969 to coins issued under section 2.  By virtue of these the Central Bank will bear the expenses of the issue and the income from the sale of the coins will accrue to the Bank.  The <Col N="689" /> Bank will also bear the cost of any redemption.  Sub-section (7) applies section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1963 and vests the copyright in the design in the Minister for Finance.  This is a standard provision of coinage legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (a) inserts a new section 4A in the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, to enable the provision of 1p and 2p coins in the form of copper coins with a steel core.  Section 3 (b) is a technical amendment of section 14 of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, to include a reference in that section to coins issued under section 2 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (c) amends the First Schedule to the Decimal Currency Act, 1969 to provide for the issue of a £1 coin.  The amended Schedule specifies the standard weight and composition of the coin and the permitted variation from these standards. The size and design of the coin will be dealt with separately by an Order under the 1969 Act.  Section 4 is the short title and construction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The coinage of a country is an important symbol of its nationhood.  The coins of a country are used by its citizens every day.  Consequently, the design of the coinage is a matter of importance and a subject on which many people will have an opinion.  The designs on the Irish coins are of an accepted high standard and the Government are anxious that this should continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>In introducing new coins one cannot hope to please everybody but the design of the Irish red deer is a design which I think will find favour with most people. The issue of the ECU coins is a suitable way to commemorate the Irish Presidency of the EC and is an important first step for us into a specialised market.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the generally favourable reception which the new coinage received in the Dáil.  I hope that Senators will express a similar welcome. I am anxious to hear the comments of the House and for Senators to share their advice and knowledge with me.  The Bill opens up a new area of the coinage with the issue of commemorative pieces and we are willing to listen carefully to the views of the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very interesting piece of legislation that, as the Minister has pointed out to us, deals with three main areas.  It is interesting in the order these areas are mentioned in the Bill but as they are mentioned the first point is the commemorative ECU coins, then the change in the 1p and the 2p coins.  Finally, the Bill deals with the proposed £1 coin which will replace the legal tender, the note we have known heretofore.</P>
      <P>Interestingly, in 1986, when I was Minister of State at the Department of Finance I had the pleasure, and indeed the responsibility, of steering the legislation for the 20p coin through both Houses so in a sense I have been through this issue before and basically it is much the same, even though we are talking about different coins.  As I said on that occasion, and it is very fitting for this occasion again, we must remind ourselves that the primary purpose of coins is their use as a medium of exchange.  In any modern economy they are used mainly to pay for the many small purchases and services that are an essential part of daily living. It is, therefore, important to provide coins in the denominations that best serve the needs of the public.</P>
      <P>These coins should, of course, be of convenient size and weight.  With the devaluing of our money over the years needs have changed.  Now a pocket full of change or a handbag full of change is not uncommon.  The halfpenny has been withdrawn because effectively it was of little use as legal tender.  Indeed, it was of such little value that it really did not come into the pricing system or the change we might expect for any particular article.  It was just irrelevant because of its devaluation over the years.</P>
      <P>As coins no longer satisfy the criteria for which they are needed, it is up to the Government of the day to look at the situation and to see if new introductions are needed or if changes are needed in existing coinage or existing legal tender. There are two changes proposed here, (1), the introduction of the £1 coin and, (2), the change in the 1p and the 2p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> I would like to ask the Minister a few things about the proposed changes in the 1p and 2p before I go on to deal with the £1 coin.  The composition of the 20p coin when it was brought out was an alloy of copper, zinc and nickel.  It was light, it was relatively inexpensive to produce and there was a colour advantage.  It was easily distinguished by colour from our other coins at the time.  I have just seen a copy of what the new 1p and 2p coins should look like, colourwise.  I wonder will the composition of the new 1p and 2p coins mean that a further third or fourth colour scheme will be introduced into our colour range.  I think, in fact, that is so.  I had a brief glance at what was passed around the House a few minutes ago.</P>
    <P>I accept the reason we are changing from bronze.  On face value the 1p and 2p coins now cost more to produce in the Central Bank than the 1p and 2p worth of coin you get for the bronze content. But why was consideration not given to a similar composition as that of the 20p coin?  Maybe there is good reason.  I would be interested to hear why that was not done, why we are now introducing a fourth type of coin, compositionwise. Surely the composition of the 20p coin would be cheaper than the copper with the steel core, from which, I understand, the new 1p and 2p coins will be made. Again, they are fairly technical points but, having steered similar legislation through the Houses, I would be interested to know why the change now and why we do not continue with what we thought was a good composition when introducing the 20p.  It was economic to produce and at the time it was lauded as state-of-the-art.  Times do change.  There may be very good technical reasons and I look forward to being advised as to what those technical reasons may be.</P>
    <P>I noticed in the Official Report of the Dáil a few weeks ago that the Minister replied to questions about whether the £ note and the £ coin would be in circulation side by side for any length of time.  As I understand it, the response to Deputy Michael Noonan was that the £1 <Col N="692" /> note would be withdrawn fairly rapidly on the issue of the £1 coin to ensure the acceptance of the £1 coin by the public. The Minister made a statement to the effect that if you left the two denominations or the two types of tender for the £ in circulation, being creatures of habit, there would be resistance among the public to accepting the £ coin and that the only way to get immediate or fairly immediate approval and usage of the £ coin would be to withdraw the £ note.  Is there no place at all for the £ note as we now know it?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could develop his thinking and the thinking of the Central Bank on that issue, because certainly for a long time in the UK after they switched to their £ coin there was amazing resistance and, indeed, resentment by the public that they no longer had the £ note. There were occasions when they felt that that would be appropriate and, indeed, many people have stated that they felt the coin type tender of the £, in fact, devalued it, it made them too familiar with it and whereas they would use a 10p or 20p coin in a transaction, the £ coin made them too familiar with the usage of the coin and they did not respect it to the same extent as they respected the £ note.</P>
    <P>Taken against the overall argument of the devaluing of money over the years &mdash; we might remind ourselves that a 1954 £1 is worth only 2.5p today &mdash; one can understand why we must address these issues.  But I have some sympathy for the whole concept that a £ coin might be held in less respect than the £ note.  Maybe it is just because we are creatures of habit. I would like to hear the Minister's views and the advice he has received in relation to this issue generally.</P>
    <P>At the time the 20p coin was introduced &mdash; I think it was in 1986 &mdash; the same type arguments were used, in other words, because of the devaluation of our currency generally and the large amounts of 10ps, 5ps, 2ps and 1ps and in everyone's pockets, in terms of change, another coin denomination was actually needed.  It was stated at the time and the advice of the Central Bank was that the 20p coin would take a lot of 10p coins <Col N="693" /> out of circulation, thereby lessening the weight and the number of coins on average that people would be carrying around with them in their pockets or their handbags. I would like to know if we have any figures as to whether, in fact, it transpired that that view was correct.  Has the issuing of the 20p coin some years ago meant that a lot of 10p coins have been taken out of circulation and there is less use for the 10p coin?  I am sure the Central Bank must have been monitoring the effect of the introduction of the 20p and the general usage of coins then as a result and whether one coin has been weighted in favour of others subsequently.  I would be very interested to know what the views are in that area generally.</P>
    <P>The Bill is being presented to the House in a different order from what was done in 1986.  I wonder why the First Schedule of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969 is being amended before the coinage order for the £1 coin?  If we look at what happened with the issue of the 20p coin in 1986, we had the coinage order first and then we amended the First Schedule of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969. Maybe I am reading a bit much into it.  I was just wondering if it is a convenience mechanism, that while we are discussing the commemorative coins here today and perhaps pointing up changes in the 1p or 2p coins that are to come in the future, it has been decided to bulk all three issues into one Bill.  I noticed this technical reversal of procedures and I was wondering what it was all about because, if I interpret correctly what will happen from here on in, the Minister will not be able to issue the £1 coin without coming back to this House with an affirmative order and we will again have a debate on the benefits or otherwise of the issuing of a 1p coin.  In other words, the debate we are having here today will largely be gone through again at another stage because it has to be by affirmative order that the 1p coin is brought to both Houses.  It certainly must be confirmed in both Houses.  I notice the Minister is shaking his head as I make that statement.  I am really taking from the views I gave, on <Col N="694" /> the advice of my officials, in 1986 that that was the procedure that had to be gone through.  I have in front of me the speech I made on the coinage order of the time, confirming that the order had to be confirmed by both Houses.  I am interested to know if we will have another opportunity to debate the £1 coin and whether, on another occasion, we will be going over most of what we have been saying today.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the design on our coins and the proposed changes in the 1p and 2p coins from bronze to the new composition and the change from the Celtic scroll that is now on our 1p and 2p coins back to a Metcalfe-type design. I was very interested in the contribution of Deputy Ger Brady in the other House. We could all learn a lot from his obvious knowledge in this area.  He made a very valid point that we all need to talk, to think and get advice about this.</P>
    <P>I do not have any monopoly of wisdom in this area, I just have a peripheral interest in it, as I suspect most Members of the House have, but I feel there is an excellent case for going back to the Arts Council, or even considering a new commission. We have only to think of the commission chaired by W.B. Yeats in 1927 which reported by publishing <i>The Coinage of Saorstát Éireann</i> in 1928.  We know the excellent work that commission did and the efforts they went to to reflect our culture and our heritage at the time. Since then, we have been tacking on and fiddling around with designs and adding to our coins.  We are now talking about Metcalfe-type designs; they are no longer part of the Metcalfe series.</P>
    <P>I like the design of the £1 coin but it is not a Metcalfe design.  We must be quite clear here.  It fits in with the Metcalfe series, it is part of the flora and fauna type series of the much lauded and beautiful Metcalfe series but we are not being purist.</P>
    <P>The question was raised as to whether we should now be considering a total new series of coins with a complete new series of designs.  Is it time to ask the Arts Council to look at this issue?  Is it time to set up a new competition or a new <Col N="695" /> commission chaired by some eminent person to see if we need a new series of coins with a new series of designs?  They may come back and tell us, &ldquo;No, stick to the Metcalfe designs, even have a Metcalfe-type design tacked on&rdquo;.  That could be acceptable but I feel with the changes we made in our coinage design in 1971, on decimalisation, the Celtic scroll type designs we brought in, with some old Metcalfe designs and now Metcalfe-type designs, we really have a mixum gatherum of designs, even though the final lot of coins, the facsimiles of which were circulated here today, look very attractive.  I agree with the proposition to change the shape.  I am not sure where we got the shape for the 50p coin.  It is out of synch with all our other coins. While I agree with what is trying to be achieved I wonder if, from a heritage and cultural point of view, we are going about it in the right way.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to be critical.  I am posing a rhetorical question.  Are we going about it in the right way by just adding on odd coins here and there as consumer demands dictate that we need to change our coinage denominations?  They are very attractive looking, but from a heritage and cultural point of view, we should bounce what is proposed off the Arts Council and off, perhaps, a new commission. Sixty to 70 years later is it time to look again at where we are going, as we enter the next millennium, for example?  I pose that question because I have some reservations, even though I find the individual designs very attractive.  I found the £1 note very attractive but from a purist point of view is it really in order to keep tacking on to the Metcalfe series Metcalfe-type designs?  I have doubts and I question that.</P>
    <P>The most important part of the Bill appears to be the commemorative issue of the ECU coins.  Perhaps it is the main reason why this Bill had to come before us now and why we did not wait for the coinage order.</P>

Maybe it is the main reason this Bill came to us now rather than await the coinage order and then go back to amending the First Schedule of the Bill.  That does not really matter anyway.  I just have some views in terms of this whole commemorative issue.  The Presidency of the European Parliament is a very important honour for this country.  That goes without saying.  I would like, however, to remind the Minister and his colleagues that it is not the first time we have had the honour of the Presidency.</P>

      <P>I hope we will do a very good job.  When June comes and goes we will look back on the six months and then pass judgment as to whether it has been successful or not.  I sincerely wish the President and, indeed, all the Ministers who are Presidents of their particular groups of Ministers, every success with what is a very important issue for our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question whether we should decide now, a couple of months into the Presidency, to issue a commemorative coin telling us what great lads and lassies we are and how important we are to Europe. I question that a little.  I looked at it and <Col N="697" /> initially I thought it would be great idea, that it would be lovely.  This idea of the gold and silver coins and the different denominations reads very well.  Those interested in numismatics and those who follow this will have their views.</P>
    <P>When I looked at what we did in this area, and the two previous occasions we had commemorated, quite honestly, this third occasion does not hold a candle to the two previous occasions.  As I said in 1986 &mdash; this is not just a conversion now because I am on record as having views on the issue of commemorative coins and I will quote those in a minute &mdash; they must be occasions of great national importance.  We issued a commemorative coin in 1966 to commemorate the Easter Rising.  There was no national division. It was of major national importance.  We issued another one in the early seventies to commemorate our accession to the EC.  They were the only two occasions &mdash; when we joined the EC and to commemorate the Easter Rising.  Now there are coins coming out to commemorate the present Presidency of the EC.  If this was the first six months in 1993 and the start of the internal market I would understand; if it was the first time we had been in receipt of the Presidency of Europe, I would understand, but just in an ongoing rota for our turn to hold the Presidency we are going to commemorate the occasions with a coin. When I said, &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; was the word used on the other side a few minutes ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The only time we should issue commemorative coins must be on occasions of major national importance.  It is not of major national importance that the Taoiseach is now President of the Council of Ministers.  He happened to achieve this very important and worth-while position on a rota basis, his turn came as in school one's turn comes &mdash; you are in there for a while, then you are gone and the next person's turn will come.</P>

      <P>What will be inscribed on the back of this coin?  Charles, President of Europe or something like that?  It is the red deer again on the back of the coin, all beautiful coins but I question the motive for issuing them at this point.  Lest Senators think I am a late convert to these views in terms of the issue of commemorative coins, may I put on the record words I used in 1986 on this very issue.  I said at the time:</P>
      <P>A coin is much less ephemeral than a postage stamp.  It is a long-lasting artefact that reflects its time and culture. Some last so long that they become invaluable historical records.  I believe the issue of commemoratives should be relatively limited, that the occasions should be of major significance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>It certainly is not on this occasion</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that they should tend to unify rather than to divide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it will divide.  I will make that point now.  There is no question of division on this issue.  It certainly is not an occasion of major significance, our <Col N="699" /> third time holding the Presidency.  It is not the first start of the Internal Market. Apart from it being The Taoiseach's Presidency, what is the major national importance for the issue of a commemorative coin?  I await the Minister's answer with interest.</P>
    <P>I also said on that occasion in relation to the issue of coins for commemorative and numismatic purposes, that generally this country has only a policy of providing coins for domestic use and that we had not ventured into the international numismatic market at that time.  The only departures from the policy of issuing coins for the domestic market were the ten shilling silver coin issued in 1966, to which I referred, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising and the issuing of some polished sets of the decimal coins in 1971.  I stand corrected, I think I stated they were when we entered the European Community.  The issue of polished sets of decimal coins in 1971 was the second occasion.  This apparently will be the third occasion.</P>

      <P>I stand corrected on that. Was it not a commemorative rather than just a legal tender note?  In regard to the decimal coins of 1971, am I correct in my interpretation that they were purely commemorative?  They were sets.  They could have been used if you took the set <Col N="700" /> apart.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I have said enough in this area.  It is nothing I will lose sleep about.  When the coins are issued they will be recognised as either good design of coins and nice pieces of art, hopefully reflecting our culture and our heritage.  I question the motives behind issuing commemorative coins for the reason that has been given and I put my views on record in relation to it.</P>
      <P>I understand from what the Minister said the Central Bank's role in this is that they will have total control over the process of the ECU commemorative coins.  I also questioned why we are not using the money saving copper zinc nickel alloy that was used in the 20p for the £1 coin.  Indeed I note we are not using it for the change in the composition that is proposed for the 1p and 2p coin.  Maybe I could have a response later on, when the Minister is winding up the debate. There may be a good technical change. Could we also have views as to what research has been done into the use of the pound coin at point of sale of equipment, slot machines and items like that?  I look forward to hearing the views of others and indeed the Minister's response in relation to the queries I raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as the Minister has outlined, has a threefold objective; the proposed new £1 coin, the issue of a series of ECU commemorative coins and the change in the metal composition of the 1p and 2p coins.  Despite Senator Doyle's comments I think it is very appropriate that we should have a special commemorative coin issued to celebrate <Col N="701" /> our Presidency of the EC.  We are not the only nation to honour the Presidency of the EC in this way and it certainly appears a very reasonable, correct and appropriate way to honour what I regard as an historic event.</P>
      <P>I know, too, that there will be critics of the fact that the 5,000 gold coins will be available at a very costly price of £250. There will always be coin collectors, there will always be souvenir collectors. I am sure there will be always be people, and indeed corporate bodies, who might feel it appropriate and correct to spend £250 to honour the event that we, a small nation, can have as of right the honour of Presidency of the EC from January 1990 to June 1990, I think what we are proposing is appropriate and correct.</P>
      <P>The change in the metallic composition of the 1p and 2p coins &mdash; as we know they are made of bronze &mdash; is something I definitely agree with because the coins at present in use become very tarnished. Even though these coins are not as readily available as they have been in the past, I have no doubt that many of the bank cashiers throughout the country, having handled these coins for a period of a few hours will almost immediatley retire to the nearest washroom to wash their hands.  That can be said equally with regard to the £1 note because over a period of time the Irish £1 note becomes a filthy piece of paper.  It is simply not an acceptable standard at the moment and it is right that we should do something in this regard.</P>
      <P>I spoke to a number of bank staff in Athlone, young men and women, who every day of the week are handling the 1p and 2p coins and the filthy £1 note and their attitude quite honestly to the Bill is the quicker the change is made the better. In the knowledge that the £1 note has a short life &mdash; the Minister referred to this &mdash; and for economic reasons it is good business at this time to change to the £1 coin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some experience of the use of the English £1 coin and I noticed the Minister had some coins too.  Obviously he paid a visit recently to some part of England.  Senator Doyle referred to the <Col N="702" /> fact that we may be creatures of habit.  I certainly felt, having six or seven one pound English coins in my pocket that I simply had a pocketful of loose Irish change not of great value, you learn after a while what the £1 coin really is.  It will take some time for us to get used to the actual coin.</P>
    <P>The design of the coin is a good choice. The Irish red deer is a large, majestic native animal which, unfortunately, has declined in number over the years. However, thanks to various preservation orders it will be preserved.  A whole new set of coins were circulated here and it is very interesting to examine them.  The 1p coin has the Irish wolfhound.  As I have a great interest in the greyhound, I would love to see the greyhound back on one of the coins as it was on the old sixpence. The 2p coin has the hare, which was always a great favourite on the pre-decimal threepence.  The new 10p coin has the salmon, the 5p coin has the bull, the 50p coin has the woodcock, the 20p coin has the horse and now the new £1 coin will have the Irish red deer.  All seven coins will be quite distinctive.  All the species are native to this country.</P>
    <P>The actual dimension of the new £1 coin should be very distinctive.  It is important that it should be easily identifiable not just for blind people or for people who might have bad sight but in places such as pubs, discos and restaurants which often have dim lighting and where it is often a problem to differentiate between the 20p, 10p and 2p coins which are alike in size.  Having examined the new £1 coin it is certainly different.  It is the largest of the seven coins I have seen on display here this evening.  It is lighter than the present 50p. It is an attractive coin and I welcome the fact that it will be easily identifiable.  We have a high standard in design.  The changes now being suggested will continue this high standard of design.  I welcome the Bill and hope that it will serve the Irish citizens for many years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should restrain himself.  He might be in the High Court shortly.  It is about time we introduced a £1 coin.  However, in the interests of our perception of ourselves as a tourist nation with an image to portray, it is about time we persuaded the Central Bank or the Government to make sure that our notes in general are of top quality and that we never again have a situation of a disgraceful quality of notes &mdash; which to my mind constituted in many cases a health hazard &mdash; becoming part of our legal tender.  Our notes should be replaced not according to some arbitrary view of what should be but as is necessary to preserve top quality notes.  It was one of the great attractions of the earlier automatic teller machines that they had to use good quality notes but some of the more recent models seem to have managed to get their way around that and they are now managing to produce recycled notes of an inferior quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put one important point to the Minister, that is in relation to the use of coins by visually handicapped people. Will the Minister or his officials sit down with a group of visually handicapped people and not just listen to an organisation which tells them what visually handicapped people think or feel or how they can handle the coins?  I know from talking to people about the 20p coin, which was supposed to be suitable, that many visually handicapped people find it difficult.  I would like to reiterate that the vast majority of the visually handicapped are old people and, because they are old, not only can they not see but their use of their hands is often restricted because of the various ailments of old age.  Therefore, what might seem to be a reasonably distinctive coin to a young person who happens to have the misfortune of being visually handicapped could be extremely <Col N="706" /> difficult for an older person.  As the value of coinage increases the possibilities for old people to make mistakes, or &mdash; God forbid that anybody would do it &mdash; to be ripped off, increases.  The design of coins must be based not on a reasonable position but on the experience of elderly people.</P>
    <P>Is it possible for us as a nation to ensure, if we are changing our currency, that all the machines and the equipment in the State that uses coins are geared to cope with the new coins?  Will it be the case that all our phones will have signs saying: &ldquo;these phones will not take the new coins&rdquo;, that meters in car parks will have notices for two years saying: &ldquo;these meters will not take the new coins&rdquo;, that it will take two years after the new coinage has been introduced to make the necessary adjustments?  It is not a matter of waiting for technology to catch up, it is a matter of proper planning and proper organisation.  We, as a nation, have to get ourselves organised to do things properly. It is simply a question of devising a system and ensuring that Telecom Éireann and other agencies actually do what any proper organisation would do, which is to facilitate their customers.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a ridiculous position where people have to go around with a pocketful of old coins to operate various machines and a pocketful of new coins that are handed out to them in change we will make a laughing-stock of ourselves. It is necessary to organise things properly.  That does not just mean issuing the coins and hoping for the best.  It means reminding people that these coins are about to come into use.  I would suggest, therefore, that these coins should be introduced and Telecom Éireann and other agencies should be reminded to pay up the extra cash to convert all their machines, and not in five years' time. There are still telephones in public houses and public telephones around the country that cannot even take a 20p piece and some that cannot take a 50p piece.  Can we not organise ourselves to do something properly for once?  In something as relatively simple as changing our coinage we ought to make sure that everything in <Col N="707" /> which that coinage is used actually uses the coinage we choose to use and we should not have some sort of antiquated equipment that is 20 years out of date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put on record that I, too, welcome this new departure.  I hope it is the first of many.</P>
      <P>The Minister states, in relation to the limited edition, that it is our first step into the market of specialised coins.  Will the new issue be the first of many?  Does the legislation as currently framed mean that the Minister will be allowed to make an order rather than having to come back into the House whenever there is a decision taken, irrespective of which Government are in office, to issue a commemorative coin?  How will this particular ECU coin or series of coins be promoted?  I would have to think that institutional investors would corner the gold coin and the silver coin market.  The nation as a whole should have an opportunity of putting some money aside because, after all, these coins should be of value both intrinsically and materially for many generations to come.</P>
      <P>A very old lady in my home town of Drumshambo, who is now celebrating her 89th year, only recently gave to one of her great-granddaughters a gold coin that was issued to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1901.  It had been in her family since that time.  It is obviously worth a great deal of money.  I would hope that these limited edition coins, if they are the first of many, would be promoted properly and that the public would be given an opportunity and encouraged to buy them.</P>
      <P>Will the Government be considering issuing gold coins on an ongoing basis similar to, say, the Canadian maple leaf coin and the South African krugerrand which, of course, due to the status of South Africa and the hope for a return to the family of nations, is not as much sought after now as it used be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a separate issue, will the Government be contemplating reducing the size of the £50 note and what is the current status of the £100 note?  I am not even <Col N="708" /> sure if there is such a note in existence. When I was very young I remember farmers going to the banks on fair days with the large £100 notes.  I am wondering whether, in the current situation, there will be a need for a £100 note.  Are the Government contemplating reducing the size of the £50 note, because it is rather unwieldy and due to inflation and pressures, etc., over the last ten or 15 years it is coming increasingly into use.  I hasten to add that I do not have all that many of them, in fact, they rarely pass my table, but in the context of the other contributions made about the usage of our coinage and the usage of our notes perhaps the Government might take the opportunity to look at the £50 note.</P>

      <P>I will endeavour to reply to the points raised within the limited time at my disposal, perhaps not in the order in which they were raised. Senator Doyle asked whether the Arts Council might be consulted in relation to the overall design.  The Arts Council were consulted and in their reply stated that they were most pleased with the Metcalfe design and that they were possibly the most pleasing coins in Europe, if not in the world.</P>

      <P>With regard to the commemorative coins Senator Doyle mentioned, this is a very unique and special occasion but apart from that there is an increasing interest in commemorative coins generally.  It is an area that we have not been involved in up to now to any major extent because we did not exploit that area.  There is an increasing and growing interest in commemorative coins and it is important that we get into a market which will offer opportunities for employment.  It is an area that has been researched by the bank.  It has not been entered into just purely on speculation. Before this decision was taken, some research work was done specifically to determine whether or not there was a <Col N="709" /> market for such a commemorative coin. It has shown that there is a market.  It is one that we should be involved in.  It is a wise step, a welcome one and one that should be advanced further.</P>

      <P>Senator Mooney asked whether it would be the Government's intention to issue further commemorative coins.  Yes, further commemorative ECU coins can be issued under the Bill.  The silver and the gold coins are aimed at the man in the street and will be available to the public at large.  It will be acknowledged that there is a specific market and demand for that type of coinage and one that will be taken up quickly by the specialists interested in it.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised the question of cost of the 1p coin and the 2p coin.  The cost of these coins is 40 per cent more than the actual face value.  The Central Bank, having examined the technical aspects, decided in favour of a copper coin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be considered for use in the 5p and 10p coins.  Senator Doyle also asked whether the 20p coin has taken the 10p coin out of circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent it has been taken out of circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been no 10p coins minted since 1984, where as 66 million 20p coins have been minted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>So it has reduced the demand for the 10p?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that seems to be the position.  The 1p and 2p coins will be exactly the same colour at at present. Senator Doyle asked whether there were consultations with the principal coin users.  Yes, there were extensive consultation by the bank with the coin users. <Col N="710" /> They were acquainted with the planned dimension and the consultations extended to the ESB, Telecom Éireann, CIE, Dublin Corporation, Dublin Gas, Aer Rianta and the matters of coin-operated machines.  The consultation clearly identified that the coin users were satisfied with the coins.</P>
      <P>The question as to whether the £1 note and the £1 coin should remain in circulation simultaneously was one that was raised previously.  The evidence is that in the practical day-to-day working of this system if you leave the two in operation one seems to negate the impact of the other.  Part of the reason for introducing the new coin is it lasts about five to seven years without any major change in the face value as against the £1 note which only lasts for about six months.  That would be one of the main advantages &mdash; the durability and reliability of the new coin &mdash; and the fact that it has a pretty good face value for about six or seven years and has a life of about 40 years.</P>

      <P>We will certainly look at that but my advice is that it is not necessary. Senator Ryan raised the question of whether there had been consultation with the visually impaired.  The bank did consult with the representatives of the various organisations involved with the visually impaired and it has been clearly <Col N="711" /> identified that it would be acceptable to those people.</P>
      <P>I think that covers the main points that have been raised unless anybody wants to question anything else.  Overall, I believe it is a very timely and useful piece of legislation and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Senators for their very constructive and helpful comments.</P>

There is a matter of amending the First Schedule and there is also a coinage order and I thought both had to be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross took the words out of my mouth; I am about to make the same point.  While I am very glad to see the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food in this House because we were nursed upon the self same hill and he is a former pupil of whom I am very proud, nonetheless the fact that this debate is being taken by him and not by anybody from either the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Justice I regard as a slight to this House and as a slight to myself.  It is a slight to the seriousness of the motion before the House.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, noting the implications of the Supreme Court judgment in the McGimpsey case, calls on the Government to initiate the necessary constitutional changes to end the State's territorial claim on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the section of the Constitution on the nation, Articles 1, 2 and 3.  I phrased the motion deliberately so as not to refer to any one of those Articles specifically. There are nuances here into which I do not wish to go.  This is the section of the Constitution which postulates a single Irish nation inhabiting the one national territory on the one island, coterminus with the island.  I think these Articles taken together are a fraud and a deceit and have been from the beginning.  They <Col N="713" /> are tacked on, as it were, to the rest of the Constitution.  If they were taken away unconditionally and unilaterally, they would be no loss to anyone on this island. I have held this opinion for years and years.</P>
    <P>I remember a television debate with the now Tánaiste Deputy Brian Lenihan, in which I pointed again and again to the territorial emphasis of Articles 2 and 3; the word &ldquo;territory&rdquo; or &ldquo;territorial&rdquo; occurs five times in ten lines.  The plain citizen, let alone the judges of the Supreme Court, can be in no doubt about their territorial intent.  I am not deterred by the Taoiseach's dismissive head-in-sand attitude in the Dáil yesterday when this matter was brought up.  I am concerned to ascertain Seanad Éireann's opinion on a question which is sometimes referred to glibly as a hoary old chestnut but which is of crucial national importance &mdash; a life and death matter in the context of the Northern conflict and now a matter of renewed topical interest.</P>
    <P>It was understandable perhaps in 1937 that the makers of the Constitution should be concerned with sovereignty and territoriality, with the kind of historical background, disappointment over partition, the collapse of the boundary Commission and so on, but even then it is interesting to observe that there was a substantial dissenting voice within the Nationalist camp about these articles. The then Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, described them as &ldquo;make-believe&rdquo; which is what they indeed always have been.  The No. 1 civil servant &mdash; if I may call him that &mdash; J.J. McElligott, the Secretary of the Department of Finance, objected strenuously to these Articles.  He described them as &ldquo;a fiction and one which will give offence to neighbouring countries with whom we are constantly protesting our desire to live on terms of friendship.&rdquo;  He continued, &ldquo;It is not clear whether we are on safe ground in claiming sovereignty and jurisdiction over land recognised internationally, <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i>, as belonging to another country.&rdquo;&ldquo;These <Col N="714" /> Articles.&rdquo;  he concluded, &ldquo;will not contribute anything to effecting the unity of Ireland, but rather the reverse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a remarkably perceptive and astute observation in 1937 and nearly 30 years later those remarks have lost none of their relevance or forcefulness.  I am sorry, nearly 55 years later! I said 30 years in a slip of the tongue because 30 years after the Constitution was drafted, when Nationalist passions had cooled, when there was a more liberal atmosphere an all-party constitutional review committee of the Oireachtas suggested that these offensive, territorial-orientated Articles, certainly Article 3, be replaced by a more generous sentiment and one, I may add, more in keeping with true united Irish republican tradition.  What that review committee recommended was that instead of Article 3 there should be a clause saying:</P>
    <P>The Irish nation hereby proclaims its firm will that its territory be re-united in harmony and brotherly affection between all Irishmen.</P>
    <P>The name of Seán Lemass is generally associated with this progressive new departure and rightly so.  He should be given due credit but it is unfair and untrue historically to suppose that the main Opposition were deficient in this respect. Indeed, Liam Cosgrave gave this new departure his full support and it appears that the person who drafted this new version was none other than the distinguished constitutionalist, former Attorney General and Member of these Houses, John Kelly.  So it was, we may say, a bi-partisan situation and not exclusively a Lemass initiative.  However Article 3, this mischievous and baneful Article, was used in 1977, despite the progressive suggestions made ten years earlier, by certain political troglodytes to wreck the Sunningdale Agreement which, you will recall, had been so agonisingly arrived at in the context of such Irish slaughter in 1972-73.  Article 3 was used deliberately to wreck the Sunningdale Agreement.  That alone, in my view, would prove that this Article is a disaster.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> Despite all our professed greater understanding of the Ulster Unionist position, which our predecessors did not have in 1937, we now seem to have gone backwards since the suggestion of the 1967 committee.  At least Fianna Fáil have gone backwards since that liberal, proposed version in 1967.  The Taoiseach's stubbornness no later than yesterday is proof of that regressive attitude in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>For some years now we have been pretending, in a typical Irish solution to an Irish problem manner, that this bombastic and aggressive clause does not really mean anything, that it should not be interpreted territorially.  That is the point the Tánaiste tried to push on me in that television debate some years ago, that it does not really mean territorially, despite the evidence of our eyes, or if it does mean a territorial intent we do not really mean it.  We are told: &ldquo;Do not take any notice of that; we do not really mean that at all but it would be too difficult to get rid of it.&rdquo;  Besides it would be electorally disastrous to try to get rid of it, so they think.  So there is this pretence which has now been blown sky high by the Supreme Court yesterday.  That is the significance of the Supreme Court decision: they have blown the gaffe on that piece of hypocrisy and it cannot now be used again.</P>
    <P>I do not have to explain the circumstances of the McGimpsey case for the House except maybe to summarise that the McGimpsey brothers who are moderate and, perhaps, somewhat eccentric, in the best sense, Unionists, for their own Unionist reasons, took the court action to prove that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was incompatible with the Constitution.  On 1 March the Supreme Court made a ruling on this in which they turned down the McGimpsey case but put paid to the notion that what we have in Articles 2 and 3 is a lovingly aspirational expression of our ardent desire to consummate our union with our separated brethren.  That fiction was put paid to for good on 1 March.</P>
    <P>The court said deliberately, and it did not <Col N="716" /> have to spell it out, that Articles 2 and 3 constitute a claim of legal right which the Government have not only the right to pursue but the duty to pursue.  It is a constitutional imperative.  The territorial claim is the law, is the Constitution, irrespective of the wishes of the majority in Northern Ireland.  So what are we going to do about that?  What does the Constitution say?  It says that:</P>
    <P>... without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution...</P>
    <P>In other words, the Oireachtas is involved, so how do we react to what the court has said in this historic judgment on 1 March?  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to put his head in the sand. He should ponder, for example, on the impartial and learned conclusion of a highly respected commentator on constitutional matters, my colleague in University College, Cork, David Gwynn Morgan who, following on the court judgment, said in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 5 March in a highly significant article:</P>
    <P>The significance of all this is plain: ...The Government lacks the capacity to renounce the <i>de jure</i> claim on Northern Ireland.  If these articles are matters of law, then an Irish Government is simply not legally competent to reach certain kinds of compromise with the unionist majority.</P>
    <P>The net result is that the Government are rather constrained in any future bargaining with the Northern majority.</P>
    <P>Their hands are tied and tied in an aggressive territorial direction by the ruling of the court.  In political terms, the court's ruling confirms the Unionist belief that these Articles were always aggressive, that they were always territorial in intent and that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was only a stalking horse for these territorial claims.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the reaction we have had along the line over the last week or ten days or so.  Again it is all moderate reaction. These are not the wild men of <Col N="717" /> Unionism talking, they are people like the McGimpsey brothers and Ken Maginnis, than whom there could be no more moderate voice.  If we do not talk and listen to Ken Maginnis we might as well throw our hats at anything like an accommodation with the rest of the Unionists. The draft proposal which was leaked, and which we have no reason to suspect is other than genuine, for a new British-Irish agreement, which was the submission of Ian Paisley and Mr. Molyneaux and which was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 27 February, again pinpointed Articles 2 and 3 &mdash; and this was before the Supreme Court judgment &mdash; as a main source of Unionist fear and grievance.</P>
    <P>Frank Miller, former secretary of the Unionist Party, who now writes on an occasional basis for <i>The Irish Times,</i> in an article only yesterday pointed up the significance of the court in the same way.  The Presbyterian Synod yesterday again put Articles 2 and 3 to the forefront of any agenda that attempts to achieve reconciliation in Ireland.  If all the moderate voices articulate this fear and this resentment of the territorial claim, especially in the wake of the Supreme Court judgment, are we going to listen to them? Will the Taoiseach listen to them?  He is always talking about how generous they will find him and about how he would like to allay their fears and their concerns. This is the stock rhetoric he goes on with. Does he mean any of that?  What they are telling him if he will listen is: &ldquo;We are telling you what our fears are; hands off Northern Ireland; knock off the territorial claim&rdquo;.  Is he going to listen to that?  He shows no sign so far of doing so.  This motion is aimed at getting him and his Government to face up to this demand.  Will he go to Belfast next month as the head of a Government which has aggressive territorial intent on the people of that area, or will he have the imagination and the courage to release a new dove of peace on that occasion?</P>
    <P>I am proposing this motion in the first place &mdash; and the first reason may not <Col N="718" /> command the assent of some of my colleagues, even those of my colleagues who support the general sentiment &mdash; because I do not believe that the national territory concept is authentic at all.  The whole idea of a national territory is becoming increasingly dubious.  Who said that &ldquo;the whole island of Ireland&rdquo; who first ordained that the whole island of Ireland is the national territory?  There was never, by the way, a united Irish State embracing the whole island of Ireland under native Irish rule, and that is something we should think about.  I believe that Northern Ireland, in terms of jurisdiction and sovereignty, is a kind of a no-man's land. I would submit that the British, though originally claiming exclusive sovereignty &mdash; though even then you have to keep in mind that the British never really wanted a partitioned island &mdash; in regard to that British claim which was enshrined in the 1973 Constitution Act, the British have now waived that claim by their agreement to Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The British in effect have said this is not exclusively and unconditionally our territory any more.  So, I am saying it is a kind of a no-man's land.  I am also saying that the idea of a nation in the abstract having a right to unity is meaningless and cannot really be substantiated &mdash; apart altogether by the way, from the arrogance of people living in this part of the island in the comfort and smugness of places like Cork and Kerry making bombastic demands about the national territory, where people are suffering day in and day out because of the conflict that all that concept entails.</P>
    <P>Another argument is surely that the State which incorporates three-quarters of the nation has forfeited much of its right to a territorial claim in any event because of its purely partisan and denominational behaviour on great public issues.  But people might not agree with me on that.  People might prefer to tread the middle ground of the Progressive Democrats or of Jack McQuillan, who has proposed, and as the Progressive Democrats have similarly suggested, that we should have an aspiration to a peaceful unity and have that <Col N="719" /> replace Articles 2 and 3.  But, even though people do not follow me in this, maybe unpopular, belief that the national territory idea is erroneous, I then appeal to them on other grounds.  I am saying that the territorial claim is bombastic, unhelpful &mdash; that at least it is bombastic and unhelpful and that at the worst it can, as was proved with Kevin Boland's initiative in 1975, be disastrously invoked to oppose the real welfare and the real harmony of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am saying that the territorial claim is invalid because it is made in the name of &ldquo;We, the people of Ireland&rdquo;, but the people who enacted the Constitution in December 1937 did not include the Northern majority against whom the claim is now made.  I am saying that the territorial claim limits and damages the work of such excellent bodies as Co-operation North and the Ireland Association. In other words, all the good work that could be done by cultural bodies for creating real links between people are compromised by the fear and the aggression implicit in the territorial claim.</P>
    <P>The claim is as offensive to progressive opinion down here as to the Unionists. Let me quote from an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> on the very day of the 50th anniversary of the enactment of the Constitution, 29 December 1987, a year in which I think we in this House debated the Constitution in an anniversary context. What <i>The Irish Times</i> said on 29 December 1987 is this:</P>
    <P>It is a claim which is expressed in a dangerously simplistic idiom, in terms which are suggestive of a desire for conquest, subjugation indeed, and which can have no place in the dialogue which must come about with the Unionist majority in the North.  The concept of territorial occupation, of the Gael flying to the sea before the conquering might &mdash; military, social, or cultural &mdash; of the Gael may well have had its place as part of a necessary political or cultural mythology 1937.  It has none today.  And it contradicts the <Col N="720" /> declared desire of the great majority of people on this island for the achievement of unity by peaceful means alone.</P>
    <P>That surely is now further confirmed by the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if we have the vision to lift the territorial claim we will ease the whole pressure on Northern Ireland, pressure on the Unionists.  We will make it easier for them to consider an internal accommodation, a lasting internal accommodation.  We will improve dramatically North-South relations.  It will help us, as I said, to develop cultural links instead of meaningless political claims; and I think also that if we lifted the territorial claim it would put the onus on the British to be more responsible in all kinds of ways.  Then it would be their Border exclusively and they would be responsible for it in the eyes of the world, more than we would.  In fact, it would enhance our moral standing in the world perception of this problem if we backed off from the territorial claim.  In time I believe that, if there was no longer a territorial claim, the endemic hatred between Protestant and Catholic would diminish.  It is arguable at least that the reason why Catholics are the unfortunate victims of Protestant bigotry and sectarian hatred is because they are seen as the fifth columnists of an aggressive and unfriendly State.</P>
    <P>Another central advantage perhaps of pressing this change in the Constitution would be that we would be dissociating ourselves not only from the methods of the Provos, which we all deplore, but from their aims as well.  In the existing state of affairs they can argue that they have the courage of our casually held convictions, and in a way they are right. They are right when they say, and they scribble it as graffitti on various public walls, that &ldquo;Ireland is Irish soil&rdquo;.  If they believe that all of Ireland is Irish soil, meaning that it is subject to the central control of one united regime, then they are right to regard the Unionists as foreigners and aliens and to drive them out by force.  We cannot have it every way.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is in accordance with the new spirit of Europe that we should disown <Col N="721" /> the territorial claim.  That is how peace is going to be established in the new Europe &mdash; by people not insisting on old shibboleths and where borders are drawn and so on.  Of course, it is arguable that as a member of the Community we have no right to make a claim on part of a neighbouring state.  Of course, there will be objections to what I am saying tonight. It will be objected, for example, that we are abandoning the Nationalists.  Well, I submit that the present constitutional clauses give no protection or no assurance to Nationalists and since the drafting of the Anglo-Irish Agreement I submit that article 1 does guarantee the Nationalist aspiration of the Northern minority. Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the Constitution are absolutely no use to them whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a referendum on this question would be divisive.  In fact, Fianna Fáil are the only ones out of step. The Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael &mdash; if you look at what was said at the Ard-Fheis and at Deputy Dukes' own personal reaction to the question and answer session &mdash; they also, as far as I can read them, would have no objection to the dropping of these Articles.  The Workers' Party similarly.  I am not sure about the Labour Party; but certainly only Fianna Fáil refuse to budge.  Only Fianna Fáil are out of step.</P>
    <P>I submit that in this as in other matters the referendum would not be divisive. There is a strong tide of public opinion out there which is favourable to radical constitutional change if it thinks it would help to promote peace: all the public opinion polls at least suggest that.  Such a referendum would be an occasion for a radical declaration of our own peaceful interests <i>vis-á-vis</i> the North.  It is despicable that we should be told we must keep these claims in reserve as a bargaining counter, hold them over the heads of the Unionists, until they see sense.  That is what that means.  That is what the Taoiseach was saying again yesterday &mdash; change only in an all-Ireland reshuffle.</P>
    <P>What that means is blackmail.  It means that he is saying to the Unionists &ldquo;If we take our hands off your throat, what <Col N="722" /> concessions will you make to us?&rdquo; That is what that means.  It is as despicable as the Cardinal's similar piece of blackmail a year or two ago that divorce is on the table as a trading point in a United Ireland.  That is not the way of the future. That is not the aspiration of peace and brotherhood we are talking about.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have kept on saying ever since the New Ireland Forum, ever since the Anglo-Irish Agreement, that territory is not what we are interested in, that unity of hearts and minds is what we are after, that preoccupation with territory is an outmoded shibboleth.  Do we really mean that?  If we do, then we have a chance to show it in supporting and promoting the spirit of this motion.  I am proud to propose this motion.  If we support it, it would be a first step in an historic compromise that will help greatly towards peace on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very proud to second this motion on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  I should say at this stage that Senator Murphy and I and one or two other Independent Senators have ploughed a fairly lonely furrow on this issue for many years now.  It seems to me a source of great encouragement that, whereas this very issue before the McGimpsey case was voted on in its plain, stark, naked condition some time ago in the last Seanad, and we were defeated by, if my memory serves me right, 27 votes to three, with Fine Gael abstaining, that now for the first time we will have the main Opposition party and we will, without consultation, have the Progressive Democrats on board for this issue.  Senator Murphy is right when he says what we are starting here today is isolating Fianna Fáil as the only major party who can defend these absurd aggressive territorial claims and that the other parties in this House have now come to take the point of view which we have led them to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons I am proud to speak on this motion is that Mr. McGimpsey is a constituent of mine and Mr. McGimpsey represents the sort of modern Unionist whom I am proud to represent in this <Col N="723" /> House.  I see no shame in such representation here.  I am delighted that one of the benefits of being in this House and having Unionist constituents is that I have to and must keep in touch with their point of view almost weekly.  Those people have in the past day received an incredible knock to their attitude to the Republic as they see it.  Not only has the Taoiseach slammed the door on Articles 2 and 3 in the past day but also we have had a Surpeme Court judgment on extradition which they cannot comprehend and which I cannot comprehend either.</P>
    <P>It seems absurd that the Government here should come out &mdash; and I understand this happened this evening &mdash; in support of that decision by the Supreme Court. What is understood up there is that IRA men are once again &mdash; and I am not saying this now to be provocative; it is what is understood and I have checked this today &mdash; using the courts of this country to escape from justice which they would receive somewhere else.  That is the perception and I find it difficult not to say that is the reality.  What has happened is that people sentenced to long sentences for serious offences in the North and who have escaped have, because of legal niceties and political reasons, because they pleaded political offences, escaped the justice which they undoubtedly deserve. Nothing is more calculated to offend and alienate the Unionist mind.</P>
    <P>It is time the politicians here faced up not only to the fact that strange decisions are being made by courts here which cannot be understood outside the country, but also that Articles 2 and 3 are possibly the most divisive areas of our constitution and that there will be no friendly communication between the two parts of this island so long as they remain there.  I say this in the full knowledge that Fianna Fáil, the most Republican party or Nationalist party &mdash; I correct myself &mdash; in the traditional sense are the people who do not like the people of Northern Ireland very much, do not know the people of Northern Ireland very much and do not want to know the people of Northern Ireland very well or very much.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> Articles 2 and 3 as they stand at the moment &mdash; as Senator Murphy has said so much more eloquently than I can &mdash; are purely and simply territorial claims which are wheeled out at convenient times to rally the Republican backwoodsman in the party.  I am not sure that the leaders of Fianna Fáil really care terribly about this, but what they do use it for is quite simply as a call for annexation of Northern Ireland which unites the party when they are in difficulties. There is an old saying &mdash; I think it is from Henry IV &mdash; which is, if you want to unite your party you declare war on someone abroad.  It is quite simple.  If you can find the lowest common denominator, something like the fact that there is on our border a territory which we claim but which we cannot get, you just wheel it out that claim as a rallying cry at the right time, even if you do not believe it and even if you know it is not practical and it is not going to happen.</P>
    <P>We often say in this part of the country that the Unionist mentality is unrealistic because it is a siege mentality, because they are a small and as people say, almost an non-viable unit, that they are, as the Taoiseach is fond of saying, a failed entity.  That may or may not be true but it does not give us any right to annexation against their will.  Secondly, how can we blame them for having a siege mentality when we are constantly making threats against them amd claiming territory?  I suggest that the <i>sine qua non</i> for actually relieving that siege mentality is that we abolish this claim and take it out of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the governing party really want Northern Ireland.  They want the spectre of taking Northern Ireland over for domestic political reasons and the embodiment of that is Articles 2 and 3 in our Constitution.  I do not believe either that the governing party really want a united Ireland but they want to say they believe in a united Ireland because it is an old Fianna Fáil tribal war cry which keeps their backwoodsman happy.  If they were faced with a united Ireland in the morning they would not know what to do with it.  But they know what to do is to <Col N="725" /> threaten them with a united Ireland day and night when it is convenient.</P>
    <P>What I would suggest as the most constructive proposal &mdash; and I would be interested in what the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture passes on to the Minister, who I presume is going to reply next week on this &mdash; is that we have a referendum not only in the South on Articles 2 and 3 but that we had an all-Ireland referendum on unity and that all-Ireland referendum on unity should include as far as is possible a summary of the cost that it would be to the people of the Republic of Ireland, because I suggest that the people of the Republic of Ireland no longer care very much whether there is a united Ireland or not in the abstract.  I suggest it would be a very useful test to put to them if you spelled out the cost, because I have rarely seen Northern Ireland or a united Ireland or unity of any sort become an issue in a general election.  I know what people vote for in general elections &mdash; they vote for what will make them better off.  They do not vote for whether or not they want a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>I suggest that an all-Ireland referendum on unity itself, which would of course include the uncomfortable fact that it starts with one million people against the proposal, would be a very interesting exercise and it might not result in the outcome which would be anticipated.  I challenge the Government to think of doing this in consultation and in tandem with our Northern friends, or some of our friends in Northern Ireland, in order to see the sort of result we would get because if it were defeated, which it might well be, it would be very difficult for Fianna Fáil from what would then be a minority position to say &ldquo;We still want that territory up there.  It is ours by right&rdquo; if the majority of people in the North and South of Ireland have rejected it.</P>
    <P>I think it is in that context that we have to talk about and look at the Fianna Fáil attitude to Northern Ireland, and their record and their sincerity on it, because not only did they do a U-turn on the Anglo-Irish Agreement but also they now seem absolutely adamant in pursuing <Col N="726" /> the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Nothing was more opportunist than the Taoiseach's refusal to countenance the Anglo-Irish Agreement when he was in Opposition, but now he wishes to enforce it with more vigour than the Government at the time; and the reason he enforces it now is because it is a convenient vehicle for him for putting the boot into the Unionists.</P>
    <P>I have yet to hear Deputy Collins protest about the killings of UDR men, of RUC men or of anybody on the Unionist or Protestant side.  Why is it that he consistently calls for meetings of the Anglo-Irish Agreement when the killings and atrocities are committed on one particular side?  Nothing is more guaranteed to make us seen as partisan, one-sided, aggressive and enemies.  We have got to come off that particularly prejudiced Nationalist pedestal and we have got to come forward and call meetings of the Anglo-Irish Agreement about something which is not just simply a Nationalist issue.</P>
    <P>We should also consider the calls from the Unionist population for the suspension of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. At this stage there is no doubt whatsoever that that is the largest obstacle, and not only to talks.  It is the largest immediate obstacle to talks and to changing the Unionist attitude.  While that is intact, while Articles 2 and 3 are intact, while other noises are made and there is sabrerattling from the Republic, we will simply not be able to change their attitudes.</P>
    <P>I think as well we can do things down here, besides the abolition of Articles 2 and 3, which would prove or start to prove that we are serious about our fight against terrorism and about our need and our wish to live in friendship with the Unionists of Northern Ireland.  I think we should look again at the position of Sinn Féin in our society.  We should look at the position of Sinn Féin as a political party.  Senator Norris and others quite rightly recently picketed the Mansion House, because it was utterly abhorrent to them, as it is to me, that the Mansion House &mdash; Senator Murphy protested as well &mdash; was being used by killers and Provisional IRA men to hold a political <Col N="727" /> rally.  How does that look to people abroad?  How does that look to the propagandists overseas when we allow them to do this?  There they are, the Provisional IRA, parading in an official building and obviously getting the blessing of those who control it.  That is utterly wrong.</P>
    <P>I think we should go further.  Why should we allow those people who are preaching killing and hatred to sell books, to open shops, to have what they call community workshops, or even to exist as a political party?  As a society we have to take decisions on certain things as being right and being wrong within very broad democratic parameters.  One of those decisions, which I think we should have the courage to make, is that any political party that preaches the gospel of killing, slaughter and hate should be banned, that there should be no room for ambivalence about Sinn Féin and the IRA, Sinn Féin groups and community workshops &mdash; the whole lot &mdash; and those who masquerade under such banners should all be forbidden not only from broadcasting but from existing as a group.</P>
    <P>In addition, we should consider other areas which will prove not only our wish to combat terrorism but the fact that we were prepared to take concrete measures against it.  Like it or not, because of the Supreme Court decision yesterday and other such decisions, the UK and the Unionist population believe we are ambivalent towards the IRA.  It may be, if we continue to make decisions of that sort, that it will be necessary, not only for practical reasons and practical military reasons, to introduce internment North and South so that people like those who were released yesterday do not come out and mix as ordinary members of society when they are wanted in the North for appalling crimes.</P>
    <P>What we need to show is that not only will we abolish Articles 2 and 3 but that we will take the necessary measures to show that we are not ambivalent, that we do not keep Articles 2 and 3 in place which give legitimacy and encouragement to the Provisional IRA.  We need to show we care about the people <Col N="728" /> of Northern Ireland, that we do not necessarily want unity, but we want peace; and there is only one way of doing that and that is by joining together with them in taking the necessary domestic and internal measures which this motion encompasses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the motion, but before I do so I would like to welcome the Minister, Deputy Walsh. I regard him as an intelligent and capable Minister and it is no slight to me that he is here to take this motion.</P>
      <P>Articles 2 and 3 have been described as bombastic and unhelpful, but I do not think we would be debating this matter were it not for the recent Supreme Court decision.  There is no better way of refuting some of the arguments that have been made than by looking at that decision and some of the interpretations that were reached by the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>As Senators will remember, a case was brought by Christopher McGimpsey and Michael McGimpsey as plaintiffs against Ireland and others as defendants.  The essence of it was that the agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom made on 15 November 1985 &mdash; in other words, the Anglo-Irish Agreement &mdash; is contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. We need to look at the people who brought this case, these two brothers, both of whom were born in the Six Counties and who now live in the Six Counties.  In the course of his judgment, Judge Barrington described the political ambitions and activities of both the plaintiffs in the following words and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both plaintiffs are members of the Official Unionist Party in Northern Ireland.  Both are deeply concerned about the present state of Northern Ireland and of all Ireland.  Both reject any form of sectarianism and both have been involved in peace movements working to accommodate people of various traditions who live on the island of Ireland.  Both gave evidence before the New Ireland Forum and in oral and written submissions <Col N="729" /> attempted to explain to the Forum how the problem appeared to men fully committed to unionism but interested in finding a peaceful solution to the problem of Northern Ireland and of Ireland.  Both believe that the Anglo-Irish Agreement has aggravated the problem, instead of solving it the problem has become part of it.</P>
    <P>Having heard the expression of their opinions and their attitude to the problems with which the case is concerned, the judges acknowledged that they were both sincere.  However, had they succeeded in their claim, and to deal with some of the ways they tried to support this claim, it would have supported their own political agenda, indeed the agenda of many Unionist politicians.  First, they claim that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution were not compatible with the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It is worth looking at Articles 2 and 3 to see why they should not be removed.</P>
    <P>In his judgment Mr. Justice Finlay said:</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the statement that this national claim of unity exists, not in the legal but political order and as one of the rights which are envisaged in Article 2, necessarily means that the claim to the entire national territory is not a claim of legal right.</P>
    <P>That claim as you all know, according to Article 2 of the Constitution is &ldquo;the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and its territorial seas&rdquo;.  He went on to say that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution should be read with the Preamble and that he was satisfied that the true interpretation of these Constitutional provisions were as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  The reintegration of the national territory is a Constitutional imperative.</P>
    <P>Article 2 consists of a declaration of the extent of the national territory as a claim of legal right.</P>
    <P>Article 3 says:</P>
    <P>Pending the reintegration of the <Col N="730" /> national territory and without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory the laws enacted by that Parliament shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws of Saorstát Éireann and the like extra-territorial effect.</P>
    <P>He said in his judgment:</P>
    <P>The enactment of the laws in any greater area or extent of application or extra-territorial effect than the laws of Saorstát Éireann and this prohibits the enactment of laws applicable in the counties of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>He also said that the restriction imposed by Article 3 pending the reintegration of the national territory in no way derogates from the claim as a legal right to the entire national territory.</P>
    <P>The McGimpseys also claimed that there was inconsistency between the Agreement and Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Their main submission on this was that article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement states that the two Governments affirm that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland; (b) recognises that the present wish of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland is for no change in the status of Northern Ireland; (c) declares that if in the future a majority of the people of Northern Ireland wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, they will introduce and support in their respective parliaments' legislation to give effect to that wish.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Barrington said:</P>
    <P>It appears to me that in Article 1 of the Agreement the two Governments merely recognise the situation on the ground in Northern Ireland, from a political judgment about the likely course of future events and state what their policy will be should events evolve in a particular way.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Finlay said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> I find myself in agreement with this economical but precise analysis of the provisions of Article 1.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The learned trial judge then concluded that on any interpretation of the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution these provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement was not in any way inconsistent with either of those two Articles.</P>
    <P>With that conclusion I am in complete agreement.  There can be no doubt but that the only reasonable interpretation of Article 1, of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, taken in conjunction with the denial of derogation from the sovereignty contained in Article 2 (b) of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is that it constitutes a recognition of the <i>de facto</i> situation in Northern Ireland but does so expressly without abandoning the claim to the reintegration of the national territory.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Finley went on to say and I quote:</P>
    <P>In so far as they accept the concept of change and the <i>de facto</i> status of Northern Ireland as being something that would require the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland, these articles of the Agreement seem to me to be compatible with the obligations undertaken by the State in Article 29, 1 and 2 of the Constitution, whereby Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation and its adherence to the principles of the specific settlement of international disputes.</P>
    <P>Article 29 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>1.  Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.</P>
    <P>2.  Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> 3.  Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other states.</P>
    <P>The McGimpseys had another claim, which was, that the fettering of the power of Government to conduct external relations was in breach of Article 29 but that is not true because, as Mr. Justice Finlay pointed out, the framework contained in the Agreement and structures created by it provide a method of carrying out these activities, it can be argued, in a manner most likely to make them effective and acceptable, namely, constant mutual discussion.</P>
    <P>Article 2 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement sets out that the two Governments should deal on a regular basis with political matters, security and related matters, legal matters, including administration of justice, the promotion of cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Finlay goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The Government of Ireland at any time carrying out the functions which have been agreed under the Anglo-Irish Agreement is entirely free to do so in the manner in which it and it alone thinks most conducive to the achieving of the aims which it is committed to.  A procedure which is likely to lead to peaceable and friendly co-operation at any given time must surely be consistent with the constitutional position of the State that affirms its devotion, not only to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation, but to the ideal founded on international justice and morality.</P>
    <P>Again, the case was made that it in some was disregarded the interests of the majority community in Northern Ireland. I do not think there are any ground for that because, as Mr. Justice Finlay said, the suggestion that there has been any invidious treatment or any discrimination between the two communities in Northern Ireland by virtue of the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is not just true.</P>
    <P>One of the previous speakers said it was an aggressive territorial intent but <Col N="733" /> surely the aggressor is the person who occupies the territory at the moment, hardly the person who intends to occupy it or to re-unite it, as I would say.  It was said that Fianna Fáil were the only party out of step.  Yet, there is a large proportion of the Irish population who are continually out of step with us, nearly 50 per cent of the population in every election.  We do not have the following of some pseudo-intellectual left-wing west Brits but we do represent the decent people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the previous speakers attacked the Cardinal and made some reference to the Cardinal which is not true.  The record will show that it is not exactly what the Cardinal said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Another speaker referred to another decision that was recently made in reference to extradition.  People whom I have heard in this House and the other House and indeed in public giving out about British justice that allows cases like the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Winchester Three and allows torture to be used in Northern Ireland should be satisfied now because two people have not been extradited to British jurisdiction or a jurisdiction under British control.  That is not the way some people look at these things.</P>
      <P>Somebody said that the Taoiseach was stubborn.  How could the Taoiseach be stubborn?  We have only to look at some of the comments he made yesterday in reply to questions in the Dáil.  He said:</P>
      <P>I would like to repeat my statement, that I made at the time of the New Ireland Forum, that was, that if we had a situation where both parts of Ireland could be brought together in some way it would certainly call for an entirely new Constitution.</P>
      <P>That is hardly stubborness.  Again he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it will be necessary to bring forward an entirely new Constitution <Col N="734" /> in the context of unity or some other arrangements.</P>
    <P>That is hardly the comment of a stubborn man.  Finally, he said:</P>
    <P>My invitation to the representatives of the Unionist tradition is permanently on the table to discuss anything at all that they would discuss with me.</P>
    <P>That is hardly the comment of a stubborn, unhelpful man.  In fact, he has been more than open in his dealings with people and willing to receive them at any time.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the final statement on Mr. Justice Finaly's judgment:</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that all the grounds of the appeal brought by the plaintiffs must fail.  I come to the conclusion from an analysis of each of the submissions that have been made both in the High Court and in this court.  I would also point out, however, that there is, looking at the Anglo-Irish Agreement in its totality, looking at the entire scheme and thrust of the Constitution of Ireland, a high improbability that a clear attempt to resolve the position with regard to the reintegration of the national territory and the position of Northern Ireland by a process of consultation, discussion and reasoned arguments, structured by constant communication between servants of each of the two States concerned could ever be inconsistent with a Constitution devoted to the ideals of ordered, peaceful international relations.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this appeal failed and the two Articles of the Constitution stand.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement stands.  The Government are determined to pursue the reunification of Ireland by peaceful means and I do not think the existence of either of these Articles of the Constitution in any way inhabits that process.  The Taoiseach is open in his attempts to reunify the country by peaceful means and, as he has said and I will repeat before I finish, he is at all times willing to meet with the Unionists and <Col N="735" /> to discuss anything they wish to discuss. Nobody could be more clear in his aspirations than that.  Nobody could be more clear in his statements than that.</P>
    <P>I hope the motion will fail because I see nothing wrong in trying to reunify a country.  It has been an aspiration and I am glad to see it is now legal.  That is the way in which I have always thought of it.  The Taoiseach said something similar yesterday.  I see nothing wrong with that. What should be wrong with looking for a united Ireland or a reunited Ireland? Nothing.  This is what got us our freedom in the first place &mdash; the part that is free &mdash; and if we continue holding out the hand of friendship, as we do in a peaceful manner, then perhaps we can achieve this in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I compliment Senator Murphy especially on his opening speech here this evening.  It was an extremely courageous, generous and thoughtful speech and it has put the problem we face into fairly clear focus.  I would also like to congratulate Senator Ross on his contribution although I would not agree with everything he said.</P>
      <P>In relation to his opening remarks when he said that Senator Murphy and himself especially on this issue over the past number of years have been ploughing a very lonely furrow that to a certain extent is true but I do not think at the beginning of this debate I have to put the Fine Gael credentials on Northern Ireland on the record.  Of all parties in the Republic we certainly have sought to discover and isolate the underlying causes of the problem on this island and of all parties we have sought to bring together groups, especially groups within Northern Ireland, and have sought to put before the body politic new and at times radical structures for tackling the problem. One can go right down through the years from Sunningdale, which perhaps is one of a number of great lost opportunities in the history of this island, to the New Ireland Forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes when I hear Fianna Fáil Senators quoting the Taoiseach on the <Col N="736" /> New Ireland Forum as somebody who was a member of the Forum, I have to take some of that with a pinch of salt because what the Taoiseach tried to do with the New Ireland Forum was to hijack it; what he tried to do was to impose on the agreed findings that the only solution was a unitary State.  He did that blatantly at the end of the workings of the New Ireland Forum.  He did not get away with it but he almost did.</P>
    <P>Again, when I hear the great reverence about the Anglo-Irish Agreement from the far side I have to put on the record that the Tánaiste was despatched to the US before the agreement was signed to try to persuade leading members of the American Congrees not to support the Anglo-Irish Agreement and we were told then that it was copperfastening Partition. I am not saying this out of any bitterness.  I am saying it simply because Fianna Fáil on Northern Ireland cannot be trusted.  Fianna Fáil on Northern Ireland speak with forked tongues and what is said at the Cumann meeting, at the comhairle ceanntair, is not what is said in the Dáil Chamber, or in the Dáil Chamber when the party are in Government. I could spend all of my short time this evening talking about the way in which the party opposite tried to sabotage the Anglo-Irish Agreement, tried to misrepresent it and now we are told that this is the cornerstone of Government policy.</P>
    <P>Again, I recall what Fine Gael did in an attempt to move towards a greater understanding, while making the country more acceptable.  It was Fine Gael who brought in the divorce referendum.  It was unsuccessful.  It was Garret FitzGerald who launched the constitutional crusade. Senator Ross has been a courageous speaker on many issues but there has been very major political movement in all political parties except Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Indeed, if you were to look at the party from which I find myself at the greatest distance in this House &mdash; The Workers' Party &mdash; they, too, have grappled very painfully with their own colourful past. They have through hard analysis come to views on Northern Ireland which are fundamentally different from what they <Col N="737" /> held in their early stages and for that I must give them full credit.  It appears the only party who have not changed in their attitude to Northern Ireland have been the Government party.  I am interested tonight and I applaud the Progressive Democrats on their decision as I believe, to support the motion here this evening.</P>
    <P>I will come to the central part of the motion, which is, the place of Articles 2 and 3 in our Constitution especially since the outcome of the McGimpsey case.  I think the case for the removal of Articles 2 and 3 hardly has to be made; it has been made very effectively by Senator Murphy.  If we go back to the enactment of Articles 2 and 3 in 1936-37 when the Constitution was been enacted, the most benevolent interpretation one could put on their presence there was that they expressed an aspiration for some sort of Irish unity wherein the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland would, in some great flash of light, be converted to a belief that their destiny lay best in a sense converting to green republicanism and we would have one green republican Ireland.  The subtlety of analysis which now at least allows us to define two separate traditions each with an equal right to its own aspirations and to co-exist was not very evident in 1936 and 1937.</P>
    <P>When W.T. Cosgrave said, as quoted by Senator Murphy this evening that this was a case of make-belief, that it meant nothing, he was simply expressing a truth which had it been grasped then might have saved a great deal of trouble in the years subsequently.  It was Cosgrave back in the 1920s who said that there was no way in which we could ever bomb or shoot a million Unionists into Irish unity and that the only way we could every hope to persuade them that Irish unity was worthwhile was by building up a State here which was a model of what a small civilised State should be in terms of economic and social development.  Again, if only his own party and other had been able to follow that piece of advice as given then.  At best, in 1936-37, the benign aspiration meant that the Unionists would be expected to submerge their identify.</P>
    <P>I accept, and all of us must accept, that the presence of Articles 2 and 3 can <Col N="738" /> represent a very malign scenario as far as even moderate Unionists are concerned. Senator Murphy mentioned Ken Maginnis who is a very close friend of mine and is one of the Unionist politicians who has worked tirelessly to engender good relations with politicians and people in this part of the country.  He has travelled to all parts to speak at meetings and so forth, not in any sleveen way, to say that things are different but he has taken us sufficiently serious to come and tell us the truth, to tell us how he as I think a reasonable, moderate, honest, authentic Ulster Unionist, sees our politics and the way in which things could develop.  He has told me, as I am sure he has told everybody else, that Articles 2 and 3 are seen by him and by his people as constituting a threat to him and to his people. We talk about the round table and listening to everybody and all approaches being open but surely we have to take seriously what people of the calibre of Ken Maginnis, the McGimpseys, Mr. Ferguson and other moderate Unionists who have shown consistent goodwill towards us over the years, are saying.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy pointed up the sort of the wink and the nod approach to Articles 2 and 3 that even if they are there, they do not mean anything anyway and they could go on the day.  A constitution is a very serious business.  Articles 2 and 3 are very explicit as to what they mean and given the strong evidence that well-meaning Protestants and Unionists see Articles 2 and 3 as constituting a threat, then we should take them at their face value, believe what they say and, indeed, act on it.</P>
    <P>Again, Senator Murphy referred to the failed opportunity of the all-party committee in 1967.  If we look at Sunningdale as a great lost opportunity, so too was the failure of politicians here to grasp the challenges of that all party committee to go ahead and do what is proposed there on Articles 2 and 3, and indeed, imperfect as it was to go ahead and seek to implement the proposals there on marriage. But, again, that was failed opportunity.</P>
    <P>I have concerns about how we would in a practical sense go about giving effect to the removal of Articles 2 and 3.  Having <Col N="739" /> been through two very bruising referendums I certainly would be loath to embark on that process without a great deal of thought and preparation.  Having perhaps been one of the people most involved in my own party in the divorce referendum, I am now very firmly of the view that it is unwise to get into a referendum without a fair deal of knowledge that one will be successful.  I have a feeling that a referendum at this stage on Articles 2 and 3 could let loose all sorts of ghosts around the political countryside maybe living ghosts like Paddy Ryan and the 30,000 votes he conjured up in Munster.  Was this a sneaking regard to vote for the Provos?  Was it just having a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at England?  Was it simply some sort of sympathy for the underdog?  I do not know.  We have seen and we know enough about the darker side of our society to know that a referendum campaign can unleash some very nasty and vicious elements into the political ether. I would be slow but nonetheless if the people of the Twenty-six Counties decided that they wanted to keep Articles 2 and 3, then so be it.  Then we should simply stop talking to the Unionists in Northern Ireland, accept that we are a partitionist State and get on with our business.  My own view, in fact, is that if there were a campaign on Articles 2 and 3 it probably would succeed even if Fianna Fáil, as is its wont in referenda, were to sit on the fence and play whichever side would most embarrass the other parties. I believe that in the country as a whole there is now a growing view that Articles 2 and 3 represent nothing, constitute a threat and that fair-minded people would care very little if they were removed and it would be seen as a gesture towards genuine progress in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wonder, as well, if Articles 2 and 3 really are as central to progress at the present time perhaps as has been represented by the proposers of this motion this evening.  We had a chance a few years ago on the question of the divorce referendum to put to test our willingness to change, to look after minorities then. Senator Murphy quoted the Cardinal and I think he was right to quote the Cardinal. <Col N="740" /> Whatever flexibility is shown by the Cardinal now, and I am not sure what is being said by the Cardinal now, was certainly not evident during the time of the divorce referendum.  Certainly, during that time when we turned a major moral question into a discussion of property rights &mdash; and that is what it became &mdash; we did ourselves very little credit.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of our Constitution and of our law which perhaps might be an even clearer signal that we are prepared to change.  I suspect especially in the context of the present day, that a serious attempt to tackle the problem surrounding extradition would be the clearest signal of all to the Unionists of Northern Ireland that we are serious, that we are people of our word, that we mean what we say.  It is inconceivable to most fair-minded people that in over a period of 15 years two sovereign Governments have not been able to get right a system which guarantees proper extradition, with proper safeguards of people who are wanted to face charges in another friendly jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>There is not much point in our saying, as I have said and many others have said frequently in the past, that the fault has lain with the British, their inability to process warrants correctly, their sloppiness in delivery, their frequent arrogance in not making the attempts to understand our legal system.  All of those things have been said and all at their time were valid.  It beggars description to think that at the present time two sovereign Governments cannot get their act together, get the thing working properly, on an issue which is simply a matter of straightforward international law.  If we want to show a gesture, that perhaps is where we could start.</P>
    <P>Again I come back in my closing remarks to say how much I appreciate the words of Senator Murphy tonight but I also say that the only way in which we can persuade the Unionists of Northern Ireland that we are serious is by deeds not by words.  There are areas where we can do things which will show we are serious.  I also believe &mdash; I will not have time to develop this &mdash; that perhaps the best thing we can do if we want to see progress in Northern Ireland is to put <Col N="741" /> pressure on the parties in Northern Ireland to work towards some form of devolved government, to try to begin the process whereby parties will begin to talk to each other in a meaningful way.  I do not think I am alone down here in feeling that none of the parties are making sufficient efforts in this regard.  In the Unionist Party there is a veto which Ian Paisley holds; there is the unwillingness of Mr. Molyneaux to really get involved.  He almost seems to be happy with the <i>status quo</i>.  On the SDLP side, I personally would like to see a great deal more movement, a great deal more evidence of serious intent in talking to the other parties. While I support Senator Murphy, while I would like to see a great deal of movement in other areas I think the most useful thing we can do is to try to put pressure on our friends in the various parties in Northern Ireland or those inside and outside politics to move towards the position where the parties will at least start talking to each other in a move towards devolution.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael will certainly support this motion this evening.  I would like once again to congratulate Professor Murphy and Senator Ross on the timing and wording of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Progressive Democrats were established just over four years ago, a key aim was the desire to bring new realism and maturity into political debate in this country at every level and on every issue.  That desire for realism and maturity is particularly keenly felt where the problem of Northern Ireland is concerned.  The very act of our formation signalled the desire of a significant group of people in the Republic to turn their backs on the catchcries and empty rhetoric which for too long had passed as an acceptable policy on the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate on the constitutional claim to Northern Ireland touches the very heart of our attitudes to its problems.  Each one of us in this country shares responsibility for events in the North. This island is too small and the problems of the North too tied up with the politics of the Republic for us to seek to claim <Col N="742" /> ignorance or indifference about what happens in that small province.  Each and everyone of us must examine our conscience as to these terrible problems, our role in them and any possible contributions which we could make to their alleviation.</P>
    <P>The majority of people in this country have now spent a great part of their daily lives living in the shadow of death and destruction only 60 miles from this House.  We cannot get away from the fact that the Sinn Féin IRA movement seek, in part, to legitimate their murder campaign by claiming that they are seeking to reunite this country as per Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Their's is a campaign which seeks to bludgeon one million Unionists against their will into a united Ireland.  That has to be the essential backdrop against which any debate about Articles 2 and 3 of the 1937 Constitution must be conducted.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that for the vast majority of Nationalists, both in the Republic and in Northern Ireland, that territorial claim expressed in those Articles amounts to nothing other than a deeply-felt aspiration to see the two parts of this island united at some stage by peaceful means.  Indeed, if we could simply regard Articles 2 and 3 in that light they would be a matter of little concern, but it is precisely because they play an important role affecting matters of life or death on this island that we cannot be indifferent to their effect.</P>
    <P>Why are they so important?  I want to give two good reasons why this is so. First, as I have already indicated, they can be invoked, however mistakingly or maliciously, to seek to justify the IRA murder campaign.  To the extent that Articles 2 and 3 can give even a scintilla of comfort or endorsement to the IRA, we simply must re-examine them.  Secondly, it is quite obvious that these Articles of our Constitution give offence to the Unionist community on this island. However much we protest that they are misguided in this view, the fact is that the Unionist community regard the territorial claim in our 1937 Constitution as a desire to annex or dominate them and to force their absorption into a United Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> I am not concerned here with the stance of extreme Unionist politicians, like the Rev.  Ian Paisley who would always tend to find fault with things in the Republic.  However, when responsible moderate Unionists voices like those already mentioned by Senator Murphy and by Senator Manning, of Ken Maginnis and the former General Secretary of the Official Unionist Party, Frank Miller, plead for changes in these Articles, we must take them seriously, if all of our rhetoric about being sensitive to the Unionist case is to have any meaning whatsoever.  To this extent it is obvious that last week's Supreme Court declaration that Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution constitute a legal claim on the North does, understandably, heighten Unionist fears and objections no matter how much we might contest to the contrary.</P>
    <P>It was precisely to address such concerns and to face up to the practicalities of North-South relations, rather than continue to take refuge in the verbal republicanism that has so dogged the debate on Irish unity, that the Progressive Democrats proposed a redefinition of Articles 2 and 3 in January 1988 as part of a new draft constitution for the Republic. I would like to state to this House the precise wording on this matter which the Progressive Democrats favour:</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland hereby proclaim their firm will that the national territory, which consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and territorial seas, be reunited in harmony and by consent.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely nothing wrong in aspiring towards unity.  We do.  This is a clear expression of an aspiration towards unity to be achieved by consent, which words also acknowledge the agreement between the Governments of the Republic and the United Kingdom in Article 1 of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.  That agreement makes it explicitly the policy of both Governments that Irish unity, if it is ever to be achieved, can only take place with the agreement and consent of the Unionist community.</P>
    <P>Clearly the challenge posed by the <Col N="744" /> Anglo-Irish Agreement for all Irish Nationalists is to work for and to win the consent of the Unionist community for new constitutional arrangements on this island, which most of us would wish to correspond with some form of Irish unity. Obviously you cannot win that consent or even to pretend to be serious about working for it if you steadfastly refuse to take on board or entertain one of the most fundamental Unionist reservations about the Republic's attitude to them. Clearly our credibility and credentials, so far as reaching accommodation with the Unionists is concerned, are on the line here.  Are we serious about trying to address their fears or are we to remain deaf to them?</P>
    <P>Of course, the question of constitutional reform in this Republic is a subject wider than the form and intent of Articles 2 and 3.  It is the view of the Progressive Democrats that we need an entirely new Constitution and not merely for some form of unity between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  We need a new Constitution for this Republic to reflect fundamental rights for our own people. To this end, in January 1988 the Progressive Democrats, uniquely among the political parties in the Republic, published a complete draft constitution for this country.  It is clear that we would prefer complete, rather than piecemeal, reform of the Constitution.  In so far as this debate questions our credentials on the specific issue of Articles 2 and 3, I emphasise that we favour redrawing them.  I would remind this House, however, that the idea of such a redrawing is neither new nor revolutionary.  We have already been reminded about this to some extent.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that as long ago as 1967 the Oireachtas All Party Committee on the Constitution, which included my colleagues in the Progressive Democrats, the Minister for Energy, concluded that the present wording was defective and proposed that the Articles be redrawn.  Indeed, our own proposed wording draws heavily on the proposal of that committee for both its wording and logic.  If there was such agreement on the need for redrawing then in what were far more peaceful times, can we not now, <Col N="745" /> after all the turmoil, horror and tragedy of the past 20 years, see the need for such changes much more clearly now?</P>

      <P>I understand.  I welcome the opportunity to speak which I had really given up hope of doing.  I have just a few points to make, the first being to refer to something Senator Murphy said in his learned contribution, that was that the ground had now been cut away from those of us who favoured a gradualist approach.  This is perfectly true.  I would like to take this opportunity to serve notice on Seanad Éireann that I hereby withdraw Item No. 38 from the supplementary Order Paper in the name of myself, Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator Carmencita Hederman, which reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann urges the Government to hold a referendum with the intention of adding after Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution the following words: &ldquo;that in any attempt to realise this aspiration the use of force shall be prohibited&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Persons like myself of a moderate disposition in the South who have consistently struggled against the use of force now find themselves isolated and now find that our position of moving gradually towards the position of good neighbourliness has been completely eroded.</P>

      <P>I believe it inappropriate for people in the South to presume to speak on behalf of the majority.  This occurred from the Government benches this evening, regrettably.  It is also regretable, in my opinion, that phrases such as &ldquo;west Brit&rdquo; were used this evening.  I do not consider this to be helpful.  I would like to ask the House in what sense is it good neighbourliness to make such an aggressive claim?  Let nobody be under any misapprehension, this, as a result of the McGimpsey judgment, has been clearly demonstrated in the Supreme Court to be a direct, aggressive, territorial claim upon a section of the island.</P>
      <P>I would like to suggest that, if this referendum is held, it be held throughout the 32 counties of this island and that it does not just take into account the wishes of the people living south of the Border. This suggestion, which is unlikely to be taken up, exposes the very real fraudulence of our claim.  We do not actually believe, nor have any Government ever attempted to implement the real ramifications of this territorial claim.  May I remind the House of very simple elementary things such as the customs provisions? If the Government were really serious they would not engage in the kind of antics they do with regard to sustaining tariff barriers against a section of the country which they believe they have jurisdiction over.  It is these precise forms of fraudulence and of dishonesty that must be combated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sufficient knowledge of, and respect for, the Unionist tradition in the North not to take a simplistic view of it and not to believe, as some people purport to, that by dosing in a million unwilling extra citizens into this country who happen to come from a different religious <Col N="747" /> background that we will automatically create a pluralist society in the South. The obligation on us is far different &mdash; not to be threatening, not to be coercive, not to be bad neighbours, but to be good neighbours, if you will, to seduce our Northern colleagues into joining with us in a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>For that reason I believe that it is very important we recognise that after the McGimpsey judgment it is no longer possible to pussyfoot with regard to this question of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  I very much regret that this is the case, because I was always someone who believed that it was possible, that it was helpful, to be moderate, to move towards a situation which would be attractive to the people in the North of Ireland.  This clearly is not the case in the light of this judgment.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to judgments in the Supreme Court in other matters, particularly in relation to extradition. It would not be appropriate for me to comment in any great depth upon the learned judges of the Supreme Court but I could not help but notice that one of the judges in a section of his judgment, in which he was not fully joined by the other judges in this extradition case, invoked, among other things, the European. Convention on Human Rights, although that very same court ruled out the European Convention on Human Rights as being a persuasive argument in a case in which I was involved.  The restatement by the Taoiseach of the hard line position with regard to Articles 2 and 3 in the Dáil yesterday was less than helpful when taken in conjunction with the Supreme Court judgment on extradition and with the general context within which this debate must take place.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in unexpectedly being afforded the opportunity to strongly second this motion.  I would like to conclude simply by pointing out that it is of interest that Seanad Éireann provides an opportunity for Members of a minority tradition to speak and that those Members have spoken in this debate and have spoken in favour of the abolition of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  If Senators are serious about listening to <Col N="748" /> the voices of minorities, they should start listening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes some adjustment to get down from those Olympian heights.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this topic today.  The topic I am drawing to the Ministers attention to tonight concerns a decision taken in the Ordnance Survey by the management there to withdraw a substantial section of the field staff employed in the Ordnance Survey Office.  The position is that the field staff <i>in toto</i> number approximately 130.  They are involved in collecting data for the Ordnance Survey and are employed in many parts of the country.  These people have been working and living in rural communities for up to 25 years and because of this decision they must move themselves and their families to Dublin.  Apparently this move has been made without any real consultation with the staff.  More specifically, of approximately 90 field staff who are outside the Dublin area it is proposed to bring 40 of those back to Dublin over 12 months and eventually to bring the rest back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why this is being done is to <Col N="750" /> work on a new tourist map, on a scale of 1:50,000, about the necessity for which and the desirability of which there is no question.  In fact, riding a favourite hobby horse of my own, I am very glad to see the 1:50,000 map being promoted because it concerns tourism and a new and desirable aspect of tourism &mdash; walking, hillside climbing and so on.  There is no doubt about the desirability of the work being undertaken here.  The point is that it is being done at the expense of an equally, if not more desirable, aspect of the work of the Ordnance Survey, namely, that there should be field staff throughout the country, that they should be there as regional staff rather than concentrated in headquarters.  Also, what is a matter of concern is that this proposed work on the 1:50,000 map may very well be promoted at the expense of the very important work of revising and updating the 1:2,500 series of maps.  The importance of these maps of course, from the point of view of county council, engineers, planners, the legal profession, valuers, the Land Registry, etc. is that these 1:2,500 maps, which show the country areas in great detail, are absolutely essential.  They need to be brought up to date, they need major revision and the Ordnance Survey need major resources to deal with this.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about conflicting interests with limited staff.  As a measure of dealing with this problem the management of the Ordnance Survey have, as it were, concentrated on the 1:50,000 work and to that end have ordered staff back to Dublin.  There is great discontent among the Ordnance Survey staff at this decision.  Indeed, the Minister will be aware of the fact that their union, the UPTCS, have put forward in some detail a proposal for a regionalisation structure which would maintain staff in their present rural locations.</P>
    <P>One of the points difficult to understand is why in this age of computerisation and high technology communication it should be necessary for such staff to be concentrated in headquarters, particularly as it is sociologically very important that such staff should remain in rural Ireland and small towns in Ireland where they have daily contacts with county councillors, local <Col N="751" /> officials and so on.  It is vitally important from that point of view that these staff should be retained locally, that they should have these contacts locally.  Surely the technology is such that this does not preclude them from doing the vitally important work on the maps from their regional areas.</P>
    <P>The document submitted by the union, the UPTCS, goes into all this in considerable and, in my view, very convincing detail.  They balance the likely costings involved in bringing staff into Dublin, providing accommodation for them and so on, against the savings that would be effected by encouraging a regional development where, for example, there would be many local offices available to them at a nominal rent instead of having to provide new and costly accommodation.  The costings have been done and the arguments for setting up a regional structure seem to me to be conclusive.  I suppose more staff are needed &mdash; that is one of the basic things &mdash; but I stress that one of the great principles of Government policy in the European community context is regionalisation and decentralisation.  This is a vital and mainstream policy.  But it does not seem it is being adhered to in this case if management are allowed to implement their decision.</P>
    <P>Another cause of unease is, as I said already, that there has been little or no consultation &mdash; only dictation I understand &mdash; with the union about this move, which has such radical implications for their lives and careers and wider implications for the good health of local services. There is the general feeling that the Ordnance Survey are at odds in this matter with the rest of the public service, that there is a more dictatorial attitude in the Ordnance Survey than obtains elsewhere in the public service.  It may well be that this is so because of the military type legacy that pervades the Ordnance Survey for historical reasons and that this is at odds with more modern style systems of consultation.  There are a number of issues here which deserve serous consideration. I look forward very much to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to outline for this House the current position of the Ordnance Survey Office.  The basic objective in today's climate for the Ordnance Survey is to supply a product &mdash; mapping &mdash; to meet the demands of the marketplace.  In meeting this demand regard must be had to commercial realities.  One of those realities is that the funds allocated by the State must be expended in the most cost effective and productive manner; another is that the needs of the market must be supplied; and yet another critical one is that consumers of the products supplied by the Ordnance Survey must be prepared to pay for that product.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the Survey spends about £6 million a year, apart from capital investment, but it effectively earns only about £2 million a year in revenue from all sources.  So we have a business supplying a product at an annual loss of some £4 million a year.  On top of that about £1.5 million is being spent in the current year on capital investment. Against this background, it was necessary to review the operation of the Survey and a very careful and detailed review has taken place.</P>
      <P>There were two principal questions to be answered.  Was the Survey producing the products the market wanted; and, is production handled in the most economical and cost effective way?  The first point was the question of the products. For a start it is acknowledged by everyone that the availability of mapping is essential to virtually every facet of society.  To name but a few, the planners of infrastructural services &mdash; roads, water supplies, sewerage piping, electricity, telephones &mdash; all require basic maps on which to base their activities.  Business and individual users need maps on which records of their property can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having accepted the <i>prima facie</i> need for mapping, the next thing was to look at the products.  One of the main products is the 1:1,000 which is the basic map of the city and urban areas, including small towns.  This programme has been the major priority of the Survey &mdash; it involves expenditures of roughly £2 million a year <Col N="753" /> and income generated is less than £1 million. The present position is that the programme is more or less fully up to date in that almost all urban areas are mapped and are under what is called continuous revision.  The review accepted that the maintenance of this programme on an up-to-date basis deserved to be accorded top priority, given the complexity and sheer scale of private, commercial and public development which exists in the areas covered by it.</P>
    <P>Another product is the 1:2,500, which deals with the rural areas.  This costs about £3.5 million a year to run, but only generates about £0.5 million in income, so the loss is running at £3 million a year.  The present position is that the programme is not up to date; and, if the manner in which it was being produced were to continue unchanged and the resources allocated to it were maintained, the programme would never be finished.  Once an area is remapped it is then kept under revision and as the years progress more staff would be concentrating on revision and fewer and fewer on remapping, so the programme would grind to a halt.  From the market viewpoint, there is a need for mapping for property transaction purposes.  The needs of other users such as planners and researchers need to be taken into account, but the scale of maps they need differs substantially from those of property owners.  All in all, the position of this programme from a financial point of view and from the consumer end is less than satisfactory, to say the least.</P>
    <P>Another product is what is called small scale mapping which is basically aimed at the tourist market.  Any mapping in this area is extremely old and does not meet the needs of the market.  Critical to this area is the 1:50,000, which is the standard local tourist map in most countries.  Prior to the commencement of the review, the Survey had produced none of these and this was a matter of considerable concern as the product is an essential tool for walking and rambling holidays.  Senators will be aware that the Government have set very ambitious targets for the entire tourist industry.  This particular segment of the market already generates some £60 million revenue a year and Bord Fáilte <Col N="754" /> are targeting a 15 per cent per annum growth in this for the next few years.  The non-availability of the 1:50,000 series would impede the achievement of these targets.  In addition to tourist interests, the security services require maps of various scales for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <P>Having considered these various needs, it was decided that a 1:50,000 series of maps should be produced as a matter of urgency.  It will be possible to derive other products at different scales from this basic map at a later date.  To date three provisional maps have been produced &mdash; the MacGillicuddy Reeks, the Slieve Blooms and the Wicklow mountains and I have copies of these here if any Senator would like to see them.</P>
    <P>This brings us on to the question of how maps should be produced.  Until recently maps were produced completely by field observation and the results were manually compiled and stored in the Survey's head office in the Phoenix Park.  Over the last number of years, technological progress has allowed for the field results to be translated digitally by computer into map form.  The 1:50,000 series that I have just mentioned is produced by way of extremely expensive and complicated machinery which translates aerial surveys into stored data in the computer, so field work is reduced to a minimum.  In addition to this, the pace of technological progress in the whole area is so rapid now that the whole prodedure for producing the other mapping products &mdash; the large-scale urban and rural maps&mdash;will change dramatically.  Much of the basic work can be done by the use of imagery, consisting of both aerial photography and of satellite data, for compiling the basic product, with the result that the need to have personnel laboriously observing and measuring data in the field will be dramatically reduced.</P>
    <P>Taking account of all that, the Ordnance Survey was asked in 1989 to: maintain the urban mapping programme on an up to date basis; accelerate the production of the 1:50,000 series so as to produce 30 maps within the next three years tackling the priority needs identified by Bord Fáilte and the security services first; to continue the 1:2,500 rural series subject to further review in <Col N="755" /> the current year in the light of field trials on the application of modern technology to establish what improvements in productivity are possible.</P>
    <P>In addition, the first stage in a three year programme to upgrade the computer capacity of the survey and to provide the latest technology was put in place in the current year with an allocation of £1.5 million for capital investment in this whole area.  The manner in which these various requirements were implemented was a matter which was left to the local management in the Ordnance Survey.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of staff transfers.  About 15 staff were transferred from areas near Dublin back to headquarters to deal with a logjam in the normal production chain of translating field data into the final product.  These staff were mainly living in the Dublin area and working down from there.</P>
    <P>As I indicated already, production of the 1:50,000 series is virtually entirely desk based.  Because of this, the management proposed to move 25 staff from field work to headquarters.  A problem then arose because some of these officers, despite being required to make themselves available for transfer if and when required, expressed unwillingness to move.  They also maintained that if they were to move, they would have to be paid removal expenses.  At this point I should mention that staff on field work get the benefit of generous field allowances. These allowances are, in part, intended to compensate field officers for the liability to move to different work locations from time to time.  Also, staff in receipt <Col N="756" /> of field allowances are not entitled to field allowances on returning to Dublin.</P>
    <P>In order to minimise the disruptive effects on staff and on the work of the Survey, the Minister has asked his officials to explore whether there is any way that the 1:50,000 series can be produced without returning staff to Dublin. Initial indications are that if a few small regional offices were established and the staff concerned were headquartered in these locations, the moves to Dublin might be avoided and many of the staff would be able to travel from their existing homes to these locations.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 1:50,000 series there is also the consideration that changes in technology will probably lead very quickly to a situation where the need to have the remaining 65 staff operating in the field will be significantly reduced.</P>
    <P>In the light of all this I have asked the management of the Survey to produce a detailed report on the possibilities on this front by the end of April at the latest and to put the matter of the transfers on hold until this report is considered.  This will, of course, be a matter for further discussion between the staff representatives and the management in the Survey.</P>
    <P>The Minister looks forward to the results of this exercise.</P>

      <P>I welcome very much the indication that there is recognition of a problem here and that the Minister agrees no purpose will be served by any discontent in such a vital service that affects tourism and local government. I would like to thank the Minister.</P>
