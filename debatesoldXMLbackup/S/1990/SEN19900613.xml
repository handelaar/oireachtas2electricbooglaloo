      <P>I have notice from Senator Hugh Byrne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to take immediate action in view of the increasing problem created by the Spanish flag of convenience vessels ramming Irish trawlers off the south and west coasts.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ó Cuív of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Energy to outline what plans he has for the development of further timber pulp users to ensure adequate outlets for the residents of timber mills which are vital to their viability.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Tom Hussey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to consider Tuam, County Galway, as a location for a Government Department as part of decentralisation scheme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice <Col N="934" /> to alleviate the enormous delays and the deteriorating position in the Land Registry, and to make a statement on the future efficiency of the registry.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Paddy McGowan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The progress of the Foyle Fisheries Commission in dealing with pollution in the River Foyle.</P>
    <P>I regard the matter raised by Senators Byrne, Ó Cuív, Hussey and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matter raised by Senator Byrne and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Ó Cuív, Hussey and Neville may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matter raised by Senator McGowan is not suitable for the Adjournment on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take items Nos. 1 and 2.  It is hoped to take all stages of the Turf Development Bill, 1988, if possible.  That will be followed at 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m. by the Labour Party motion, item No. 100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, could the Leader of the House clarify something for me?  It had been my impression that item No. 3 had been ordered for today, if that were possible. That can, perhaps, be clarified between the Whips.  Could the Leader of the House find out for us whether the Government intend to bring the Broadcasting Bill to this House before the summer recess?  I strongly urge him to advise the Government that this is legislation that could well do with being left in abeyance for the period of the summer recess when, perhaps, cooler heads and reason can prevail.  I would be grateful if he could let us know the Government's intention in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like the Leader of the House to note the publication yesterday <Col N="935" /> of the report of Combat Poverty on marriage breakdown in this country and the appalling picture it paints.  I would like to ask for an early debate on this report, especially in view of the very many promises of reform which were made by his party during the recent divorce referendum and of the fact that none of these promises has been put into effect. I ask that that report be given priority for debate in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that statements will be made in the Dáil on the six months Presidency of Europe and other EC matters.  I think we should be given the same information directly as the other House about everything concerning our nation.  I ask the Leader of the House to ensure that this House gets the same information directly as Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of legislation between now and the summer, it appears there is a great deal of legislation going through the other House at the moment.  It is being put in and withdrawn at such a rate that it is hard to recognise at this stage what is likely to be proposed one day and passed the next day.  One clear point that emerges is the need to have a programme of legislation initiated in this House.  On the Independent benches we get the impression that this Government do not seem to trust this House with the initiation of legislation because there certainly seems to be a lack of legislation being initiated here at the moment.  I would ask the Leader of the House to look into that matter.</P>
      <P>I would also remind the Leader of the House for the third week in a row, that I have asked him &mdash; and I presume he has an answer for me this time &mdash; about the response of the Minister for Education to the introduction of the Bill which will seek to remove the discrimination against girls from full participation in secondary education under the Secondary Education Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also ask the Leader of the House if he would consider putting down, very shortly for discussion in the House <Col N="936" /> the question of cross-Border communications. Just this week, Northern Ireland Railways reported a £1 million loss because of disruptions to the rail link and we can assume Iarnród Éireann had the same problems.  There are other communications as well.  I do not want to make a speech on it but I am just asking that the matter be considered for discussion next week.</P>
    <P>Finally, in terms of the Presidency, I do not expect we will be getting the report on the Presidency.  The reality is that schools and health services are still working away under the same cutbacks as they were before the Presidency.  We have seen no improvement in our line of business at any rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to support Senator Manning's request that we deal at some stage, and as soon as possible, with a motion dealing with the report on marital breakdown.  As Senator Manning mentioned, promises were made during the divorce referendum.  I look forward to dealing with, and hearing, about all the promises that were made by his party, particularly the Taoiseach of the time, Dr. Garret FitzGerald.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the statement of Commissioner Bruce Millan in the European Parliament yesterday that the Commission have approved £30 million for the reopening of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal, may I ask the Leader of the House if he would convey to the Government the urgency of ensuring that a start-up and completion date are decided on.  According to the reply of the Commissioner, no completion date has been set.  I need not remind the House of the significant economic impact the reopening of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal will have, not only in my own county of Leitrim but in the region generally.  May I ask the Leader of the House to please convey the concern of the House about the lack of a specific start-up date and completion date.  Will he request that the Government give their attention to it as early as possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning asked about item No. 3.  That matter will be taken tomorrow morning.  On the question of the Broadcasting Bill, I certainly will find out what is the intention.  I am aware that the intention was to have it in the Dáil first, and then we would have it before the adjournment for the summer recess.  I hope that is still the position but I will find out as quickly as possible. Senators Hanafin and Manning queried the question of the report on Combat Poverty.  That is something I will consider. It is something that might be appropriate for a debate in this House. Senator Honan asked about statements on EC matters for the past six months.  I am not aware of what the plans are in regard to this House.  I will check it out and communicate with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal raised by Senator Mooney, that is not relevant to the Order of Business.  Senator Kennedy referred to the introduction of Question Time. I have no knowledge that that is being entertained at this time.  It is something perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or some other body can talk about.  Senator O'Toole referred to the legislative programme a fortnight ago or thereabouts, giving what was then a realistic programme of legislation.  It has changed somewhat because of the Broadcasting Bill and the problem there.  There will be legislation.  There is legislation passing through the other House, such as the Nursing Homes Bill and the Criminal Justice Bill.  There are other pieces of legislation which are being finalised in the Dáil and I would like to think we would have those before the summer recess. The Senator also referred to an education motion.  I assure him I will have some positive reply for next Wednesday for him, if he wishes to raise it.  A debate on the cross-Border issue is something I will <Col N="938" /> consider, but there are no plans for it at the moment.</P>

      <P>I am <Col N="939" /> sorry about the mix up over the time.  I seem to have delayed the Seanad somewhat and I wish to apologise to the House for that.</P>
      <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 (2) states: &ldquo;The Board may promote and take part in the formation or establishment of a company&rdquo;. I would like to come back to my main question on the operation of this Bill.  It is to ask the Minister, does it really mean they can take part in and promote the formation of a company provided you agree with them and provided the Minister for Finance agrees?  Or does it mean that they can act like any other board running a company?  Can they make and take decisions about which they are responsible and which they can implement, or does the decision to participate mean that they must also come back to the Minister for approval?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As is laid out in section 3, the consent of the Minister is required for the establishment of sub-boards.  The Minister is the main shareholder on behalf of the community.  I am sure the House would agree that it would be appropriate in the event of a major decision to establish sub-boards which would have powers delegated to them from the main board and which would act as if they were the main board in the areas of operation which was designated for them, that such an important decision would necessarily require the consent of the main shareholder.  It is provided for in the legislation that the Minister's consent will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the sub-boards; we are on section 2. Under section 2 (6) the exercise of power by the board is subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance <Col N="940" /> after consultation with any other Minister. This is operation by Cabinet.  We now have in this section several Ministers involved.  We have the Minister for Energy, the Minister for Finance and such other Ministers who in the opinion of the Minister, having regard to the functions of that Minister, ought to be consulted. In effect, this is privatisation by Cabinet.  It certainly seems to me a very clumsy way of operating a company.  I do not understand why this is required in this section of the Bill.  What kind of fail safe can the Minister give to us here today in terms of how he intends exercising that power?</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation, as the Minister is aware.  I would like to see it as progressive and positive, but I do not see how it can be those things, because on the one hand we are giving them power and on the other hand we are putting restraints on them.  If they feel under the terms that they wish to form or establish a new company, what is the process, what happens?  Does every decision of the board have to go to the Minister?  The reason I put this is because section 2 contains this provision, as do section 4 and one of the other sections later on in the Bill.  How is this board going to operate?  There is a board meeting, they decide we want to form a company, what is the next step in that process?  Does every decision about company formation, every decision about setting up a sub-board, every decision about engaging in new activities etc., have to go to the Cabinet or to the Minister?  What are the decisions that this board can make of its volition, what powers does the board have?  I fail to find them and I cannot see how it is going to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to companies, which is the point the Senator is raising, is simply as is stated here: that, if the main board decide for good commercial reasons that they wish to establish another company, the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance in that case is required.  I am sure that the majority of Senators here would <Col N="941" /> accept that that would be quite a normal requirement to be provided for in legislation in order to protect the interest of the shareholder.  I do not see any difficulty in it.  The Senator is dramatising it and referring to privatisation.  In fact, it is the opposite; it is the Minister being asked to consent to the establishment of a company by a State company.  It is the formation of another State company, which is not moving in the direction of privatisation, which is staying within the realm of State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Apologies.  I meant to say to &ldquo;nationalisation&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;.  I meant nationalisation under Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a power the Government are anxious to give to Bord na Móna in order to give them greater opportunity to participate in the market place and to facilitate the expansion of the company; that, if the main board so decide it would be of benefit to them to have a separate company promoting a certain one of their products or an associate product or an activity which was related to their main core business, they should be free to do so.</P>
      <P>This is a progressive step within the State ownership of the company and I cannot understand why the Senator would have any particular difficulty with it.  It is something the workers, management, worker directors and others in Bord na Móna are all very anxious to have established.  They are very anxious that this legislation would be passed so that they could avail of the extensive new powers being made available to Bord na Móna under the Bill.  It seems to me to be fairly straightforward.  I do not see any difficulties in it.  If the Senator wishes to refer to any specific difficulties he may see arising from it, I would be pleased to consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I know now I have raised an issue of importance because I have not got the answer to the question.  I will deal with some of the matters that have been raised.  I know exactly what the workers <Col N="942" /> and what everybody else wanted.  What they wanted was as set out in section 2 (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5).  What they did not want, and I will explain why &mdash; to use some of the Minister's own phrases in his response to me &mdash; if they consider for good commercial reasons they want to establish a new company, if they feel they might expand in the direction of setting up a new company, if they feel that a separate company would be a progressive way to go forward, they should be free to do so.  Those are the Minister's words and they are my words also and that is also the view of all the people who have made submissions.  None of those things, however, can happen because the company can do all the market studies they wish to do, make all the assessments they wish, and they can come up with the answers at the end of the day, but they cannot make that decision.  They are not free to do so until, unless and with all the exceptions provided under subsection (6) &mdash; the Minister for Finance has to say &ldquo;Yes, we agree with you&rdquo; and the Minister for Energy has to say &ldquo;Yes, we agree with you&rdquo; and any other Minister who you feel ought to be consulted has also to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  Are we saying that all the Departments of State should be tied up in making the commercial decisions which the Minister says are important?</P>
      <P>I would like to make a distinction before the Minister comes back on the issue &mdash; I am not objecting, I am supporting all the proposals in subsections (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) etc.  I think it is very progressive and so does everybody. We do not need to discuss them.  There is a need to say again to me that everybody is in favour of those, because so am I.  There is no argument about that.  I want to know the list of people who are in favour of having that power restricted by having to go and say &ldquo;Bhfuil cead againn&rdquo; to the Minister for Energy or the Minister for Finance and any other Minister whom he feels ought to be consulted. It is on that specific point &mdash; section 2 (6) &mdash; that I wish to raise the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there is reference <Col N="943" /> to the functions of any Minister other than the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance, where it is considered that they ought to be consulted, one can foresee a situation where it might be necessary to consult another Minister where the board were proposing to form a company or to take steps which were in the area of responsibility of another Minister.  I could think of Industry and Commerce, for instance, in some cases because of the commercial aspect of the Bill under discussion and Bord na Móna's activities taking into account the substantial new functions being allocated to the board under the Bill, in such circumstances it is appropriate that the Minister, as the major shareholder, would have to be consulted in the matter and his consent given.  It is normal also that, where the Minister for Finance is also possibly going to be the guarantor of any new company, his consent would also be involved and any other Minister would only be involved if the activities proposed impinged on the responsibilities of another Minister.  I expect it is unlikely that such a situation would arise but it is important to provide for it when one is writing the legislation.</P>
      <P>One can start looking into these provisions and imagine extreme situations, but it is important to accept that the practical application of the section refers to approval of broad strategies.  It is not, and would not be, the intention of any Minister to be involved in the specific detail of each and every single decision. That is a matter for practical application. I think the history of State companies in this country has shown that a good working relationship can be successfully established between the Minister, who has ultimate responsibility for the company on behalf of the State, and the management and workers within the company and the way in which the company is operated.  I do not see that it would present any difficulties.  The type of powers that are being extended here are ones that will greatly help this company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just say I am the first to appreciate that you have to take each semi-State or State company individually. You cannot take them together and make a decision on that.  I am also very much in favour of the idea of consultation. This appeals to me in the sense that the Minister says that he will have to be consulted.  I am not sure whether he means before the boards embark on their initiatives or whether it is at the stage when they have already done the research etc. and it is ready for presentation to the Minister for his consent or otherwise.  I am a little bit confused about that.  I must say, however, that the idea of the Minister keeping some control over this semi-State board appeals to me.  It might not appeal to me in the case of another board, but it appeals to me in the sense that it is a greater protection against an immediate rush into privatisation.  I do not know whether I am right or wrong, but that is the way I see it.</P>
      <P>Because of the way it is defined in subsection (6) I believe it is difficult to accept for people who have pursued joint consultation down through the years.  I know you cannot have prior consultation and agreement, but the question of consultation could be defined in a different way.  I am in favour of control in that I see it as a protection against privatisation.  I wonder if the Minister could clarify at what stage these consultations would take place.  Would it be at the stage when all the research is done, when the market has been tested, or do they have to enter into an agreement and get the consent of the Minister before they embark on this kind of research and, to some extent, development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If one reads the powers that have been extended one can well imagine at what stage the Minister's consent would be required.  The board may promote and take part in the formation or establishment of a company.  So, if the board, having duly considered the matter, arrives at a point where it makes a decision that it wishes to promote or take part in the formation or establishment of a company, then it notifies <Col N="945" /> the Minister and seeks his consent at that point and, having received it, would proceed to do what it had chosen, whether it be the formation or establishment of a company.  The same applies in each of the other cases.  Once the board has made its decision that it wanted to do a certain thing under the powers given to it in this section, it would then present its provision to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear to Senators that it is not, and never would be, the intention of the Minister to stifle initiative or to clog up with a lot of red tape the operation of a commercial State-sponsored body.  I think in practice one would see that that has not been the position.  It has been the tradition that Ministers have sought to stay well removed from the day-to-day activities of any State boards.  It would be frowned upon in this House and in the other House if it was seen that a Minister was exercising his powers unduly and interfering in the day-to-day commercial operation of one of the State companies, whether it be the ESB, CIE, Bord na Móna or whatever.  Happily, the tradition has been the opposite, even though Members in the other House often question Ministers about minute details which the Minister would have no responsibility for or wish to be involved in the day-to-day management of a State company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are only broad safeguards. There is no new intention here to move in to have excessive daily control or excessive control in any fashion over the operation of the board.  It is merely a protection for the taxpayers of this country, who have invested in these companies and the Minister is their shareholder and acting on their behalf.  It is only a reasonable precaution that is being taken.  The decisions will be taken by the relevant Minister at a point when the board has made its mind up as to what it is going to do, having fully assessed the particular project and made its proposals to him.  In practice, I would expect that in 95 per cent of cases one would find that the Minister was approving of what was put before him by the board.  As we know, in practice these things do not <Col N="946" /> emerge out of the sky and land on the Minister's desk; there is a system whereby there is contact and communication and it is known in the various Departments what major proposals are under discussion.  I would suggest to the Senators that they have no need to fear these proposals but should welcome them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the more the Minister says the more alarmed we should become about this section.  He has just said he feels there is no reason to believe the Minister will exercise powers unduly under this section and goes on to reply on the tradition of Ministers not doing so.  I think that is a very dangerous way to legislate.  The first thing that indicates to me is that the powers are excessive and can be abused and that we should have protections against that.  I am talking about bad Ministers, not good Ministers. There is no inference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no such thing as a bad Minister in this House at the moment.  I am talking about what we are legislating for.  We are legislating to protect us from bad Ministers in the future and we are talking about legislating against an abuse of power.  The more the Minister said he relied on the tradition of Ministers not abusing power the more alarmed we should become, because it seems to me there is obviously, by his own admission, an opening there for an abuse of such powers by a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section starts off very well.  The general thrust of it is something with which I think, everybody in the House is in agreement: that Bord na Móna should have more scope for initiative in the various areas specified but I cannot for the life of me see why subsection (6) is in there, because it says quite specifically: &ldquo;The exercise by the Board of any power conferred by this section shall be subject to consent of the Minister....&rdquo;  Then it gives any power whatsoever at any time. It is just not good enough to say he will <Col N="947" /> not exercise it in practice.  It is down there in black and white that he can.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already told us that every single time the board decides to do this they have to go to the Minister for approval.  This is an extraordinarily clumsy way of running a business.  It is not the normal way business is run or private business is run, because normally the Minister, as the main shareholder, having appointed the board &mdash; and we have to remember that the Minister not only appoints the board but he then has to get the board's permission to do anything, which is a most unusual way of doing things &mdash; says that when they have to make any decisions at all the board has to come back to him.  It seems to me that the board, having been rubberstamped by the Minister, then has to go and have all its decisions rubberstamped by the Minister, and it has absolutely no freedom whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he would consider putting some sort of a time limit on this.  I notice that in this section, which is causing a great deal of concern, it says that not only would he have to be consulted but also the Minister for Finance would have to be consulted and any other Minister whom he thinks suitable would have to be consulted.  This is an extraordinarily clumsy, delaying, inept way of running any sort of business, because a lot of the decisions and recommendations made by the board should be for immediate approval or disapproval. It seems to me that this is some sort of recipe for delay and for tying the hands of the board and making sure that it does not compete properly because it has to go through procedures which in private industry and private enterprise are absolutely unnecessary.  What is going to happen here is that the Minister is going to sit on the decision and think about consulting another Minister who may be too busy or may be away or he may have to go through civil servants.  In effect, the initiative taken by the board will lapse because of bureaucracy and red tape, which of course may not be there but <Col N="948" /> could be there.  Would the Minister consider saying yes, maybe it should be considered by himself but there should be a time limit on it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot for the life of me understand the argument made by Senator Ross.  If we were in a situation where Bord na Móna had acted in a highly irresponsible fashion and had amassed massive debts and liabilities for taxpayers in this country, can he not imagine the situation where he would be calling on the relevant Minister &mdash; in this case the Minister for Energy &mdash; to appear here in this House to answer why he was not exercising his responsibilities and why he allowed this to happen while he was the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  That is what this is.  The purpose of this clause in this Bill is to stop Bord na Móna abusing their powers, not to stop the Minister.  The Minister is here to act on behalf of the Senators and the Deputies and the people in this country on behalf of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Minister appoints some of the members of the board; other members of the board are appointed by the workers &mdash; the worker directors.  I think a quite extraordinary suggestion is being made now in this House: that legislation should be enacted which would allow a State company a free hand, despite the fact that the Minister for Finance guarantees the borrowings and finances of the State companies, without having any provision whereby control would be exercised.  I am merely indicating here that it is not the intention, and never has been, to have excessive interference.  These are just normal safety precautions that any good piece of legislation would need to provide for in order to deal with the <Col N="949" /> exceptional and the extraordinary happening, which hopefully may never happen.  It is prudent to make this provision in the Bill.  I absolutely refute the suggestion that we should have a Bill without these safety precautions in it, without placing the responsibility where it lies in the ultimate, which is with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome these powers.  The whole objective of this Bill is to give Bord na Móna the opportunity to become a modern company operating under the present very changed market conditions and very changed circumstances we have at present.  It is also a company which for various reasons, historical and economic, has had a very difficult time over the past two or three years and which is now, with the co-operation of the management and the workers, making excellent efforts and showing quite considerable promise of development in so far as it is possible in the particular circumstances relating to that company.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to see the Government bringing in these powers.  If Bord na Móna is to develop it needs the sort of powers that are given here.  I do not think it will cause the House any argument about the particular powers concerned.  I must say it is beyond me to even understand the arguments which have been suggested from the far side of the House. We would be totally irresponsible if we were to have a situation in which these powers were confirmed <i>carte blanche</i> without the Minister having, quite rightly, the responsibility at the end of the day for the exercise of these very wide-ranging powers.  The fact that he may not necessarily do so, and probably will never do so, either on a day-to-day basis or even over considerably longer periods, does not in any way abrogate his responsibility to ensure from the taxpayer's point of view that he has got these powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I will just spell out some of the difficulties which Senator Conroy and the Minister have difficulty <Col N="950" /> understanding.  It seems strange to be doing this in a week where the Minister's own party are taking credit for making sure a similar abuse does not happen in another place in another area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me.  May I continue? I will now spell out for Senator Conroy a classic example of what this type of legislation does in the marketplace but before spelling it out I want to make this quite clear: I believe in accountability; I believe there should be accountability for irresponsible action and that the Bill should contain that.  I think Senator Conroy should not have wasted the time of the House by going back over subsections (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) with which we all agree.  We are simply talking about subsection (6).  We also agree there should be accountability; the objection is that every decision of the board should be accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is stating that irresponsibility should not be allowed to take place.  It is, of course, something everybody would agree also.  The Minister's statement that these things do not come out of the sky brings to mind a classic example of how precisely this type of legislation has been abused by this Government in another Ministry.  If I take the example of Aer Lingus, who saw that their most commercial route was the Dublin-London route, and the main thrust of their operation is on that route, and saw that, in terms of developing that route, the only way in which they could see themselves developing was in the area of the new airport at Stansted in north London.  They did market research over a period of three and a half years to establish that they could increase their profitability and the commercial aspect of their enterprises.  Having done the market research, having invested a lot of money, and also having tendered for certain slots for take off and landing at the airport, having done all that &mdash; the guts of five years' work &mdash; eventually it <Col N="951" /> was approved by the board, the marketing had begun on it, and the Minister pulled the plug on it and gave the operation to another company, a private company.</P>
    <P>That is precisely why I believe these powers can be and indeed may well be abused in the future.  When will it be abused?  It will be abused if the semi-State company looks like becoming more commercially viable than those in the private sector with whom it is in competition. That is what we have seen in RTE, in Aer Lingus, and we will certainly see it in Bord na Móna also if the same thing happens.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are part of the public sector in whatever way want to insist on a number of things.  First, that the semi-State sector is viable, whether it be Bord na Móna or anywhere else.  Secondly, that there are no constraints on it; thirdly, that it brings something into the Exchequer that can be useful to all of us and fourthly that it should be held responsible and that the legislation should insist that it be responsible.</P>
    <P>This is not making it responsible.  This is company rule by Cabinet.  That is what we have here.  I will give the Minister one example, and if he needs a few more I can give four more examples just like the Aer Lingus and Stansted instance.  It is a classic example.  I would like to hear how that kind of thing could not happen under this.  It is precisely the same operation which I do not want to see happening. In the same way as advertising may be capped in RTE, in the same way as routes may be taken from Aer Lingus, I do not want to see a move in on Bord na Móna when it gets involved in some commercially viable enterprise.  That is my opposition to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first say I do not need any lectures from Senator O'Toole on wasting the time of the House and I would be grateful if he could refrain from such comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers in this Bill are very necessary for a Minister.  This is a situation in which the taxpayers' money is involved <Col N="952" /> and I fail to see how we could responsibly allow a Bill to go through this House without having these powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I got an answer to my question from the Minister.  Let us say we understand his point of view.  Let us say we understand the principles behind what the Minister is saying.  We have got to remember that the semi-State bodies boards are appointed by the Minister. We have got to remember he has that degree of control over them already. We have also got to remember, if he is going to insist on these powers, that there is no parallel I know of in the private sector where a board, having made a decision, has to go back to the shareholders for approval about every single decision on matters of this sort.  If the Minister insists on doing this it means that the board, if it is competing with anybody, is competing with its hands tied behind its back.  It also means in effect, that he is politicising the decisions of the board.  He should at least put some limits on ministerial power.  This is really a blanket section, which gives the Minister unlimited powers to interfere, obstruct and stop, not to initiate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no time limit whatsoever. What will happen is that the board will come to the Minister and say: &ldquo;We want to do this, can we do it?&rdquo;  Will the Minister give us an assurance that at least he will take a decision within a certain time?  It is no good coming back and saying: &ldquo;Of course in practice it will be done on a normal commercial basis&rdquo;.  It simply will not because the actual powers in this section cannot be exercised quickly.  If the Minister has to consult all other relevant Ministers it will take weeks, if not months.  It will be a great excuse for him to delay.  I do not like seeing political control in State companies.  I do not like seeing political control over decisions by State companies.  I am not making any improper suggestions but it leaves room for improper decisions on a political basis.  That is what I prefer not to see. Having appointed a board, which I would prefer not to see in the first place, it is utterly wrong that a Minister should then <Col N="953" /> come back and be open to the accusation of making a political decision.  Would the Minister consider putting limits on it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been adequately explained by the Minister that what is involved is the protection of shareholders who are taxpayers.  As far as I am concerned, inaccurate statements have been made.  One is that the Minister appoints the board.  He does not appoint all the members of the board.  There is an opportunity for others to appoint people to that board.  It has been said that it is a constraint.  If you want to say that protection for the public is a constraint then you are misusing the word.  Is the argument being put forward by Seantors, not by Senator Harte who has dealt with this in a very balanced way, to privatise Bord na Móna?  That seems to be what they are saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If I thought this legislation was protecting the taxpayer I would be the first to shout for it.  I would like someone to explain how reducing the routes of Aer Lingus protected the taxpayer or how reducing the amount of advertising on RTE protected the taxpayer. I am not the slightest bit worried about that aspect of it.  There has been a double-think on State industry and the double-think is simply this: when it is not working well it is described by parties like those on the far side of the House as being a drain on the State and something we should get rid of.  I can give some examples for instance, the objection to the ESB selling coal.  I could go through every semi-State company and as soon as they become involved in a commercial activity somebody from a major party says &ldquo;Block it&rdquo;.  We will let them do everything except become involved in commercial activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision is not there to protect the taxpayer.  If it was I would be highly supportive of it but it is quite the reverse. It is an abuse of the taxpayers and I have seen that happen when there was an attempt made to block the ESB selling coal.  That was not done by the Government but they were involved in other <Col N="954" /> cases of Aer Lingus expanding their routes into London and Munich and having their oldest and most traditional route to Liverpool, their first ever route, taken from them.  It was seen last week in the attempt to cap income from advertising on RTE.  This is not protecting the taxpayers; it is standing on them.  This is bleeding the taxpayer a bit more so that those people in the private sector can get greater profits.</P>
    <P>I fully support the line taken by Senator Harte.  That would be my own line if what we had here was accountability and responsibility.  That is precisely what we would be supporting but the Minister said this never would be used to stop a commercially viable proposition.  They are the words the Minister used; &ldquo;Never would be&rdquo; is what I have written down though I am not sure how he finished the sentence.  But if it never would be used, why is it there?  If it never would be used to do anything that I am worried about, why do we need it?  Why do we not just have accountability?  On a point of information and I stand to be corrected on this, I understand the Minister appoints all the members of the board of Bord na Móna.  The workers elect a person but the Minister appoints the people.  That is my understanding of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The system of dealing with taxpayers' money is precisely what we are talking about.  I believe in accountability and responsibility.  People should be accountable and held responsible but that is not what this section does.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom rud beag a rá faoin aireacht agus faoi dhualgais an Aire san chás seo.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire i leith Údarás na Gaeltachta, mar shampla, go bhfuil níos mó ná leath den bhord san tofa go daonlathach.  Tá faitíos orm agus labhair mé faoi seo nuair a bhíomar ag plé an Bhille faoi Institiúid na Mara &mdash; I suggested very strongly during that debate that there should be an independent type of board, go mbeadh sé sin ceadaithe, agus go mbeadh bord dá leithéid ag feidhmiú, but that did not happen.  I also see in this section that the Minister is going to have full and total <Col N="955" /> control.  Deireann daoine go bhfuil sé sin ceart agus gur chóir go mbeadh iomlán comhachta ag an Aire san réimse Stáit a bhfuil baint aige leis.  Níl mise á throid sin ar chor ar bith, ach tabharfaidh mé sampla beag amháin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give one small example to show what can happen when a Minister gets a grip, even on a board like Údarás na Gaeltachta, where seven of its members are democratically elected by Gaeltacht people and six are appointed by the Minister. Given that status, the Minister for the Gaeltacht in time gone by when Pádraig Flynn was Aire don Ghaeltacht, he brought in a rule and regulation whereby up to then Údarás na Gaeltachta as a board, elected or otherwise, had full control over spending power and budgetary allocation.  Thug seisean rud beag simplí isteach, in by the back door, something very small, insignificant at the time. It was not seen by management or by board members but at the end of the day, if you got a grant from Bord na Móna or from Údarás na Gaeltachta to build a hen house or put up a four foot wall, no matter how small the capital expense involved, you had to get the written permission of the Minister for the Gaeltacht. That was brought in under the guise of being helpful and doing something positive. I can see the same thing ag teacht os ár gcomhair anseo.  Ag deireadh an lae beidh an comhacht iomlán ag an Aire agus ní bheidh san bhord seo ach cineál stampa &mdash; a rubber stamp.  Is é an trua é nach mbeidh an bord seo neamhspleách. Sin an fáth go bhfuil imní orm go bhfuil an fhoráil seo ann.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an oiread neamhspleáchais acu &mdash; the amount of independence for this board to be successful.  They are going into private ventures and will be competing with other companies.  If they do not get this type of independence and have to run to the Minister every time asking if they can do this, that or the other, ní bheadh aon rath ar bhord dá leithéid.  Ag an am seo, fiú amháin, Bord na Móna are unable to compete favourably with English companies when they are selling briquettes on the English <Col N="956" /> market as a result of the constraints that are placed on them.  Agus tá sé déanta anseo arís ag an Acht seo go bhfuil bac ar an mbord.  Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfadh an tAire machnamh láidir air sin, go mbeadh an bord seo neamhspleách, chomh fada is féidir, agus go mbeadh sé le feiceáil go bhfuil sé neamhspleách.</P>

Is breá liom bheith ag cloisteáil faoi na daoine atá tofa ag muintir na nGaeltachtaí don Údarás, mar bhí mé féin páirteach sa chinneadh sin nuair a bhí mé sa Rialtas.  Sin rud a bhfuil mé an-bhródúil as nuair a fuair muintir na nGaeltachtaí seans go mbeadh daoine tofa faoin chóras daonlathach atá againn chun smaointe agus tuairimí ghnáthmhuintir na nGaeltachtaí a chur chun cinn ag an mbord, rud nach raibh ar fáil roimhe sin.  Mar sin, ó thaobh an daonlathais de, ar aon nós, bhí páirt mhór agam féin san iarracht chun é sin a bhaint amach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine from listening to some Senators that every decision that Bord na Móna wanted to make would require the consent of the Minister.  We are talking about something which is very fundamental and of extreme importance from the point of view of the development of Bord na Móna.  What we are proposing here is to give this State company the power to form new companies. We are extending the remit of a State company.  One would imagine, listening to the arguments being made, that we were going in the opposite direction.  It is only reasonable that where the taxpayer is guaranteeing, through the State, the funds of Bord na Móna there should be some control over major decisions which <Col N="957" /> may be made by the board in the area of the expansion of its activities.</P>
    <P>The formation of a new company is a major decision for Bord na Móna and, in such a case, it is only normal and necessary that the legislation would build in the safeguard that the Minister's consent would be required.  It is only in these limited cases where the board is making exceptional decisions that the consent of the Minister is required. Normal democratic procedures would require that accountability would rest with the Minister where such a major shift was being made.  It is the Minister who has brought this legislation.  It is the Minister for Energy and the Government of the day who are proposing the extension of the powers of Bord na Móna.  The Government are anxious to increase the opportunities for expansion within this State company and I would have expected support for that from the quarters that are criticising section 2 (b).</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the reference made by Senator Ross to the private sector.  I ask the Senator if there is any situation in the private sector where the borrowings of a private company are guaranteed by the taxpayers?  There is no parallel.  We are talking about a State company whose funding is provided by the State and the responsibility lies with the State to protect that investment on behalf of the taxpayer.</P>

On the other hand, Senators O'Toole and Ross said that in their experience ministerial involvement in semi-State bodies <Col N="958" /> has not been very beneficial in relation to the taxpayer in recent times.  The one case we can quote is where the Minister for Communications attempted to totally undermine the role of a semi-State body, namely, RTE.

      <P>I am, but we have had a variety of playing pitches.  There seems to be all sorts of hills and hollows in the playing pitches and they never seem to become level, particularly when the Minister is involved.  That is what we are concerned about.  The Minister should have control because we are talking about taxpayers' money.  We are talking about accountability and a possible situation where a board could perhaps privatise itself if it was not subject to some control. We are talking about another situation also and that is where a semi-State body can become shackled in its operations. Recently an action was taken by ministerial directive to shackle a semi-State body for the benefit of a private company. That is the danger here.  Why did the Minister see fit to put in this provision? Would not the overall principles governing the Principal Act have sufficed to ensure that there would be relevant and satisfactory accountability in relation to the operations of the board as a whole?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> In page 3, subsection (2), line 26, after &ldquo;determine.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;At least one member of each sub-board shall be a person elected to the Board under the terms of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977-1988.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The whole area of accountability in relation to the board and its activities is connected with what we have been discussing in subsection (6).  It seems reasonable to suggest that there would be worker directors representation on the sub-boards.  In Bord na Móna there are 12 directors on the board four of whom are elected.  The others are appointed by the Minister.  If we establish sub-boards with three to six people on them, it would seem reasonable that at least one elected person who is participating in the activities of Bord na Móna should be selected to serve on them.</P>
    <P>I expressed concern earlier that there may be fragmentation of the activities of the board.  I hope that what the Minister suggests will lead to a more efficient and effective operation and to a greater diversification of activities.  In order to guard against possible fragmentation, it is highly desirable that we should ensure that there is properly elected democratic representation on the sub-boards.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment as being of benefit to the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention behind the amendment would seem to limit the power of the board by insisting that such and such a person should be in it.  It is excellent that there should be worker participation and if the board so decides that would be useful but that we should have legislation stating that a sub-board, effectively a sub-committee should have to have a particular person or persons on it would seem to be interfering with the day-to-day operations of the board.</P>

      <P>It is the intention of the board that at least one of the worker <Col N="960" /> directors be appointed to any sub-board which may be established.  The establishment of any sub-board under this legislation is subject to the approval of the Minister for Energy and it would be open to the Minister to require that a worker director be appointed before giving his approval.  Given the board's intentions in regard to this matter, I do not expect it would be necessary to take such a step.  I do not believe it is necessary to write this into legislation because nobody has any objections to it.  It is the intention that worker directors would have representation on each of the sub-boards. As Senator Conroy has said, it is a matter for the main board.  That is the intention and, as Minister, it would be my intention.  I find it difficult to foresee a situation where at any time a sub-board such as this would be formed without having one of the worker directors on it.</P>

      <P>Is an intention permanent enough?  The path to Hell is paved with good intentions.  I listened to the discussion on subsection (6) and welcome the fact that Bord na Móna, one of the oldest semi-State companies, is to be given power to diversify.  I welcome that section because of the employment factor.</P>
      <P>The Minister is genuinely interested in developing Bord na Móna and bringing it into the nineties.  The workers in Bord na Móna have accepted the role of the worker director because he is on the ground and knows what is going on.  He can have a substantial input into the workings of the board.  An intention in this case is not sufficient and the Minister could strengthen his argument by agreeing to the amendment.  Perhaps some of the senior directors in Bord na Móna might not be interested in having worker participation on the sub-boards?  I would welcome the Minister's reply on that.  I know he is aware that it is important but it is not incorporated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I endorse what the Senator said.  We are constantly getting legislation of this sort before us and constantly <Col N="961" /> having nice, good, well-intentioned Ministers telling us that things were not happening in practice which were actually in the Bill.  Here, again, the Minister with the best will in the world is saying: &ldquo;It is my intention to do this&rdquo;.  If it is his intention to do it, I cannot see why he just does not put it down in black and white. Why it is not there in the small print? That would remove from him any accusation of backsliding on it or bad will on it.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment.  He obviously agrees with it and declares it is his intention to do it anyway.  It is not good enough to say when legislation is brought before this House that in theory it will work this way but in practice will work a different way.  It is not good enough not to bind the Minister's successors to whatever his intention is today and for the next four or five years.  His successors must be bound by the legislation and the only way to do that is by writing in worker participation into the Bill.  I cannot understand &mdash; and it leaves me with some suspicion &mdash; why the Government cannot put in this provision.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the Minister's good will in the matter but the Minister will not be the relevant person in relation to the establishment of the sub-boards.  The section states that the board may, subject to the consent of the Minister from time to time, establish one or more sub-boards and may delegate to such sub-board, etc.  The Minister may wish that the board would appoint a worker director but there is nothing to state that he will direct the board to do so.  While he might have the good intention of wishing that the board would appoint a worker director, his good intention does not hold sway when the sub-boards are being established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the flaw in what the Minister said.  The Minister will not be Minister <i>ad infinitum</i> so there is no way he could bind future Ministers.  The point is that the board makes the appointment and can make the decision as it thinks fit.  It is desirable that there should be worker participation if we are to protect the <Col N="962" /> interests of the shareholders, the company and the workers themselves who have formed Bord na Móna and developed it for almost half a century. They are the people who should and must be represented.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take on board what has been said on this amendment. If he does not accept the amendment as it is he should come back on Report Stage with an amendment incorporating the principle of this amendment, although perhaps in different wording, that a worker director be a member of every sub-board.</P>

      <P>It is often very difficult to anticipate future circumstances. The Minister has stated that it is his intention that any such sub-board should include worker participation. We all agree that the participation of workers in the recent developments and renaissance of Bord na Móna has been extremely good.  We have no objection in principle to it.  I just find it slightly contradictory that a few moments ago we had Members on the other side of the House objecting to the board being bound, that they must do this and saying that they could not necessarily rely on that situation.  Now we have before us an excellent amendment but one in which we are slightly binding the board.  For my own part I have no objection to it.  I would be happy to support it.</P>

      <P>I would like to clarify my position on subsection (6).  I welcome the initiative, inventiveness and the desire for creativity within Bord na Móna to ensure that they can further diversify if you are in agreement with the intention <Col N="963" /> and agree with the worker participation in this new development in Bord na Móna and the sub-boards, surely it can be extended into the sub-boards?  It is not a matter of pride or a matter of one side trying to beat the other side on what should be in or should not be in.  I am thinking of the benefit it will be at sub-board level that we will still have the same worker director as was on the original State board, which has already shown its worth in the accomplishments in Bord na Móna.  It is only a minor detail but it should be written into the Bill and I will persist in that attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that we have four worker directors and it is very likely that we will finish up with three sub-boards. As Senator Conroy said, there is no objection whatsoever.  Therefore, it would be a sensible development if the Minister were to make the amendment rather than us having an argument over something about which there is no real argument or even putting it to a vote. There is no need to vote on something when you have everybody in agreement. I urge the Minister to listen to what Senator Costello said with regard to Report Stage to see if he could do something on it.  I have one other minor question and I hope it does not throw the nice pattern we have at the moment out of gear.  Is there any good reason why the board can only appoint members of the board to the sub-board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is because the sub-board would have delegated to them some of the functions of the main board. They would be acting as the board when they make decisions that that power would be delegated to them.  In those circumstances the Government did not think it was appropriate that any other <Col N="964" /> persons should be appointed to sub-boards other than those who were actually members of the main board.  As I said here in regard to this amendment, it is the intention of the board, it is the intention of this Minister that worker directors would be represented on each of the sub-boards that we know it is proposed to establish.  We are really arguing about whether it is necessary to write it into legislation, whether it is appropriate to single out one particular category to ensure that that category will be represented on the sub-boards, bearing in mind that there are four worker directors on the main board.  I cannot really see any situation arising where they would not have a representative on each of the sub-boards.</P>
      <P>We had a discussion on this matter in the other House, I have looked at it since then and have considered it.  If the House feels strongly about it I am prepared to change my position on it and to have it written into the legislation, if that is the wish of the House.  I greatly admire the contribution the worker directors have made in the State companies to which they have been appointed, particularly in the case of Bord na Móna, where many difficult commercial and personnel decisions had to be made in recent times. The contribution of the worker directors has been outstanding to that company and in this Bill, I want to create the conditions where that company can have good prospects for their commercial future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company have a lot of difficulties arising out of the heavy debt which they are now involved in and which is creating a problem, which I said on Second Stage is not specifically a matter for discussion here because it is still under consideration. The circumstances have to be worked out where Bord na Móna will be in a position to thrive and to avail of the commercial opportunities that present themselves.  I am thinking in particular of the situation in Dublin with the new order in regard to bituminous coal and the opportunities that present themselves abroad for the expansion of the peat moss division of Bord na Móna.  In deference <Col N="965" /> to the opinions that have been expressed here, I am prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(m) ensure that all its activities are conducted in such a manner as to afford maximum protection for the environment both locally and nationally.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is in line with what I said earlier on Second Stage that I would like to see some protection for the environment and that all legislation in relation to matters of this nature should at this time have some provision to ensure that there is environmental protection.  My amendment states that the board should ensure that all its activities are conducted in such a manner as to afford maximum protection for the environment both locally and nationally.  That is a caveat that a semi-State body which deals with our indigenous natural resources &mdash; peat being, perhaps, our most famous resource that is being exploited so successfully &mdash; should now take into consideration the possible fall-out and the implications in relation to the ecology and the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a lot of cutaway bogs at present and indeed this section refers specifically to their commercial exploitation. We have areas where afforestation is taking place and where, there can be many problems in relation to the right mix of trees that are used which can <Col N="966" /> lead to pollution problems in relation to wildlife and fish.  We have a situation where blanket bogs and moorlands which were natural habitats not just of native wildlife but the world's wildlife have been drained, have been planted, have been used and are being used in a manner that is not conductive to environmental protection.  I can give a couple of examples of this.  For example, the Clara bog, a huge soak bog, as it is called, is in danger of being damaged.  In an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last month, Dr. Peter Foss of the Irish Peatlands Conservation Council in relation to the eastern side of the bog being badly damaged when Bord na Móna started to drain it said that the cutting that is taking place is endangering the bog and that there is a danger of an entire habitat being washed away.  He also said Bord na Móna are talking about establishing an interpretative centre but that by the time this is done we might have no bog at all.  He said it is a habitat for an enormous quantity of wildlife.</P>
    <P>Another example is in relation to a statement by An Taisce that in the west of Ireland 35 per cent of the original area of blanket bog has either been cut away or has been afforested.  All sorts of wildlife and the natural habitat are affected. There is, for example, no planning permission required in relation to afforestation once the unit of afforestation is not more than 200 hectares.  This is what is happening in the commercial exploitation of cutaway bog at the present time.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we have some of the most unique wildlife habitats in the world related to our peatlands and we are in the context of this Bill specifically referring to exploitation of cutaway bog, or other activities that Bord na Móna have not been engaged in at the present time.  We are talking about thousands and thousands of acres of land and at the present time we do not have the necessary environmental protection measures in the legislation.  It would be a very reasonable thing for the Minister at this point to consider introducing an amendment of that nature that would provide <Col N="967" /> for that environmental protection.  I commend the amendment to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to Senator Joe Costello on the need to accept this amendment.  I have a particular reason for this.  I come from an area which can boast of Lough Derg, which is second only to the Lakes of Killarney as a tourist development area and whose potential has not been realised.  Unfortunately, we suffer from a pollutant that is entering the upper end of the lough at Portumna.  It has been proved conclusively that this residue emanates from turf development on the northern end of the River Shannon.  All the people in my area, and also the people in the mid-west who recognise Lough Derg as having vast tourist potential, appreciate the damage that is being done by this unfortunate residue which is flowing down uncontrolled into the lower basin of Lough Derg and causing tremendous damage to the environment of the lake.  An Taisce, Bord Fáilte, Shannonside, Clare County Council, Galway County Council and North Tipperary County Council are all agreed that Bord na Móna are the main culprit in the pollution of Lough Derg.  As local authorities we can only do so much to prevent pollution and to bring to the notice of the people concerned the damage that is being done.  Unless someone takes this serious problem on board what we have to offer to tourism in the mid-west, in particular north Tipperary, will be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a major plan on board for a major development of tourism in the region and the heart of that development is Lough Derg.  If we cannot clean the scourge of pollution which Bord na Móna have created in Lough Derg, our plan and all the money which we intend spending will be for nought.  For that particular reason I fully support this amendment. I presume the Minister is aware of the serious complaints that have been lodged and submitted to Bord na Móna by all concerned.  It is not a vested interest.  The interest is the development of tourism.  I live six miles from Lough Derg and I <Col N="968" /> am very proud of the fact that we have something to offer international tourism but it needs the protection of the State and the people involved need to be assured that Bord na Móna are made fully aware of the damage they have done so far to the environment of Lough Derg and the lower Shannon.</P>

      <P>Arís, ba mhaith liom aird an Aire Fuinnimh a dhíriú ar an gceist seo, mar it is a question of balance. Unfortunately, people in the west of Ireland will suffer for the sins of Bord na Móna because every right-minded citizen will be for environmental protection, as long as there is balance.  There is a balance involved, a social balance, an economic balance and environmental balance.  There is no doubt that Bord na Móna down through the years have destroyed thousands and thousands of acres from the point of view of the environment. There is no getting beyond that. It has been done.</P>
      <P>The people in the west of Ireland were slow to develop their areas.  Now when we have something going for us we have to pay for the sins of those in the midlands and on the east coast.  We are asked here to have maximum protection for the environment both locally and nationally. I am not disputing that, but I am disputing the question of balance that is being talked and preached about in this country at this time.  We talk about the Green Presidency, we talk about the environment but when we are speaking about that, ba chóir dúinn, dar liomsa, é sin a chur i gcomhthéacs daoine atá ag iarraidh maireachtáil agus fanacht beo agus slí bheatha a bhaint amach.  People must live, people must warm themselves and must have fires, people must use the boglands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An eminent environmentalist, David Bellamy, castigated publicly a very energetic group of people in the west of Ireland in Clifden because they wanted to develop a small airport for the exact same thing that Senator Ryan has spoken of, to help them out in a tourist venture. Mr. Bellamy spoke about people who dreamt of building a small airport right <Col N="969" /> on the periphery of the town of Clifden in an area where there are 24,000 acres of blanket bog.  We are talking about balance here.  Between 50 and 100 acres were involved for development, people were putting up £500,000 of their own money to do something for an area which is completely isolated and denuded of population.  He said that the people were stupid and vandals to even think of that. These are the very words he used publicly.</P>
    <P>We must deal with that in the context of this amendment.  I am certainly for environmental protection and I am certainly for the idea that we protect wildlife, their habitat and so on but it must be done in a balanced way without people of the stature of David Bellamy coming in to tell us in the west of Ireland that we are stupid and vandals to want to develop a small segment on the periphery of a bog and outside a town.  Unfortunately, in our great race to be Green and to be environmentalists we are beginning to forget about the social conditions of the people in that area where 75 per cent are medical card holders and over 80 per cent of the very small farmers there are living on the poverty line or below it.  These are the facts.</P>
    <P>If there is an environmental issue involved here Bord na Móna have got rid of thousands and thousands of acres of bog.  I would advocate that there should be local involvement, give all the cutaway bogs that are still there back to the farmers who owned them in the first place.  Bord na Móna got them for a pittance.  They are now offering the people of Connemara £10 an acre for bogs.  When we were speaking on this Bill before, the Department could give over £500 an acre to Bord na Móna.  Ba mhaith liom a chinntuí, má tá an rud seo le bheith istigh i mBille mar seo, go socrófar an cheist seo faoin cothromaíocht.  The balance should definitely be taken into consideration. Bord na Móna now, at the end of the day have most of their bogs cut away but they were afraid to venture into the west of Ireland when they were asked over 20 years ago, to come in and develop some of our bogs with the people <Col N="970" /> in the west.  We cannot now ask them to be more careful because the damage has been done.</P>
    <P>I do not see any great relevance of this subsection because the damage is done, the bogs are nearly cut away.  We skipped over the section and it was all agreed.  We are going out foreign to help people to cut bogs, to take over bogs, to buy bogs and develop them.  Why are we doing this when we cannot develop a small bog in Ireland?  We have An Taisce, environmentals, the David Bellamy's of this world down on top of us if a farmer wants to cut some turf for himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and appeal to the Minister to take it on board and have it included as part of the Bill.  I am not sufficiently confident that Bord na Móna will take the necessary steps to protect our environment.  I will highlight one major issue where I find them quite neglectful, that is with regard to allowing millpeat to flow directly into the Shannon and Suck simply because of failure to properly maintain the slush traps which have been provided but, unfortunately, are not properly maintained.</P>
      <P>I believe it is important that enshrined in this legislation are the clear aspirations of this House to protect our environment. Of course, I totally agreed with Senator Ó Foighil in so far as I believe there has to be a balanced development.  I fully support the sentiments he has expressed with regard to the development at Clifden. I have no doubt an airport there would undoubtedly provide major advantages to the people of that region and improve the tourist development.  There has to be a balance between protecting the environment and utilising the assets we have to our best advantage to ensure we get maximum development from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain that the interests of the Irish people would be best served by having this amendment taken on board. I believe it is important that cutaway bogs are properly developed.  If one drives through the midlands at the present time one will see bogs that Bord na Móna have <Col N="971" /> abandoned.  I am not talking about the Derryfada group which is another issue. I am talking about bogs which have been cut out, they have abandoned and look like derelict sites.  Many of these bogs should be allocated to the farming community from whom they were taken from in the first place and a balanced development of forestry and agriculture carried out and to ensure that we protect our environment a portion of them should be allocated for that purpose.  I appeal to the Minister to take this amendment on board.</P>

      <P>Senator Pól Ó Foighil, a Tipperary man now living in Galway, said there should be a balance in what we are doing.  Up to this, there has been no balance whatever.  What has happened in Lough Derg has been completely uncontrolled. Bord na Móna are the prime semi-State body responsible for the pollution of Lough Derg.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what the Senator said about employment.  We all want to see men and women working I attended a meeting five years ago in Portumna and there were about 1,000 people in the Westpark.  The people in the dock charged with the destruction of Lough Derg were Bord na Móna.  The Minister is well aware of the consternation that was caused in east Galway, Clare and north Tipperary over the fact that the biggest culprit in the pollution of Lough Derg was a semi-State body.  That is why I believe that if we are to have a balance and control, this amendment should be accepted to ensure that the environment can be protected.  We in the mid-west are most anxious to get on with tourist development but there is no good getting on with it if Bord na Móna continue to pollute Lough Derg.  I am being parochial but, unfortunately, I have to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe a great opportunity is being lost on this occasion.  Bord na Móna in the recent past engaged in a PR excuse for an hour and a half in the early morning when we enjoyed breakfast and had a chat about their activities <Col N="972" /> and what they were planning for the future.  The one thing that appalled me on that occasion was that Bord na Móna considered themselves the authority who had responsibility for extracting a certain commodity from the bogs and commercially marketing that product and after that their responsibility ended.  It was quite appalling to have a semi-State body in such a responsible position carrying out activities and depleting the acreage of bog in the country.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has a committee to advise him on the use of cutaway bogs and the use they might be put to in the future but the brief to that committee does not include the restoration of bogs or the return of acreages to bogland.  I believe that can be done and it appalls me that Bord na Móna do not realise it is possible to do that.  One very senior official in Bord na Móna said the greatest sight to him was to go on a car journey or a train journey from Tralee to some other town to see the great stretches of former boglands now in grass or in agricultural use.  That is fine, I do not mind a certain amount of that but it is wrong to put it all into grassland use or into recreational use and allow none of it to return to bogland.  I cannot understand how nobody has come up with the suggestion that the water should be left in the boglands to allow the area to remain as bogland.  I believe that future generations will not thank us if we reduce our boglands to such a low acreage that we cannot ever revive them.  I have seen bogland where the turf is extracted by hand and it continue to be a bog, but where there are machines coming in draining the area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Very many people will be disappointed that this opportunity was not grasped to bring home to Bord na Móna that they had a responsibility for the environment.  Many people expected in this Bill there would <Col N="973" /> be protection for the environment and provisions to bring home to Bord na Móna that they have this responsibility. The Minister in recent times endeared himself to very many people when he made an announcement regarding the banning of mining on Croagh Patrick and in national parks.  Many people expected similar protection in this Bill for our boglands. I ask the Minister to consider this amendment, or, perhaps, he will introduce a stronger amendment on Report Stage, that would allow some of the boglands to continue to be boglands.  The Minister has given a brief to the special committee he set up to advise him on four areas in which cutaway bogs can be used I ask him to add a fifth; in other words, that they would consider allowing some of the boglands to revert to their former state.  It would be a great pity to lose this opportunity to achieve that objective.</P>
      <P>I agree with the amendment because it will indicate to Bord na Móna that they have a responsibility to the environment. Heretofore, their only objective was to extract what they could from boglands and market the product as economically as possible wherever they could.  After that, their main concern was to get rid of that land.  They should be responsible for ensuring that some of those bogs can be used for hundreds and thousands of years to come.</P>

I am sure the Minister would approve of visibly affording the maximum protection for the environment, both locally and nationally.  It is almost like one of the recommendations about motherhood.  The Minister, being a man of logic, and so on, should have no difficulty in accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of the amendment as it would be a means of curbing pollution, but, more importantly, I hope it would provide a basis for protecting priceless environmental treasures located in some bogs, particularly in the midlands.  It would be appalling if anything were to <Col N="974" /> happen to damage them.  There is tremendous potential in those treasures for scientific research and as a tourist attraction in years to come, when we can capitalise on that type of market.  There is a tremendous richness there for scientific research and for attracting students from all over the world to study those treasures located in the midlands.  There is also remarkable potential in that area from the point of view of the ordinary tourist. For those reasons I hope the Minister will accede to our request in relation to this amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the protection of the environment, bogs and boglands are a considerable tourist attraction.  People from Dublin go down the country or up to Dublin Mountains to cut turf.  Many of those people are not doing this because they need turf or for economic reasons; they are doing it primarily for recreational reasons.  There is considerable potential here which can be developed.  I met a lady from south County Dublin last weekend who told me that she was off to the Dublin Mountains to cut turf and she was looking forward to it greatly.</P>

In the bogs of the Great Rift Valley of east Africa the bones of our ancestors of thousands of years ago have been found and likewise, in many parts of this country.  I am not just talking about Christian religious objects which have been found in our bogs, but about bones; carbon dating can be used to ascertain our background.  I hope the Minister will also take into consideration archaeological as well as Christian remains and those as yet undiscovered historical remains could be lost to posterity. That aspect should be included in the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator McMahon expressed regret that I had not included in the terms of reference of the special committee which was to advise on the disposal of cutaway bogs a provision to take environmental matters into account.  He mentioned there were only four requirements which this committee would consider.  I would like to refer him to the terms of reference of the committee.  There are five areas which they were asked to look at specifically and the fifth one is to take into account, in particular, amenity and environmental considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The main interest, of <Col N="976" /> course, is in the disposal of those cutaway bogs which can be developed as grasslands and in the argument regarding farming and forestry use.  That is the main area which the committee is being asked to look at but it is also being asked to look at other aspects, including amenity and environmental aspects which will be an important part of its work.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the Minister for Energy has no direct function in relation to the conservation of boglands. Because I am dealing with the Turf Bill and Bord na Móna it may seem I have some responsibility in that area but I do not.  That is the responsibility of the Wildlife Service which is part of the Office of Public Works and, therefore, under the aegis of the Minister for Finance.  Bord na Móna currently own less than 10 per cent of Irish boglands.  Their position is that they have recognised over the years that their development operations can have serious consequences for the preservation of wildlife and rare vegetation. To minimise this effect, Bord na Móna have, in conjunction with other interested bodies, compiled lists of peatlands worthy of conservation.  Discussions are ongoing between Bord na Móna and the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works concerning these bogs.  Bord na Móna have handed over or retained over 2,000 hectares for conservation purposes and have desisted from acquiring a further 1,000 hectares because of the conservation potential of those lands.  The most recent bog to be handed over was Clara Bog in County Offaly which comprised 496 hectares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research is being carried out in Bord na Móna into the question of silt pollution of milled peat.  Previous harvesting methods allowed for the loss of much peat bog at the harvesting stage.  The change-over that is now taking place to the haku system of collecting peat and bringing it to a central point will eliminate a lot of that loss and hopefully, of most of the milled peat that found its way into drains which, as has rightly been pointed out, was a cause for concern as it was finding its way into our major river systems. I would be concerned if that <Col N="977" /> damage were to continue.  If there is any evidence of that, I would be pleased to draw it to the attention of the chairman or managing director of Bord na Móna. We must be ever-vigilant in protecting our waterways.  The idea that we could be spending money on harvesting milled peat for it to float down our rivers and destroying them, would indicate gross inefficiency and, obviously, would add unnecessary cost to the final product.</P>
    <P>The board, management and work-force of Bord na Móna are concerned about cost efficiencies within the board and are adapting to new harvesting methods to eliminate waste and introduce more efficient methods of harvesting their product.  I hope that those new methods will eliminate problems that existed in the past.  In relation to slush traps, Bord na Móna have a duty to maintain them in good condition, to keep them clean and to ensure that none of this peat floats into the river systems.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Senators are aware of my concern and interest in the environment. I am interested in contributing to protecting our environment, in making balanced decisions and using balanced legislation to assist in that matter.  We have a task of marrying growth and development with a strict environmental regime and I am happy that the new Environmental Protection Agency, which is to be established by the Government, will have powers to ensure that Bord na Móna's operations&mdash;as, indeed those of any other commercial bodies &mdash; are carried out in a way which will afford protection for the environment.  I am satisfied that Bord na Móna are fully aware of their environmental obligations and of the serious implications of their activities if negligence is allowed to creep in.  I am satisfied they strive to ensure that those activities are carried out in a manner which causes the least possible damage to the environment.  Having said that, I am aware that there have been mistakes in the past and some damage has been done.  I hope that situation will not arise again.</P>
    <P>In regard to the amendment, which I am asked to accept by Senators Costello, <Col N="978" /> Upton, Ryan and Harte, I have no reason to object to it if the House believe it is necessary.  It is not very strong in the context in which it has been suggested but if the House consider it appropriate that we should make a reference in this way to the need for the board to conduct their affairs in a manner which would at all times take into consideration the proper protection, or appropriate protection, of the environment, both locally and nationally, I have no objection to having a clause to that effect inserted in the Bill.  If the Senators who are proposing the amendment would agree to the following slight change, I could accept it.  In other words, that the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; be changed to &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; in the second line and that the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; be added at the end because that is required to keep the section effective as regards paragraph (b).  Will the Senators proposing this amendment agree to amend the Bill to include the new section 8 (2) (m) to read as follows: &ldquo;ensure that all its activities are conducted in such a manner as to afford appropriate protection for the environment both locally and nationally and...&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his interest in the amendment and for agreeing to it.  Will he take up with Bord na Móna the problem of the pollution of Lough Derg?  He may think that the problem has ceased but it has not.  The pollution of Lough Derg is a matter of grave concern to the mid-west.  The Minister mentioned the Office of Public Works but the people who created the problem are Bord na Móna and they are the people who should resolve it.  Steps will have to be taken in this regard if we are to pursue tourism in the mid-west region.  Bord na Móna will have to be brought to task for the damage they have done and obliged to cease the pollution of the River Shannon in Lough Derg.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the amendment but I want to emphasise that the people in the mid-west region are very concerned about that problem.</P>

However, perhaps at a future date he would consider ensuring that a percentage of cutaway bogs would be returned to bogland.  I ask him to enshrine that in some order or Act so that we can be certain that all the cutaway bogs will not be used for purposes other than boglands and that a percentage of them will revert to boglands.  That will mean a continuation of our boglands for future generations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out to Senator McMahon that there is a contradiction in what he is saying.  If it is a cutaway bog then the bog, by definition, is gone and it is not bogland as we know it or want to preserve it.  Amenity and environmental considerations will be taken into account by this committee in regard to all cutaway bogs.  Some of those bogs will not be useful for grassland, some will not be useful for forestry and some will not have any productive use and will, of necessity, become amenity areas and sites for environmental works. The committee have been asked to look at that aspect and to make recommendations in regard to the cutaway bogs which do not have the potential for other developments.  I do not want to give the Senator the impression that we could preserve as bogland something that has been cut away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it requires an indepth study.  What really prevents cutaway bog from returning to bog is the drainage; the water has been taken out. Land that is drained improves.  Bogs that are hand-cut and where there is no drainage continue to be boglands.  They have been cut for hundreds of years and are still growing.  I could take the Minister to an area not ten miles from here where I saw bogs cut by hand in the forties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something I want to say on it for the information of all.  Before it is agreed, should not &ldquo;and&rdquo;<Col N="982" /> in line 20 also be deleted as it is a consequential change in accepting the amendment?  Is that agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that would be the intention.  I am delighted the Minister has agreed to take this amendment on board and the change he proposes from &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; to &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; is quite justified.  I have no problem at all with that.  Neither do I have a problem in the context of whether this amendment goes in precisely where I intended it.  In other words, as subsection (m) it could be put in a different section if the Minister saw fit, after giving further consideration to it.  Indeed, it could be put in at the end of the section, before section 9, if that would be more applicable.  I am delighted the Minister has accepted the amendment.</P>
      <P>I was a bit concerned about his earlier remarks in regard to the separation of powers between Bord na Móna and the Office of Public Works because I noticed that the Office of Public Works, for example, in relation to Clara Bog have expressed their concern.  They have criticised the way Bord na Móna have acted in relation to it even though Bord na Móna have now purchased two-thirds of it for a national heritage centre.  They are concerned that the bog will be destroyed before it could become a national heritage centre; in other words, the activities of Bord na Móna have already caused many problems in relation to this area.  I do not think one can say that one group are concerned with the environmental side and that another office or semi-State body are concerned with the exploitation or production of peat.  Bord na Móna have a duty to take reasonable care. What we are saying here is that many matters relate to the environment in terms of cutaway bogs.  The activities of Bord na Móna, in general, are relevant and it is appropriate that that is acknowledged in this Bill.  It is a worthwhile amendment in relation to this new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the amendment does not in any way interfere with what Senator Ó Foighil said about balance.  We accept <Col N="983" /> the idea of commercial development, production and the creation of jobs.  We are concerned about getting the balance right.  It is not one or the other; it is a combination of all that gives the right balance, and, of course, that gives the right environmental and ecological balance. I thank the Minister for accepting the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, paragraph (b), line 33, after &ldquo;Minister.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Such directives shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and shall come into force within 21 sitting days unless a motion is passed in either House to the contrary.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Having got the Minister to agree more or less to amendments Nos. 1 and 2, perhaps, without further discussion, he might accept amendment No. 3 also. Amendment No. 3 again relates to cutaway bogs.  Subsection (4) states that any power conferred on the board in relation to cutaway bogs shall only be exercised in accordance with such general directions as may be laid down from time to time by the Minister.  Amendment No. 3 states that such directives shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and shall come into force within 21 sitting days unless a motion is passed in either House to the contrary.  The amendment seeks to give a simple check to the Oireachtas in relation to what directives are given by the Minister in the context of cutaway bog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about large quantities of land, thousands of acres.  There is a variety of land available from agriculture, natural habitats, heritage, forestry and so on.  The House is entitled to know what the intentions are and there is not obstacle put in the way of the Minister.  It is only asking that the Minister inform the House.  It is a purposeful, positive development and unless it comes back in any form in the period of 21 days <Col N="984" /> then it simply goes ahead as intended.  It is important that the House has that extra check.  It is not an interfering check; it simply seeks to know what Bord na Móna are doing downstream with their commercial activities or their secondary operation.  It seeks to ensure that all the social, environmental and commercial implications are looked into or may be looked into.  I simply ask the Minister to allow the House to have the last word, so to speak.  The Minister is the man who will make the directives but the House may have the last word in simply inspecting them and if it sees something unusual or exceptional then it may put a motion to the contrary.  The amendment does not in any sense seek to interfere with the operation or the powers of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to support the sentiments expressed in amendment No. 3.  It is only right and appropriate that the Houses of the Oireachtas would be aware of what orders, if any, the Minister was giving with regard to the change in use or as to how cutaway bogs would be used.  It is a simple matter that this information should be circulated. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment and facilitate the Members of the Oireachtas in knowing precisely what was happening and what was taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the House to recall that the Bill I inherited had a section in it which provided that cutaway bog would be made available for forestry development, that the forestry section would have the right of choice in regard to that matter, and that whatever lands they deemed were appropriate for forestry purposes would be made available to them.  I did not think that that was an appropriate way in which to deal with this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of cutaway bog that will become available over the next 30 to 40 years is enormous.  It has been said that it is going to be as much as an Irish county.  Therefore, it is important that whatever policy decisions are made in <Col N="985" /> this area after careful consideration of all the facts and examination of every possible option, should be sound ones. For that purpose, I established a special committee of experts who have been meeting and who have accepted submissions from about 40 different groups and individuals, including all the main farming organisations.  The committee will report to me before the end of the year.  The House is asking here that whatever decision I make in regard to this matter, should not be enforced until procedure requiring 21 sitting days and a motion being passed in either House of the Oireachtas has been gone through.  I do not think that is appropriate at all.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the subsection is to enable the Minister of the day to make decisions on policy in relation to the usage of cutaway bog arising from the report of the committee of experts I set up.  They have been asked to examine this matter and to make recommendations. Anybody who wished to make submissions to that body was invited by way of public advertisement to do so and I am pleased so many people did.  I do not think it would be appropriate to specify in this legislation that any directive which the Minister might issue should require a further resolution of the House before coming into effect.</P>
    <P>The issuing of directives of this nature falls within the ordinary decision-making functions of the Minister for Energy. That is not to say, of course, that I would not be anxious to ensure that this House and the other House were fully informed of any decisions I would make in regard to this matter.  Any Government policy is well publicised and made known to the Members of both Houses and I could be called here to answer for any particular policy decision I was making in this area and I would be delighted to come here and explain any policy decision that I was making in this or, indeed, any other area. That is the appropriate way to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>It would be highly inappropriate and unnecessarily cumbersome, and would make the Minister absolutely ineffectual, if one was to extend this principle.  People <Col N="986" /> are elected to office to make decisions and to achieve certain policy objectives. If the House is to take that power from the Minister, or to add this kind of cumbersome arrangement, then very little decision-making would apply in the various Departments.  It is the whole principle of this that cannot be conceded, because it is more or less saying that a Minister should not be allowed to implement his policies.  He is answerable for his policies, by all means.  He must come before either House, if asked to do so, to explain his policies.  He can be criticised publicly, either inside or outside the House, for his policy decisions. He can be rejected at a subsequent election but, for God's sake, do not tie down a Minister with these kind of cumbersome arrangements, where any decision he makes has a kind of stop put on it for an inordinate period of time.  It is totally impractical.</P>
    <P>Having been delighted to accept the other two sensible amendments, I am sorry I could not possibly accept this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sensible amendment as well.  The first point the Minister made is one of the reasons the amendment is here, namely, the quantity of land we are talking about.  The Minister said it is the size of a county of Ireland.  One twenty-sixth of our native heritage is to be disposed in this manner, which is an enormous amount of land.  If it is to be disposed of it is important that it be disposed of correctly.  I am not suggesting that all of the Minister's directives would not be implemented with proper consultation and with the benefit of the opinion of experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he was willing to come to this House, but there is no mechanism for him to come to this House unless we put a mechanism into the legislation. This mechanism is not a blocking mechanism.  It is a facilitating mechanism. Land the size of an entire county is now coming onstream in relation to cutaway bog but the Oireachtas is going to have no say about it.  It would merely be subject to a general directive of the Minister.  Notice that it is a &ldquo;general <Col N="987" /> directive&rdquo;; we are not talking about specific directives.  We are talking about a general statement of policies in relation to the use of cutaway bog.  That does not mean that 21 days is cumbersome, if we are talking about day-to-day decisions in very specific detail.  That is a different matter.  We are talking about general directives.</P>
    <P>There is no good reason why the Minister should say that this is a cumbersome process.  It is a reasonable process.  There is no in-built impediment to the Minister going ahead with it.  It is a facilitating process.  If there is something seriously wrong, as seen by the House &mdash; not in relation to the present Minister but in relation to any Minister of the day &mdash; it is important that that extra facility be left and that it be included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have seen a lot of legislation go through here and there is no way that one could accept this amendment and force a Minister to come in with it within 21 sitting days.  The Minister has made it quite clear how cumbersome it would be and that it could not be accepted.  The Senator said that there is no mechanism to bring in a Minister if one is not happy about something he is doing or not doing.  There is, and nobody has used it better than the Senator in a short time.  Senator Costello has used motions, Adjournment debates and all the rest.  Fair play to him; he learned fast. I am delighted the Minister was so lenient and agreed to the other two amendments, but there is no way this would work with any Bill, in this case or in future legislation.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann concerned that there is severe overcrowding in many prisons in Ireland; concerned that the rate of deaths in prison has increased alarmingly in recent years; nothing the many public calls for the closure of the Women's Prison, Mountjoy; noting the delay in publishing the annual report of the Mountjoy Visiting Committee for 1988; noting the rooftop protest against the conditions of their detention by prisoners infected by the AIDS virus; noting the high cost of imprisonment and the low rate of rehabilitation, condemns the present prison policy as gravely flawed and urges the Government to implement the major recommendations of the Whitaker Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we have been elected to the present Seanad we have seen crisis after crisis within the prisons.  We have had rooftop protests in a number of prisons.  We have had a number of self-inflicted injuries <Col N="989" /> resulting in four suicides in the last ten months.  We have had a litany of tragedies. There are the appalling conditions in the women's prisons, that have been described not just in statements made to me but in the Visiting Committee report for 1987 and 1988 and, I understand, for 1989, which has not been published yet. Only yesterday eight prisoners barricaded themselves in Limerick Prison and they inflicted injuries on themselves. That is not done lightly.  That is something that is done as a last resort, the cry of desperation from people who are being detained under very difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>The visiting committee had a dispute with the Minister for Justice.  He failed to publish their report for 18 months because he disagreed with some of the contents.  Then, in breach of his statutory duty, he failed to appoint a visiting committee for the first five months of this year.  We have had a visiting committee for only a little over two weeks in this year alone.  So, what forum do prisoners have for airing their complaints if that is the way the people in charge of prisoners deal with their business?</P>
    <P>I have been involved in prison reform since 1973.  At that time I was a founder member of the Prisoners' Rights Organisation, which had as its basic principle that the prison system should be overhauled. No survey or research or official inquiry had taken place since the previous century.  It was advocated that it should be overhauled on the lines that the sanction of imprisonment should be defined as the loss of liberty, which is the loss of a single right, and that after that prisoners should be entitled to all other human civil rights like any other citizen under the Constitution.  I want to see a situation where we moved from privileges to rights, from a situation where imprisonment itself was punishment to simply that the loss of liberty was the punishment. I have not seen much change over the last 17 years.</P>
    <P>I will go through the daily routine in the prisons.  A prisoner gets up at 8 o'clock in the morning, the cells are unlocked and the prisoner slops out.  The slopping out, of course, is an appalling experience <Col N="990" /> because of the lack of toilets in the cells prisoners must carry the chamber pots down the corridor.  This is very humiliating. At 8.30 a.m. breakfast is collected and again the prisoner is locked into his cell to eat his breakfast.  At 9 a.m. the cells are unlocked for work, recreation or exercise.  At 12.15 p.m. the prisoners are locked up again for two hours having collected their meal.  There is no communal eating in major prisons.  At 2.15 p.m. the cells are unlocked for work, recreation or exercise.  At 4.15 p.m. prisoners return to their cells, have tea there and are locked up until 5.15 p.m.  The cells are unlocked for recreation from 5.15 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. or thereabouts, then the prisoners return to their cells with supper and are locked up.  Lights go out at 10 p.m.  If we add up the length of time a prisoner spends in his cell, we see he is locked up for two-thirds of the day &mdash; every prisoner spends 16 hours a day in his cell.  The prisoners in St. Patrick's Institution, generally spend two more hours in their cell.</P>
    <P>That is the daily routine a prisoner has to endure.  On top of that there is very severe overcrowding in the prisons.  Look at the statistics in the last prison report &mdash; and, unfortunately, the last prison report was in 1988 and we are now into 1990. One of the problems with the Department of Justice is its tardiness in producing these reports for the public.  So we are never really up to date with what is going on in a formal public sense.</P>
    <P>Mountjoy Prison has, according to the 1988 report, 375 single cells and 103 double cells with a daily average of 574 prisoners, roughly 100 prisoners in excess of what should be there, or a quarter to a fifth of the population in that prison at any given time.  Likewise, Limerick Prison is overcrowded by almost onethird: they have 107 single cells and five double or multiple cells with a daily average of 164 prisoners.  As I said, these figures were published in the 1988 report and the situation has deteriorated since. Cork Prison is the most overcrowded, with 128 single cells, ten double cells and a daily average of 241 prisoners &mdash; again <Col N="991" /> these figures were for 1988 &mdash; 100 prisoners or three-quarters of the prison population or 75 per cent in excess of what should be the number there.  Arbour Hill Prison, Mountjoy Female Prison and St. Patrick's Institution are all packed to capacity and over-capacity at a lot of times.  That is the type of situation we have in our prisons in general.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the Visiting Committee's report for 1988, just to give an idea of how the Visiting Committee saw the situation.  In relation to overcrowding in Mountjoy Prison they said:</P>
    <P>The number of prisoners confined in Mountjoy continued to rise during the year and far exceeds the capacity for which it was designed.  In the male prison there have been over 600 prisoners on a number of occasions.  The accommodation at the end of the year in the male prison was 588 prisoners in 482 cells.</P>
    <P>That is 100 cells fewer than the official statistic given in the prison report in which there is a lot of anomalies.  That is the visiting committee.  These are the people who monitor what is going on in the prison.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>Prisoners were confined one to a cell except for the following: 100 single cells occupied by two persons; 1 double cell occupied by three persons; 3 double cells occupied by four persons; 1 double cell occupied by five persons.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned that this overcrowding continues.  As mentioned above it has a very bad effect on management, morale, work, recreation. In our opinion, it has reached unacceptable levels.  On occasion there has been no appropriate place available to detain violent prisoners.  Some prisoners are spending almost all of the 24 hours in their cells.  We receive many complaints from prisoners that others are being released before the expiration of their sentence whilst those on a shorter and less serious offence are detained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> In other words, a haphazard policy is operating.</P>
    <P>In previous years, after investigations, we could always supply a reasonable answer.  The programme of planned releases appears to be another casualty of overcrowding.</P>
    <P>There is no proper planning in relation to releases of a temporary nature or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Because of the overcrowding, prisoners are at times held in corrugated steel cabins with no ventilation, awaiting vacant cells.  On hot summer days we have observed up to 18 men detained there from morning until late evening, conditions are shocking, with the prisoners stripped to their underclothing because of the heat.  We have previously protested about these cabins.  Prisoners should not be detained under these conditions.  There should be no further delay in rectifying the situation.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why Wheatfield Prison has not been opened and why accommodation is available at Fort Mitchel while Mountjoy Prison suffers from such severe overcrowding. Wheatfield has been opened to a degree since but it is still far from being fully utilised whereas the other prisons are grossly overcrowded.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice did not dispute that part of the visiting committee's report and that is a massive indictment of the prison system in terms of the overcrowding and in terms of its incapacity to operate effectively.  The cells are nine feet by six feet, which are not suitable for doubling up; 75 per cent of the cells in our prisons have no toilets and that compares with only 50 per cent in Britain.  We are hearing all the complaints about the conditions in Britain but Britain has a policy to have flush toilets in all the cells in their prisons by the end of the century.  We have no such policy and we have 75 per cent of the cells where we have got this <Col N="993" /> humiliating throwback to the last century, to 200 years ago, of slopping out on a daily basis; and now, with two people occupying cells that were designed in the middle of the 19th century for one person, we have an atrocious situation in terms of personal hygiene and of privacy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the AIDS virus, that has been a development that has taken place in the past four to five years.  We saw earlier this year the rather pathetic protest, a peaceful protest by people who got on to the roof of the prison and they were all suffering from the AIDS virus. They were protesting against the conditions of their detention in the secure unit and in the basement, because that is where the people who were in need of medical attention are being kept, in two areas designed as punishment areas, the segregation or secure unit and the basement which has got artificial light.  That is a terrible way of dealing with people who have major medical problems.  They consider themselves, like lepers of old, being segregated, being kept apart by the authorities and the finger pointed at them and, as a result, many of them become suicidal and self-injuries are inflicted. Indeed, only last week a man had to be taken to the Mater Hospital with a very serious neck injury because he simply wanted to get out of the prison.  He wrote a letter to me and it was certainly very tragic to read about his suicidal feelings about being there, whereas he had not felt the same in any other part of the prison.</P>
    <P>In relation to the actual segregation of people apart from that, that is an area where segregation should not take place, but where segregation should take place is where there are remand prisoners, particularly in the women's section, mixed up with prisoners who were convicted, where there are young prisoners with old prisoners.  The women's prison is particularly bad in this respect.  There are young teenage girls with much older women in their twenties, thirties and forties, juvenile and adults.</P>
    <P>We have a Dickensian type approach to our institutions in terms of how we operate our prisons.  In Mountjoy we <Col N="994" /> have the biggest drug centre in Ireland where drugs are readily available.  I am talking about hard drugs where prisoners have died of overdoses of drugs that are illegally smuggled into prison.  We have a situation now in Mountjoy where approximately 40 per cent of the population are in for drug-related offences.</P>
    <P>On the question of health, there is only a physical examination for anybody who comes into prison.  There is no psychological or psychiatric examination to determine what their mental condition is like, to determine whether they have got a mental handicap or any sort of mental disorder or whether it is appropriate that they should be in that type of closed claustrophobic institution where they will inflict self-injury and perhaps death. There was a study done last month by Dr. Arthur Connor and Dr. Helen O'Neill of prisoners who had been transferred to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum and they found that 4 per cent of those transferred since the beginning of the year were mentally handicapped and they had not been diagnosed as such in the main body of the prison because there was no survey done on their admission. Studies, according to the two doctors, suggest that the level of mental handicap in the prisons is at least up to 10 per cent.  If we combine that with low IQ and learning difficulties, we are certainly talking about 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Indeed, a recent parliamentary question on the level of illiteracy, showed that while there are no statistics on it, the Minister was prepared to say it was in the region of a quarter to a third.  That was mentioned by the Minister himself. There is not a satisfactory level of participation in education.  In the male prison in Mountjoy in 1988, 33 per cent of the prison population participated, 40 per cent in Cork and 39 per cent in the juvenile prison, St. Patrick's Institution. Even in Shelton Abbey, which is an open prison, only 34 per cent participated. That is quite a low level of participation. We are talking not about a regular regime.  The women's prison in Mountjoy is supposed to have a 56 per cent level, but when I visited the prison the women <Col N="995" /> who were there said that what that amounted to was maybe 20 minutes a week.  That is not exactly a high level of education.  They were conducting the classes in an old prefabricated hut where the water came through on wet days. That is far from satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I mentioned prison deaths.  We have had, as I said, four prison deaths since this Seanad came into existence, and that is an alarming increase on what the situation used to be.  In the sixties there were virtually none, in the seventies there was one or two, in the eighties they began to increase and in the past couple of years they have begun to increase alarmingly. We are now talking in the region of four to five per annum and that certainly has brought us into line with what the situation is worldwide, whereas we were well below the international average.  Now, not only have we come up to it, but we are exceeding it.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has set up an inquiry, but what good is an inquiry? We already had inquests.  We had internal inquiries by the Department of Justice and I know a study has been done by the psychologist in the probation service and that that is available for the Minister.  The work is being done, but what are we going to get?  What is the Minister's response? Another committee is sitting.  When are we going to have an end to committees, when are we going to get some action on the problems we know exist?</P>
    <P>The conditions in the women's prison, where we had the tragic suicide of Sharon Cregg last March, are absolutely appalling. I will read what the visiting committee said about the women's prison:</P>
    <P>During the year [1988] two detention cells were constructed in the women's prison.  They measured 4' x 7' x 7' high, approximately.  There was no daylight in either cell and no emergency bell,</P>
    <P>This is what was constructed in the women's prison in 1988.</P>
    <P>In our opinion, these cells, the size of a modern toilet cubicle, furnished <Col N="996" /> only with a mattress and blanket, would have a severe effect on a disruptive prisoner and could have a devastating effect on a claustrophobic one. We have requested that they be enlarged, that some means of daylight be provided, also emergency bells, and that prisoners only be detained for a limited and specified period.  Extended detention should only be allowed on the written authorisation of a Governor, a Deputy or Assistant Governor.</P>
    <P>There has been no dispute with the Minister for Justice on that particular point. The next point they deal with is:</P>
    <P>We are appalled that male officers attired in helmets and visors and equipment with riot shields should chase and baton female prisoners in enclosed areas.  The use of such force even to quell such disturbance is abusive.  In the heat of the moment the excitement and fear of such confrontation is increased dramatically.  The use of excessive force should be forbidden and new rules introduced to prevent its recurrence.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of that last point, the fact that the authorities should devise two detention cells of the most confined nature that you would not find in the Second World War in a concentration camp, and that that is the way they deal with problems in the women's prison, it is absolutely outrageous.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of the prisons, this year the prison system is costing £62.5 million and that works out at £31,500 per annum, or £600 per week per person.  So, each person incarcerated on our prisons at the present time costs the taxpayer £31,500 per annum or £600 per week.  That is roughly £100 per day.  That is the cost to the State for the type of system we are getting and that is not very good.</P>
    <P>We have a level of recidivism that is on the increase, particularly among the young.  In St. Patrick's Institution the increase from 1983 to 1987 &mdash; unfortunately, those are the last figures that are available because we do not have <Col N="997" /> the reports coming out on a sufficiently regular basis &mdash; was a 40 per cent recidivist rate in 1983 to a 54 per cent recidivist rate in 1987.  That is in respect of the youngest of our prison population, the people who should be kept out of prison, in regard to whom every effort should be made to ensure that they are steered away from the cycle of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>We must urgently address reform of the prison system.  The Minister who is responsible for it has been negligent in regard to it.  It is all before him &mdash; 1985 the Whitaker Committee of Inquiry into the Prison System gave the official account of what should be done.  We must get a definition of imprisonment along the lines I spoke about already stating that the prison was a sanction where only one of the citizen's rights was going to be taken away.  That is what the Whitaker inquiry states as well.  Prison conditions have to be improved, and there is a whole section on it in the recommendations.  A prison board must be established which would take the day-to-day running from the Department of Justice, which is a bureaucracy that cannot deal with it properly.  We require an inspectorate to monitor the prison system, visiting committees with real power, the alternatives to prison which are outlined by the Whitaker committee.  There is a whole range of measures outlined.  They have to be introduced.  The women's prison must be closed, that is what Whitaker says.  There is no point in refurbishing it.  A medical director was three months waiting for that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I formally second the <Col N="998" /> motion.  Prisons have been a major source of public interest for the past ten to 20 years.  Prior to that they did not rate and the fact that they have been gaining such public interest is in many ways an indication of the extent to which things have deteriorated.  Deaths have increased alarmingly, as Senator Costello has said. We have had four deaths in prison since this Seanad came into existence on 1 November 1989.  We have had the rooftop protest recently and on top of that there is the high cost of imprisonment and the low rates of rehabilitation in prison.  In addition to all of these problems there is the new and terrible difficulties arising from the presence of AIDS victims in the prison system.</P>
      <P>The Whitaker report has been published for approximately five years and we await the implementation of its recommendations.  It recommends the use of alternative sanctions to imprisonment. There is need for far greater efforts to be made to streamline this type of approach rather than continuing with the old-fashioned ways that have long since proved ineffective by way of providing reform.  There is need for open structures where prisoners who are not a threat to the community can be treated on an open prison basis and allowed to fill a certain function within the community rather than being ruined by being held in the prison system when that is not a necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, there is the whole philosophical approach of using prison as something of a last resort.  That certainly does not appear to be the case at present. There have been very few changes in the prison system over the past 16 years. Effectively, the building in Mountjoy is Dickensian.  It dates from the last century, the facilities there are totally inadequate, prisoners of differing categories are lumped together under the same conditions, remand and convicted prisoners are kept in the same environment.  Prisoners with differing levels of conviction are all kept together.  There does not seem to be any clearly established criteria as to the levels of accommodation which are acceptable for prisoners in prison.  I <Col N="999" /> think it is imperative that clear standards and guidelines should be laid down as to what is acceptable by way of the levels of accommodation, the type of accommodation, the floor space, the level of facilities which are basic to any civilised standards in prison.  There is a clear need to spell those out and to adhere to them.</P>
    <P>There is then the awful problem of AIDS.  This is an especially sad and appalling problem, reflecting the development of this disease in society at large.  Given the way AIDS has developed and given the way this problem can be anticipated to develop, it is fair to say it can be expected that the AIDS problem will get worse in the prison community unless very definite and clear action is taken.  I believe the time is now appropriate to establish a committee of experts who will look into this problem of AIDS specifically in prison and set about finding what is the best way to handle this problem, because we have a very serious medical problem which is complex because of the environment in which AIDS patients who are prisoners find themselves in.  It is very important that some clear initiatives be taken to sort out that problem.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the women's prison.  Again, I agree with my colleague, Senator Costello, when he suggests that the only real answer here is to close it down, and that is also in accord with the Whitaker report.  It seems to me to be quite unnecessary to house of the order of 40 to 50 women prisoners in the prison system when it appears that perhaps of the order of five to ten are as many as need to be maintained in a secure environment. The rest are simply housed in prison for reasons which relate to administration, to an inappropriate philosophy and so on.  Many of the people who finish up in prison are victims of society and that is the reason they are there.  In many ways we have not laid adequate emphasis on the need to set about prevention rather than, as it were, using prisons as a form of treatment which does not work.</P>
    <P>That takes me on to the amendment which is put down in the name of the <Col N="1000" /> Government.  This is a truly remarkable and spectacular piece of work.  It must have been taken directly from the man who writes those resolutions for the clár for the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, when he is really on top of his game, because all that is missing is &ldquo;new scenarios&rdquo; and &ldquo;meaningful situations at appropriate moments in time in our society&rdquo;, if I can get all the clichés to come flowing out together.  First, it &ldquo;commends the establishment of an Advisory Group on Prison Deaths&rdquo;&mdash; advice.  It &ldquo;notes the intention to refurbish extensively the Women's Prison&rdquo;&mdash; it notes an intention.  It &ldquo;notes the high level of services&rdquo; provided for offenders with the AIDS plus virus. When it says it &ldquo;notes the high level of service&rdquo;, I find it hard to take this seriously, except perhaps that the person who drafted this has in mind height as in the AIDS victims being on the roof of Mountjoy.  But that is about as far as I can figure out how high levels of service for AIDS victims can be appropriate in the context here.  It talks of plans for a new unit for offenders with special medical problems &mdash; again, plans.  Wheatfield is open, but it is just about open and certainly it has not become fully effective. St. Patrick's, it says, is being refurbished, but when you read the resolution it talks in terms of things taking place for the refurbishment of St. Patrick's.  It talks of &ldquo;many positive developments&rdquo; taking place.  We are getting better.  Really, this is super stuff: &ldquo;the establishment of a Sentence Review Group, the imminent appointment of a medical director, substantial measures to improve, constructive and effective responses&rdquo;&mdash; all the clichés are put together in one motion.  Where is the beef?  This amendment draws attention to the fact that there has not been any action.  It mentions reviews and good intentions.  The Whitaker report was published in 1985.  The time for talking is past and it is now time for action.  I hope the Minister will give us concrete timescales.  I do not like this advisory business, and so on.  I could advise myself.  That is basically tomfoolery, the kind of stuff one would expect on the clár at the Ard Fheis.</P>

    <P>It is vitally important that we do not lose sight of the fact that priority must be the protection of the public against habitual criminals.  It appals me when I hear some of my colleagues on the other side of the House speaking in terms of the 11th and 12th century prison set-ups I used to come across when studying legal history.</P>
    <P>Senators mentioned current tragedies. In the recent crisis in Limerick Prison some prisoners inflicted wounds on themselves. To a certain extent and I am not being offensive to any of my colleagues on the opposite side, the hype that is generated by such unbalanced statements fuels the fire that makes these people wound themselves.  For example, one of the prisoners concerned in Limerick was a man who committed an atrocious murder in my constituency.  He was convicted and is serving a life sentence.  He tortured a man who came from New Zealand for four days.  Eventually he killed him and dumped his body.  These are the type of people Senators Costello and Upton wish to protect.  If that man inflicts wounds on himself in order to gain publicity for his imprisonment, then he should get no sympathy.</P>

I remember on a number of occasions serving as secretary to a Bar Association and meeting with various judges of the District Court, Circuit Court and High Court.  None of them wanted to send anybody to prison but when they came up against a situation where the public <Col N="1003" /> had to be protected as a last resort they were obliged to impose a prison sentence. It must not be forgotten that there are approximately 2,100 people in our prisons. They are being looked after and fed.  Roughly £68 million is spent on our prison service trying to keep hardened criminals off the streets.</P>
      <P>Take the situation at Strangeways in Manchester.  The only comparison one can make between that prison and Mountjoy Prison is the fact that one is dealing with old buildings, etc.  In Strangeways there are three prisoners in a cell and they are locked up for 23 hours a day.  In the Irish prisons the prisoners are normally out of their cells from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m.  They are entitled to recreation and sometimes to education. Various other facilities are provided such as medical facilities, etc.  That point should be noted.  On a current issue, prisoners are being allowed to watch the World Cup even after 8 p.m. when they should normally be in their cells.  For example, next Sunday night when Ireland play Egypt they will be allowed special concessions to watch the match.  This is at enormous cost and inconvenience.  It is a major point but I am trying to bring some balance to the debate.  I will be the first to admit that there are certain inadequacies in the prison service.  The Minister is sympathetic to the problems and progress is being made in this area.</P>
      <P>In relation to services, there are chaplains, psychiatrists and psychologists. There are in the region of 100 teachers providing educational services for those who are illiterate, and for those who are at primary, secondary or university level. The open university system is used.  These facilities are given to those who wish to avail of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Death by suicide in our prisons is a problem but we must realise, and it is accepted generally by psychiatrists, psychologists and medical experts, that this is a growing problem in society and it not only affects prisons.  In a four month period in 1985 there were four prison deaths.  The total in 1988 and 1989 was <Col N="1004" /> four.  It is still far too many but we must keep this matter in context.</P>
    <P>Alternatives to prison sentences have been mentioned.  I am quite satisfied that we have a wide ranging set of alternatives. We have fines, probation and community service orders.  Every district justice, Circuit Court Judge and High Court Judge has an in-built system to use community service orders.  From my experience as a lawyer working in the Munster area, this has been widely and successfully used.  It is being used also in other parts of the country.  It is something to be commended.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote some figures from the Council of Europe document.  The rate of imprisonment per 100,000 of the population is 98.2 in the UK; 106.2 in Scotland; 86.7 in West Germany; 92 in France; 96 in Austria and 56 in the Republic of Ireland.  Of 22 countries surveyed, we are sixth from the top when it comes to providing good services.  In relation to accommodation it must not be forgotten that the Government are spending £8 million on refurbishment. The Wheatfield Prison which is being filled by way of transfers etc. is now 80 per cent full and hopefully by the end of the year it will be 100 per cent operational. St. Patrick's is being fully refurbished and in Mountjoy special units are being built to provide facilities for people with contagious diseases such as HIV, TB, etc.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that the public be protected and that a certain balance be brought to the debate.  If some Senators on the other side had their way prisoners would not be in prison cells but in Butlins, the Burlington or Jurys.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I am very pleased that the amendment is phrased in positive terms which are in contrast to the negative, unbalanced picture of prison conditions which the motion seeks to portray.  People who consistently speak about the negative side of prisons seldom show the same concern for the victims of crime.  They seldom focus on the trauma, suffering and loss <Col N="1005" /> that is inflicted on victims.  Everybody acknowledges the need for a prison system.  Prisons exist in this and every other country to protect the public from the activities of criminals and to detain socially dangerous persons.  Hopefully they also serve as a deterrent to those who would seek to deprive others of their rights and freedom.</P>
      <P>As in other countries, the prison service has become more difficult in recent years.  This is because the prison population is increasing due to the fact that crime is on the increase.  Crimes are becoming more violent and the system has to deal with prisoners who are very often addicted to drugs or who are in prison for drug related offences.  Some prisoners have infectious diseases, such as the HIV virus and some have full blown AIDS.  All these factors tend to exacerbate the tensions which inevitably exist in a prison.</P>
      <P>Every reasonable person wants to see a prison system which is humane, efficient and which as far as possible will help to rehabilitate prisoners.  Our prison system operates on the basis set out in the Whitaker report, namely, that imprisonment should be regarded as an imposed penalty and that nothing should be done to inflict hardship or punishment beyond what is an inevitable consequence of imprisonment, and that regulations for the management of prisoners should be based on the principle that the fundamental human rights of a person in custody should not be interfered with or encroached upon except to the extent inevitably associated with imprisonment. I am satisfied that our prison system meets these criteria that it is a humane, efficient and as far as possible, rehabilitative system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody acknowledges that some problems exist in relation to accommodation. There is some overcrowding. I compliment the Minister for what he has done to date to deal with these problems. It is unrealistic for anybody to suggest closing prisons because the cost of providing new prisons would be totally prohibitive.  The Minister is implementing a very realistic programme of <Col N="1006" /> renovation and refurbishment and, as Senator O'Donovan mentioned, he is spending £8 million in the current year on that programme.  Senator O'Donovan mentioned what is being done to improve accommodation.  Our prisons, for the most part, are old buildings.  Renovation takes times but it is being carried out on a planned basis.  I also compliment the Minister on the fact that he is providing detention facilities for young girls.</P>
    <P>The level of support services in our prisons &mdash; the chaplaincy, medical, psychological and psychiatric services &mdash; are up to a very high standard.  There is medical care for prisoners with infectious diseases.  Prisoners have access to education. They have access to library facilities, to games and various other activities, and to the work training programmes that are in operation.  Our system is a reasonably satisfactory one and the Minister is to be complimented on it.</P>
    <P>As regards the delay in publication of the 1988 report, the Minister was perfectly right to delay publication until he had investigated the allegation made by the visiting committee.</P>

      <P>Senators Upton and Costello remind me of two school children on top of a glass roof prison throwing pebbles.  These two same Senators and their party were in Government for four and a half years and what exactly did they do for prisoners during their time in office?  The answer is absolutely nothing. The Whitaker report has been thrown up to us.  It is only right to remind the Senators that people in glasshouses should not throw stones.  As regards Senator Costello's contribution he seems to be extremely conscious of prisoners' rights.  At times I wish that same concern was expressed for prison officers who have an extremely difficult task to perform. Very often the pronouncements from the likes of Senator Costello and others make the difficult task these prison officers have to perform even more difficult. In many instances, and I am afraid to say it, one would ask if this encourages <Col N="1007" /> further misconduct and misbehaviour by long-term prisoners.</P>

      <P>A number of statements have been made in this debate that are factually incorrect.  Before I was interrupted, I was complimenting Senator Mullooly on the fact that he was conscious of the people against whom crimes are committed.  The issue of severe overcrowding has been mentioned.  Senator Upton mentioned Wheatfield Prison and the fact that there is hardly anybody there.  My understanding is that there is an 80 per cent occupancy rate at Wheatfield and that before the end of the year <Col N="1008" /> that prison will be totally occupied.  St. Patrick's Institution is being totally refurbished. If a unit is closed down when refurbishment work is being carried out obviously that will have a knock-on effect.  That has to be accepted.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment very much. The Minister has taken very positive steps towards alleviating problems within the prison service and he should be complimented for what he has done to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate.  I have, over the past few months, called for such a debate to recognise the serious situation we have in our prisons.  Overcrowding is the main problem.  My party on numerous occasions, and I on several occasions, called on the Government to establish a criminal law reform commission to advise and report on the updating of criminal law.  I support the view that we should have alternatives to prison for minor offences such as non-payment of fines and debts.  It is absurd that our prisons are clogged up with offenders who do not pay their fines or debts at a cost to the taxpayer in excess of £600 per week.  Prisons should be reserved for those who commit serious crimes against the person and against property.  They are the people who should serve their full sentence with only time off for good behaviour.</P>
      <P>Last year 1,000 prisoners were committed for non-payment of fines and 250 for non-payment of debts.  The cost to the taxpayer to keep one person in prison per annum is £31,200.  I do not believe this is acceptable.  The Law Reform Commission should look at alternatives. Maybe there should be an increase in the level of fines.  There should be more effective non-custodial sanctions in the event of non-payment of fines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A range of alternatives to prison must be considered.  For example, the confiscation of property or assets should be available to enforce such fines.  During the Second Stage debate on the Larceny Bill I proposed the extension of compensation to the victims of crimes particularly in the case of old people who are often traumatised and do not recover <Col N="1009" /> from the effects of attacks and robberies. Where there is default in such compensation, the confiscation or attachment of income where possible should be used. Where this is not possible, an extension of the present approach to community service should be substituted rather than putting people in prison.  The opportunity to pay fines by instalments must also be examined.  Many people will not have the ready cash to pay a fine and rather than putting them in prison an approach should be made to allow them to pay by instalment.</P>
    <P>Drug trafficking is a growing menace to society and it will grow over a period of time especially when we open our borders in 1992.  I have brought up this issue in the House on several occasions. Nobody seems to take any notice of me but this will be a serious situation post-1992. The assets of professional criminals and those who amass vast amounts of money from ill-gotten gains should be confiscated.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the rate of crime outside Dublin, especially violent crime. Those who commit such crimes must serve their full sentence rather than have the revolving door approach we have at the moment.  Full-term prison sentences must be served by those who claim political motivation and who are a serious threat to society and to the State.  Those who commit homicide, grave crimes against the person, organised crime, drug pushers, armed robbery, taking property with serious violence or those who attack the elderly must know that if convicted they will serve full sentences.</P>
    <P>I condemn what happened in Limerick Prison.  Two of the people who committed those acts over the weekend were well-known drug traffickers from Dublin. They should serve their full sentence.  The present overcrowding in prisons results in these people being released and this should be tackled.  It is wrong to say that we do not have a problem in our prisons. We have a dual problem, the problem of overcrowding and the problem of early release of serious offenders.  The present level of crime is intolerable and the Government must do more to discharge <Col N="1010" /> their fundamental duty to maintain law and order.</P>
    <P>One-third of offences are committed by those under 17 years of age and special mention should be made of this.  They suffer from emotional, physical and cultural deprivation.  Most of the crimes are petty stealing and it is rare that first time crimes are committed by those over 17 years of age.  We should take that into account.  Prison is a training ground for such people.  We must attack this problem by increasing the life opportunities for these people and by a careful programme of rehabilitation and education. The aim should be to keep offenders away from future criminal activities and out of prison.  We should concentrate on providing further education, training, welfare and guidance to try to ensure that those who are in prison are helped to become constructive members of society. Alcohol and drug abuse can lead to crime and I was very disappointed to note that last week a course for alcoholics was cancelled in Mountjoy because funds were not available to run it.  I would like to pay tribute to the prison service and officers and to the Garda for maintaining law and order as far as they can given their limited resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Neville for allowing me to have some of his time.  It is obvious that Senator O'Keeffe never read any Labour Party policies.  They cost us five seats in 1969.  The Labour Party are not only concerned about prisoners rights and human rights.  We are concerned about prison officers because of the nature of their work.  On and off duty they are exposed to attacks by inmates and to varying degrees of injuries including the death of one off-duty officer, Mr. Stack, about which we are very sorry.  We also went on to point out the problem of unstable offenders, the problems of prison officers trying to maintain order and discipline and being in a position to physically prevent escape from custody, ensuring prisoners are not subject to physical attack by other prisoners, the whole question of these officers having to <Col N="1011" /> work in a hostile environment and the dangers that are created for them there.</P>
      <P>How did the dangers arise?  The reason the officers are subjected to this danger is that while we agree that people have to be incarcerated and have to be punished for crimes of violence, lawlessness, vandalism, etc., we cannot ignore human rights.  When you put them into conditions where there is clear evidence of sheer degradation, which is verified by the Whitaker report, then you have to make up your mind that the reason is that the jails are largely old, cramped and starved of funds.  This is what has been happening over the years.  It does not matter which Government did it.  As long as the numbers in prisons continue to increase there will be severe overcrowding. The prison officers and everyone else will be exposed to this danger.</P>
      <P>Crime prevention is too big an area to talk about.  We have not got the time to debate it here but it would have been very desirable if we had been able to discuss it.  The aim of the motion was to put pressure on the Government to implement the spirit of the Whitaker recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to begin by saying that the ground covered by this Labour Party motion has been well furrowed over the years and particularly so in the recent past.  The Minister for Justice has dealt with various Dáil questions, a motion in this House and also made public statements on the matters raised.  It is, of course, the right of any Senator or group of Senators to demand further debate and I welcome the opportunity of contributing to it.  I have no doubt, however, that on the basis of what the Minister for Justice has said time and time again on many of the issues raised and on the basis of what I am about to say here today, this House will recognise that the amendment proposed to the Labour Party motion by Senator Denis O'Donovan is fully justified and that it deserves to be carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party motion consists of a <Col N="1012" /> number of elements.  It is best if I deal with them one by one.  First, there is a reference to &ldquo;severe overcrowding&rdquo;.  The Minister for Justice has never denied that there are accommodation problems in Irish prisons.  This problem did not begin when he took up office &mdash; there have been accommodation pressures for years. I am sure the House will recognise, however, that he certainly has not sat on this problem.  He has, in fact, taken a number of measures which I believe will make a valuable contribution.  It is appropriate to remind the House again of some of these.</P>
    <P>Last year he indicated that the new prison in Wheatfield would be brought to half occupancy level by the end of the year &mdash; this was achieved.  Wheatfield is now 80 per cent occupied and will be fully occupied by the end of this year when the necessary staff become available.</P>
    <P>He secured Government approval for the necessary expenditure on a special unit for those known to be HIV positive. I am glad to say that planning work on this project is now well advanced and that construction will commence in the near future.  Demolition of existing structures and site clearance have already taken place.</P>
    <P>The Minister also secured Government approval for the complete refurbishment of the St. Patrick's Institution complex which includes the Women's Prison.  One of the wings has already been vacated and work on this project, too, will begin in the near future.  I should mention, incidentally, that one of the side effects of a substantial refurbishment programme is that there is an inevitable loss of prison places for certain periods with consequent pressures on accommodation elsewhere. This indeed is recognised in the Whitaker report which states.</P>
    <P>The repair and modernisation of existing prison buildings must also be undertaken.  It is estimated that the renovation programme, even with the best planning techniques, would take an average of 200 places out of service over a lengthy period.</P>
    <P>The total provision for prison capital and <Col N="1013" /> maintenance works in the current year is £8 million.</P>
    <P>There are two further approaches to accommodation pressures, i.e. build new prisons or employ alternatives to custody to a greater extent.  An extensive building programme had been drawn up in the early 1980s with plans for new prisons in Cork, Portlaoise, Wheatfield and a total reconstruction of Mountjoy.  However, because of the widely agreed need to curtail public expenditure at that time, a decision was taken to proceed with the Wheatfield project only.  The economic arguments underlying that decision still hold good.  The fact is that the restoration of that building programme could run to hundreds of millions of pounds of public expenditure.  While recognising that the question of providing some additional accommodation is one which certainly has to be borne in mind as an option &mdash; it is something which obviously depends on crime and imprisonment rates &mdash; the Minister's view is that the appropriate course, now, is to examine further the idea of providing more alternatives to custody as envisaged in the Whitaker report.  In fact it may be more a question of providing for more extensive use of alternatives than extending the range of alternatives because many of the alternatives mentioned in the Whitaker report were already in place and are now quite extensively used.  There are about 3,000 offenders on alternatives of one kind or another as against approximately 2,100 in custody.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated elsewhere that he is having this matter specifically examined by his Department at the present time with a view to deciding what measures might be taken to secure a more extended use of alternatives.  I would have to enter a note of caution, however, as he has done consistently whenever the subject of alternatives is raised by making the point that, for a substantial number of offenders in prisons, the idea of serving sentences in the community is just not on.  It is simply not true &mdash; the Minister has repeated this point over and over again &mdash; that prisons are chock-a-block with minor offenders such as fine <Col N="1014" /> defaulters and debtors.  People in this category occupy only about 1 to 2 per cent of prison places, on an annualised basis, because they serve very short sentences.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second issue referred to in the motion, the concern that &ldquo;the rate of deaths in prisons has increased alarmingly in recent years&rdquo;, let me say, first, that I am sure this House will agree that in discussing this very sad problem it is desirable to begin by getting the facts right.  While I have no wish to play with statistics &mdash; each death is a tragedy &mdash; it is important that the House should be aware that the number of apparent suicides in 1989 was four which was the same as the figure for 1988.  More significantly, however, the figure for one four month period in 1985-86 was also four.  The figures, in other words, fluctuate. This is no consolation but it benefits nobody, least of all those who may be disposed to take their lives and need our help, to begin talking about &ldquo;alarming&rdquo; increases without looking at the facts.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that prison deaths are a worldwide phenomenon and successive Ministers have made this point.  It is a fact also, sadly, that suicide is a community issue.  It is not simply a prisons problem and it is clearly illogical, in the light of this, to attempt to blame all suicides on prison conditions such as accommodation pressures.  The fact is that prisoners have died in single cells as well as cells with more than one occupant.  And it is also a fact that the expert medical advice in some cases is that offenders at risk should be placed in single cells and in others that they should not be placed in such cells.</P>
    <P>On this issue, again, the Minister took an important initiative.  While recognising that prison suicides are a worldwide phenomenon and an extremely complex problem, he felt that it was an issue which should be made the subject of specific examination and that is why he established an expert group to look at the problem.  He expects to be examining some interim recommendations by this group in the very near future.</P>
    <P>With regard to calls for the &ldquo;closure of <Col N="1015" /> the Women's Prison in Mountjoy&rdquo;, which is the next element in the motion, I have to say that the closure of that prison, now, is quite simply impractical.  The relatively small number of women involved &mdash; about 35 in custody with 15 or so on temporary release at any one time &mdash; includes some quite serious offenders including drug traffickers and two murderers. I am sure nobody would suggest that offenders in this category should simply be set free if the institution were closed today.  I believe that the policy the Minister for Justice has adopted, that is, the total refurbishment of the women's prison, is the only feasible option, at least in the relatively short term.  Other options may have to be looked at in the longer term.  Demands have been made for the construction of a new women's prison but this, with the best will in the world and on the basis of all available experience, is something which would take several years from the time of decision in principle to actual delivery.  I am sure nobody seriously suggests it is wrong to make a serious attempt to improve conditions in that prison in the relatively short term.</P>
    <P>The next reference in the Labour Party motion is to: &ldquo;The delay in publishing the Annual Report of the Mountjoy Visiting Committee for 1988&rdquo;.  The Minister has explained the reasons for this delay very fully in a statement which he issued some time ago and which now is included as a preface to the report.  The facts, in a nutshell, are that the Visiting Committee in a report which is said to be &ldquo;for the calendar year 1988&rdquo; expressed itself &ldquo;appalled&rdquo; that male officers attired in helmets and equipped with riot shields should chase and baton female prisoners in enclosed areas.  This was an extremely grave allegation and since neither he nor his Department knew anything about such an incident taking place either in 1988 or at any time, it was obviously incumbent on him to investigate the matter.  It turned out that the incident took place in 1986 and while, as he has said elsewhere, he has no wish to be <Col N="1016" /> involved in controversies with any Visiting Committees I think it reasonable, in fairness to staff who have to deal with disturbances of the kind which took place in 1986, when chairs and other items were hurled at female officers, to ask why the committee, which expressed itself to be &ldquo;appalled&rdquo; in 1988, had remained completely silent on the issue for some years. They could have reported the matter to the then Minister in their annual report, in any of their monthly reports or in a special report.  They had statutory power to conduct an investigation but for some reason or other they did not follow any of these courses.  Statements have since been made by four women concerning this matter as a result of which he immediately requested the Garda Commissioner to investigate the allegations which they made.  For this reason, I am sure the House will accept that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reference in the Labour Party motion to: &ldquo;the rooftop protest against the conditions of their detention by prisoners infected by the AIDS virus&rdquo; I would again appeal to the House to have some regard to the facts which, incidentally, the Minister fully outlined in reply to the Private Notice Question in the Dáil on 8 May.  The first fact is that five of the ten offenders who appeared on the rooftop are not in the segregation unit because they are known to be HIV positive.  They are in special detention on one of the landings, segregated from the HIV offenders because, and only because, they are among the most difficult prisoners in the system.</P>
    <P>With regard to &ldquo;the conditions&rdquo; in which HIV victims are detained, it is important to mention a few more facts. In the first place, those involved in the protest are detained in the segregation unit in Mountjoy which was totally refurbished only a few years ago.  Secondly, it is not correct to describe it as overcrowded. Thirdly, the oft-repeated assertion that those concerned are deprived of medical services appropriate to the HIV infection is simply without foundation.  They are attended daily by <Col N="1017" /> a doctor who specialises in treating the condition and are referred to hospitals for appropriate treatment as and when medically advised.  Those suffering from drug addiction &mdash; the reality unfortunately is that both problems very often go hand-in-hand&mdash;also receive appropriate treatment, advice and counselling.  Some evidence of the truth in this is provided by the fact that offenders suffering from the HIV virus who have been released from Mountjoy have actually sought to have their periods of release terminated in order to avail of the services provided.</P>
    <P>Those who have read the above mentioned report of the Mountjoy Visiting Committee for 1988 will note that while they express concern about the health and safety of prisoners and indicated that they would be issuing a special report, which incidentally was not received, they also state:</P>
    <P>The health of most prisoners is very good.  Indeed, the health of many prisoners, especially drug abusers, improves while they are in prison. Access to hospitals and medication is better than it is for many members of the public.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment suggest that everything is perfect.  The Minister's decision to build a special unit for those suffering from contagious diseases is a clear acknowledgement on his part that we could possibly do more, and indeed demonstrates in a very practical way his determination to do so.  Expressions of concern are all very well and are understandable but, at the end of the day, what counts is action and he is taking positive action.</P>
    <P>The main point he is making is that the picture conjured up in relation to &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; in the segregation unit are not very closely matched by the facts as I am sure most of those who have visited the unit, indeed whom the Minister has facilitated in visiting the unit, will acknowledge.  What is extremely worrying, is the implication that the life-threatening behaviour which took place during this so-called &ldquo;protest&rdquo; is somehow justified. The action taken by prisoners was <Col N="1018" /> utterly disproportionate and I have no doubt this House will agree that comments tending to imply that it was somehow justified are very unbalanced indeed.</P>
    <P>On the subject of balance, the 1988 annual report said various positive things also.  I should mention for the sake of balance that as well as criticisms the visiting committees comment favourably on many aspects of our prison regimes and it might be no harm to mention some examples.  The Mountjoy Visiting Committee comment that education at the prison continues to have a most positive and rehabilitative effect.  In relation to the health of prisoners the committee said that the health of most prisoners is very good.  Indeed, the health of many prisoners, especially drug abusers, improves while they are in prison.</P>
    <P>The Cork Visiting Committee refer to members paying visits to the prison outside meeting times and finding that business of the prison to be at all times as it should be.  The Arbour Hill Visiting Committee note with satisfaction the many valuable activities taking place in the prison and refer, in particular, to the excellent educational facilities being provided.  There are many other favourable references throughout the visiting committees' reports and, while I accept they also contain criticism which need to be addressed, it would be a pity not to place some emphasis on the very valuable work being done in the prisons by staff and management, together with the various support services.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt either that ordinary law-abiding citizens take a different view of incidents of this kind and that it is appropriate that their commonsense views should be reflected in any discussion concerning prison protests.  The offenders who got on the roof did so by force and, in the process, inflicted injury on a prison officer who was simply doing his duty.  They included two remand prisoners, one on remand for carrying a firearm with criminal intent, an offender serving two years for receiving stolen goods, one serving four years for robbery, one serving five for supplying drugs, one <Col N="1019" /> serving six for arson &mdash; arson, incidentally, of a house while the family slept upstairs &mdash; one serving seven years for robbery, one serving eight years for robbery and one serving nine years, again for robbery.  Those serving such sentences are not minor offenders, they are not the type of people who could suitably be placed on alternatives and clearly they are not in Mountjoy because they happen to suffer from a contagious disease.</P>
    <P>The average citizen would feel we should spare a thought for victims of crime and spare a thought also for the elderly and vulnerable in our society who suffer at the hands of criminals.  I believe, too, that, as public representatives we should, consider what the people whom we represent must feel when they see those who should know better straining to catch the words of criticism uttered by such a group while engaged in an act of gross provocation with apparently no regard for their own safety or that of others.  What does the ordinary person make of the spectacle of people in public life practically falling over themselves to get their own words of solidarity on tape or on screen?</P>
    <P>All of this carries a price.  There is little doubt that the protest which took place in Limerick last Sunday night, for example, was influenced by the belief that the consequent publicity and posturing by various people would have an impact. These offenders inflicted superficial wounds on their necks.  One does not need to be unduly suspicious to suggest that this type of action is influenced in no small way by the expectation that the understndable concern expressed when prison suicides or attempted suicides take place, might be extended also to the offenders involved on this occasion.</P>
    <P>While it is regrettable, obviously, that any offenders should behave in this way, there is really no basis for extending sympathies. Those involved were, again, a group of quite serious offenders, one serving two years, two serving five years, three serving ten years, one serving 14 years and one serving life for offences which included possession of drugs with <Col N="1020" /> intent to supply, producing a firearm to resist arrest, manslaughter and murder. Their complaint, which, in the circumstances, can hardly be said to be justified, was that the level of supervision applied to them when receiving visits was too tight.</P>
    <P>We simply cannot afford to allow prisoners to believe that the way to &ldquo;get action&rdquo;, which, make no mistake about it, for them includes the removal of essential controls, is to get on a roof or take some other disruptive action with the virtual guarantee that various people, many misguided, will hype things up to the point where authority is tarnished and its hand forced.  I can assure this House, now, that such tactics will not work.  The Government, while dealing with those in custody as humanely as possible, with a view to their ultimate resocialisation, are also determined to protect the public. There are various channels through which offenders may express their grievances. They are used every day and problems are resolved every day.  The channels do not include rooftop protests and nobody should attempt to shroud such actions with any veil of legitimacy.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to the suggestion that &ldquo;the present prison policy [is] gravely flawed&rdquo; I am sure that, in the light of what I said, the House will readily acknowledge that there is nothing to substantiate the assertion.  Prisons policy embraces many elements but if I mention some of what I would regard as essential elements, and outline briefly what the policy is, I am sure the House will have no difficulty in agreeing that the right policies are being followed.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have a policy of secure containment.  I have made it quite clear that this is an essential element and that the Government are determined to see to it that the community is protected. Difficulties inevitably arise from time to time but I feel that, in relation to the serious situations which have developed in recent times, the House far from describing the approach as flawed will join me in complimenting the prison governors and staff concerned on the <Col N="1021" /> manner in which they have dealt with these situations.</P>
    <P>There has to be a humane approach. Again I am sure the House will recognise that various initiatives for which the Minister for Justice has been responsible in this area indicate, quite clearly, that the humane approach, which incidentally, has been the characteristic of Irish prisons policy down the years, is not only being maintained but is being further developed.  The Minister has already mentioned his decision to establish a group to advise on the problem of prison deaths, a decision motivated entirely by humanitarian considerations.  He is also bringing together an appropriately qualified group to advise on the future handling of those suffering from contagious diseases.  Last Christmas, with Government approval, he granted Christmas leave to categories of offenders who were not previously considered for such release.  This, I am glad to say, was a resounding success.  Of course he has also established the Sentence Review Group which has the job of providing him with independent advice on the administration of long-term sentences, including life sentences.</P>
    <P>A prisons policy should, I believe, involve an element of openness and here, again, I think the House will acknowledge that the Minister has taken a number of initiatives.  He has facilitated visits by an all party Oireachtas group to our prisons.  One such visit has already taken place.  He has also facilitated a visit by representatives of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights to the Women's Prison and, of course, he has facilitated visits too by various representatives of the media since he took office as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Whitaker report let me say, first, that it is unfair to that committee to suggest that their report has been ignored.  It had an influence on many developments which have taken and are taking place.  I might mention, for example, the extended use of alternatives and the introduction of new duty rosters. The Minister established the Sentence <Col N="1022" /> Review Group, which was also a Whitaker recommendation.  He is specifically looking again at some of the recommendations made in the report on the subject of alternatives to custody and he hopes to be in a position within the next few days to make an offer of appointment to a medical practitioner who has been recommended by the Civil Service Commission for appointment as medical director.  There are various other recommendations in the report which he shall also be examining in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>With regard to the assertion that prisoners spend almost 24 hours in their cells, very few offenders spend lengthy periods in their cells.  When they do so it is for very short periods.  The reason for this is that those concerned need protection from other prisoners and more often than not, they welcome the protection provided.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Department of Justice delaying publishing annual reports, one of the reasons for the delay in publishing the 1989 report was that the Department had not got a report from the Mountjoy Visiting Committee.  I think it was Senator Upton who made the point that a committee of experts on AIDS should be established.  The Minister has already done so.</P>
    <P>An assertion was made that drugs are freely available.  Suffice it to say that it is not the authorities who supply them.  The precise reason for the disturbances in Limerick Prison on Sunday night was that major criminals, including major drug traffickers object to the level of supervision exercised during visits.</P>
    <P>Far from being flawed, I would argue that prisons policy is soundly based and that its development is on secure footing. In the light of what I have said I would strongly commend to this House the amendment to the motion which has been put down by Senator O'Donovan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed by the tone of the Minister's response.  There is confrontation in terms of what the Department will do, how they will run the prisons and how they will rule the prisons.  I do not think <Col N="1023" /> that is the proper way to go about it, Everything I have done in the last number of years is in line with the recommendations in the Whitaker Committee of Inquiry.  I listened to what Senator O'Keeffe and Senator O'Donovan said, and it is not good enough for Senators who should know better to simply attack the person and try and divert attention from the failures and the negligences in the system and by successive Ministers for Justice.  I am not saying that the present Minister for Justice is worse than any of the others.  He has put some useful provisions in place and some others he has in the pipeline of which I am very much in favour.  For example, he is now agreeing to look into the area of alternatives to prison.  He is setting up an expert group to look into the position of prisoners with the HIV virus.  That should have been done ages ago.  He has set up the sentence review body.  Of course, the recommendation of the Whitaker Committee of Inquiry was that it should be on a statutory basis &mdash; which the Minister has not done.  He, hopefully, will appoint the medical director, a promise which was made earlier.</P>
      <P>I do not think any speaker said prisoners were kept in their cells for 24 hours. I certainly did not.  I said 16 hours, or two-thirds of the day, so there is no need to refute something that was not alleged.</P>
      <P>With regard to the appointment of the Visiting Committee, the Minister has not addressed that.  Why has it taken five months to appoint a visiting committee when the Minister is statutorily bound to appoint it?  A visiting committee should be in place at all times.  He said the reason the 1989 report was not published was that there was no report from the Visiting Committee of Mountjoy.  The Visiting Committee have to make an annual report.  If it is not forthcoming, then the Minister must demand it.  That is his duty and his obligation.  Let him not use that as an excuse for the Department of Justice not publishing their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the allegation that drugs are freely available in the prisons, naturally enough the Department of Justice <Col N="1024" /> are not making illegal drugs freely available but they are allowing illegal drugs to be freely available.  Quite a number of prisoners have died from overdoses of illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>These are the nitty gritty we can get involved in.  I am talking about a general overhaul of the prison system.  The Whitaker Committee of Inquiry have made a broad set of recommendations as to how the prison system is to be overhauled. That is what I am talking about.  I have always spoken about a set of policies that will give us a humane prison system, an efficient prison system and a cost effective prison system.  Such a prison system would benefit all &mdash; it would benefit the prisoners because it would take their needs into consideration and it would benefit the prison officers because they are the people who are also imprisoned. They are the people who want the Whitaker Committee recommendations implemented because they spend a lifetime working in the same conditions as prisoners are detained in.</P>
    <P>It would benefit society because the whole purpose of prison reform is to make it effective so that the 50 per cent plus level of recidivism is ended and people who go to prison, particularly young people, will realise that it is not simply a university for crime as it so often is, because of the lack of segregation in prisons right across the board and because of the overcrowding in the prisons, as well as the other aspects of the prison system, particularly in our main prison, Mountjoy, where roughly 60 per cent of the prisoners are processed.  We are talking about a system that will benefit everybody.</P>
    <P>It is not making hotels or holiday camps for prisoners.  I am not talking about that. Everybody who commits an offence against society should be punished.  I am in favour of that, but while they are being deprived of their liberty let us ensure that the maximum is done to ensure they do not go back and inflict a similar offence on society and for that we must have a proper rehabilitative system in the prison.  We must have an after-care service when they come out of prison which <Col N="1025" /> matter the Department of Justice wash their hands of in the present circumstances. Once the door closes they are not concerned about the situation. People continue in the cycle of crime.  We are talking about a comprehensive look at our prison system.</P>
    <P>We have been dealing with some of the nuts and bolts, but if we look at it overall the purpose of imprisonment must be examined. Who do we put into prison? Why do we put them in?  How long are they going to spend in prison?  While the Minister says there is only a tiny per cent &mdash; only 1 to 2 per cent &mdash; of people in for such offences as non-payment of debts or non-payment of fines, we are still talking about 10 to 15 per cent of the people who go to prison.  Roughly 10,000 people go to prison every year.  The last figure we had for people who go into prison for non-payment of fines was 1,250.  We are talking about 10 to 15 per cent of the people who go through the prison process who could be kept out of it entirely.  Their inclusion leads to the prison system being clogged and overcrowded.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that I am not concerned with the victims of crime. The victims of crime are the people who get the worst end of the stick in our society.  I admit that.  This is one of the areas that must be addressed on another day and in another debate.  First, they are brought through the harrowing experience of having to go to court in very difficult circumstances and being cross-examined. There is no support of any description either psychological or financial for those who have been subjected to injuries of a personal or traumatic nature.  I am concerned with that. I am involved in that.  I have been very much involved with the people who have set up the association for the victims of crime.  I will continue to be involved with them which, I would say, is probably more than most of the people do who criticised me on matters here in the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> We are talking about the quality of life in society.  We must establish an effective system which we do not have at present. That was the reason the Whitaker committee was set up.  It was set up to look into the whole area of prisons and the penal service.  It criticised it and put together a comprehensive set of policies. We should be examining how all of those could be implemented so that we have a better system.  It has not been done.  The Minister takes credit for dealing with certain parts of it.  Let me say that that has been a tinkering with it.</P>
    <P>We must look at the overall system and at a comprehensive overhaul of the system.  The first thing that must be done is to define the sanction of imprisonment. What is it?  What does it do?  We know who goes to prison.  Why they go to prison?  What does the punishment mean?  Does the punishment fit the crime?  We must look into the structures in which the prison system operates.  The Whitaker Committee of Inquiry recommended that the prison system should be taken out of the control of the Department of Justice in its day-to-day operations. That was five years ago but we have had no response from the Minister in relation to it.  Are we going to have the bureaucracy operating a prison system that must be flexible, adaptable and able to respond to such things as an epidemic of the AIDS virus, the drugs problem and the people who are in prison for those issues which relate purely to the 1980s?  I do not believe the Department of Justice can do it and that is not a criticism of the Department.  It is a criticism of the fact that you cannot have a type of Civil Service bureaucracy, which the Department must be.</P>
    <P>I must reject the terms of the amendment. I ask the Minister to reconsider the motion the Labour Party has put forward, to take on board its main provisions and to see about overhauling the prison system.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Ramming of Irish Trawlers.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing time with my two colleagues, Senators D. Kiely and O'Donovan.  First, I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity of raising this issue this evening.</P>
      <P>The issue of ramming Irish trawlers has been raised at many levels.  I understand it was raised in the European Parliament last Monday.  On a personal basis, I felt the issue was of such magnitude and so relevant to this House that it should have been given greater priority here. However, I am grateful for small mercies. The Cathaoirleach was a colleague of mine in the Dáil for some time and would have heard me refer to the many dangers posed to our fishermen by activities of submarines underneath the sea.  Here we have far more blatant piracy on the high seas from Spaniards who seem to think nothing of ramming Irish trawlers.</P>
      <P>Incidents of ramming of Irish trawlers by Spaniards is certainly not new and has been happening now for many years but it has been particularly serious over the past four or five years.  These incidents have been taking place about 40 to 50 miles west of Catstletownbere in lucrative fishing grounds well known for hake, monkfish and other fish.  The Irish licensed trawlers were obviously heading for these grounds.  The Spanish trawlers, steel hulled and twice the weight of the Irish ships, also congregate in this area. The Spaniards use long lines, 15 miles in length in some instances, and do not want any interference from any competition. If necessary they will protect their lines by ramming the Irish trawlers.  What chance has a wooden hulled 120 foot trawler against 200 tonnes of steel with a grossly unscrupulous skipper and crew? There are well documented incidents of ramming of Irish trawlers, particularly over the last few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three types of Spanish vessels fishing in this area, all of which are <Col N="1029" /> illegal in one way or another.  First, there are Spanish trawlers licensed by the EC to fish at certain periods of each month &mdash; maybe two days at a time &mdash; but who fish for the entire month.  Indeed, this category has been charged and convicted for offences under this heading in the very recent past.  The second category are Spanish re-registered trawlers, or flag of convenience vessels, who have been re-registered in Ireland, England, France or elsewhere, and which, in fact, is the category of trawler which rammed the <i>Orion</i> in the last incident.  Thirdly, there is the Spanish trawler which is not registered, not licensed and has no rights whatsoever.  These three categories are guilty of piracy of the worst type by threatening the lives and property of those who go about their daily business legally and without interference to anyone.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the comment by a Sherkin publication which says that the Spaniards under the 1990 EC quota system for white fish are allowed to catch 19,355 tonnes in a twelve month period. The average annual landings for a typical Spanish trawler in the 110 foot or 130 foot length range operating off the Irish coast, is 360 tonnes.  The average round trip for a trawler from Spain to Irish waters is 20 days or 18 trips yearly.  On this basis the number of trawlers needed to catch the above tonnage would be 54 vessels fishing ten days every trip from Spain.  This converted to total fishing days for the Spanish fleet in one year would be 10,000 days approximately.  Therefore, from these figures the Spaniards can reach their quota in the first five months of 1990.  They will be allocated at least the same amount of days monthly for the remaining months of the year, so the situation is that they will be allowed to take from these areas 27,000 tonnes over the quota which is deemed legal by the EC.  This fish is valued at £70 million. According to the Spanish lists given to the EC, the average days spent by Spanish trawlers for a month as 12, whereas the actual number was 18 days.  This adds up to illegally caught fish to the value of £30 million per annum.  It is well known that <Col N="1030" /> there are unregistered Spanish trawlers fishing in these areas.  The conservative estimate from a number of reliable sources is that there are 100 trawlers at any one time, which in tonnage is 36,000 tonnes per year, valued at £90 million. To conclude from this document, the figure for illegally caught fish by the Spaniards of £190 million of white fish is, therefore, a minimum estimate.  This figure is greater than the total Irish landings for all species in any one year, including herring and mackerel.</P>
    <P>Our protection vessels, of which we have seven &mdash; and may I point out that there are never more than four at sea at any one time for one reason or another &mdash; are not adequate to deal with this piracy or, as one Irish fisherman put it, an attempt at premeditated murder.  The Spaniards are anxious to keep competition out at any cost.  When the Navy bring an arrested skipper to shore, the fishing grounds are left without any protection, and any money that is lost in fines is quickly recouped by blatant disregard and flouting of the laws.  The skipper is fined and the vessel is back to business straight away.  Even though our Naval Service do an excellent job with the numbers they have, they just do not have the wherewithal to protect our fishermen in this situation.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister this evening that the laws must be strengthened.  Fines must make it prohibitive for these pirates to operate.  We must adopt a much tougher attitude to these Spaniards.  I would suggest that if the same vessel is caught fishing illegally twice within a six month period, the trawler in question and its gear should be confiscated.  That is a serious charge, but this happens in Denmark where, if a trawler is caught twice within a limited period it is confiscated. It is only with an attitude like this that we will make any impression.</P>
    <P>It should be known also that the vessels in question have been caught six times in the recent past.  Oddly enough, the skipper is the only one who is affected. This vessel can steam off next morning with a new skipper on board.  At present it is a laugh for the Spaniards, because <Col N="1031" /> even though their fines are in the region of £10,000 they are back the following day.  The fact that they are back the following day is clear evidence that they just do not give a damn about the laws or about our own protection agents, the Navy.</P>
    <P>My understanding was that when the last Naval protection vessel was built a helicopter pad was to be installed on board.  This has not happened.  I would ask the Minister what proposals he has in mind to provide such a facility and service. I am also led to believe that the Spanish authorities will not allow EC officials to inspect their books.  Therefore, quotas mean absolutely nothing to them.  On the other hand, the Irish are subjected to quota restrictions.  The quotas are rigidly imposed by the national authorities, which is proper order. Because the Spaniards are fishing the area in question at will, quotas will, as a consequence, be reduced.  The estimated tonnage will obviously have gone down. Therefore, the quota is reduced for the Irish fisherman.  We are losing out on all fronts.  The question must be asked whether we are going to make a serious attempt to prevent these incidents.  They will certainly not go away.  They are definitely on the increase.  I believe we owe it to our fishermen to give them protection from this enemy.  There are enough problems out there in natural forms, about which we can do very little. I would ask the Minister to spell out what his solution to this problem is, and to let our fishermen know we are concerned about their lives and livelihood and that they can have more confidence in their own industry.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered also that there is no mechanism at present to deal with this despicable, arrogant and highly dangerous activity.  The Navy can bring in the trawler and charge them with illegal fishing, but will do absolutely nothing regarding the ramming.  This is a civil offence.  It would be very difficult to find independent witnesses on the high seas. We are members of the EC.  We are <Col N="1032" /> behaving as we should.  Is this to be our reward?</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Minister whether he has been in touch with the EC regarding these incidents?  Can he tell us what the attitude of the Commission would be to the ramming of Irish trawlers off our own coast?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to welcome the Minister here and to compliment my colleague, Senator Byrne, on some very factual points he has made and on the question he has raised.  On a positive note, I would like to compliment the Minister and the Department of the Marine for sending the Naval vessels into the area in question, which is a short distance off the coastland where I was born.  Since this has happened, the incidents have actually decreased.  I was told by the fishermen in the Castletownbere area quite recently that over the last few days the incidents that have been referred to have now totally ceased.  That is not to say that the matter can be taken lightly. The Naval patrol vessels have brought ashore a number of vessels.  Yesterday four skippers were charged before the Cork Circuit Court by the State Solicitor for west Cork.  Each was fined £1,000 and in most cases gear and fish to the value of up to £25,000 and indeed in some instances as much as £30,000, have been confiscated.  I would, of course, concur with what Senator Byrne has said that this in itself is not sufficient and is certainly not a sufficient deterent, because in many instances the same skippers and the same vessels come back before the courts.  I certainly urge the Minister to look for a massive increase on the fines to be imposed on these skippers and particularly on those who constantly and deliberately flout the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also would like to remind the Minister, in a constructive fashion rather than being negative, that on a number of instances &mdash; and I think two were recorded in the recent acts of piracy off our coast &mdash; possibly because of the lack of patrol vessels the fish and the gear were transferred from an arrested trawler, and <Col N="1033" /> attempts have been made at that.  I understand that we are in a situation here for which this Minister is not responsible This has been going on for the past two decades at least.  I would go further and say that the problem is not purely confined to the Spaniards but it applies also to the Russians, the Norwegians and the other non-EC countries who rape and plunder the waters off our coastline.  We have very rich white fishing grounds off our coast.  I can go back a dozen years or 14 years, when my family were involved in herring fishing, when large Russian trawlers came in within sight of the coastline and took thousands of tons of herrings without being apprehended.</P>
    <P>This problem is an ongoing one and the Minister has a very difficult task in hand.  I would like to compliment him. Since coming into the Department of the Marine a few months ago he has made great strides.  I think a breath of fresh air is blowing through the corridors of that Department, and I would like to compliment him on his work there.  Nevertheless, I think some of the questions raised by my colleague, Senator Byrne, are very pertinent and I am now more or less convinced that, particularly in regard to our European waters, not our national waters, we need further assistance in the line of patrol vessels.</P>
    <P>I must condemn utterly the incidents that happened off the west Cork coastline. I know the skippers of all of the vessels concerned.  The <i>Orion,</i> mentioned by Senator Byrne, is at present in Baltimore boatyard.  In that particular instance the ramming was so severe that the fact that there was no loss of life or serious injury was indeed a miracle.  I am quite sure the Minister is aware of the gravity of the situation and I ask him to use all his endeavours, both nationally and through the EC, to try to cut out these acts of plunder and piracy off our coastline.</P>
    <P>On a final note, I would like to congratulate Mr. Gene Fitzgerald, MEP, who has highlighted this matter a number of times in Europe, as well he may do because he serves the constituency of Munster, which has a large coastline.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> This is not a problem of today; it has been ongoing and, unfortunately, because of the rammings it has been highlighted. It is something that must be addressed.  I urge the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure that these incidents do not recur either this year or indeed next year and, if necessary, to seek the assistance of the European Commission.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  I too would like to welcome the Minister here and to thank him for taking this motion this evening and to thank Senator Hugh Byrne for raising the matter.  Indeed, we are all very concerned and worried about any type of incident on the seas.  As has been stated, it is hard enough to beat the elements besides trying to beat these enemies.  While this was a Spanish incident, I am quite sure other countries in the EC would take the same type of action if they were put to it.  I thought that in this day and age piracy at sea was completely finished with and that the days of Long John Silver and so on had long since gone.</P>
      <P>Of course, as Senator O'Donovan stated the answer seems to be that our waters are so rich.  I feel the Department of the Marine should assist with grants, perhaps in a bigger way, to try to get our own fishing fleet into a position to compete with our EC partners, who seem to be light years ahead of us, due to various reasons over the last 30 or 40 years.  When the security vessels bring some of these perpetrators ashore the amount of stock and fishing gear confiscated and the fine imposed do not seem to deter these people.  They just seem to go back to sea and continue as if nothing happened.  There seem to be huge amounts of money being made from the wealth around our shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was at a conference some years ago concerned with the development of the Cork-Kerry region.  It was all about the fishing in the waters of the peripheral regions of the EC.  Most of the fishermen will tell you that as soon as the weather is suitable the first place these people <Col N="1035" /> seem to hit for is the coast of Ireland because our fishing waters are so good. Our fishermen should be treated with due respect.  Many people may say that we should have more patrol vessels, although perhaps many of our local fishermen might not agree with that.  Many of them would prefer at times if our security vessels were tied up, but I think in general the Naval Service are doing a terrific job. They should be complimented and commended for what they have done to date in bringing these perpetrators ashore.  As Senator Denis O'Sullivan stated earlier we had four cases yesterday in west Cork and I think that has to be noted.  In addition, on the figures given by Senator Hugh Byrne &mdash; the 12 fishing days <i>vis-à-vis</i> the 18 fishing days &mdash; you are speaking in real terms of almost an extra three months in the year.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to congratulate the Minister on the speedy way in which he and his Department acted when this Spanish vessel actually attacked one of our own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want first to express my appreciation for Senator Hugh Byrne, Senator O'Donovan and Senator Kiely for the concern and interest which prompted them to ask for this Adjournment debate. The Senators will recall that, in reply to a Private Notice Question in the Dáil on 23 May last, in relation to the recent incidents of aggressive behaviour by foreign registered vessels against Irish boats, I indicated that my Department and the Naval Service had mounted an intensive fisheries surveillance operation in the area off the south-west coast.  The subsequent speedy arrest by the Navy on fishery-related offences &mdash; and I stress that &mdash; of seven foreign vessels allegedly involved in this interference and the civil actions which were mentioned by the Senators which also ensued have helped defuse a threatening situation and restored a considerable measure of order to current fishing activities in the area. There have been no further reported incidents apart from one which was <Col N="1036" /> recorded in the past 24 hours and which I have now asked the Naval Service to investigate with all possible speed.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the intensive follow-up operations carried out by the Navy have acted as a major deterrent to further incidents of this kind.  Of course, the court cases which were mentioned by Senator O'Donovan have also strengthened our case and the news, so to speak, has got back to various ports and harbours. A number of Navy boats, backed up by aerial reconnaissance and relevant onshore support, have been deployed for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I want to say to Senator Byrne that the Naval vessel does exist equipped with a helicopter pad and that the Air Corps have been landing the helicopter on that boat and practising its new role as a surveillance unit in our whole surveillance area.  The European Community is very concerned about this and are backing us in the most practical way by supplying us with grants for this purpose.  Indeed, I may mention in passing that I have put in a strong application to the EC for further moneys for surveillance equipment, for boats and equipment for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear once again &mdash; I want to express myself very clearly on this &mdash; that I will not tolerate interference with Irish fishing vessels going about their legitimate pursuits in Irish waters and I have taken very strong steps, which resulted in the court cases mentioned by the Senator, with this in view, to indicate to people that they cannot with impunity interfere with our fishermen fishing waters off our coast.  No resources will be spared in preventing such incidents and those involved will be well aware from action taken to date of our determination to stamp out this practice altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my main aims is to ensure that agreement can be reached with relevant flag state authorities enabling appropriate action to be taken against vessels involved in these deliberately aggressive activities.  In this regard I have personally written to my counterparts in France and Spain, the Community member states concerned, seeking their assistance and <Col N="1037" /> support in combating this potentially dangerous situation.  The words were used by the Senator, and it was a potentially dangerous situation, dangerous to fishermen and a grave danger of loss of life.  In addition, the various State services concerned have been brought together at senior level by my Department to identify further practical measures that can be taken.</P>
    <P>In this context the adequacy of legal provision governing incidents of this nature is now being urgently reviewed.  I must say that, while the area up to 12 miles, which is our own territorial area, is well provided for legally, I am not at all satisfied that the international law of the sea is adequate to cater for the incidents which we have been discussing here this evening.  The fact is that the flag country is the only country that can take action against a ship once it is outside the 12 mile limit.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that the whole area of national and international law is very complex and care needs to be exercised to ensure that any actions taken are in conformity with such law and are sustainable in court.  Already some measures have been identified that will contribute to a further lessening of tension in the area.  In particular, legal advice suggests that any unregistered vessels involved in these incidents may be detained for a period.  The Irish protection services have been requested to enforce this ruling in relation to all such unregistered vessels in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>The general situation in relation to our national regulations, if I may outline this for the benefit of Members present, is as follows: The &ldquo;rules of the road&rdquo;, so to speak, for ships moving in our territorial waters are contained in the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.  The latter are implemented internationally on a uniform basis and that basis is enshrined in the Collision Regulations (Ships and Water Craft on the Water) Order, 1984, as amended by the Collision Regulations (Ships and Water Craft on the Water) (Amendment) Order, 1990.  Those committing wilful breaches of these regulations &mdash;<Col N="1038" /> section 419 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 &mdash; are guilty of a misdemeanour and punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to two years.  That is under section 680 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  However, there is a difficulty in that the Collision Regulations do not apply to foreign-registered vessels where incidents occur outside our territorial waters.  That is a point I have already made.  This is a fairly complex area involving international law which is currently being examined in detail by our legal experts.</P>
    <P>Finally, as I have outlined, everthing possible is being done, both at a national and international level, to prevent any recurrence of this problem.  Again, I would emphasise my determination to eliminate such dangerous and irresponsible activities by any vessel operating within the Irish zone.</P>
    <P>With regard to some points made by Senators in the course of the debate, I would like to indicate to Senator Byrne that the Commission does not licence any boat.  The system works as follows.  For certain species the Commission, acting on the advice of the scientific experts in the 12 countries, decides on total allowable catches.  The total allowable catch having been decided, then quotas are allocated to the various members for species that are subject to quota.  The Commission does not have any licensing of fishing boats.  The Council of Ministers makes a decision on the recommendation of the Commission with regard to allowable catches and the individual quotas for each country.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan mentioned the court cases and I appreciate very much what he said about the action taken.  I have nothing but praise for those operating under the ukase of my colleague, the Minister for Defence, for that quick action in this particular regard.  There is a very delicate point here.  It is a very delicate matter in that they took in the ships whose skippers appeared in the court in Cork on fishery offences&mdash;being at sea, that is the only offence they could take them in for.  I do know, and it was hardly coincidental, that the people who <Col N="1039" /> suffered damage took the opportunity of their being in port for serving civil legal bills on them and nailing them to their crafts.  I know also that there used to be problems with non-EC countries.  The Senator mentioned the USSR and Norway.  I have not had any information about interference with our fishing boats from those countries since I took office. They do come with factory ships and they buy in the area mentioned by Senator O'Donovan.</P>
    <P>I also want to say that I appreciate what has been done by a member of the European Parliament, Mr. Gene Fitzgerald, in this regard.  I had the opportunity of addressing the Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament. Mr. Gene Fitzgerald was there, we keep in touch with regard to fishing matters and I find him at European level to be of great help to me when I am making decisions with regard to fishery matters in my own Department and in the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I do not concede what Senator Dan Kiely said about the fishermen from other countries being ahead of us.  I would say that, scientifically and commitment wise, the best of our fishermen are as good as or better than many of the foreigners. Our fishing fleet is ageing and we have that problem.  There is a problem arising from that.  With the fleet that we have we are performing very well in an international context.</P>
    <P>We have a very substantial mackerel <Col N="1040" /> quota, for example.  Last year the mackerel fisherman had fished the quota four or five weeks before the end of the year. This is an indication of their efficiency and it is also an indication of the sparsity of stocks.  It is a point that is exercising the minds of the Council of Ministers at present &mdash; how to preserve stocks; how, if possible, to increase stocks and what measures should be taken for that purpose. There is no allocation of fishing days by the Council of Ministers or the Commission of the European Community; all the fishing takes place within the context of quotas, which derive from the total allowable catch for species for which there are total allowable catches. There are some species where you have total allowable catches determined by the Community, but no quotas.  It is a free for all for fishermen to take as much as they can within the total allowable catch area.  There are some species for which there is neither a total allowable catch nor a quota.  Again, I am trying to encourage experimental fishing in those areas.</P>
    <P>I want again to express my gratitude to the Senators for taking an interest in the fisheries and in the welfare of our fishermen I can assure them by reiterating what I said already: that nobody is going to drive Irish fishermen off the sea and nobody is going to interfere with them with impunity.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 June 1990.</P>
