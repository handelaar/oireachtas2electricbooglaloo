      <P>I have notice from Senator Larry McMahon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Education to clarify the position regarding the acquisition of a site for the proposed construction of Jobstown community College in west Tallaght.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
      <P>An gá atá ann go méadóidh an tAire Comhshaoil an t-olldeontas bóithre do Ghaillimh ag féachaint do dhrochstaid na mbóithre i gConamara.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to immediately outline the future employment prospects for all our customs officers in the light of the free trade position in the EC from 1 January 1993, and in regard to his recent announcement concerning the introduction of automatic entry processing and direct trades input on 1 January 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1670" /> I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase funding to enable Dublin Corporation to continue its programme of upgrading its housing stock.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health in the light of the recent resignation of the Chairman of the Health Research Board, due to unexpected arbitrary budgetary constraints imposed in the Estimates to look urgently at the possibility of providing future and adequate funding so that this important body can carry out its work in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Pat Upton of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to alleviate the serious overcrowding in Scoil Iosagáin, Aughavanagh Road, Dublin.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The unacceptable delay in the processing of investigations by the Garda Complaints Board and the need for the Minister to allocate additional staff immediately thereto.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Liam Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The delay in publishing the report on pay and conditions in the Defence Forces with the continuing hardship for members and their dependants.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McMahon, Ó Foighil, Doyle, Costello, Norris, Upton, Ross and Cosgrave as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matter raised by Senator McMahon and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Norris, Ó Foighil, Doyle, Costello, Upton, Ross and Cosgrave may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is intended to take Items Nos. 1 and 2 today, and Item No. 3 tomorrow, that on Item No. 15 we take No. 59 on the Supplementary Order Paper.  Item No. 1 is purely a formal matter to allow the report of the Examiner of Private Bills to be laid before the Seanad and the Second Stage debate can take place on the matter in due course. It is intended that we take the Bord Glas Bill to 6.30 p.m., that we take Item No. 59 from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. and that tomorrow we take the Appropriation Bill, Item No. 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I am speaking for my own group but I think I am speaking for all on the Opposition side when I say there is great dissatisfaction with the way in which the Order of Business in the House is being organised.  We were given very solemn undertakings in the last session that there would be a new start made in this Seanad.  We were told we would be back in January.  That did not happen.  We were told there would be regular meetings between the Whips held in an organised and structured way. That has not happened.  In fact we, and I am sure the other groups, have had to chase after the Whip looking for information which should come to us in the normal course of events.  It has been impossible to plan the work of Members on this side of the House in any sort of precise or proper way.  We have not been given the programme of legislation in advance, as we were told would be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saying at this stage, on the first day back, two or three weeks later than was intended, that we certainly do not want to fall into some of the bad habits which characterised the last Seanad.  We want to see the promises which were made in the last session kept.  We want to see business organised efficiently.  On foot of that the only protest I can make today is that as I understand the Independent group will be moving that the Order of Business be amended to take the Bill dealing with abolition of the <Col N="1672" /> death penalty, Item No. 12, we will certainly be supporting them in that.  We feel this is a measure which is part of the Fianna Fáil-PD Programme for Government. It has the support of all parties in this House.  We will be supporting that item today because it is worthwhile, and also as a protest against the way in which business is being organised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We, in the Independent group, would like to underline and reemphasise all the points that were made by Senator Manning.  It is quite clear to us in that, in the old phrase, organising a booze-up in a brewery would seem to be impossible to the organisers of the Government.  We are working at the moment without a plan, without a structure, without direction, with no legislative programme whatsoever.  It might come as a surprise to you, a Chathaoirligh, to know that in the past three weeks our group have had a notice each week from the Government Whip to say that the House would be resuming.  This was on foot of commitments given before Christmas.  However, without any explanation at any time, the decisions were changed.  Thus, we are back today, three weeks later than originally planned. It is not acceptable; it is no way of doing business and it is a clear indication that we have fallen back into the worst way possible.</P>
      <P>There has been no consultation about today's business.  There has been no Whips meeting to organise the operation of today, tomorrow, this week or next week.  There has been no legislative programme given to us by the Leader of the House.  He gave us all sorts of commitments before Christmas that that would be availabe but it is quite clear we are moving into the old story of no order and no direction.  We are demanding that we have proper consultation and agreement on the way matters should be dealt with.  We should not need to have these rows on the Order of Business week in, week out, as we had in the old days.  We had an agreement that meetings would take place.  They have not taken place, there has been no consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1673" /> One of the issues which we attempted to raise before Christmas in Private Members' time was the abolition of the death penalty, which is Item No. 12 on the Order Paper for today.  At that stage the Leader of the House indicated he would not allow it to be taken in Private Members' time because it was going to be introduced by the Government.  We have waited, but some months later it still has not been introduced.  We are insisting that that matter be dealt with now.  The abolition of the death penalty is something to which this Government and the Coalition Government have given full commitment and we are proposing that Item No. 12 on the Order Paper, namely, the Criminal Justice (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill, 1989 to be taken today.  I propose that amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view it is absolutely ahborrent that we have not had a major discussion on the health services in this House since the beginning of the year.  Our disgrace is all the greater because we are three or four weeks late coming back at a time when the Dáil is debating a no confidence motion in the Minister.  It is an appalling situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to remind the Senator that he must put this down by way of motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be doing that but I wish to address a question to the Leader of the House.  Would he agree that the appalling breakdown of our health services merits an immediate emergency discussion in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>On a technical matter, I am intrigued and perhaps the Cathaoirleach might be able to help me as to the order in which the matters for the Adjournment are read out.  I am curious to know if there is any significance in this because the matter I had down is a matter I felt was of some urgency.  It was one of two at the end of the last session.  The other matter was taken and I had my request in immediately.  I am wondering <Col N="1674" /> for my own guidance if this indicates a pipeline starting, so that I will know what are the practicalities of putting it back in again.  I do not know whether it is appropriate for the Cathaoirleach to comment at this point &mdash; I would be happy for some elucidation in one form or another.</P>
      <P>I would like to formally ask the Leader of the House the situation with regard to the Interpretation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill which is ordered for Second Stage on the Order Paper particularly because the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights have unanimously supported this Bill and we would all welcome a speedy passage.  We would also welcome the generosity of the Government if they were prepared to allow it to pass through from the Independent benches.  It would indicate that <i>perestroika</i> and <i>glasnost</i> and participatory democracy have arrived in Ireland as well as in eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Leader of the House if he would be able to seek a little information for me with regard to Item No. 13, namely, the response of the Government to this matter.  I can make available to him a draft Bill.  The reason I ask is because I have been contacted once more by a constituent who is personally involved in this situation.  It regards adoption rights for citizens outside the State.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention a couple of items from the supplementary list, in particular Item No. 30 which I will not press today.  I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is a continuing contempt of the European Court judgment involved in this.  During the coming session I certainly will be pushing this very hard indeed if we do not get any indication that the Government are moving to reform the law on homosexual activities.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the Leader of the House and the Cathaoirleach to Items Nos. 56, 57 and 58 which deal with completely different matters but they are linked.  The first one deals with the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the <Col N="1675" /> Senator he may not involve the Cathaoirleach in matters arising on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  Perhaps I could have some guidance in that case because what I wished to ascertain was whether, in view of the fact that a particular position has been expressed by the Cathaoirleach in all these matters, he would give an indication to the House that he will vacate the Chair during their discussion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case may I ask whether it is appropriate for me to question the regulations governing the conduct of debate in this House with a view to demonstrating the principle of impartiality?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you could advise me of some other time when I can make this point, which is an extremely important one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  I will be pressing for an early taking of these three motions. Thank you, a Chathaoirleach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Leader of the House for facilitating myself and the Labour Party with Item No. 59 on the supplementary panel in the Labour Party Private Members' time, and to ask the Leader of the House if he can indicate to us the length of time that will be given to the debate on that item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being said, I must agree with the remarks made by the people on the Opposition benches in relation to the ordering of business, or the lack of ordering of business, and in relation to the late <Col N="1676" /> resumption of the House.  It is six months since we were appointed here and we have sat for less than two months in that period.  It tends to undermine the authority of the House if the public see us as not conscientiously going about our duties, not to talk about our own position as legislators.  It is a very serious matter for all of us considering the question mark that has been placed about the future of this House by certain members of the Government Coalition.  It is extremely important that we are seen to be performing effectively, regularly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>In relation to the ordering of business, we need to have a much more coherent ordering so that we know sufficiently long in advance what the Order of Business is to be.  That should be organised by the Whips getting together on a very regular basis.</P>
    <P>Finally, we will be supporting item No. 12 by the Independent group in relation to abolition of the death penalty.  The Minister for Justice made a commitment that this would be dealt with urgently, indeed prior to the end of the Christmas session.  Now it seems to have been postponed indefinitely.  There has been a slack and lackadaisical approach to a matter of very considerable national importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague has said all the needs to be said about the shambles of the ordering of the business of this House and the way the House meets. May I ask the Leader of the House if he would consider allocating time, even a brief period, to discuss the outrageous behaviour of a major Irish bank in ignoring the entire Irish design industry when it was designing a new logo.  It was a shameful insult to the whole of the artistic community of this country.  It is disgraceful in its entirety and I believe it is a matter on which the entire House would be at one.  Those major institutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to have an agreed motion rather than one of my unilateral efforts.  May I say also, a Chathaoirligh, without wanting to be disorderly, that I would like you to assure the House you are satisfied that in a certain number of matters you are not in any way impinging on your obvious impartiality by taking public stances on them in recent times.  I would appeal to the Cathaoirleach to clarify to the House the rules under which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not involving the Cathaoirleach in any matter on the Order of Business.  I would not dream of doing that.  I am considering the position of the Cathaoirleach as the spokesman for this House, not on the Order of Business and not on a matter on the Order of Business, and on the appropriateness of the Cathaoirleach taking stances on issues. As a fairly long-standing Member of the House, with a considerable respect for this House, and one who has defended it on many occasions, I am entitled to raise issues which I believe would impinge on the image of this House in the public mind.</P>

      <P>Tá dhá mhí eile imithe ó bhíomar anseo cheana agus tá ceist shimplí agam ort, agus tá mé ag iarraidh freagra shimplí.  Cén uair a mbeidh mo chearta bunreachtúla le fáil agamsa sa Teach seo?  Cén uair a gcuirfidh tú ar fáil an córas áistriúcháin anseo sa chaoi is go mbeidh gach duine timpeall orm in ann mé a thuiscint go soiléir?  De réir an Bhunreachta tá an ceart bunúsach agamsa mo chuid cainte a dhéanamh i nGaeilge agus níl aon duine anseo a shéanfadh sin.  Ach leis sin a chur i gcrích <Col N="1678" /> níl aon deis agam mo chuid cainte a dhéanamh sa chomhthuiscint go bhfuil gach duine sa Teach in ann mé a thuiscint</P>
      <P>Mura bhfuil an Teach seo sásta mo chearta bhunreachtúla a thabhairt domsa mar Sheanadóir ón Ghaeltacht, nó mar Sheanadóir ó áit ar bith sa tír, go bhfuil fonn air nó uirthi Gaeilge a labhairt sa Teach seo, caithfidh mé rud éigin eile a dhéanamh le mo chearta a bhaint amach. Níl mé ag dul a chur suas leis níos faide. Tá mé sé mhí anseo agus tá mé ag labhairt anseo ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a labhairt mar bhunteanga agam féin agus níl duine ar bith ag tabhairt cúnaimh dom.  Is scannalach an rud é freisin nach bhfuil aon chaint cheart déanta againn faoi staid shláinte na tíre seo mar atá ráite ag an Seanadóir O'Reilly ar ball.</P>
      <P>Tá mé ag iarraidh go mbeadh a leithéid ann.  Ach thar aon rud eile tá mé ag iarraidh go mbeadh mo chearta mar shaoránach, mar Sheanadóir agus mar dhuine poiblí, le fáil agamsa sa Teach seo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting other Senators' comments on the inept Order of Business I should like to regret particularly the long delay in dealing with the Marine Institute Bill, a Bill of great importance and on whose expeditious passage depends substantial EC funding from various sources.  I hope there will be no further delay in that.</P>
      <P>I welcome as a fairly sensible measure the division of the Order Paper into a main list and a supplementary list except that I hope it does not encourage the undisciplined habit of putting everything down on the Order Paper, frequently for no other purpose than to express the policies of a particular party but without any serious intention ever of getting them discussed.  That discredits the Order Paper, if it does not make a mockery of it.  I hope that tendency will not be encouraged by the new business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I wish to express solidarity with my colleague, Senator Norris.  It is perfectly appropriate that he should raise any item he likes on the Order Paper and I support his concern as expressed in item Nos. 56 and 57 to which my name is <Col N="1679" /> added also.  I hope he is not going to be deterred by veiled threats such as taking a particular line.  I believe we are all too grown up for that kind of thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to register my disapproval and disappointment at the late reconvening of the Seanad and I would like clarification on one point from the Leader of the House.  When we went into recess on Christmas week we were given the date of 10 January for resumption.  I would like to know why we did not resume on that day?  What happened between 10 January and 7 February?  Obviously, we had the budget; I suppose I am answering my own question.  Is there any reason for the long delay?  The whole business of Seanad Éireann will be totally undermined in the general public's view if we are paid to work but are not given an opportunity to do so while having pages and pages of motions which will take until the 20th century to go through judging by what has happened since 1 November. If we are here and wish to work we should be given that opportunity.  Was it the Leader of the House who decided on the date of resumption?  Was it the Leader of the House in consultation with the Taoiseach or was it the fact that any budget debate was stymied before we could return?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to second the amendment to the Order of Business made by Senator Joe O'Toole on the Criminal Justice (Abolition of the Death Penalty) Bill.  The Government had promised the Bill and there are reports &mdash; it is difficult to judge their authenticity or otherwise &mdash; that the Garda and prison <Col N="1680" /> officers are causing the Minister for Justice to delay it.  This Bill has been on the Order Paper now for five or six years and it seems to be unreasonable, both of the Progressive Democrats and of the Fianna Fáil Party, to refuse to take a Bill which must be mainly acceptable to them according to their declared public stances. I would like to ask the Leader of the House to take this Bill today and to accept amendments from his own benches, if they have any.  Otherwise perhaps we should have an assurance that the Bill will be introduced during this session.  I also assume in the light of recent reports that we will get the support of the Progressive Democrats for taking a Bill which they publicly support in principle.</P>
      <P>I am slightly fed up with the false starts this session has had.  I was not the only person in this House who did not know whether we were resuming on 16 January, 23 January, 30 January, this week or any other week.  It should be reasonably easy to organise the time the Seanad sits and the legislation.  I cannot understand why the House has not been sitting before now.  We have been given no reason for the delay.</P>
      <P>Finally, a Chathaoirligh, it appears necessary that you, Sir, issue a statement as an assurance to the House that you will not in future be taking political stances on matters which affect this House.</P>

It would have been my preference if the Cathaoirleach had felt himself to be in a position to elaborate fully on the particular reasons he put forward to us in the House but he feels that it is not proper for the Cathaoirleach to discuss questions of the Cathaoirleach in the House.  I accept that is a position which he holds very strongly and which he is advised is the correct position.</P>
      <P>I am happy that the full statement which he has made to us, which outlines his position, will be circulated to all Members of the House.  The issues involved are reasonably serious and they are also fairly straightforward.  It would be wise if the Members of the House, upon receipt of this statement reflected on the issues involved and discussed it in their various groups.  If they are happy with the position, as I suspect most people probably will be then the matter can rest.  If not, there are appropriate channels through which any outstanding issues can be addressed.</P>

Unfortunately, it is my view that the issue which was raised by Members of the House in good faith, seeking an explanation for something that was not covered <Col N="1689" /> by Standing Orders, though there is precedent as you outlined, should be clarified in the House.  That remains my position.  We feel it should be cleared at some stage but it should be cleared in the House.

From the tone of your remarks, a Chathaoirligh, and their content I understood that you were ruling on a point of order and it appeared then that that was not the case.

      <P>A number of items have been revised on the Order of Business and there were comments passed in regard to the Business of the House. There were arrangements made here in the last session that the Whips of each party would meet on a Thursday on a formal basis and that the business for the following week would be arranged.  I thought that would happen and that is why I did not mention the business that would be coming before the House in the next few weeks.  I sincerely hope that that meeting will take place tomorrow morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following are the Bills we will be dealing with: the Derelict Sites Bill, the Marine Institute Bill; the Horse Breeding <Col N="1691" /> Bill, the Building Control Bill.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport will be introducing the Bill dealing with the international carriage and goods by road. The Minister for Health will introduce an amendment to the Control of Clinical Trials Bill in this House.  The Presidential Election Bill, 1990, will be introduced in this House in the next few weeks.  I am making those remarks by way of telling the House that there is plenty of business but I will leave it to the Whips to arrange what business is on the Order Paper for next week.</P>

      <P>If Senator Brendan Ryan wants to bring in a motion in connection with AIB he is quite in order to do so by way of notice of motion.  Items Nos. 57, 58 and 59 are on the Order Paper.  If the Independent group wish to bring them forward in their time, that is there business. We will not be taking Item No. 12.  The Government have given a guarantee that this legislation will be introduced in the near future and I accept that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Marine Institute Bill has been mentioned by Senator Murphy.  Pending what happens with the Whips, I presume that Bill will be coming to the House next week.  As far as a debate on health is concerned, again, it is up to Fine Gael to bring that forward if they wish as a notice of motion.  Item No. 30 is an item on the Order Paper which the Senator can bring forward with his group if he wants to by way of giving it priority.  It is up to them <Col N="1692" /> to give whatever priority they wish to their own Private Members' Bills.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Interpretation Bill, I was in touch again with the parliamentary draftsman on this matter.  I have not got a satisfactory answer to that yet.  If the Senator keeps asking me I am sure that we will get a satisfactory conclusion to that question in the very near future.  I do not think there was any other question raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish An Bord Glas as a statutory body.  The Bill was passed by Dáil Éireann on 13 December 1989.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that changes brought about by the events following an our accession to the European Communities, in particular the effects of free trade, the energy crises and a certain lack of organisation and preparedness within the horticultural industry itself, left us in the position where products capable of being produced in this country were, and still are, being imported.  At the same time, however, we have to be realistic and accept that some imports will continue, but it is obvious we must capitalise on what we here in Ireland can do best and concentrate our efforts on those areas which offer the greatest scope for expansion and import substitution.  Horticulture, by its very nature, is an intensive employer of labour and it was this factor, as well as the potential for expansion, that led the Government to place special emphasis on this sector.</P>
      <P>I think there would be unanimity on the need to revitalise and develop the horticultural industry.  There might, however, be differences of opinion as to how this is to be done.  We have a country which enjoys advantages of climate, labour resources and high plant-health status.  Hence there is no good reason why we cannot reduce imports, increase exports and, in the process, create jobs. This is the objective of An Bord Glas as proposed in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Government's view that the type of body now proposed is the best vehicle to achieve the goals I have referred to.  Some commentators have decried the direct involvement of the State in this sector and advocate the continuance of a <i>laissez-faire</i> approach. However, on the evidence of the general performance of the sector since our accession to the EC, it is clear that interventionist measures are necessary if the decline of some areas is to be arrested and recovery made.  Even in areas which have been successful there is room for <Col N="1695" /> State involvement and continuation of support so as to ensure that the success already achieved is maintained and enhanced.</P>
    <P>Shortly after my appointment in 1987 An Bord Glas was set up on an interim, non-statutory basis.  One of the first decisions of the interim board was that a very intensive and detailed examination of the industry was essential.  As a result of this examination the interim board produced a report and a set of recommendations in November 1988.  This document is titled &ldquo;A Programme for the Development of Horticulture&rdquo;.  The main task of the new board will be to implement these recommendations. Additionally, a separate programme on the seed-potato industry was published last December.  Copies of both programmes are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The two programmes taken together envisage a market-share recovery and export expansion of £60 million and the creation of 1,800 full-time and 1,500 part-time jobs over five years.  Of the £60 million, £29 million will be increased exports and £31 million will be import substitution.  These are ambitious but nonetheless realistic targets.</P>
    <P>The industry is already showing its capacity for providing employment. Some 300 full-time and 400 part-time jobs were created in 1989 under the development programme and this trend is set to continue over the next four years.</P>
    <P>The interim board has already taken action on a wide variety of fronts.  One of the strongest elements of the report I have referred to was the emphasis which was placed on the need for much improved marketing if the industry is to progress and move in the right direction. As Senators will note from the Bill, the statutory board will have a strong, positive marketing orientation.</P>
    <P>The interim board has also taken special action in regard to the ware-potato sector &mdash; a sector which is very clearly in need of continuing improvement and which in many ways typifies the difficulties which the horticultural industry must confront.  Even though certain <Col N="1696" /> improvements have taken place, this sector is one where there is least justification for imports.  The problems in this area have been well analysed and documented and we have reached the point where concerted action is needed. Special arrangements are currently being set up for close co-operation between the board and the Irish Farmers' Association to improve the marketing of potatoes.</P>
    <P>The seed-potato sector is another area which has been of considerable concern to the interim board and indeed to myself.  This sector has been in decline for a number of years and urgent action is necessary to reverse this decline and restore the industry to enable it to regain valuable export markets.  A healthy seed-industry is also essential for a healthy ware industry.  The seed-potato area is very specialised and, accordingly, the interim board set up a separate commodity team to examine it in detail.  The team's examination led to the programme for the seed-potato industry I mentioned earlier.  I firmly believe that this sector has considerable potential and that, with some new thinking and initiatives, progress can be achieved.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Government, in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, are laying special emphasis on the development of our horticultural industry.  A cardinal element in our policy for horticultural development is the promotion of organised production and marketing through the development of producer groups.  The changing pattern at retail level, brought about by the growth in supermarkets and the change in consumer demand, has meant that horticultural produce must be of the highest quality and has to be supplied on a continuous and reliable basis.  I am convinced that the best way to meet the challenge of this changing demand and to compete successfully against imports is for growers to join together in producer groups to organise and market their produce.</P>
    <P>It cannot be emphasised too often that the go-it-alone approach is a thing of the past.  The future of the industry depends largely on growers accepting the philosophy of co-operation in selling their <Col N="1697" /> produce.  We have a number of producer groups in operation at present but we need more growers in groups.  That is why we made special representations to the EC Commission, who in turn extended the producer-group regulation to Ireland for a number of products, including potatoes.  As a result, valuable financial aid is now available towards the cost of setting up and running a potato group.</P>
    <P>What are the advantages of group membership?  Well, it needs to be recognised, as the interim board already has, that weakness in marketing is one of the great problems of Irish horticulture, particularly potatoes.  By coming together in a producer group to sell produce on a joint basis, growers are in a better position to meet present-day market requirements for produce in greater quantity, better quality and on a continuous basis.  This improves competitiveness against imports and gives the grower a better opportunity of improving the return for his produce.</P>
    <P>The board and the Government have also recognised the special difficulties facing the glasshouse sector.  Accordingly, special aid for this sector was introduced last year in the form of a new capital grants scheme of 25 per cent and an increase from 15 per cent to 35 per cent for grants under the farm improvement programme.  These were very significant developments and followed on a specific recommendation in the board's Programme for the Development of Horticulture which I referred to earlier.  If these new grants succeed, as we expect they will, the result will be an increase in production of tomatoes by 6,500 tonnes.</P>
    <P>Bord Glas will also be very actively involved in what is known as the business of hardy nursery stock and amenity horticulture. Here we are dealing not with edible products but with the decorative shrubs, plants and small trees that are used by people to adorn their private gardens or by local authorities or large public concerns in the landscaping of public parks and gardens, roadsides or areas surrounding buildings.  We have a particular advantage in Ireland for growing trees and shrubs.  There is great scope <Col N="1698" /> for the hardy nursery stock sector, especially on export markets.  Already the interim Bord Glas in consultation with Córas Tráchtála and the IDA have taken an initiative to improve the co-ordination and development of marketing on export markets.  I merely quote these as examples of the work of the interim Bord Glas.  There were many other special initiatives which were also taken.</P>
    <P>The new board will have broadly the same responsibilities as the interim board, that is, the development of all aspects of horticulture. The Bill, when enacted, will give An Bord Glas the status of a permanent statutory board. The Bill sets out in detail the activities in which the board may engage so as to help the industry to realise its full potential.</P>
    <P>Apart from the very close involvement which the board will have with production and marketing, there are some specific points in the Bill which I would like to draw to the attention of Senators. A very important aspect of the board's work will be liaison with other State bodies and specifically Teagasc.  Teagasc has the very important work of research, education and dissemination of advice to the agricultural and horticultural industries. In the case of horticulture, the annual programme of research, training and advice activities will be drawn up by Teagasc in consultation with An Bord Glas.  This is provided for in section 8 of the Bill and will mean that there will be a strong linkage between the two organisations and that the board will have an important role in ensuring that this programme is relevant to the needs of the industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that An Bord Glas will have the right of consultation in regard to State investment in horticulture, in regard to higher education in horticulture and in regard to grading and quality standards for horticultural produce.  It is obvious, therefore, that An Bord Glas will be a focal point for the many varied lines of action which affect the development of horticulture in this country.  The board have wide scope for <Col N="1699" /> action and will, I believe, produce very good results.</P>
    <P>One important point, of course, is the availability of funds to the board.  There is provision for State funding and the Bill, as Senators will have seen, is also providing for the possibility of the collection of a levy and charges for services by the board.  However, money alone will not solve the problems of horticulture.  It will be up to the board to bring about a reasonable, pragmatic balance between what can be achieved by spending money and what can be done by enterprise and initiative, a more enlightened attitude and a willingness to respond to the challenge of rapidly changing times and circumstances.</P>
    <P>Within the range of horticultural products, we have a very wide spectrum of performance in regard to both exports and imports.  On the export side we have the mushroom industry which has been very successful and is continuing to develop.  In addition to the potential on the export market, the board believe that there is scope for increasing sales of mushrooms on the home market. Accordingly, the board recently joined with the industry in a promotional campaign with a view to increasing the consumption of mushrooms on the Irish market.  Moreover, domestic consumption needs to be developed to complement the export trade.  In this context a particular relevance attaches to the recent decline in the value of sterling. This is a matter which is outside the control of the Government.  Currency fluctuations are an issue which will arise from time to time for any company competing in export markets.  However, I recognise that because of its high dependence on the UK market, our mushroom sector is particularly vulnerable to any decline in sterling.  The real answer to the problem is to ensure that we maintain competitiveness by keeping our own costs under control and that inflation and interest rates are kept down.  Equally, we have to continue to improve yields, <Col N="1700" /> productivity and quality in order to compensate for any decline in the return from the market.</P>
    <P>Unlike mushrooms, the demand for many other products is still, as I indicated at the outset, being met unnecessarily by imports, thereby hampering the potential for development at home in the interests of both the balance of payments and job creation.  I am quite satisfied that Irish consumers are more than anxious to support Irish horticultural products provided quality, continuity of supply and presentation are of a high standard.  Of course, success on the home market is often the launching pad for expansion into the export market.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to talk a little about dietary aspects of fruit and vegetables.  It is intended that the statutory board will, in their promotional role, work closely with the Department of Health and health agencies to stimulate public awareness of, and interest in, fruit and vegetables as a very necessary and important part of diet.  While I am not an expert on nutrition, I have considered it important on a number of occasions to mention the beneficial effect of fruit and vegetables in diet.  There is now evidence coming forward to show that a diet with a good content of fruit and vegetables can prevent certain kinds of cancer.</P>
    <P>In this connection I might mention a very interesting article I read of late on the dietary role of fruit and vegetables. It was written by Dr. Ronan Gormley of Teagasc and appears in volume 3 of <i>Professional Horticulture</i>, 1989.  This reference is well worth mentioning here for the overview it provides of the literature dealing with the subject.  The article highlights some of the beneficial effects of fruit and vegetable in relation to the prevention of various diseases.  The author advocates an increased consumption of these foods in the Irish diet, putting special emphasis on uncooked items such as coleslaw and shredded carrot.  He also urges that greater efforts be made to encourage children to consume more fruit and vegetables.</P>
    <P>I would also add that reference was made in the Dáil debate on the Bill to an <Col N="1701" /> international conference on vitamins held last year in London.  The one thing that struck me forcibly in an account of the conference published in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> of 3 November was the link the medical experts have found between fruit and vegetable and the prevention of cancer.  A delegate representing the American National Cancer Institute advocates that people be made more aware that a reduced risk of this disease is associated with a higher intake of fruit and vegetables.  I like to think that the board are doing their bit in the direction of awareness.</P>
    <P>A most attractive and colourful poster intended mainly for children has been prepared by the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Information Centre with Bord Glas assistance.  It is designed to introduce young children and their parents to the benefits of integrating fresh fruit and vegetable products into the daily diet. The poster has been sent to primary schools around the country: the intention is that it will result in a greater consumption of fruit and vegetables, not only among children, but among their parents as well.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal briefly with the Single European Market which will come into operation on 1 January 1993. I would like to refer in particular to its effect on a very important area of operations in horticulture, that is, plant health.  It is, to some extent, correct to say that horticulture had its 1992, as it were, in 1980.  Ten years ago the plant health directive came into operation here and plant material could move freely subject only to compliance with the directive. By the end of 1992, however, there will be further liberalisation of trade between member states by cutting down on the number of inspections and formalities in the movement of plants.  Details have yet to be worked out in Brussels but the essence of the new arrangements is that the emphasis will be mainly directed at the point of despatch, with reduced controls along the way or at the point of destination.</P>
    <P>On this island we have long enjoyed, and still enjoy, a freedom from many <Col N="1702" /> serious pests and diseases of plants. Mainland Europe knows this.  It is imperative, therefore, that the horticultural industry continues to play its part in preserving that reputation particularly on the export market.  The Department, for their part, have been meticulous in ensuring that all material certified for export conforms to the directive.  Under the new arrangements I have just mentioned, there will obviously be more freedom but, with that increased freedom, there will be a correspondingly greater responsibility on the part of the trade.  I would, therefore, appeal to traders not to be tempted to cut corners for the sake of short term gain which can only spell disaster in the long term.</P>
    <P>I would now like to touch upon organic farming.  Senators will be aware from the recent Budget Statement that a special unit is being set up in the Department to promote the development of organic farming.  I shall have Ministerial responsibility for this unit, which will have a general co-ordinating role and will assess the opportunities for expansion in the sector. It will assist in the production and marketing of organic products and will liaise with the EC Commission and other relevant organisations.  An allocation of £450,000 is being provided to cover measures for the promotion and development of the industry as well as the expenses of the new unit.  There is a strong demand for organically produced food stuffs in member states of the European Communities and the Government believe there are very good possibilities for this country to be a substantial supplier to that market.  The interim Bord Glas had already taken the initiative in so far as horticulture is concerned and had set up a working group to consider the production and marketing of fruit and vegetables using organic methods.  The new unit in the Department will, of course, have a much wider remit than the working group.  It will have to consider the possibilities in regard to all classes of agricultural products.</P>
    <P>It is also worth mentioning that the EC Council of Ministers is considering a proposal dealing with production <Col N="1703" /> methods and presentation of organic products.  Certain countries already have their own national rules on this subject. The proposal was put forward by the EC Commission in December and is at present being examined by a working group of the member states presided over by Ireland.  I think the initiative taken as regards the special unit in the Department of Agriculture and Food is very timely and I look forward to worthwhile results coming from its activities.</P>
    <P>It is true that for a long and foreseeable future traditional farming methods will continue to be the main means of producing food.  It has also to be recognised, however, that there is a growing concern about excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides.  Health and environmental considerations are behind this concern &mdash; notice has to be taken of it.  Our role in this respect should be to anticipate likely developments and be in as good a position as possible to make the best use of opportunities.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer further to some of the salient provisions of the Bill. Its primary purpose is set out in section 3, that is, the establishment of An Bord Glas as a statutory body.  Sections 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10 set out the functions of the board.  The keynote in these provisions is flexibility.  The board are given powers to engage in a broad range of activities designed to secure comprehensive development of the horticultural sector. Section 6 entitles the Minister to attach new functions to the board so as to enable a change of course or corrective action in response to changing needs.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to section 8.  This section of the Bill merits particular attention in that it provides for a very close form of co-ordination between the board and Teagasc.  Under its own Act, Teagasc must furnish, every year in advance, a statement of its proposed activities in agriculture.  The point of section 8 is that the horticultural content of that statement must be drawn up by consultation between the board and Teagasc.  The intention in this provision is to ensure that the two bodies co-ordinate their <Col N="1704" /> activities so as to generate a single concentrated thrust towards developing the sector and also to ensure that duplication or overlapping of activities are avoided.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is also relevant here, in that it entitles the board to have a say in horticultural education, State investment and grading and quality standards in horticulture. To run ahead, section 19 authorises the Minister to make advances from the Exchequer to the board in order to enable them to perform their functions. In this context it is important to bear in mind that the board will not be totally dependent on the Exchequer for funds.</P>
    <P>Section 11 empowers them to charge for services and secton 12 provides for the imposition of a levy on horticultural products, as I said already.  The levy has been the subject of much comment, debate and indeed a great deal of misrepresentation. While I do not propose to repeat all that has been said, I will just emphasise that if the work of Bord Glas results in increased business and profits for people in the horticultural industry, then it is only reasonable and natural that the beneficiaries should contribute towards the costs of the board's work on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Senators will also note the very important provision in the Bill which provides that a levy can be introduced only if both the Dáil and the Seanad expressly approve the necessary regulations.  These regulations will spell out, <i>inter alia</i>, the rate of levy, the point in the marketing chain at which it will be enforced, what products will be involved and what exemptions will apply.  There is nothing sinister about the levy.  There are precedents in other sectors, and the Oireachtas will have ample opportunity to consider the whole question and have the final say in due course.  To round off, the staffing of the board and related matters are covered in section 15 and 16. The remaining sections of the Bill are, generally speaking, fairly standard legislative provisions.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the Schedule to <Col N="1705" /> the Bill, Senators will note that it provides for a board of 11, including the chairman, to be appointed by the Minister. There has been considerable comment and debate about the mode of appointment of the board as set out in the Schedule. Strong views were expressed in the Dáil on its merits and demerits.  I must say, however, that having listened to the arguments and given the matter lengthy consideration in the meantime, I remain totally convinced that the method of appointment proposed is the best one and will result in a board which will be efficient, flexible and successful in performing the tasks we have set them.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to thank the Minister for his contribution.  I am happy to say I agree with a lot of what he had to say, although I have some reservations also.  The present level of imports of vegetables, fruit, potatoes and nursery stock, which we could and should be producing at home, is a national disgrace and a serious indictment of everybody involved from the growers to the Government, especially the Government.</P>
      <P>The setting up of An Bord Glas looks to me like a panic measure designed more to give the impression of doing something rather than achieving anything constructive; in other words, an exercise in window-dressing.  Furthermore, there would appear to be a conflict of interest where the chairman of the board is concerned since he is also one of the biggest importers of fruit and horticultural produce in the country.  His interests must surely clash with what is one of the main objectives of the board, namely import substitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present our imports of what we could well produce at home are approximately: potatoes, 53,000 tonnes; apples, 56,000 tonnes; tomatoes, 10,000 tonnes; onions 20,000 tonnes; carrots, 7,000 tonnes; plus a whole range of lesser quantities of a variety of fruit and vegetables as well as nursery stock.  In money terms the value of imported fresh and processed vegetables and fruit which we could <Col N="1706" /> produce in Ireland stands at approximately £100 million.  In addition, we import approximately £12 million worth of nursery stock and fresh-cut flowers, which could also be produced at home. Such a record in an agricultural economy is a disgraceful one, especially at a time when we are looking for alternative farm enterprises.  I am not at all confident that the setting up of An Bord Glas, a body which at present have more board members than staff members, will be able to redress this sad situation.</P>
    <P>In a world of surpluses, any enterprise to succeed must be market-led.  Marketing weakness was, and is, the biggest single factor responsible for our failures in agriculture and horticulture.  Planning must, therefore, begin at the consumer's plate in future, not at the producer's plough, as in the past.  Producers, too, could spend their time more profitably at check-out counters in supermarkets, discussing market requirements with the buyers of these multiples rather than waiting on Ministers for something they will not get.</P>
    <P>Only by having a continuous supply of uniformly high-quality produce will the producer succeed.  The producer must also have proper wholesale and retail outlets if he is to reap the reward in the marketplace.  Never in the history of this State has so much been controlled by so few to the possible detriment of so many. One company at present have got such a dominant position in the wholesale sector for fruit and vegetables that I believe we no longer have healthy competition here. On the retail side, the bulk of buying is now under the control of a handful of buyers.  This is not a healthy situation for producers or consumers.  The time has come for the Government to monitor very carefully the activity of the multiples to ensure there is not abuse of their power.</P>
    <P>The task which An Bord Glas are undertaking could, I believe, be better done by Teagasc if given the necessary resources and the proper remit.  Laying on another layer of bureaucracy with more officers than soldiers is unnecessary and will not be successful.  If Teagasc had <Col N="1707" /> the approval of the Minister for Finance to charge levies on the sale of horticultural produce such as Bord Glas will have, then with these funds, combined with all their other expertise and resources, they could do a far better job than a small body like An Bord Glas who at best can only have a very limited range of expertise.</P>
    <P>Levies on the sale of produce is just another means of getting the producer to pay for the service.  There is nothing wrong with that if the producer is getting value for money.  The question must be asked, will the levies be charged on both home produced and imported produce and, if so, can we legally justify levying a charge on foreign producers in order to pay for a service for home producers to enable them to compete against imports more successfully?</P>
    <P>I believe, under the law, we will not be entitled to do so but I sincerely hope I am wrong about this.  What is needed more than anything else is producer groups or producer co-operatives.  This is something which our co-operatives should have taken up especially in recent years when there is such a great need for alternative farm enterprises.  The co-operatives could organise production on a competitive commercial scale, supply the technology plus the necessary inputs, build the necessary grading and packing facilities and arrange for orderly marketing using their muscle with the multiples to ensure that the producers and consumers are not being ripped off.</P>
    <P>This is what the Government should be promoting.  If we go down that road the producer groups, if well serviced by Teagasc, would not only win back the home market, they could build up a substantial export trade for a number of products such as we have achieved with mushrooms already.  Without such a move on the part of the co-ops we will not have success.  We will just have another impotent board which will be abolished after some years as happened with Bord na gCapall and the Wool Board.  I appeal to the Minister therefore, and to the <Col N="1708" /> board to give priority to setting up such producer co-ops without delay.</P>
    <P>With reference to what the Minister had to say, I was very glad to note he is concerned about building up our seed potato exports as we had in the past and which we have unfortunately lost.  I am glad to note also that he has taken on board the idea of producer groups and I am pleased to note he expects to continue the success in mushrooms.</P>
    <P>With regard to the health aspects, while there is probably very little scientific evidence to support what he has to say, I am afraid that in this world perceptions are probably more important than facts.  The Minister is quite right to try to exploit this perception &mdash; perhaps it is a fact &mdash; but certainly the Mediterranean diet is shown to be very healthy and it has a lot of fruit and vegetables. It would be desirable to emphasise the health aspects of fruit and vegetables.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's reference to nursery stocks, I believe Ireland has the potential to be the nursery farm of Europe.  Given the climatic and soil advantages which we have for nursery stock, this is an area where we can have considerable expansion.  Here again, it is at the marketing end that we will have the greatest problems.  Our disease-free status which the Minister referred to is also something which we can exploit and which, incidentally, we must protect after 1992.</P>
    <P>With regard to organic farming, I have to tell the Minister we had much experience of this during and after the war years.  Having said that, let me say if people are prepared to pay a premium price for organically produced produce in the belief that it is somehow better, then by all means, let us satisfy that demand, but we would not want to get carried away on an emotional tide about organic farming.  We would also want to be careful about the certification and the labelling of organically produced food.  We could have con-men getting in on the act which would destroy our reputation.</P>
    <P>I, too, have to say I have reservations, as the Members in the Dáil had, about the appointment of the board but I will <Col N="1709" /> leave that to another day.  I thank the Minister for his contribution.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of our horticultural industry by an independent statutory body is long overdue and I must take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister and the Government on setting up An Bord Glas.  I know the Minister of State has been working very hard for the past few years to try to bring some order into the horticultural industry but he was <Col N="1710" /> very limited in what he could do because An Bord Glas did not have the statutory authority.  Now the board will have that authority and will also have finance.  That finance will be provided under section 19 of An Bord Glas Bill for the purposes of expenditure by the board in the performance of their functions.</P>
      <P>The board must, of course, work in close harmony with other Government agencies such as Teagasc, who have responsibility for advice, research and education, the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  They must also, of course, maintain close contact with the Department of Agriculture and Food. The Minister now has at his disposal the recommendations of the teams of experts who have been examining the horticulture industry from the producers' and a marketing point of view.  I hope the new board will be able to act positively on those recommendations.</P>
      <P>The production of a five year development plan for horticulture is a step in the right direction.  If the right methods are followed the quantities we produce here at home could be increased substantially. In an agricultural country such as Ireland it is shameful that we should have to import vegetables.  In dairying, beef and cereal production at the present time there are quotas, but here is one area where there are no quotas.  All those people involved in horticulture need is a little planning in the production and marketing levels and their output could be increased substantially.  We could in the space of a few short years eliminate many of the vegetables imports and help our balance of payments.  Of course, we will always have to import certain kinds of fruit that we cannot grow here at home, but there is no reason in the world why we should have to import carrots, onions, brussel sprouts and, indeed, many other vegetables.  We have the most favourable land in Europe &mdash; one might say the most fruitful land in Europe &mdash; to grow these vegetables and our climate is right also.  There should be no need to import those type of vegetables in such large quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> The Minister says we can gain £31 million by increasing home production. Indeed, he is a little modest in his assessment, but even £31 million would be a great achievement.  There is also the possibility of increasing exports.  Here again the figure of £27 million has been mentioned as the yearly value of our exports.  I have no doubt these targets could be met if the right strategy is applied.</P>
    <P>Great strides have been made in recent years in the development of mushroom growing and the Minister referred to this today.  In almost every parish plastic tunnels are used to a great extent and are becoming a feature of rural Ireland, giving valuable employment both full-time and part-time in the industry.  I believe there is potential there for further development and expansion.  Farmers should be encouraged and helped to diversify.  If the traditional methods of farming are not viable there is nothing wrong with going for something new provided, of course, the venture has been properly thought out and planned and that consultation has taken place with the agencies responsible for the development of the market.  There is plenty of potential in this area and I hope An Bord Glas will give every assistance to small farmers, whether they be in the west, east or south, who are interested in setting up plastic tunnels and getting into mushroom production.  There is a good demand in Britain at present for Irish mushrooms and tomatoes and we should avail of the opportunity while it is there.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see improvement in the potato-growing area.  In the five-year development plan the board set themselves a target of 95 per cent self-sufficiency. That target is achievable and there is no reason why we should have to import as much as one tonne of potatoes. I know there are many problems in the industry, the principal one being that there is a totally inadequate marketing system.  That has been the case for a long time in this industry.  Also, there is the problem of a multiplicity of small producers all competing with one another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> The net effect of this is that potatoes are badly presented and badly graded and the housewife, who is always looking for good value for her money, is simply not getting that value.  She cannot be blamed then for turning her attention to the better presented imported products.</P>
    <P>There is legislation which protects consumers from shoddy dealers who are doing the industry a lot of harm by their lack of concern for grading and presentation, and it is a pity the law is not enforced.  I would like the Minister to look at that because it is presenting a very bad image of Irish potatoes.  I have heard housewives complain bitterly about the quality of potatoes purchased by them. Indeed, at a time when housewives are trying to stretch their housekeeping money as far as possible, it is unreasonable to expect that they should have to accept inferior products from anybody.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the way is now clear for Irish potato producers to benefit from aid available to facilitate the formation of producer groups.  This is an important development and it is the road that potato producers must travel if they are to succeed.  Potato growers operating through their own producer group would have much more influence, would be stronger and more organised than large numbers of growers operating individually and the resultant improvement would benefit both producer and consumer alike.</P>
    <P>The Minister today talked about seed potatoes.  I often wonder what has happened to the seed potato export business which was a thriving business some 20 years ago.  I believe that in 1975 we exported 24,250 tonnes, while in 1988 the figure was down to less than half that. That is a very serious matter and is something which we should grapple with immediately.  In other countries exports of seed potatoes have been doubled.  Why not here?  At one time it was a good source of income for small farmers. Indeed, many farmers in my own constituency were involved in this.  Of course, the Donegal seed potato is world renowned and I am sure Senator McGowan will have something to say <Col N="1713" /> about that.  In my constituency there were a number of parishes who were actively involved in promoting this industry and who had a very good income from it and it is unfortunate it has declined to such an extent.  I hope An Bord Glas will see what can be done about improving that industry.</P>
    <P>Have we been active enough in promoting new varieties of potato?  In my opinion we have not.  An Foras Talúntais were involved in improving breed varieties back in 1962 for all aspects of the potato trade.  A potato breeding programme was started at Oak Park Research Centre around 1962.  Originally its main objective was to produce a high yield blight resistant form of Kerr Pinks, our most widely grown main crop variety. The process of producing a new variety of potato is very long and tedious.  The evaluation process takes at least ten years and eventually involves large-scale field trials in the main potato growing areas, combined with quality, processing, storage and screening testing.  It takes about 15 years from the making of the initial cross to obtain true seed until a new variety is available to the potato grower.  Therefore, it is important that something positive should happen in this area all the time.  We should not be depending on the old varieties, the Kerr Pinks and so on, that we have had over the years.  We should always be endeavouring to seek out and promote new varieties.</P>
    <P>The glasshouse sector also comes under An Bord Glas.  They have had a very hard time for a number of years.  The biggest handicap has been the increase in oil prices in the mid-seventies.  This made it difficult for them and it put many of them out of business at that time because they were trying to compete with their European counterparts, some of whom I believe were being subsidised to stay in business.  That made it very unfair competition. The special aid introduced last year in the form of a new capital grants scheme of 25 per cent and an increase from 15 per cent to 35 per cent for grants under the farm improvement plan should be a considerable help to this industry. <Col N="1714" /> The predictions are that production will increase by 6,500 tonnes.  That would be a great achievement and I see no reason why this should not be achieved.  We should be setting ourselves a target of becoming self-sufficient in this area.  I believe we could do that because the quality of the Irish tomato is as good as any from Europe.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see An Bord Glas make an input with regard to cutaway bogs.  Some experimental work was done in this area some years ago but An Bord Glas should involve itself in this area now because there are thousands of acres of cutaway bogs which are under-utilised; in fact, they are not being used at all. Those of us who have an interest in land or in bogs will know that bogland is the best place to grow carrots, parsnips and onions.  No other type of land will produce as good a variety of crop as cutaway bogland.  These cutaway bogs are lying idle at the moment, growing moss and so on.  An Bord Glas might take up a few hundred acres and develop it to see how it would work out.  It should certainly be looked at.  I see no reason why they should not be able to grow in that cutaway bog a lot of the vegetables we are now importing.  Thousands of acres of it are lying idle.</P>
    <P>Organic farming has been mentioned. In spite of what Senator Raftery has said there is great potential for organic farming.  It should be encouraged and I am glad that money is being provided in the budget this year and that An Bord Glas will have the responsibility of promoting organic farming and spending that money.  We hear a lot of talk now about the spread of cancer from the use of pesticides, fertilisers and so on.  I believe that if organic farming was developed in an organised way &mdash; you do not want to overdo it &mdash; there would be great potential for it.  It is something the new board should get involved in to see how it can be developed.</P>
    <P>There are exciting times ahead for this new board.  I wish them all the luck in the world.  I hope the best people can be selected to act on that board, people who have experience of the industry, people <Col N="1715" /> who are prepared to give the board a commitment.  I am satisfied that sufficient funds will be made available to the new board to let them carry out their work.  I hope that in the space of a few years we will see the elimination of many of the imports coming in at present, vegetables that we could grow here at home which are being imported from England, France and so on.  There is no reason why we should not be growing them here.  I hope this is where the new board will come in and that they will do a good job. I am confident they will.  I know that the Minister of State responsible is very committed to his job.  I wish him every success and I hope that when we are coming back here again, perhaps in a year or two, we will see this as one of the great success stories of our time.  I wish the board luck.  There is a lot of work for them to do.  I hope the new board will be committed to that work and try to help the balance of payments by eliminating many of the imports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the objectives of the board as laid out in the explanatory memorandum.  They are all very worthwhile. I do not think any of us would want to say that horticulture in this country has achieved its potential.  As long as fruits and vegetables that can be grown at home are, as it were, being replaced on the Irish market by imported items it is a cause for concern.  We should not rest until imports of these products which we, of course, can produce to standards which are comparable to anything in the world, have been eliminated.  I know that to eliminate totally competing items from the marketplace here is unacceptable and, broadly speaking, impossible but certainly we have not attained our potential. For that reason we have a great deal of work to do in relation to the production and the marketing of Irish produce. There is considerable scope for improving the quality and the consistency of fruits and vegetables which are produced in Ireland for the home market.  I do not have to hand the data on imports which would be competing with Irish products <Col N="1716" /> but certainly when I last looked it up it was quite alarming and was something of a political issue ten or 15 years ago.  It seems to have faded away in more recent times.</P>
      <P>First let us consider the composition of the board.  It is to be a board of ten people.  I am pleased to see that five of them are to have experience and expertise in horticulture.  I would be a bit happier if a certain proportion of the board were appointed or elected by various elements in the industry.  I am concerned that boards should be appointed in total by Ministers of the day.  The reality is that in many cases Ministers tend to appoint people who are of a certain frame of political thought.  I do not wish to sound as if I am objecting to that totally.</P>
      <P>I was on boards in the past when I was going around in my light red jersey at the time.  I do not think that it to any great degree inhibited or interfered with what I had to say.  What is important is that there should be some degree of continuity between boards.  For that reason I am disappointed that there is no degree of input into these boards from sources other than ministerial appointments.  I am pleased there is some degree of balance in as much as half the board will have to have expertise and experience in horticulture.  That is encouraging but I would like to see elements of the board coming from the farming organisations directly and from various other interest groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scope of the Bill is quite large.  It covers every aspect of horticulture.  It covers things like grading.  It even goes so far as to refer to an input from the board into the curricula for higher education courses in horticulture.  Certainly it would be desirable that the views of the industry be taken into account by the people who formulate curricula for horticulture programmes at third level educational institutes.  I would imagine that some people in these institutes might be concerned in relation to questions of academic freedom and so on, as to where that input might stop and where academic freedom might begin to be interfered with.  That would be a matter of some <Col N="1717" /> concern.  Certainly I would welcome the notion and the idea that the board would have an input, would have an opinion and would express it in relation to courses for third level institutions.  I would be a bit concerned as to where the opinion might end and a degree of coercion might begin to occur.</P>
    <P>There will be an increasing potential for fruit and vegetables in the diet in developing countries.  I am interested to see in the Minister's speech that he quoted from an article of an old colleague of mine, Dr. Owen Gormley, with whom I have had the pleasure of meeting at various conferences.  He would have been a colleague of the Minister's also or the Minister who is sitting in today from his days in An Foras Talúntais, even if he belonged to a different wing of An Foras in those days.  I am pleased to see reference to him.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that attention is drawn to the fact that fruit and vegetables should now be seen as a desirable part of the diet, commodities that are not being consumed in adequate amounts.  There will be a growing emphasis on the value of fruit and vegetables in the diet and the great benefit that can derive from consuming them.  They certainly have an important contribution to make to the total intake of fibre in the diet, a matter which is of grave concern here.  Medical studies on the Irish diet would indicate we are not consuming as much fibre in the diet as is desirable.  The experts would go on further to say that extra fibre in the diet should be consumed in the form of fresh food rather than taken in processed products.  They also make an important contribution to the total vitamin and mineral intake &mdash; a matter of great concern even if some of the concern about the intake of vitamins and minerals is misplaced. Fruits and vegetables are, of course, low in fat.  It is very important that An Bord Glas should lay emphasis on these sorts of considerations when they are promoting the value of fruit and vegetables as part of a healthy diet.  There is considerable potential there.</P>
    <P>Irish food products generally, particularly fruit and vegetables, are perceived <Col N="1718" /> in Europe as being produced in a desirable environment where the input of chemicals and so on is relatively modest compared to what are the norms in Europe.  We have a great potential for obtaining premium prices for our products based on that perception of Irish foods which is very widespread in Europe at present.  The survey data indicates that very clearly.  It is a pity we have not been more aggressive in marketing our fruit and vegetables in Europe on that basis.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is broadly speaking in line with this notion of organic farming. People who have come from a background in agricultural science and technology might have reservations about organic farming.  The reality is that in Europe organic foods are perceived as desirable.  It would be very foolish and simple-minded of us not to set about exploiting that potential.  We have a great opportunity there.  It is very important when we do set about exploiting the potential for organically-produced food in Ireland that we absolutely insist that the quality control and product assurance and so on is foolproof.  The worst thing possible that could happen is that we sell material as organically produced and that it would be found that it did not meet the standards which are required for organic production.  It is essential that we lay great emphasis on ensuring that what we say is organic will meet what the European consumer would perceive to be organic.  Anything less and we would be on the road to disaster.</P>
    <P>We have a great potential there, given the way European consumers are moving in relation to their perception of food. There are EC directives in the pipeline and they are making their way into the system here.  It is very important that An Bord Glas gear itself up to be able to exploit that potential fully.  We will be able to get premium prices for our products.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by noting that diet is going to have a higher vegetable and fruit content.  I wish An Bord Glas well in their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I preface my remarks by <Col N="1719" /> recalling that in the very early days of this House the Minister, Deputy Kirk, was asked to apologise to us for having kept us some small amount of time and that he graciously did so.  We, in turn, have delayed him and his officials quite considerably this afternoon and I take the opportunity to apologise to him.  The matters we are now discussing are of considerably more relevance to the generality of the population than some of the procedural mischief we have had here this afternoon.  It is remarkable that some of those who profess to defend the institutions of the State and the House seem to hold it and some of the people who sit here in such contempt.</P>
      <P>We in the Progressive Democrats welcome the establishment of An Bord Glas. The Minister, Deputy Kirk, has worked hard on behalf of horticulture.  I hope the new board will make an impact on the industry and that it will be able to boost the returns to growers, turn back the growing flood of imported fruit and vegetables and that it will help, most of all, to create extra jobs.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister estimates that there is a capacity within horticulture to create 1,850 full-time new jobs and 1,500 part-time jobs over the next five years.  I welcome what the Minister had to say this afternoon about the 700 full-time and part-time jobs which were created in 1989.  The industry has a much greater potential than that and given the proper level of commitment from the Government, a commitment that has been frequently absent in the past from successive Governments, the industry can do a great deal to increase employment and help maintain viable rural communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is widely accepted that we have a very favourable climate for the production of high quality potatoes and vegetables, mushrooms, nursery stock and ornamental plants, particularly in these times when we are so conscious of the effect of a good diet on health and of the value of a clean environment on food production.  Ireland must be in a unique position to take advantage of our natural <Col N="1720" /> advantages and to exploit food production in general and the horticultural industry and fresh vegetables in particular.</P>
    <P>The need for alternative enterprises was mentioned by Senator Raftery.  That need was never more obvious than it is today in Irish agriculture.  Horticulture, it should be remembered, is the ideal activity for the small family farm.  Unfortunately it has to be admitted that our national record in horticulture over the past 20 years or so has been very poor and that we have missed a lot of opportunities through poor production and especially through an inability to organise the marketing of our produce.</P>
    <P>It cannot be right that an agricultural country like ours produces less than half its own requirements of fruit and vegetables. I fully realise we must import bananas and oranges and even the ubiquitous kiwi fruit, but I find it difficult to accept a situation where we import half our tomatoes, 80 per cent of our onions and 90 per cent of apples.  In 1988 our fresh vegetables import bill, including potatoes, was £28 million.  How can we explain that a country whose history has been identified so closely with the potato imports £15 million worth of frozen chips or that a country that has shown it can produce high quality applies in abundance imports £20 million worth of apples per year?  How can we explain that we exported 42,000 tonnes of seed potatoes a year 25 years ago and now we cannot export 10,000 tonnes or that our overall acreage has fallen by a quarter in the past ten years?  I highlight these figures, not so much to list the failure of the industry to survive and compete but to underline the potential that must be there to expand, given the right environment.</P>
    <P>The mushroom industry has been referred to.  It is the most exciting example of what can be achieved and it sets a headline for the rest of horticulture. Here is an industry which has expanded fourfold in the past ten years.  It now produces more than 22,000 tonnes a year, worth £26 million to the economy, with exports accounting for 60 per cent of that production.  I am sure we all hope, <Col N="1721" /> notwithstanding the difficulties which that industry now must face with the strength of the IR£ against sterling, the mushroom industry will reach its production target of 42,000 tonnes a year by 1992 and that the high employment content of that industry will account for 2,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>The technology of growing mushrooms in plastic bags in plastic tunnel houses was pioneered by Cathal Mac Anna and his colleagues at the Agricultural Institute at Kinsealy and the move away from the old capital-intensive tray houses to the system of satellite growers supplying from a central composting depot has revolutionised the industry.  The most important thing is that it has created an ideal enterprise on the small family farm and this is a model for what horticulture has to offer.  It can provide a decent living for people on the smaller acreages and can help make some impact on the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>The mushroom industry has nailed the lie that farmers are incapable of meeting the fundamental requirements of all markets, that is, markets demanding a constant supply of quality products at a competitive price.  The mushroom industry has not been a case of the classic disease of producing first and then trying to sell, which seems to be a feature of a lot of our potato and vegetable production. It would repay Bord Glas and the whole industry to study closely what has been done at Carbury Mushrooms in Kildare and at Walsh Mushrooms in Gorey and at the other centres around the country.  The growers who have contracted to these companies have shown they can accept the discipline that is needed to hit demanding targets on yield and quality and to accept that the consumer should get a closely graded, well presented product at the right price on the supermarket shelf.  The truth is that the consumer is right.  That seems to be accepted more by the mushroom and the nursery stocks industries than by any other horticultural producers.  It is probably central to the success which these two industries are enjoying.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1722" /> I agree with what the Minister said earlier about the hardy nursery stocks industry, that is, the production of shrubs and trees for amenity use.  It is another horticultural sector which has made remarkable progress and which has adopted a professional approach to marketing. Great strides have been made in exporting and this industry has contributed significantly to employment in west Kildare around the peatland areas. Each year the growers in that area hold their own trade show.  It is very successful and they have been involved in the major garden exhibitions in Britain.  They have done all of this through their own initiative, with the help of the Teagasc nursery stocks specialist, Paddy Gleeson.</P>
    <P>For this industry we have excellent disease-free conditions in this country and the right climate for rooting and growing quality shrubs and trees.  The industry has a central role to play in improving our environment and the market is one which is expanding rapidly. Although great strides have been made, I hope this will not be just another example of Ireland missing out on the golden opportunity to do something at which we are obviously good.  I note there is a national conference on Friday on nursery stocks which has been organised by Teagasc and An Bord Glas.  That is the sort of activity in which both organisations should be involved together, and it is a good thing to see.</P>
    <P>Obviously mushrooms and nursery stocks are good examples of what can be done, but it is a pity that we cannot say the same thing about potatoes.  I can recall several efforts to overhaul and organise that industry, but it is still in a fairly sorry state.  Potato growers must be the most resilient group of people in the country, given that from one year to the next they can move from almost bankruptcy to being able to pay their debts and back to bankruptcy again.  They have no way of knowing that in advance.  I sometimes think they would be a lot better off and enjoy themselves a lot more if they went to the Curragh and backed the outsiders.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the situation <Col N="1723" /> where our potato acreage has declined by a quarter since 1980 to around 75,000 acres, is one which is regrettable.  The numbers of growers has halved in the past 20 years.  Many were small producers getting out of business.  There are now some very well organised professional growers producing potatoes successfully, although how some of them do it on very expensive rented land I just do not know. Growing the crop is a very expensive business.  It costs around £1,000 an acre, which is a lot more than for any other field crop and because of inadequate storage a lot of the potatoes have to be moved at harvest-time.  This leads to discounting on the market and to an absence of continuity of supply.  The result is very poor marketing and frequently a collapse in the price.</P>
    <P>The returns from the crop are so unreliable that it is hard to blame growers for not investing in storage space, but the lack of good temperature-controlled storage is at the heart of the potato marketing problem.  At present we have only long-term storage for about 7 per cent of our national crop and about two-thirds of that storage is for processing.  Losses due to storage rot and mechanical damage are estimated to be about one-third of the national crop on average, and that is an appalling figure.  It is huge and it is unacceptable from a national point of view.  We need about 80,000 tonnes of extra storage space and this can best be achieved through an expansion of the producer groups, which would have the simultaneous effect of putting some order into the general marketing of the crop.  I am glad the EC producer group regulation has been extended to Ireland for potatoes and similar financial advantages as those for vegetables now apply to potatoes.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey mentioned the breeding of new varieties of potatoes.  Dr. Harry Keogh and his colleagues at Teagasc in Oak Park in Carlow have a very impressive record in producing new potato varieties.  The question must be asked as to why these varieties have not been fully exploited commercially by the <Col N="1724" /> seed potato industry and why the industry has declined so much when, at the same time, the Dutch industry has grown from virtually nothing after the war to being the dominant force in the world today, with people in countries all over the world selling Dutch potatoes.  Seed growers in Donegal seem to resent the fact that Northern Ireland and Scottish seed is being sold in the South.  I do not think there can be any obligation on growers to buy seed if those who produce it are not prepared to go out and market it.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in ware potatoes, as in other areas of horticulture, irresponsible behaviour by a few growers, wholesalers and handlers of the crop is pulling down the price that the good growers are getting. It is preventing those people from investing in the industry to which they are committed.  Good growers cannot be blamed for throwing in the towel when they go to the trouble of grading their produce according to the law and then see it all jumbled up again at retail level. It is frequently said, and the growers would say it, that we grow the best potatoes in the world, and it is probably true.  However, we must admit that the best can become very poor between the time they leave the field and the time they reach the consumer.  This is a fundamental problem that the new board and the grading inspectors must address. Otherwise it will be very hard to encourage the growers to expand the industry.</P>
    <P>I note what the Minister had to say about the links between An Bord Glas and the IFA.  I hope that the marketing co-ordinator who is to be employed by the IFA will be working actively before long.  It must be admitted that one of the main reasons for many of the problems of the potato industry is poor yields.  The variety Kerr Pinks account for half our acreage and there is an obvious need for a new high-yielding variety or for several varieties.  The increased use of certified seed and of sprouting would also help, but it is very difficult for the potato industry in the Republic to compete successfully when our yields are only about two-thirds of those in Holland and are even a couple of tonnes below those in <Col N="1725" /> Northern Ireland.  The result is that our costs per tonne of production are very much higher and very much more uncompetitive than they are elsewhere and it makes it very hard for us to resist imports.</P>
    <P>Raising the yield of marketable ware through extra yield in the field and through less loss in storage must be fundamental to improving the Irish ware potato industry.  This means good research and advice.  I have already referred to the work carried out at Kinsealy Research Centre, which helped the expansion in the mushroom growing and the valuable work which has been done at Oak Park in plant breeding by Dr. Keogh.  In my view research and advice is fundamental to keeping the whole agricultural industry on a competitive footing, and I am very sorry that Teagasc, or ACOT as it was, suffered so disproportionately during the period when Government spending had to be cut for all our sakes.  People who contributed a lot, and who still had a lot to contribute, have been lost to the industry and that is a matter of regret.  It is hard to talk of developing horticulture when Teagasc have been without a head of horticulture since the middle of last year.  The same applies to the UCD Lyons Estate in County Kildare where, among other things, research on potatoes is being carried out by Dr. Paddy Barry.  I hope the Minister for Education whose responsibility this is will see that the Lyons Estate continues to contribute to the development of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the role producer groups can play in developing the industry.  It is unfortunate that only about 10 per cent of our fruit and vegetables is sold through the officially recognised producer group network in Ireland.  This compares with almost 100 per cent in some other European countries.  Irish growers in their present disorganised state must be vulnerable to exploitation by very large wholesalers and dominant supermarket chains and the best way to resist this must be through a strong producer group.</P>
    <P>I note that the functions of the board, as defined in section 5 of the Bill, do <Col N="1726" /> not make reference to producer groups. Perhaps the Minister would consider reviewing this sector to allow the board to become actively involved in helping to establish producer groups.  This would be very much in keeping with the tone of the Bill and with the activities in which the interim board has been involved.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires Teagasc to consult the board when preparing reports.  I note what the Minister had to say.  I accept he would like to see a close relationship between the two bodies but I would like him to explain more fully how he sees the working relationship between the board and Teagasc operating because, unless both organisations are at one, many of the laudable aspirations of this Bill will fall by default.</P>
    <P>The support of the farmers and growers, and in particular of IFA members, is also essential if the board is to operate successfully.  It has been suggested in the other House that the IFA do not support this Bill.  This is simply not the case.  The IFA is on record as fully supporting the necessity for the proper establishment of An Bord Glas as a statutory body but that is not to say it does not have reservations on one or two aspects of the Bill.  It seems reasonable since section 12 of the Bill proposes a levy to be paid by the seller of the horticultural products concerned that the main representative organisations of growers and nursery men &mdash; that is the IFA &mdash; should command the five places which the Minister can choose after consultation with such persons as he considers appropriate who are engaged in or representative of those engaged in horticulture.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister could specify the criteria he will use in choosing board members.  It would seem only right that those who pay the piper call the tune. The composition of the board must not only give representation to producers but it must be seen to do so.  The need for a really innovative approach to horticulture is so urgent and the potential pay-off for such an approach is so great that it is essential we have both a board and a chief executive of the highest calibre. These selections must be on the <Col N="1727" /> basis of excellence, concern and performance in the industry.  I ask the Minister to settle for nothing less than that. As to the collection of the levy itself, I would like clarification as to how this fits in with EC legislation and if it is possible to levy the sale of imported produce.  This matter has already been referred to by Seantor Raftery.  I share his sentiments in that respect.</P>
    <P>Another legitimate concern of the producers as represented by the IFA is the increasing dominance of a few large buyers within the market.  Already I understand that half of our ware potatoes traded in this country are sold through four multiple supermarket groups.  The ability of a few very large groups to dominate the whole fruit and vegetable market is a worrying trend.  We all know the danger of too much domination of a market sector by one or two buyers.  I would support the IFA view that the board must try to ensure fair trading practices operating at all levels and at all times throughout the industry.  For example, using potatoes as loss leaders in supermarkets can have a catastropohic effect on growers' incomes and is wholly detrimental to the balanced development of horticulture as envisaged by this Bill.  I wonder if the Minister has any plans to tackle this problem in the Bill?</P>
    <P>The location and the operation of the Dublin wholesale fruit and vegetable market does nothing to improve the efficiency of the industry.  Most fruit and vegetable markets in Europe have been moved to outside of cities and this has greatly helped in the distribution of fresh produce.  The horticulture industry must have a huge capacity to contribute to farm incomes, to the balance of payments and to meet the need for good wholesome food.  Unquestionably, the health of the nation would improve and our very high level of heart disease would decline if we increased our consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables.  We have a distinct climatic advantage for growing field vegetables, nursery stock and even protected crops where we can make savings in fuel bills.  The use of natural gas must be <Col N="1728" /> encouraged in our protected crops industry.</P>
    <P>There are a whole range of opportunities in horticulture.  In field vegetables, for instance, we should be producing more onions, winter cauliflower and carrots.  Teagasc have estimated we could save £7 million in vegetable imports.  Brittany, for instance, is a major producer of fresh brassica crops for export.  There is no reason why Ireland could not do the same.  The onion acreage could be expanded by 600 to 700 acres without any great problem.  There are major opportunities to expand apple production provided good storage is available.  Here, again, the producer group idea must be considered.  The farmers of County Wexford have shown they can successfully grow soft fruit and these crops could be expanded into other parts of the country.  The nursery stocks and the mushroom industries can be expanded further but I have already dealt in detail with them.</P>
    <P>The other matter that must be attended to is that of plant health.  We must not sacrifice our excellent plant health status for short-term expediency.  The matter of organic farming has been referred to throughout this debate.  I share the view that there are opportunities there but I would not like it to be believed there are unlimited opportunities, that we can produce immense amounts of organically grown food and that it will find a ready market which will compensate the growers for the increased costs involved.  I would not like it to be perceived that the conventionally produced food from the farmers of this country is anything other than fully wholesome and is right for the European market.  We are very unintensive by Europen standards.  Our food is of the very highest quality and I think it would be very dangerous for us to even begin to think that the food produced conventionally on our farms and our horticultural enterprises is anything but of the highest standard.  I agree in this respect with what Senator Upton had to say, even if his Munster jersey was a red one and not the same colour as mine.</P>
    <P>The opportunities are there.  I hope the <Col N="1729" /> new board, through its educational and promotional activities and through the collection of accurate market intelligence information &mdash; and that is a very important aspect &mdash; can help us to exploit these opportunities to the full.  I have been going to horticultural conferences for the past 20 years and I am hearing the same things today that I heard 20 years ago in relation to the need to increase efficiency of production, to increase marketing.  We are saying exactly the same things we were saying when Senator Hussey was an active member of the Government and that is not so long ago.  The board will not solve all the problems of the industry but with the energy and right direction it can do a lot to rectify some of the past ills. I wish the Minister well in his endeavour.</P>

      <P>May I respond to this Bill as the housewife all are attempting to woo today in an effort to promote the sale of glossy fruit under the Bord Glas Bill.  One sentence took me back to my childhood.  We all learned at school that we are a country enjoying advantages of climate, labour resources and high plant health status.  I have been learning that and teaching that for quite a long time.  I wonder has any analysis been done in preparation for this Bill in relation to why the small farmer, medium farmer and large farmer throughout the country has not got orchards?  I am from Tipperary and I remember when I was growing up that every farmer had an orchard but that whole traditional lifestyle seems to have gone.  Farmers also had gardens where they saw fit to tend and produce their own vegetables but that seems to have disappeared within a number of years.  I have yet to see any analysis from the IFA or from the Department of Agriculture and Food as to the reason for the changeover. <Col N="1730" /> I do not think it was the impact of our joining the EC.  Perhaps it was the exports, perhaps it was laziness, I do not know but I would like to know from the Minister of any research that might have been done in that area.</P>
      <P>Overall marketing strategy is something we hear about every day of the week, whether it is associated with Bord Fáilte or Bord Glas but I have yet to go to a conference and see what exactly this marketing strategy is all about.  It is a buzz word; it appears to be discussed and debated but never seems to be something we are good at doing.  I would like to know what &ldquo;new&rdquo; marketing strategy Bord Glas will have in mind when they are trying to get our European counterparts or even ourselves to eat our fruit and vegetables.</P>
      <P>In relation to the composition of the board, I wonder if it is within the remit of the Minister to appoint a Dutch expert as one of the five or ten, whichever category the Dutch expert might settle into, or whether it has to be Irish only.  The Dutch have often said that they could feed their population on our long acre.  I think it would be valuable to have a Dutch expert even if it were only for an interim period.  I suggest that we look towards the Dutch for their expertise and I am sure they would give it to us.  There is a statistic here as regards what we are actually aiming to compete with; it relates to our nursery industry where our imports are £2 million a year.  We just have 1,250 acres and our exports are a mere trickle. If we were to compare with our Dutch counterparts, in a country little more than half our size, with no climatic advantage, they have 1,750 acres of nursery stock and a huge export trade with more than 80 countries and this trade is gowing substantially every year.  There is not doubt that a country that has got to that stage of development should certainly be considered, in regard to the composition of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education was mentioned in the debate.  The best gardens throughout the rural parts of Ireland during my childhood were the gardens of the techncial schools where students learned to work <Col N="1731" /> the soil with their hands.  I do not think it is sufficient to have specialists just at the third level.  It is very important to get our young people to understand the soil. I would expect the Minister to think in terms of a module second level education, not just in technical schools or vocational schools as they are know now but in community, comprehensive and particularly voluntary secondary schools. I teach in one of those schools and one particularly interesting module is in the alternative leaving certificate where students have food technology as a module on their course.  I have never tasted better vegetables and fruit than those produced by those students.  That school is in the inner city and it has only a small patch of ground.  They have their mushrooms in tunnels they have their vegetables, even exotic vegetables.  The students were probably never in a country garden in their lives.  I think we get carried away with work at third level education. I remember thinning turnips when I was a child and doing a lot of work in the garden.  I did not consider it an onerous task, but all of that is gone.</P>
    <P>We shall concentrate on work on the soil, as the Dutch do.  I would like the second level area to be looked at in this context.  The students I teach have carried out many surveys on social and environmental studies and they show that the lowest intake in their diet is fruit. They were not aware of it, which was the extraordinary thing.  How do you get students to eat fruit?  They do not see an apple as Eve did; they do not regard it as an attractive fruit.  I would like to push for a way of getting youngsters to eat fruit and vegetables.  They are certainly not going to eat it in the boring way it was presented in the past.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara are worn out trying to encourage us to eat fish, with little or no positive result.  The Minister would probably have the statistics there to tell me whether we have improved on our fish intake in our diet.  We probably have, but not to the extent that we, an island, should have improved.</P>

      <P>Not the students I have.  I am afraid it has not yet come to Limerick, but maybe the Clare students are fed on a diet of fish.  It is difficult to get young people to eat fruit and vegetables. They are the parents of tomorrow and the junk food they eat is far more expensive than fruit.</P>
      <P>Another point I wanted to mention was that of value added.  Our vegetables sent abroad, seeing that we are the furthest from continental Europe, probably will have to have perservatives and additives. I do not know; I am raising that question. Have we the technology to ensure that we can export them out without any deterioration en route?  If it is the case that there is deterioration we must look at how we use our vegetables in our own island.  I ask the Minister to look at value added.  Poultry or pork are being exported as prepared meats, with the benefit of food technology and we should give consideration to the inclusion of vegetables in this context.  People want alternative farming and vegetable production has enormous potential in this regard.</P>

      <P>I will be guided by the Chair in this matter.  I welcome the Bill, as indeed many people in Ireland will welcome a new initiative in this very important industry.  The more one studies the question of agricultural development <Col N="1733" /> and the potential for the industry the more one realises the complications.</P>
      <P>Ireland is in a very fortunate position at the moment in so far as we have the Presidency of the EC Council.  That means our Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, is in a very good position to help this country.  We are fortunate to have also Deputy Kirk who has done trojan work to highlight the importance of the industry.  Deputy Walsh has also strongly identified himself as a person with tremendous ability and with dedication to further the lot of those who are committed to agriculture.  For that reason I welcome to the House Deputy Seamus Kirk, Deputy Joe Walsh and the Minister from the west of Ireland, Deputy Daly.  All are young, energetic, able Ministers who have a commitment to further the development of agriculture.  I would like also to welcome Mr. John Bourke and the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. O'Donnell from Donegal, if I may be allowed to give him a special welcome. With his background it is obvious we are on the right track.  I have no doubt he has the determination and the ability to make a major contribution to the success of this industry.</P>
      <P>On at least two or three occasions in his speech the Minister said he will be flexible.  That is important.  I have taken special note of the Minister's readiness to listen and to understand that people's concerns are important; he is prepared to listen and to respond and that is the proper approach.  I compliment the Minister and his Department and those that are involved in the setting up of An Bord Glas.  After I have made this initial response in welcoming the Bill, I will bow to the advice of the Leader of the House.</P>

It was unanimously decided that two resolutions would be passed and those resolutions now have been incorporated into the text of this motion, namely, the rescision of <Col N="1735" /> the ESB deadline to close the station and cease taking coal from 31 March; and, secondly, implementation of the workers' proposals for the future development.</P>
    <P>I would have expected this would be a non-contentious motion and that it would be passed without any problem and I am extremely disappointed to see the text of an amendment that has been proposed by the Leader of the House which to my mind subverts the entire intention of the motion.  The section of the motion is dealing with the rescission of the ESB decision not to take coal from 31 March, which is only two months away, would not permit any task force to operate effectively to provide any alternative set of proposals for the area.  I am extremely disappointed with that amendment and certainly I will be opposing it as strongly as I can.</P>
    <P>The effect of the ESB decision will be to devastate the six parishes of Ballinaglera, Drumkerrin, Drumshanbo, Kilronan, northern Ardcarne and my own home parish of Geevagh, which are located in the four counties of Leitrim, Roscommon, Cavan and Sligo.  The last substantial coal mining industry in Ireland will come to an end.  A sum of £2.5 million will be lost by that isolated rural economy and community; hundreds of people will be out of work and thousands of men, women and children will be detrimentally affected in the adjoining areas.  Schools will close, villages will become deserted, the small holdings in the area will be sold and will be bought out, the mountain ranges and the valleys of Arigna and Slieve na Iarann will be forested, families will emigrate, the social welfare burden will be imposed on the State and the traditional way of life will be gone forever.</P>
    <P>According to the workers' calculations, this destruction is being caused to save the ESB one-tenth of a penny per unit of electricity generated in the country.  Indeed, listending to an ESB spokesman at the meeting in Drumshambo on 28 January the book-keeping argument of strict financial profit and loss he referred to sounded pathetic, and <Col N="1736" /> indeed tragic in the circumstances. Unless the decision is rescinded, the date of 31 March will sound the death-knell for the Arigna community and its environs.  I want to record as strongly and as fervently as I can here in the House tonight that the sudden announcement by the ESB without consultation with the workers is grossly irresponsible.  I further assert that the Taoiseach's statement, after the announcement to the effect that the closure was entirely a matter for the ESB, is outrageous and a grave dereliction of governmental duty.</P>
    <P>Let us be under no misapprehension that it is the Government and the Department of Energy who determine overall energy policy for the nation, having considered social, economic, technological and competition factors.  The ESB cannot close down the power station at Arigna without the express permission of the Government of the day.  That is where the buck stops.  The Fianna Fáil-PD Coalition must be forced out from behind the coat-tails of the ESB and must be forced to raise their collective hand and say, &ldquo;Yes, we are responsible for the closure of the power station and we are responsible for the consequent effects on the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Briefly, Sir, I would like to outline the background to the present situation.  This is an area where a tremendous amount of mining has taken place over the centuries. As far back as the 15th Century the iron mines were worked in Slieve an Iarann.  Indeed, at its height in the 17th century 3,000 men were working there. It is an interesting and indeed an ironic fact at the present time that in 1790, exactly 200 years ago, Wolfe Tone, leader of the United Irishmen, castigated the British Government for their failure to develop the coal and iron mines in the area.  Since the mid-19th century, the Arigna Mining Company having been established, coal has been mined successfully. In the Emergency years of 1939 to 1945, 350,000 tonnes of coal were produced annually.  The Arigna mines played a crucial, though unsung, role in the national economy at the critical time.</P>
    <P>The railways, the sugar company and <Col N="1737" /> the ESB itself relied very heavily on supplies to keep it going during the war years.  However, after the war there was a slump in demand and the Government at that stage decided to intervene to protect the jobs of the workers.  It was then a feasibility study was undertaken and this study showed it was technically possible to produce electricity with a coalbased generating station.  It was not then considered that the project would ever be financially viable, and we must remember that.  Indeed, at times it did produce a small profit, but it was constructed for social rather than economic reasons. That was the reason the Government decided to initiate the project.  The power station was commissioned in 1958 with a 15 megawatt capacity and Leyden's Arigna Collieries were contracted to supply 35,000 tonnes of coal annually and the smaller collieries in the area, Flynn, Lehany and Wynne's, were given a yearly supply quota of 12,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The Arigna power station is a very small part of the entire ESB network of power stations.  In 1988 it generated 64.5 million units of electricity out of a national total of 12,563 million units, so about 0.5 per cent of the nation's total is generated in Arigna.  According to the excellent position paper of the miners and the ESB employees, the power station since its foundation has performed at a very high proficiency level within plant parameters.  To quote from the position paper:</P>
    <P>In the past year it was the fifth most efficient power station in the ESB network. To put this in context, Moneypoint was well below it in the efficiency table, being only in eighth place.  The power station in Arigna has over the past 30 years produced electricity in a very technically efficient manner.  Last year it was as efficient as in any previous year and the locally produced coal is as good as the very best as far as the Arigna Power Station is concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1979 it was decided to build a second and larger station in Arigna to use the lower grade coal which was termed crow coal and which was abundant in the area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1738" /> This station would be three times the size, with 45 megawatt capacity.  The construction was delayed until the February 1982 election, when the present Taoiseach announced, in a letter that got wide publicity in the Sligo-Leitrim electoral area, that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power they would immediately commence work on the construction of a crow coal generating station.  This famous &ldquo;crow coal election&rdquo;, as it is known in the area, is still spoken of with reverence in the Arigna area, much like the other holy cow and that equally imfamous scheme, the draining of the River Shannon. However, neither promise, as we all know, has been kept.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the ESB went on to propose to close down the power station entirely, claiming it was inefficient and that there were inadequate supplies of coal.  The then Minister for Energy, Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Dick Spring, and the Coalition Government of the day rejected the proposal and confirmed that the station would remain in operation as long as there was coal of sufficient quality to burn in it and no major mechanical breakdown occurred in the station.  It is worth noting today that the final decision was made then by the Minister for Energy and by the Government of the day, not by the ESB.</P>
    <P>That was the position until 29 October 1989, when the ESB announced their intention to close down the station in two and a half years and because they had a reserve of coal stockpiled they would cease taking all supplies of coal from 31 March 1990.  This effectively means the loss of the miners' jobs from 31 March and of the ESB jobs after that.  That is the crux of the situation.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that the ESB decision was wrong.  As I said earlier, it was irresponsible in the circumstances and it should be rescinded, and rescinded immediately.  The miners' proposals should be explored with a view to implementation.  I quote as an example the recent development in the Nixdorf multinational company in Bray, where an original initial decision was rescinded after intervention by the IDA and the <Col N="1739" /> trade union movement.  That multinational company decided not to take the early decision for closure it had originally proposed but to allow the plant to remain open to explore alternative uses for the plant and to review the situation on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>If a multinational company with no great responsibility to the nation can take such a stance, surely a semi-State body that was founded to exploit and develop the nation's natural resources can do likewise? Why can it not rescind its decision, which is due to take place and the axe to fall within two months, and wait and allow the proposals that have been made to be explored and implemented.</P>
    <P>What are these proposals?  I would like to deal with them in the context of some of the matters that have been raised by the Minister for Energy in the Dáil on 12 December, when this issue was raised, and also the objections of the ESB.</P>
    <P>The first issue is the quality and quantity of coal.  The Minister in his speech on that occasion said that the reserves of usable semi-bituminous coal in the area were estimated by the Geological Survey of Ireland as approximately 100,000 tonnes.  If that is the case why not continue mining that coal, which would keep the power station open for another two years at least and provide breathing space for everyone?  I would like to ask the Minister further: did the survey that was conducted cover the smaller colleries of Flynn, Lehany and Wynne's?  I understand that both companies are anxious to continue to supply coal to the power station.  Can they not be given contracts for a certain annual supply, as Leyden's contract is at present?  I understand there are ten acres of coal in Spinecop mountain in the area which is suitable for open casting and that there are reserves of coal in Greene's mines which have not been touched at all.  There is a great degree of confusion about the actual quantity and quality of reserves of coal.  If the Minister is unable to make a definitive statement today, then a comprehensive, independent study of the reserves should be commissioned immediately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> Secondly, I want to refer to the crow coal issue and the possibility of a station in the area.  Everybody is agreed, without exception, that there are considerable deposits of crow coal in the area.  This is the low grade coal which has a high ash content, though nobody is able to say precisely what is the content of ash and the level of combustibility.  We know that the power station, using such coal, was considered a feasible option ten years ago.  We know that crow coal has little acid and is environmentally friendly.  We know that Moneypoint, which relies entirely on imported bituminous coal from the United States, now requires the installation of a scrubber at a cost between £400 million and £500 million to remove the acid that is caused by the burning of that coal.  In the context of exploitation of natural resources and the need for a native supply of energy, in view of environmental concerns and modern technology, it is essential that the option of a crow coal electricity generation station be re-examined in this area.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I want to look briefly at the question of the cost &mdash; another area the Minister referred to and to which the ESB give so much attention and base so much of their reason for the closure.  The Minister compared the cost of producing a unit of electricity at 7.62p in Arigna with the cost in Moneypoint of 1.37p. This difference, of course, is due to the cheap coal coming from the United States at present.  That could change with currency exchanges, interest rates, the international market, any emergency that could occur.  We know that the ESB's plans are to increase their generating capacity, their dependence on imported fuel from 58 per cent in 1988 to 68 per cent in 1992.  That is not a coincidence in the context of Arigna being threatened with closure.</P>
    <P>In relation to the actual cost of 7.62p, if we look at our bill from the ESB in 1989 we will see that the cost to the consumer was 7.14p per unit generated. There is a very small difference between the actual cost of production in Arigna and the cost to the consumer.  It is less than half a penny on each unit produced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1741" /> If the ESB are determined to make a profit from all their power stations, why not look at ways at cost-saving at the Arigna power station and mines rather than closing down the entire operation?</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of the age of the station.  The Minister referred to the station as perhaps being too old.  It was six years over the specified period of 25 years.  I would like to refer the Minister to an article in the present issue of the internal magazine of the ESB where there is a reassessment of the situation. They state it is not very clear what the intended design life of these units was but values of 25 years, which is the one in Arigna, that is 100,000 hours, have been quoted.  These values are now seen to have been conservative and a more realistic internationally accepted value of 200,000 equivalent hours, or 50 years, is now used to signal the need for significant attention for such units.  In fact, in the internal magazine of the ESB there is the statement that these stations are not by any means out of date.</P>
    <P>Then, the article considers it in the context of the need by the ESB for future unit need.  For example, in their own report in 1988 the ESB talk about the increased capacity being required as 2.7 per cent.  That was in 1988.  In this internal document of 1989 we see that it is a surprising 4.7 per cent, so there has been a very considerable increase.  There will be a need for refurbished stations or new stations long before the end of the decade.  We must take that into consideration as a major factor before we talk about the closure of the Arigna power station.</P>
    <P>The last point I would like to make is the question of the orderly winding-down of the station to which the Minister referred.  I am glad he did say that in his statement: he said that he would like to see an orderly winding-down.  There is no way we can have an orderly winding-down of the station in Arigna if no coal is going to be taken from the mines after 31 March.  That is obvious for anybody to see.  The only way there can be an orderly winding-down is first to rescind <Col N="1742" /> the decision and then allow for an examination of proposals that have been made &mdash; and there is a whole set of proposals in section 8 of the position paper that I do not have time to go into at present &mdash; by the miners, the workers, the representatives of the miners and the representatives of the ESB employees.  These would enable the station to remain open, alternative sources of employment could be examined, the reserves of coal could be examined, the future of the station could be explored and a task force could be established &mdash; indeed, the amendment refers to the establishment of a task force. What is the use of having a task force established unless there is time for the task force to explore the possibilities? That is a critical point.</P>
    <P>That is why it is essential that the motion I propose here be passed as it stands and that the amendment be rejected.  These proposals are reasonable proposals and they would ultimately save a community from devastation.  The decision for the future of that community rests in the hands of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello has indicated he will give two minutes of his time but he has exceeded his time.  The Chair will grant some latitude to Senator Jackman but would appreciate if she would make her contribution as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, Sir.  I will take just one minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate my support for the Labour Party motion and to reject the amendment. I would make one statistical point. If we are talking about savings for the ESB of £3 million, that is a very small amount of money.  Going on simple arithmetic, if we were to look for IDA job creation for 250 people multiplied by what is generally accepted as £30,000 per job, that makes a bill, to my mind, of £75 million.  I cannot see how the DART and CIE have been subsidised over the years at a great cost to the taxpayer in areas where there is alternative employment <Col N="1743" /> and here we talk about the Arigna coalmine which the ESB have acknowledged is an area where there is a social and developmental dimension to its operation.</P>
    <P>The social conditions have not changed.  What we are looking at now is mass emigration from that spot despite all efforts by us to try to improve the economic situation.  I would just ask two questions: has EC aid been sought for mining communities and has high technology which is in use on the west coast of the United States been investigated relating to the use of methane gas for use in cars which could be used, I believe, in relation to coal deposits in that area. Every option has to be exhausted before we start looking for alternative jobs at a cost of £75 million versus £3 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion.  We have to bear in mind that we are talking of the 200 people employed in the mines being turfed out of their jobs by the end of March of this year and we are talking about 50 people employed in the station &mdash; a total of 250 people who will be out of jobs two years down the road.  If we consider the effects of this in relation to service jobs which are needed to sustain people who are in manufacturing industry and so on, we are talking of total unemployment of the order of 500 to 1,000 people in this area arising from the decision to close down the mines and the power station.  That is by any standards a major industry in a deprived area.</P>
      <P>If you want an index of the significance of the industry in the area you have only to realise that 66 per cent of the parents of the school children in the area are employed either in the mines or in the power station.  It is the central source of employment in that whole area.  We are talking about that reality in the context of the broader social realities of County Leitrim and the adjoining area.  It is a small county.  It has a small population of 20,000 people.  There is high unemployment in the area; something like 28 per cent of the people are dependent on social welfare.  It is an ageing population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> There are very limited natural resources in that whole area of north Roscommon, south Leitrim and south Sligo.  If this closure goes ahead a whole community and a whole way of life will be devastated. There is no prospect at all of employment in the near future in this area.</P>
    <P>There is talk about task forces and so on.  The simple reality is that task forces will not deliver the types of jobs needed. They are to a large extent talking shops. They are in many ways simply gimmicks and they are not going to solve the problem. The reality facing the people in this area is the dole and the emigrant's plane, presumably flying out from Knock.  That is what is facing something between 250 to 500 people.</P>
    <P>If we look at the significance of that and put it in context, 250 or 500 people losing their jobs in that area in County Leitrim is the equivalent of the order of about 50,000 people being unemployed in the city of Dublin, if you scale it up on a per head of population basis.  It is an enormous factor in relation to the whole fabric of that society.  We hear frequently that rural areas in Ireland are a source of wonderful valuable culture.  These people in this area are the source of that culture. They are source of that tradition.  They are in many ways part of what we are. They are the type of people about whom the lads, when they go to the hospitality tents on rugby international days, or whatever their equivalent is in Croke Park on All-Ireland Final day, like to talk about.  They talk about them with great fluency after they have had the benefits of a few glasses of whiskey, or whatever type of elixir is given out in these places. But these people, that culture they put so much value on, are now about to be hit by criteria which are derived from the Dow Jones index, the Nikei index and the others spoken about on the radio each morning.  That is the simple reality.  The preservation of these jobs relates to values.  It relates to what values people put on the culture and on the tradition in that part of south Leitrim and north Roscommon.  Those values are losing out to the new order, and that new order is what is coming in to us from cultures that <Col N="1745" /> in many respects some of us find very repulsive.</P>
    <P>The other disappointing part of the closure is that in many ways it is not necessary.  As Senator Costello has said, the station is the fifth most efficient power station that the ESB operate.  There are adequate supplies of coal in the area.  The quality of the coal is apparently adequate, as the Barnett report states quite clearly. The plant is effectively paid for now. Senator Costello has said it can have a life expectancy of the order of another 25 or 30 years.  I understand there are no major maintenance problems envisaged in the foreseeable future for that plant. The closure is also taking place in the expectation that in the 1990s the ESB will need considerably more power than their present output.</P>
    <P>The station was built for social reasons. That is a very important consideration and is something which the ESB now, very politely, want to walk away from. They want to turn their back on that central reality.  The station was built there to hold together a social fabric in a very deprived and under-privileged part of the country.  It now seems the Government and the ESB are turning their backs and walking away from these people.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the motion which the Labour Party put down can do very little, if anything at all, to reassure the people in the area around Arigna.</P>
    <P>The motion notes firm undertakings, with a two year time lag.  In reality what we are noting is the fact that 250 people will be put on to the dole queue and the entire fabric of the community will be put in jeopardy because of that decision.  That is what should be noted instead of talking in terms of initiatives and so on.  That is simply jargon and it means nothing. When boiled down, it does not amount to anything concrete by way of commitment to preserve those jobs.  It is worth noting, as Senator Costello mentioned, that when the Leader of the Labour Party was Minister for Energy, he took that social decision and made the social commitment to hold together the <Col N="1746" /> community and those jobs in that part of County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>The other appalling prospect which faces many of the workforce is that a large number of them are now approximately 40 years of age.  That means most of them have a large number of dependants; they are too young to retire and, at the same time, they are too old to get new employment.  It appears the Government are now acting in co-ordination with the ESB to allow people, ultimately, to be exported so that we might import coal, all in the name of efficiency.</P>
    <P>I ask Senators, in the interests of maintaining the culture and fabric of society in that part of County Leitrim, to support our motion this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the situation in Leitrim because the terrain and difficulties in County Leitrim are not much different from those pertaining in Donegal.  I hope the Cathaoirleach will allow me sufficient time to give my reasons and background as to why I believe it is necessary to move an amendment to the motion.</P>
      <P>Nobody wants to be involved in misleading the people in Leitrim.  I believe it is the Government's intention and the Minister's intention not to be part of any kite-flying operation and not to lead people of Leitrim to the point that hopes are raised that cannot be fulfilled.  It is not unusual for a source of material to reach a stage where it is no longer viable. We have all seen on television the closure of pits in England and all the hassle that goes with it.  It is a sad day for all of us to be closely associated with such development in part of our own country. The Government must recognise there is no point in giving the impression that by supporting it they will retain an industry that has partly exhausted its resources. For that reason I formally move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after Seanad Éireann and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;notes the initiative of the Government in facilitating the establishment of a locally based working <Col N="1747" /> group whose immediate and urgent task is to seek worthwhile job opportunities in the Arigna area to cater for job losses which arise directly from the viable coal seams in the area running out; that the Seanad also notes the firm undertaking by the ESB to maintain generating operations at the Arigna Station until the existing stockpile of coal is fully used over the next two years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Members of this House, members of Leitrim County Council and people in the west may say that is a negative attitude.  I believe it is a positive, realistic and an honest attitude.  Those who are expressing the hope that the Government have an alternative approach are expressing the hope and aspirations all of us would dearly love to be associated with, but which, unfortunately are not attainable.</P>
    <P>In County Donegal the turf burning station in Gweedore had to be closed down to my bitter disappointment but the reality had to be faced up to.  I believe that is what is being done here.  It gives me no great pleasure to propose an amendment to the motion but I believe it would be dishonest to support the motion.  That is not levying criticism on the proposers of the motion and those supporting it.  I believe the ESB would dearly love to continue there.  However, the Government have been informed by one of the suppliers in the area that the stockpiles are exhausted and that if the ESB did not take the action which they propose to take their main supplier would be forced to cease delivering coal to the Arigna power station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it very clear that I am very concerned at the decision of the ESB to cease taking supplies of Arigna coal for the power station after 31 March 1990.  I cannot see how this decision can be reconciled with the following statement from a section of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Joint Programme for Government which deals with energy which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> Particular priority will be given to the maximum development of indigenous energy resources.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about an indigenous resource which is being used to generate electricity.</P>
    <P>The Arigna power station was commissioned in 1958 and since then it has performed at a very high efficiency level. Last year, as other speakers have said, it was the fifth most efficient power station in the ESB network.  The power station has, over the past 30 years, produced electricity in a technically efficient manner.  Last year it was as efficient as it was in any previous year.  The locally produced coal is as good as the very best coal.  The difference between cost per unit of electricity produced in Arigna and cost per unit of electricity produced in other stations, is only a fraction of a penny.</P>
    <P>The closure of the power station will have no impact whatever on electricity prices nor will it have any impact of any significance on the efficiency of the overall ESB operation.  I do not believe there is any need at the moment to implement this decision.  I believe the decision should be rescinded.  The date of 31 March should be deferred because if implemented and if the ESB cease taking coal from the mine in Arigna it will be a disaster for the area, the jobs of the 200 workers in the mine will be affected immediately and when the power station closes a further 50 jobs will be affected.</P>
    <P>We are talking about one of our most deprived regions.  We are talking about six parishes which are totally dependent on the mine and on the power station. The closure of the mine will devastate those six parishes and many small towns, such as Keadue and Ballyfarnan and indeed Drumshanbo.  There are no alternative jobs in the area.  It is an area of small farms and of very poor land.</P>
    <P>Emigration or social welfare will be the only option for the workforce if this decision is proceeded with.  Already 28 per cent of the population of the region are in receipt of some form of social welfare.  We are talking about people in <Col N="1749" /> an age group of between 25 and 40.  These are married people, people with families, people with mortgages.  An indication of the situation is the fact that the parents of 66 per cent of the children attending national schools in the region are directly employed in the mine or in the power station.</P>
    <P>At present we depend on imported fuels for energy supplies.  I cannot understand why the ESB want us to become more dependent, why they want to reduce the use of indigenous native fuel. We are 58 per cent dependent on imported fuels at the moment and this is projected to increase to 68 per cent in 1992.  A heading in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Thursday last, 1 February stated: &ldquo;Oil prices to soar in the 1990s&rdquo;.  The report under that heading was of an address given by the Chairman of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Kennedy, to the United States Chamber of Commerce.  Mr. Kennedy made the point that massive production shortfalls in the United States, in Russia and in the North Sea, together with an increasing dependence on the Middle East, would bring about a decade of increasing oil prices.  If oil prices increase during the decade ahead, then the price of imported coal is also bound to increase.  This could very well lead to a situation where there would be no difference in the unit cost of electricity produced in Arigna and the cost of electricity produced in Moneypoint.  Apart from that the total cost of fuel used by the ESB in 1988 was £225 million.  The total cost of the fuel used in the Arigna power station was £3.8 million.  Therefore, we are talking about 2 per cent of the total amount of fuel used by the ESB.  It is so small it is of no consequence in the context of the overall fuel bill of the ESB.</P>
    <P>The ESB want to close this power station and they see an opportunity now to do so.  Their PR people are trying to put the best face possible on the case they are making for the closure.  Certain points are being put forward which I am satisfied are not totally in accordance with fact.  In fact, only half the truth is being told.  We are told that suitable coal reserves in the <Col N="1750" /> area are running out and that is true up to a point.  We all know that the coal reserves in the area are not infinite and that at some stage they will run out.  I am satisfied on the evidence available to me firstly, from the people in the area, secondly, from a mining survey that was carried out in the area by mining surveyor, John Barnett, and, thirdly, from an independent study carried out last spring for Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo county development teams by a Canadian mining consultant, Dr. Charles Newmarch, that there are adequate supplies of coal in the area suitable for the power station which will last for quite a number of years, possibly as long as ten years.</P>
    <P>It is also stated that the design life of the Arigna power station was 30 years, but as a previous speaker pointed out, there is no reason the power station cannot continue in operation for quite a number of years.  I understand it is operating satisfactorily at the moment.  I also understand it is not unusual for a generating station's design life to be doubled in practice.  There is no reason the power station cannot continue to operate satisfactorily for quite a number of years.</P>
    <P>We all realise that one day the suitable coal supplies will be exhausted and the power station will cease operating.  Steps have already been taken to deal with the situation which will then arise.  Why do the ESB want to pull the plug now before any measures have been put in place to deal with the situation that will be created by the loss of the 250 jobs in question?</P>
    <P>I am Chairman of Roscommon County Council.  I was a member of the advisory group involved in the preparation of the sub-regional plan for Region 5, the Galway-Mayo-Roscommon region.  The Roscommon County Manager was a member of the working group.  We ensured that the position regarding Arigna was written into the sections of the programme dealing with energy, mining and minerals.  The following very important sentence from the sub-national programme is included in the Government's national plan at page 112:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> Special measures will be required to protect employment in the Arigna area where coal mining has been the principal economic activity for over 100 years and is due to cease in the near future.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that Roscommon county development team, of which I am also a member, have been very concerned about the inevitability of a downturn in coal mining in Arigna and the implications this will have for employment in the area.  This was why in January last year, in assocition with Sligo and Leitrim county development teams, we arranged to have a study of the area carried out by the gentleman to whom I referred to earlier, Dr. Charles Newmarch, a Canadian mining consultant.</P>
    <P>We had a special meeting of Roscommon and Leitrim County Councils and at that meeting there was a long and detailed discussion when a number of points were agreed.  The first point was that the power station should continue in operation for quite some years down the road, that it should also take coal supplies from the mine and also that a task force should be set up.  Of course, I welcome the establishment of this task force but I am asking that the power station and the mine be allowed to continue in operation until that task force has had a chance to bring forward a report and until that report can be implemented.  The people of Arigna have a very succinct way of putting what they want.  They say they are looking for a hand up rather than a hand-out.  I am asking the Minister here this evening to give them that hand up by keeping Arigna open.</P>

      <P>Before the next speaker gets in I would like to bring to the attention of the House that it was intended that the Minister would come in at 7.30 p.m.  That was before we started a bit late and the extreme tolerance of your predecessor with time has meant that we are running out of time.  It was agreed that each group would have a speaker. Could I ask for tolerance so that each <Col N="1752" /> group would at least have an input to make, even a restricted input.</P>

      <P>It was agreed we would have ten minutes and I would like to share portion of my time with my colleague, Senator Naughten.</P>
      <P>I want to say very emphatically and categorically that Fine Gael totally support the motion put forward by the Labour Party this evening with regard to Arigna, the power station and the coal mine.  Apart altogether from hard economic facts we have to view this matter in this area on a socio-economic basis.  As has been repeatedly said here this evening, we are talking about the jobs of 250 people.  We are talking about the jobs of 57 persons in the generating station and 200 jobs in the mining area.  Therefore, a total of 250 to 260 jobs are in question.  There will also be 250 indirect jobs in question in so far as shopkeepers, professional people and other persons who will be affected.  Coupled with the fact that each worker would represent three or four people between their wives and their children we could be talking of up to 2,000 people.  That is the enormity of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respectfully say to the Minister that an independent investigation should be carried out before anything further is done on this.  Various studies have been made by the ESB and by other bodies but to my knowledge there has not been a totally independent investigation by an authority without a vested interest of any sort.  The Government have the responsibility for the State, not the ESB.  This is perhaps the keynote to the whole thing. The ESB in my view had no right to decide on 29 October last to cease operation in Arigna on 31 March.  The Government must intervene, as the responsible agency looking after the affairs of the State, and stop that action taking place.  I would like to say to the Minister that under no circumstances should the ESB be allowed proceed with the date of 31 March as the date of closure of the power station.  I appeal to the Minister and his other colleagues in <Col N="1753" /> Government to make certain that that date is deferred.</P>
    <P>These matters are so intertwined that it is not necessary to go through them &mdash; if we do not have a power generating station in Arigna we do not have a coal-producing operation either because 95 per cent of the coal produced in Arigna is used by the power station.  I would not be over-concerned about the efficiency of this station because if we were to carry that argument to its logical conclusion we would import butter, dairy products, beef and other commodities from other countries.  We must take into account the socio-economic factor that exists here and this is a very point that must sway the Government in their decision in this whole area.</P>
    <P>It has been said before and I think it is worth repeating that in 1985 the then Minister for Energy, Deputy Spring, made a very firm commitment that there would not be a closure as long as a certain supply for the five tonnes of coal was available and that there was no major breakdown.  To my knowledge that situation has not occurred and is not imminent. I say quite earnestly to the Minister that the chaos that would arise from the closure of these operations in Arigna would be catastrophic in the extreme. The whole area would be denuded of its people.  Most of the workers in the power station are small farmers and the surrounding countryside would be adversely affected by closure of the power station. Much of the land would be bought up by multinationals for forestry development and so on.  The Minister and his colleagues in Government have the responsibility to maintain this operation, and even if hard economic facts do not stand up there is a social aspect that must be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion put forward by the Labour Party to defer the closure of the ESB power station in Arigna.  As has been pointed out, the suggested closure of the ESB power station in Arigna would have a devastating effect on all of the north Roscommon, south Leitrim and south Sligo area.  As has been mentioned on many occasions up to 300 workers would lose their jobs. When you talk about closing the power station, you are also talking about closing a mining industry in that area which was the only source of income for the families who live there.  As has been pointed out, 66 per cent of the children attending schools in that area are children of parents who work in the ESB or in the mine and allowing the ESB to close Arigna power station would have a devastating effect in that area.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Government take immediate steps to ensure that the proposal to close the power station is withdrawn immediately and that every effort is made to continue producing electricity in Arigna until such time as the coal reserves that are clearly established as being available at the Flynn, Lehany and Wynne mines and another coalfield owned by Greens have been fully utilised. It is absolutely crazy importing coal halfway around the world and at the same time not utilising the natural resource in the Arigna area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A task force has been set up I would like to ask the Minister what aid will the ESB give to the establishment of industry there?  What aid will the Government give to establish alternative industry? Has EC aid has been sought for the Arigna area?  These are three very important questions.  While it is very fine setting up a task force to create alternative industry, we all know what happened in Tuam. On the closure of the sugar factory in Tuam, alternative industry was supposed to be put in there but two years later there is still no alternative industry.  I <Col N="1755" /> appeal to the Minister and to the Government to use their good offices to ensure that coal mining and the generation of electricity continue in the Arigna area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague Senator Naughten for allowing me a brief few moments to put on the record of the House my support for the aspirations and the wishes of the people of the area that I live in and represent.</P>
      <P>At this stage with time being at a premium, unlike the coal reserves in Arigna, the arguments in favour of deferral of the ESB decision have now been exhausted. It is now decision time.  The plea I bring from the people of Drumshanbo, Arigna, Boyle, Ballyfarnan, Keadue and other small communities in Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo is: please do not write us off; do not write us off the economic map; please do not dismiss us as a people not worthy of a generous decision at Government level and please do not condemn our children to the emigrant ship, our businesses to bankruptcy and our population to continuing indignity and unemployment.</P>
      <P>I will make one specific point in relation to the ESB's role in all of this sad and sorry affair.  I single out the ESB, because I know that the Minister is sympathetic to the situation in my part of the country.  He knows it well.  Why should the ESB, as a semi-State body responsible to the Government, be allowed to make an arbitrary decision without consultation on a matter that has such far-reaching effects, the impact of which on a community stretching across three counties, already ravaged by the natural and man-made disasters that have affected us, will be such that it will be so badly decimated that any hope it has of recovering ground will be lost completely by the closure of the power station and the decision to cease purchase of supplies from 31 March?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does have a responsibility in this area.  The ESB have a greater responsibility.  I know the argument could be made that their responsibility is to the wider public and that the station has been <Col N="1756" /> losing money and is not economically viable.  In my discussions in relation to this matter I have never brought up the economic argument, because I accept I could probably be beaten on all fours. The point I have hammered home in the past, and my colleagues have reiterated many times, is that when this power station was originally located on the shores of Lough Allen in 1958 it was done as a social need and a social necessity.  That social necessity is as great, if not greater, 30 years further on.</P>
    <P>My plea started off as a plea to the Minister.  I have tried not to be emotive about this issue, but when I am dealing with the possible death of the area that I love and the area in wich I live I cannot be anything other than emotional.  I lay my case at the feet of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and I support the contributions made by the proposer and seconder.  After that the level of hypocrisy, with the people of Arigna and surrounding areas being pawns in a game, I find impossible to stomach.  The people of Arigna are being misled in this debate here tonight.  The great champions of privatisation are suddenly talking about the ESB providing social welfare.</P>
      <P>What we are seeing here today is the devastation of a local community, an area which I know well and where there are friends of mine working, simply because of the lack of a Government plan.  The people who spoke here tonight would be the first people to demand that semi-State industry be rationalised; that semi-State industry be privatised; that semi-State industry make a profit, and now suddenly that semi-State industry should start supporting local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the people on the Government benches: are you the people who last week in the budget supported a further 10 per cent VAT on electricity?  I can go back to the foundation of the ESB.  At every step and turn it has been made the whipping boy of the State.  The gombeen men opposed its setting up.  In the last three weeks they have been hit three <Col N="1757" /> times.  There was the closing of the fisheries on the Liffey.  They are blamed for the flooding in Cork.  They are hammered with extra VAT in the budget.  It is not the ESB's responsibility to have a proper structure of employment in Arigna and other areas.</P>
    <P>I support the motion because I think the decision to close on 31 March should be rescinded.  It is far too sudden to allow the development of the task force and the implementation of proposals, etc., but I do not support any idea that the ESB are responsible for what is happening up there.  What we see is a lack of any kind of a properly structured plan to develop the rual economy in a rural area which will be devastated when this goes through, as effectively it is.  However, I cannot support the views put forward by people here who are conveniently blaming the ESB for this problem.  It is not the ESB's problem.  The ESB have done a lot for this country in terms of presentation. The quiet infrastructural revolution of rural electricification is the greatest achievement of this State, done despite the most dispersed retail distribution of any commodity we have ever seen.</P>
    <P>I support the motion and I support alternative industry.  I also want to add that in the implementation of this motion tonight it should be done through Government intervention and not be laid at the door of the ESB.  It is misleading to the people of Arigna and surrounding areas to blame the ESB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to ask the Minister who owns the mines.  Did the ESB acquire them or do the private people still own them?  Nobody has been able to give me a satisfactory answer to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB do not own the mines.  I am fully aware of the great tradition of coal mining in the Arigna area.  I know that when it first began in the 1800s it was used for converting iron ore to iron.  Coal mining in Arigna flourished during the era of steam trains and was also used <Col N="1758" /> extensively by the sugar companies as an energy source.  It probably hit its peak during the war years when it was widely utilised for both domestic and industrial purposes.  Unfortunately, after the Second World War the demand for Arigna coal declined and it was replaced by cheaper imported coal and oil.  To preserve employment locally a Government initiative in the 1950s resulted in the construction of the 15MW power station. From the outset the project was never considered financially viable but it was proceeded with based primarily on social considerations.  It was commissioned in 1958 with a design life of 25 years.  It is now 31 years old, however, and its continued reliability cannot be guaranteed.</P>
      <P>The present price of coal supplied to the Arigna station is approximately £91 per tonne compared to an average price of £32 per tonne for coal delivered to Moneypoint.  However, when adjusted to a comparable calorific value, the price of Arigna coal is approximately £111 per tonne.  The cost of producing a unit of electricity at Arigna is 7.62p compared to 1.37p at Moneypoint, 2.83p at the Tarbert oil station and 4.89p at the Ferbane peat-fired station.  Arigna station is, therefore, five times more expensive than the cheapest ESB station and ESB are actually selling Arigna-sourced electricity at a loss.  ESB operations at Arigna are costing the electricity consumer some £3 million per annum.  In addition, there is a coal stockpile which has grown to over 100,000 tonnes.  This represents a capital investment of £9 million with carrying charges of £1 million per annum.</P>
      <P>In view of the diminishing main seam coal reserves, the high cost of power produced and the fact that this power station is now operating more than six years beyond its expected life span of 25 years, the ESB recently informed me that they will cease to accept supplies of coal in the near future with the consequent complete shutdown of the station in about two years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision by ESB to stop accepting supplies of coal and to close the Arigna <Col N="1759" /> power station is not a recent development. As far back as 1983 when ESB submitted their strategic plan for the period 1983 to 1988 it was recognised that the underlying supply conditions could not support an open-ended commitment to keeping the power station going.  The ESB then proposed the closure of the station.</P>
    <P>Arising out of discussions and representations to the ESB regarding their plans, the ESB presented modified proposals which involved keeping the station open.  These were accepted by the Government in 1984 on the basis that the station would be kept open as long as no major investment was required and suitable local coal was available at an economic price.  This was announced by the then Tánaiste and Minister for Energy in June 1984.</P>
    <P>Since that time, however, the stockpile of almost 100,000 tonnes of coal has built up.  This is equivalent to over two years' supply to the power station.  In addition, the total current reserves of main seam coal in the area is estimated by the Geological Survey of Ireland at less than 100,000 tonnes.  I understand that such reserves of coal are becoming increasingly uneconomic for the mine owners to extract and that the proposition of continued operation of the mines at current coal prices is not an attractive one.</P>
    <P>The Arigna power station employs 53 people and up to 180 are employed in the three companies supplying the station. Arigna Collieries Limited, (Laydens), is the largest of three companies working Connacht coalfields and has a total employment of about 120 people.  The second of the three companies, Flynn and Lehany Limited, employs between 30 and 40 people.  The third colliery is owned by Wynnes and employs about 20 people.</P>
    <P>In response to claims by both the mine workers and some of the owners at a meeting which was held in my own house in Galway sometime ago about the extent of usable coal reserves, I asked the Geological Survey of Ireland to meet the interested parties with a view to forming an opinion as to the possible remaining <Col N="1760" /> reserves.  The views of both the Geological Survey and the ESB on the reserve question have been communicated to me only this week.  There is great uncertainty as to the quality and quantity of possible remaining coal reserves and the Geological Survey have told me that a further six weeks work will be required before they could give a firm assessment of reserves.  I have instructed the Geological Survey to proceed with this work.</P>
    <P>The impact on mineworkers of the proposed closure is such that approximately 130 miners in the 20 to 40 year age bracket will become redundant.  These workers are likely to find it very difficult to obtain alternative emplyment with any of the existing major employers in the area and, therefore, the potential for investment in the Arigna area with a view to attracting new industries needs to be explored urgently.  The ESB have advised me that they have been in contact with local development groups and are actively pursuing ways in which the ESB can assist in the attraction of viable alternative industries to the area.</P>
    <P>They tell me that they are prepared to contribute financially to the establishment of any new viable industry that might be attracted to the area.  They have also been in contact with the IDA and have had discussions with the managers of the three county councils involved about planning future employment in the region.</P>
    <P>Because of my concern to ensure that the State should facilitate replacement industry in so far as it is possible to do so, I entered into discussions with my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce and with the Roscommon County Manager with a view to the establishment of a task force.  This task force has now been established under the Chairmanship of the Roscommon County Manager, Mr. Donal Connolly, the task force also includes the Leitrim County Manager, representatives of Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo county development teams, the IDA, FÁS, Teagasc, the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Tourism and my own <Col N="1761" /> Department, the Chairman of the Central Development Committee of the Department of Finance, Coillte Teoranta and the ESB.</P>
    <P>With a view to ensuring the success of the task force and a speedy report I intend to explore the possibility with both the ESB and the chairman of the task force of having a permanent secretariat assigned to it.  This should enable the task force to report to me within a six month period.</P>
    <P>Because of the crucial local situation as regards employment, I will be discussing with the ESB the possibility of their continuing to accept coal supplies for the local mines for the next six months.  This breathing space will enable the task force to complete its job and will enable me to evaluate the implications of the results produced by the work to be done by the Geological Survey.</P>
    <P>In regard to European Community possibilities of support, there is a recharge programme which is under discussion, aimed at directing assistance to areas that are depressed because of closure of mines.  The Community say there must be at least 1,000 job losses in the mining area to qualify for assistance under that recharge programme as at present proposed.  The Minister for Finance is pressing the Commission to include Arigna.  We made an application for inclusion under that recharge programme quite some time ago.  It has not yet been finalised.  As it stands at the moment we would not qualify.  There is need for major fundamental change in the principal proposals under discussion.</P>
    <P>I have confirmed that the ESB are prepared to make a contribution and recognise their own social obligation in this matter.  I want to state quite clearly that the Government are very concerned at the prospect of such large-scale unemployment in an area such as north Roscommon and County Leitrim where there are so few other job opportunities. In order to give an assurance to people in regard to the work of the task force, I have discussed this matter with the Taoiseach who has expressed a personal commitment, as have the members of the <Col N="1762" /> Government, to give whatever special assistance might be required to attract the kind of industry that is needed to absorb the numbers of men who may become redundant if and when this decision is finally implemented.</P>
    <P>In our discussions we have to accept that there is a certain inevitability about this.  The extension I am offering here tonight is to allow the task force to make their report.  In mentioning the necessity for a permanent secretariat for this task force I indicated a commitment to ensure that no obstacles are put in their way to enable them to come forward with solid recommendations and to make a report within the period of six months.</P>
    <P>In view of the commitment I have given here tonight to ask the ESB to continue to accept coal for a period of six months and in view of the instructions I have given to the Geological Survey Office to undertake an additional survey which will require expenditure of £15,000, and also my commitment to seek a permanent secretariat for the task force to enable them to report within six months, I hope that the Senators proposing the motion would agree to withdraw the motion which, because of its specific wording, I would not be in a position to accept.  I expect they will welcome this move on my part and I trust they will accept my good faith in the matter.  I want to assure the Senators who have spoken and indeed the Members of the other House who have also approached me in this matter that as far as I am concerned, as Minister for Energy, everything possible will be done to try to find a satisfactory solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I think it is accepted by all concerned that there is a certain inevitability about the life of the mines and the life of the power station.  I have travelled the roads of Leitrim and the roads of Roscommon not so long ago and I am very familiar with the area.  I well recognise how important these two industries are in this area.  I want to assure every Member in this House who is interested and concerned about this matter and the work-force and their families, that &mdash; and I have indeed given this commitment <Col N="1763" /> before &mdash; everything possible will be done by me.  The time constraint upon me is such that only this week I had a satisfactory report on the study I asked to be undertaken and now find that it requires we will have to move machinery onto the site to make a more accurate assessment of the extent and the quality of the coal that is there.  That will require another six weeks' work.  I am prepared to seek to move for an extension of six months in this matter to allow all of these important issues to be fully examined and fully considered and to allow the agencies of the State, who have been committed by the Government to give top priority to this area, to carry out their work and to make their recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the debate from all sides of the House. I must say there was a tremendous degree of unanimity in the statements that were made and the sentiments that were expressed in relation to this very serious issue facing the community in the Arigna area.  Likewise, I listened carefully to the statement by the Minister and I have to state I am not satisfied with the commitments the Minister has made.  I would describe them as crumbs.  A six month stay of execution is not nearly enough.  I quoted earlier Nixdorf, the multinational company which had initially made a unilateral decision but rescinded that decision totally and did not put a deadline for the review.  That is the type of commitment we will be seeking from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has presented to us the very interesting information that now, all of a sudden, there is great confusion about the quantity and quality of the reserves in Arigna.  We always knew that and the miners and the ESB workers in the area presented their case in their document. They were seeking a ten-year phasing out of the power station, where the opportunity would be available for the task force to look into the possibility of further job opportunities and more particularly to have an independent examination of the need for the power station and of the <Col N="1764" /> full extent of the reserves of coal there. We have already seen the great increase in the revised ESB figures for requirement and for capacity in the years to come.  There will be need for refurbished stations much sooner than expected hitherto. The whole area of reserves is now undergoing examination.  There is the question that still has to be re-examined of the crow coal power station.  All of these matters have to be fully investigated before a final decision is taken.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is offering us is a carrot &mdash; that we will postpone the final decision for six months.  It is in that context that I am dissatisfied and am unable to accept the amendment proposed by the Fianna Fáil Party.  That amendment takes away the absolutely essential provision in the main motion, which is that the decision be rescinded.  Let us not state a timespan.  Let us say that the decision no longer exists and let us in the meantime carry out, as the Minister has suggested, a full geological survey of the reserves that are there, put into operation the task force that has been established. The danger is that we will be ending up with talk; we may not be ending up with any jobs.</P>
    <P>I would ask at this time that Senator Lanigan and the Fianna Fáil Senators who spoke of the need for rescinding the decision and who welcomed such a proposal that was made in Drumshanbo in your own presence, a Chathaoirligh, on 28 January that they would withdraw the amendment on the grounds that the motion is useless unless we can get rid of that deadline, the chop that falls on the people of Arigna in two months' time, as decided by the ESB, or in six months' time as the Minister is now proposing. That is critical.</P>
    <P>The ESB decision should never have been taken.  It is not the prerogative of the ESB to make a decision in relation to the nation's energy and the strategy in relation to it.  It is a Government decision and it is a decision by the Minister for Energy.  The Government must now state categorically that they have as their concern the preservation of the community there, that they are concerned with the <Col N="1765" /> social consequences of the ESB's decision for the devastation of that community and that they will take on their own shoulders the responsibility for the death of that community.  They cannot and must not do that without having explored to the full the future of the coal mines in Arigna, the future of the power station in Arigna, and the future viability of job opportunities in other areas.  The Government must do so now.</P>
    <P>I have seen a slight change in what the Minister has said from his statement on 12 December.  He has certainly moved forward but unless he moves forward that extra bit, unless he rescinds the decision and leaves it open to the full exploration of all possibilities.  I am afraid the deathknell will still sound for that community and the jobs and the livelihood of the workers will be gone.</P>
    <P>I earnestly ask the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1766" /> Senators, and Senator Lanigan in particular because the amendment is in his name, to withdraw it and leave the original motion stand.  It incorporates the resolutions that were passed at that packed meeting in Drumshanbo, expressing the wishes of the workers of the community in Arigna.

      <P>I welcome the assurances the Minister has given here this evening.  The deferral of the 31 March deadline will give very vital breathing space to everybody involved in this situation. I think implicit in the Minister's statement was an assurance that this matter could be reviewed when further reports are available to the Minister.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Jobstown (Dublin) Community College.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for permitting me to raise this <Col N="1767" /> matter on the Adjournment and I apologise to the Minister for bringing him here in such a busy week.</P>
      <P>It may seem a trivial matter to many Senators and to many people who do not reside in west Tallaght but it is an extremely important matter.  While we have had over the years many difficulties with regard to getting a school, particularly in the fast developing areas of County Dublin, this is the greatest saga there has been.  It is unfortunate because of the area we are dealing with and I will deal briefly with that first.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with an area that was built over the past 12 years by Dublin Corporation to transplant hundreds of families from the centre city and outside the central city area.  The corporation took them out of the environment to which they were accustomed all their lives and put them out in west Tallaght. To them it was quite a journey.  To have to set up a new home in this fast developing area was a major task for many of the families.  The houses were allocated on a points system which meant they had to have at least two, and some of them three and four children.  It is an area where there is a very large child population, probably the highest child population in any part of the country.</P>
      <P>It is a disadvantaged area in many ways.  More than 70 per cent of the heads of households are unemployed.  They are in an environment they are not used to. They happened to move into the area just as the recession came and there was no further development.</P>
      <P>I believe the Department were quite prepared to have the school built there long before this year but when the recession came and there was a slowing down of development in the area I suppose it was natural for them to have another look at the situation.  Because the numbers were not likely to rise as rapidly as was anticipated they cut back on the provision of this school.  It was unfortunate for the few hundred families living in that area that it should have happened just like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to use the term &ldquo;political <Col N="1768" /> football&rdquo; but it would appear to many that the provision of this school on this particular site has been a political football. It was to be provided one year, then it was not being provided, then it was promised by another party or another Government and then the proposal was scrapped again.  On 14 June, 1989 in the run-up to the election, both the Fine Gael Party and the Minister of the day gave an undertaking within a week of each other. Fine Gael were first and then the Minister gave an undertaking that the school would be provided by September of this year.  This was after many public meetings and much lobbying of public representatives by the parents' committee, a body that was extremely active but it was necessary.  The hype at the moment is on the health services but after health, and indeed in many instances before health, education is considered the highest priority with many families who do not have a health problem.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by the Department at one stage that the children of this area could be catered for in three or four other schools in the general Tallaght area.  This is something that should not be allowed to happen in a developing area.  These people should be helped in every way to become a community.  We are dealing with people who did not know the person who is now their next-door neighbour until they arrived in this area a few years ago.  We should be encouraging them to knit into a community but instead of that we were suggesting scattering them to the four winds.  I believe the best way to bring any community closer together is to give them adequate educational facilities because it is through the children that the parents meet.</P>
    <P>Following on the undertaking by the Minister on 14 June 1989, there were statements on 21 August by the Minister, on 24 October, again by the Minister, by the Minister of State, Deputy Harney on 5 January and by Deputy Flood on 16 January, 1990.  The latest statement was given by the Minister to Deputy Alan Dukes only last week where she said that agreement has been reached with the liquidator.  That is known for well over <Col N="1769" /> two years now.  She said agreement has been reached with the liquidator and the legal arrangements for the purchase are currently being processed.  Since then we have been told those documents have been mislaid and there has been some hold up.  Is there a jinx on the provision of a school for these people in such a disadvantaged area?  The Minister went on to say that the ongoing legal processing of these legal documents will not in any way constrain the arrangements for the construction of the new school on the site for which tenders are being sought shortly.  That statement was only made last week.</P>
    <P>In my experience of school building, it is an exceptional builder who will have a school on that site next September.  At the best, work will start in April.  I know how long it takes the Department to advertise for tenders, to receive tenders and then decide on who is the successful tenderer.  The suggestion is coming from some quarter in the Department that there will be a clause in the contract to ensure that the builder continues working through the summer and through the summer holiday period.  That is something new to me but if that can be done I welcome it.  I welcome any measure to provide the school on the site at Jobstown in September next but I do not know what builder is prepared to give such an undertaking.  I hope that will not be a further reason for delaying the provision of the school because we are at crisis point.</P>
    <P>The school at the moment is operating in the Brookfield School, another school providing for children from similar families. In the coming year that school will have 600 pupils.  Jobstown school, the school for which we are seeking the building on the Jobstown site, is operating in the same building with 300 children. If they do not have their school in September they will have almost 400 children, that is 1,000 children in two schools operating under the one roof.  I do not think that can be tolerated by any Government, particularly in an area that is trying to settle into a community as is west Tallaght.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> I would appeal to the Minister of State to move with all speed and perhaps improve on his Minister's reply to Deputy Alan Dukes.  I am fairly used to Civil Service language but the Minister said the ongoing legal processing will not in any way constrain the arrangements for construction.  I do not like the word &ldquo;arrangements&rdquo; because the Minister can come back next June, July of August and say she never said it would be built by September, she only said the legal processing of the purchase of the site would not constrain the arrangements for construction.  That is not what the people of west Tallaght are looking for &mdash; arrangements for construction.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give us in this House an undertaking this evening that that school will be built whether the site has been procured or not.  It is not unusual to move in and to build on a site and sort out the legal documents afterwards. We have done it on the VEC in County Dublin.  I know of one school that was built for many years before the Department were the legal owners of the site.  All the legal documents did not go through until last year, even though the school has been operating for eight or ten years.</P>
    <P>The parents of this area are particularly worried that there is no room here now for any further error, losing of documents or delay.  If a builder refuses to work during the August holiday period, does it mean the school will not be ready for September?  I do not think we can tolerate these two schools operating under the one roof after next September.  Many of the parents are reluctant to enrol their children for September in the Jobstown school because of the uncertainty of the situation.  If there is any error, any delay, a strike, a scarcity of timber or a scarcity of cement what happens?  There are five months for the construction and equipping of that school for the area.  I appeal to the Minister to give this matter immediate attention.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to thank Senator McMahon for his <Col N="1771" /> contribution and to say I do not think he should be so concerned about all the negative possibilities with which he ended his speech.  If the sun does not come up tomorrow we will have no new day but, please God, it will.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Senator at the outset that this school will be ready in September.  As I said in the Dáil last night during an Adjournment debate on this project, the proposed new school at Jobstown was originally planned and was to be located on a site owned by the Gallagher Group which is in liquidation.  The present Minister for Education reactivated this school project when it was found that the original site was no longer desirable as it was considered that the road to it would not be provided by the local authority for some time.  A new site nearer to the present road was selected and its purchase was agreed to by the liquidator.  This change of location necessitated a redefinition of boundaries and a site survey as well as alterations to the planned documentation for the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure Senator McMahon that no unreasonable delay has taken place in regard to this project.  In actual fact, the planning of the project has gone on much faster than planning of similar community school projects throughout the country.  It was as a result of most unusual legal difficulties which were totally outside the control of the Department of Education that the delays he described took place.  However, the <Col N="1772" /> present position is that the boundaries for the new site of the college have been delineated by the liquidator's representatives and the survey of the delineated area has been completed by the design team.  The legal formalities associated with the acquisition of the site are being processed by the Chief State Solicitor who has been specifically notified of the Department's requirements.  The design team are at present revising the tender documentation; indeed some of this tender documentation is now available and it is intended we will proceed with the invitation of tenders shortly.  The significance in terms of the time-scale is that the contract documents will specify that certain classroom accommodation must be available for next September.  A schedule of work is agreed towards this objective and to ensuring that the balance of the facilities will be ready by September 1991.</P>
    <P>At this stage I have every confidence that the classrooms will be provided on time, the school will be ready to open its doors in September and that is largely due to the fact that in the Department of Education we are now achieving great efficiencies, both in terms of time and cost.  I want to assure the House I have no reason to believe we will not meet the targets that we have set ourselves in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 February 1990.</P>
